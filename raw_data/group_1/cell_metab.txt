AB  - Animals require an immediate response to oxygen availability to allow rapid
      shifts between oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. These metabolic shifts are
      highly regulated by the HIF transcription factor. The factor inhibiting HIF (FIH)
      is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that controls HIF transcriptional activity in an
      oxygen-dependent manner. We show here that FIH loss increases oxidative
      metabolism, while also increasing glycolytic capacity, and that this gives rise
      to an increase in oxygen consumption. We further show that the loss of FIH acts
      to accelerate the cellular metabolic response to hypoxia. Skeletal muscle
      expresses 50-fold higher levels of FIH than other tissues: we analyzed skeletal
      muscle FIH mutants and found a decreased metabolic efficiency, correlated with an
      increased oxidative rate and an increased rate of hypoxic response. We find that 
      FIH, through its regulation of oxidation, acts in concert with the PHD/vHL
      pathway to accelerate HIF-mediated metabolic responses to hypoxia.

AB  - How intracellular pathogens acquire essential non-diffusible host metabolites and
      whether the host cell counteracts the siphoning of these nutrients by its
      invaders are open questions. Here we show that host mitochondria fuse during
      infection by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii to limit its uptake of 
      fatty acids (FAs). A combination of genetics and imaging of FA trafficking
      indicates that Toxoplasma infection triggers lipophagy, the autophagy of host
      lipid droplets (LDs), to secure cellular FAs essential for its proliferation.
      Indeed, Toxoplasma FA siphoning and growth are reduced in host cells genetically 
      deficient for autophagy or triglyceride depots. Conversely, Toxoplasma FA uptake 
      and proliferation are increased in host cells lacking mitochondrial fusion,
      required for efficient mitochondrial FA oxidation, or where mitochondrial FA
      oxidation is pharmacologically inhibited. Thus, mitochondrial fusion can be
      regarded as a cellular defense mechanism against intracellular parasites, by
      limiting Toxoplasma access to host nutrients liberated by lipophagy.

AB  - Mitochondria associate with lipid droplets (LDs) in fat-oxidizing tissues, but
      the functional role of these peridroplet mitochondria (PDM) is unknown.
      Microscopic observation of interscapular brown adipose tissue reveals that PDM
      have unique protein composition and cristae structure and remain adherent to the 
      LD in the tissue homogenate. We developed an approach to isolate PDM based on
      their adherence to LDs. Comparison of purified PDM to cytoplasmic mitochondria
      reveals that (1) PDM have increased pyruvate oxidation, electron transport, and
      ATP synthesis capacities; (2) PDM have reduced beta-oxidation capacity and depart
      from LDs upon activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and
      beta-oxidation; (3) PDM support LD expansion as Perilipin5-induced recruitment of
      mitochondria to LDs increases ATP synthase-dependent triacylglyceride synthesis; 
      and (4) PDM maintain a distinct protein composition due to uniquely low
      fusion-fission dynamics. We conclude that PDM represent a segregated
      mitochondrial population with unique structure and function that supports
      triacylglyceride synthesis.

AB  - Glucocorticoid and other adipogenic hormones are secreted in mammals in circadian
      oscillations. Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern correlates with obesity 
      in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics
      affect adipocyte differentiation. Using live, single-cell imaging of the key
      adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with
      fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are
      rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system. In striking contrast,
      equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify
      the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow
      and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice
      that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the 
      mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a
      molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushing's disease, and other conditions for
      which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility may lead to obesity.

TI  - AIDA Selectively Mediates Downregulation of Fat Synthesis Enzymes by ERAD to

AB  - The efficiency of intestinal absorption of dietary fat constitutes a primary
      determinant accounting for individual vulnerability to obesity. However, how fat 
      absorption is controlled and contributes to obesity remains unclear. Here, we
      show that inhibition of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD)
      increases the abundance of triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes and fat absorption
      in small intestine. The C2-domain protein AIDA acts as an essential factor for
      the E3-ligase HRD1 of ERAD to downregulate rate-limiting acyltransferases GPAT3, 
      MOGAT2, and DGAT2. Aida(-/-) mice, when grown in a thermal-neutral condition or
      fed high-fat diet, display increased intestinal fatty acid re-esterification,
      circulating and tissue triacylglycerol, accompanied with severely increased
      adiposity without enhancement of adipogenesis. Intestine-specific knockout of
      Aida largely phenocopies its whole-body knockout, strongly indicating that
      increased intestinal TAG synthesis is a primary impetus to obesity. The
      AIDA-mediated ERAD system may thus represent an anti-thrifty mechanism impinging 
      on the enzymes for intestinal fat absorption and systemic fat storage.

AB  - Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known 
      to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and
      consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy
      source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule.
      "Lactate shuttle" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of
      oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine,
      it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with
      illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some
      clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a "strain" and not a "stress"
      biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat
      pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in
      sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate
      metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from gut enteroendocrine cells controls 
      meal-related glycemic excursions through augmentation of insulin and inhibition
      of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also inhibits gastric emptying and food intake,
      actions maximizing nutrient absorption while limiting weight gain. Here I review 
      the circuits engaged by endogenous versus pharmacological GLP-1 action,
      highlighting key GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-positive cell types and pathways
      transducing metabolic and non-glycemic GLP-1 signals. The role(s) of GLP-1 in the
      benefits and side effects associated with bariatric surgery are discussed and
      actions of GLP-1 controlling islet function, appetite, inflammation, and
      cardiovascular pathophysiology are highlighted. Refinement of the
      risk-versus-benefit profile of GLP-1-based therapies for the treatment of
      diabetes and obesity has stimulated development of orally bioavailable agonists, 
      allosteric modulators, and unimolecular multi-agonists, all targeting the GLP-1R.
      This review highlights established and emerging concepts, unanswered questions,
      and future challenges for development and optimization of GLP-1R agonists in the 
      treatment of metabolic disease.

AB  - RNA-targeted therapies represent a platform for drug discovery involving
      chemically modified oligonucleotides, a wide range of cellular RNAs, and a novel 
      target-binding motif, Watson-Crick base pairing. Numerous hurdles considered by
      many to be impassable have been overcome. Today, four RNA-targeted therapies are 
      approved for commercial use for indications as diverse as Spinal Muscular Atrophy
      (SMA) and reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and by routes 
      of administration including subcutaneous, intravitreal, and intrathecal delivery.
      The technology is efficient and supports approaching "undruggable" targets. Three
      additional agents are progressing through registration, and more are in clinical 
      development, representing several chemical and structural classes. Moreover,
      progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these drugs work has 
      led to steadily better clinical performance and a wide range of mechanisms that
      may be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Here we summarize the progress, future
      challenges, and opportunities for this drug discovery platform.

AB  - How brown and beige adipocytes activate UCP1-dependent thermogenesis has been
      studied in great detail. In Cell Metabolism, Tharp et al. (2018) have recently
      added another interesting dimension to this by demonstrating that
      actinomyosin-mediated elasticity regulates the thermogenic capacity of UCP1+
      adipocytes, opening up new ways by which UCP1-dependent thermogenesis can be
      stimulated.

AB  - Cellular senescence is traditionally viewed as a permanent form of cell cycle
      arrest that restrains tumorigenesis. In a recent study in Nature, however,
      Milanovic et al. (2018) challenge this conventional view, showing that senescence
      can counterintuitively promote cancer stemness and tumor aggressiveness. This
      finding suggests that attacking senescence can be exploited in cancer therapy.

AB  - Excess plasma triglycerides (TGs) are a key component of obesity-induced
      metabolic syndrome. We have shown that gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) treatment 
      improves glucose tolerance due to inhibition of hepatic Notch signaling but found
      additional Notch-independent reduction of plasma TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in
      GSI-treated, as well as hepatocyte-specific, gamma-secretase knockout (L-Ncst)
      mice, which suggested a primary effect on hepatocyte TRL uptake. Indeed, we found
      increased VLDL and LDL particle uptake in L-Ncst hepatocytes and Ncst-deficient
      hepatoma cells, in part through reduced gamma-secretase-mediated low-density
      lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) cleavage and degradation. To exploit this novel
      finding, we generated a liver-selective Nicastrin ASO, which recapitulated
      glucose and lipid improvements of L-Ncst mice, with increased levels of
      hepatocyte LDLR. Collectively, these results identify the role of hepatic
      gamma-secretase to regulate LDLR and suggest that liver-specific GSIs may
      simultaneously improve multiple aspects of the metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention with potential benefits for
      healthspan improvement and lifespan extension. In 53 (34 CR and 19 control)
      non-obese adults, we tested the hypothesis that energy expenditure (EE) and its
      endocrine mediators are reduced with a CR diet over 2 years. Approximately 15% CR
      was achieved over 2 years, resulting in an average 8.7 kg weight loss, whereas
      controls gained 1.8 kg. In the CR group, EE measured over 24 hr or during sleep
      was approximately 80-120 kcal/day lower than expected on the basis of weight
      loss, indicating sustained metabolic adaptation over 2 years. This metabolic
      adaptation was accompanied by significantly reduced thyroid axis activity and
      reactive oxygen species (F2-isoprostane) production. Findings from this 2-year CR
      trial in healthy, non-obese humans provide new evidence of persistent metabolic
      slowing accompanied by reduced oxidative stress, which supports the rate of
      living and oxidative damage theories of mammalian aging.

AB  - Ghrelin, a gastric-derived acylated peptide, regulates energy homeostasis by
      transmitting information about peripheral nutritional status to the brain, and is
      essential for protecting organisms against famine. Ghrelin operates brain
      circuits to regulate homeostatic and hedonic feeding. Recent research advances
      have shed new light on ghrelin's multifaceted roles in cellular homeostasis,
      which could maintain the internal environment and overcome metaflammation in
      metabolic organs. Here, we highlight our current understanding of the regulatory 
      mechanisms of the ghrelin system in energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis
      and its clinical trials. Future studies of ghrelin will further elucidate how the
      stomach regulates systemic homeostasis.

AB  - Dietary restriction (DR) was shown to impact on tumor growth with very variable
      effects depending on the cancer type. However, how DR limits cancer progression
      remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that feeding mice a low-protein
      (Low PROT) isocaloric diet but not a low-carbohydrate (Low CHO) diet reduced
      tumor growth in three independent mouse cancer models. Surprisingly, this effect 
      relies on anticancer immunosurveillance, as depleting CD8(+) T cells,
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs), or using immunodeficient mice prevented the
      beneficial effect of the diet. Mechanistically, we established that a Low PROT
      diet induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in tumor cells through the
      activation of IRE1alpha and RIG1 signaling, thereby resulting in cytokine
      production and mounting an efficient anticancer immune response. Collectively,
      our data suggest that a Low PROT diet induces an IRE1alpha-dependent UPR in
      cancer cells, enhancing a CD8-mediated T cell response against tumors.

AB  - Whether and how regulation of genes and pathways contributes to physiological
      aging is topic of intense scientific debate. By performing an RNA
      expression-based screen for genes downregulated during aging of three different
      species, we identified glycine-C-acetyltransferase (GCAT, EC 2.3.1.29). Impairing
      gcat expression promotes the lifespan of C. elegans by interfering with threonine
      catabolism to promote methylglyoxal (MGO; CAS 78-98-8) formation in an amine
      oxidase-dependent manner. MGO is a reactive dicarbonyl inducing diabetic
      complications in mammals by causing oxidative stress and damaging cellular
      components, including proteins. While high concentrations of MGO consistently
      exert toxicity in nematodes, we unexpectedly find that low-dose MGO promotes
      lifespan, resembling key mediators of gcat impairment. These were executed by the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, namely PBS-3 and RPN-6.1 subunits, regulated by the 
      stress-responsive transcriptional regulators SKN-1/NRF2 and HSF-1. Taken
      together, GCAT acts as an evolutionary conserved aging-related gene by
      orchestrating an unexpected nonlinear impact of proteotoxic MGO on longevity.

AB  - The molecular causes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well understood. Both type 
      1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D are characterized by impaired insulin signaling and
      hyperglycemia. From analogy to T1D, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are
      thought to also play causal roles in T2D. Recent clinical studies, however, found
      that T2D patients treated to maintain glycemia below the diabetes definition
      threshold (HbA1c < 6.5%) still develop diabetic complications. This suggests
      additional insulin- and glucose-independent mechanisms could be involved in T2D
      progression and/or initiation. T2D patients have elevated levels of the
      metabolite methylglyoxal (MG). We show here, using Drosophila glyoxalase 1
      knockouts, that animals with elevated methylglyoxal recapitulate several core
      aspects of T2D: insulin resistance, obesity, and hyperglycemia. Thus elevated MG 
      could constitute one root cause of T2D, suggesting that the molecular causes of
      elevated MG warrant further study.

AB  - The lung presents a highly oxidative environment, which is tolerated through
      engagement of tightly controlled stress response pathways. A critical stress
      response mediator is the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related 
      factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2), which is negatively regulated by Kelch-like
      ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway have been
      identified in 23% of lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting that deregulation of the
      pathway is a major cancer driver. We demonstrate that inactivation of Keap1 and
      Pten in the mouse lung promotes adenocarcinoma formation. Notably, metabolites
      identified in the plasma of Keap1(f/f)/Pten(f/f) tumor-bearing mice indicate that
      tumorigenesis is associated with reprogramming of the pentose phosphate pathway. 
      Furthermore, the immune milieu was dramatically changed by Keap1 and Pten
      deletion, and tumor regression was achieved utilizing immune checkpoint
      inhibition. Thus, our study highlights the ability to exploit both metabolic and 
      immune characteristics in the detection and treatment of lung tumors harboring
      KEAP1/NRF2 pathway alterations.

TI  - Metabolic Maturation during Muscle Stem Cell Differentiation Is Achieved by
      miR-1/133a-Mediated Inhibition of the Dlk1-Dio3 Mega Gene Cluster.

LID - 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.02.022 [doi]
AB  - Muscle stem cells undergo a dramatic metabolic switch to oxidative
      phosphorylation during differentiation, which is achieved by massively increased 
      mitochondrial activity. Since expression of the muscle-specific miR-1/133a gene
      cluster correlates with increased mitochondrial activity during muscle stem cell 
      (MuSC) differentiation, we examined the potential role of miR-1/133a in metabolic
      maturation of skeletal muscles in mice. We found that miR-1/133a downregulate
      Mef2A in differentiated myocytes, thereby suppressing the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster,
      which encodes multiple microRNAs inhibiting expression of mitochondrial genes.
      Loss of miR-1/133a in skeletal muscles or increased Mef2A expression causes
      continuous high-level expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, compromising
      mitochondrial function. Failure to terminate the stem cell-like metabolic program
      characterized by high-level Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster expression initiates profound 
      changes in muscle physiology, essentially abrogating endurance running. Our
      results suggest a major role of miR-1/133a in metabolic maturation of skeletal
      muscles but exclude major functions in muscle development and MuSC maintenance.

AB  - Nutrient deprivation induces autophagy through inhibiting TORC1 activity. We
      describe a novel mechanism in Drosophila by which TORC1 regulates RNA processing 
      of Atg transcripts and alters ATG protein levels and activities via the cleavage 
      and polyadenylation (CPA) complex. We show that TORC1 signaling inhibits CDK8 and
      DOA kinases, which directly phosphorylate CPSF6, a component of the CPA complex. 
      These phosphorylation events regulate CPSF6 localization, RNA binding, and
      starvation-induced alternative RNA processing of transcripts involved in
      autophagy, nutrient, and energy metabolism, thereby controlling autophagosome
      formation and metabolism. Similarly, we find that mammalian CDK8 and CLK2, a DOA 
      ortholog, phosphorylate CPSF6 to regulate autophagy and metabolic changes upon
      starvation, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism linking TORC1
      signaling with RNA processing, autophagy, and metabolism.

AB  - Metabolism is a fundamental process of life. However, non-invasive measurement of
      local tissue metabolism is limited today by a deficiency in adequate tools for in
      vivo observations. We designed a multi-modular platform that explored the
      relation between local tissue oxygen consumption, determined by label-free
      optoacoustic measurements of hemoglobin, and concurrent indirect calorimetry
      obtained during metabolic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). By studying
      mice and humans, we show how video-rate handheld multi-spectral optoacoustic
      tomography (MSOT) in the 700-970 nm spectral range enables non-invasive imaging
      of BAT activation, consistent with positron emission tomography findings.
      Moreover, we observe BAT composition differences between healthy and diabetic
      tissues. The study consolidates hemoglobin as a principal label-free biomarker
      for longitudinal non-invasive imaging of BAT morphology and bioenergetics in
      situ. We also resolve water and fat components in volunteers, and contrast MSOT
      readouts with magnetic resonance imaging data.

AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan and delays the onset of age-related
      disorders in diverse species. Metabolic regulatory pathways have been implicated 
      in the mechanisms of CR, but the molecular details have not been elucidated.
      Here, we show that CR engages RNA processing of genes associated with a highly
      integrated reprogramming of hepatic metabolism. We conducted molecular profiling 
      of liver biopsies collected from adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) at
      baseline and after 2 years on control or CR (30% restricted) diet. Quantitation
      of over 20,000 molecules from the hepatic transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome
      indicated that metabolism and RNA processing are major features of the response
      to CR. Predictive models identified lipid, branched-chain amino acid, and
      short-chain carbon metabolic pathways, with alternate transcript use for over
      half of the genes in the CR network. We conclude that RNA-based mechanisms are
      central to the CR response and integral in metabolic reprogramming.

AB  - The role in longevity and healthspan of nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological
      precursor of NAD(+), is elusive. Here, we report that chronic NAM supplementation
      improves healthspan measures in mice without extending lifespan. Untargeted
      metabolite profiling of the liver and metabolic flux analysis of liver-derived
      cells revealed NAM-mediated improvement in glucose homeostasis in mice on a
      high-fat diet (HFD) that was associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and
      inflammation concomitant with increased glycogen deposition and flux through the 
      pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways. Targeted NAD metabolome analysis in
      liver revealed depressed expression of NAM salvage in NAM-treated mice, an effect
      counteracted by higher expression of de novo NAD biosynthetic enzymes. Although
      neither hepatic NAD(+) nor NADP(+) was boosted by NAM, acetylation of some SIRT1 
      targets was enhanced by NAM supplementation in a diet- and NAM dose-dependent
      manner. Collectively, our results show health improvement in NAM-supplemented
      HFD-fed mice in the absence of survival effects.

AB  - Mitoribosomes are specialized for the synthesis of hydrophobic membrane proteins 
      encoded by mtDNA, all essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Despite their
      linkage to human mitochondrial diseases and the recent cryoelectron microscopy
      reconstruction of yeast and mammalian mitoribosomes, how they are assembled
      remains obscure. Here, we dissected the yeast mitoribosome large subunit (mtLSU) 
      assembly process by systematic genomic deletion of 44 mtLSU proteins (MRPs).
      Analysis of the strain collection unveiled 37 proteins essential for functional
      mtLSU assembly, three of which are critical for mtLSU 21S rRNA stability.
      Hierarchical cluster analysis of mtLSU subassemblies accumulated in mutant
      strains revealed co-operative assembly of protein sets forming structural
      clusters and preassembled modules. It also indicated crucial roles for
      mitochondrion-specific membrane-binding MRPs in anchoring newly transcribed 21S
      rRNA to the inner membrane, where assembly proceeds. Our results define the yeast
      mtLSU assembly landscape in vivo and provide a foundation for studies of
      mitoribosome assembly across evolution.

AB  - Efficient insulin secretion requires a well-functioning pancreatic islet
      microvasculature. The dense network of islet capillaries includes the islet
      pericyte, a cell that has barely been studied. Here we show that islet pericytes 
      help control local blood flow by adjusting islet capillary diameter. Islet
      pericytes cover 40% of the microvasculature, are contractile, and are innervated 
      by sympathetic axons. Sympathetic adrenergic input increases pericyte activity
      and reduces capillary diameter and local blood flow. By contrast, activating beta
      cells by increasing glucose concentration inhibits pericytes, dilates islet
      capillaries, and increases local blood flow. These effects on pericytes are
      mediated by endogenous adenosine, which is likely derived from ATP co-released
      with insulin. Pericyte coverage of islet capillaries drops drastically in type 2 
      diabetes, suggesting that, under diabetic conditions, islets lose this mechanism 
      to control their own blood supply. This may lead to inadequate insulin release
      into the circulation, further deteriorating glycemic control.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is critical for thermoregulation and
      contributes to total energy expenditure. However, whether BAT has non-thermogenic
      functions is largely unknown. Here, we describe that BAT-specific liver kinase b1
      knockout (Lkb1(BKO)) mice exhibited impaired BAT mitochondrial respiration and
      thermogenesis but reduced adiposity and liver triglyceride accumulation under
      high-fat-diet feeding at room temperature. Importantly, these metabolic benefits 
      were also present in Lkb1(BKO) mice at thermoneutrality, where BAT thermogenesis 
      was not required. Mechanistically, decreased mRNA levels of mtDNA-encoded
      electron transport chain (ETC) subunits and ETC proteome imbalance led to
      defective BAT mitochondrial respiration in Lkb1(BKO) mice. Furthermore, reducing 
      mtDNA gene expression directly in BAT by removing mitochondrial transcription
      factor A (Tfam) in BAT also showed ETC proteome imbalance and the trade-off
      between BAT thermogenesis and systemic metabolism at room temperature and
      thermoneutrality. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ETC proteome imbalance 
      in BAT regulates systemic metabolism independently of thermogenesis.

AB  - The activation of brown/beige adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism and the induction
      of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression are essential for BAT-based strategies 
      to improve metabolic homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that BAT utilizes
      actomyosin machinery to generate tensional responses following adrenergic
      stimulation, similar to muscle tissues. The activation of actomyosin mechanics is
      critical for the acute induction of oxidative metabolism and uncoupled
      respiration in UCP1(+) adipocytes. Moreover, we show that actomyosin-mediated
      elasticity regulates the thermogenic capacity of adipocytes via the
      mechanosensitive transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ, which are
      indispensable for normal BAT function. These biomechanical signaling mechanisms
      may inform future strategies to promote the expansion and activation of
      brown/beige adipocytes.

AB  - Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has multiple roles in orchestrating whole-body
      energy homeostasis. In addition, VAT is now considered an immune site harboring
      an array of innate and adaptive immune cells with a direct role in immune
      surveillance and host defense. We report that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)
      in VAT acquire a tolerogenic phenotype through upregulation of pathways involved 
      in adipocyte differentiation. While activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in
      cDC1 DCs induces IL-10 production, upregulation of the PPARgamma pathway in cDC2 
      DCs directly suppresses their activation. Combined, they promote an
      anti-inflammatory milieu in vivo delaying the onset of obesity-induced chronic
      inflammation and insulin resistance. Under long-term over-nutrition, changes in
      adipocyte biology curtail beta-catenin and PPARgamma activation, contributing to 
      VAT inflammation.

AB  - Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid
      metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis,
      but whether changes in the upper small intestinal microbiota alter specific fatty
      acid-dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We here
      first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, oleic acid, or
      linoleic acid pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose
      production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty acid sensing
      and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3
      expression. Transplantation of healthy upper small intestinal microbiota to
      high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty acid sensing via
      increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to
      non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small
      intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty acid sensing. In summary, we unveil a
      glucoregulatory role of upper small intestinal L. gasseri that impacts an
      ACSL3-dependent glucoregulatory fatty acid-sensing pathway.

AB  - Every animal species has a signature blood glucose level or glycemic set point.
      These set points are different, and the normal glycemic levels (normoglycemia) of
      one species would be life threatening for other species. Mouse normoglycemia can 
      be considered diabetic for humans. The biological determinants of the glycemic
      set point remain unclear. Here we show that the pancreatic islet imposes its
      glycemic set point on the organism, making it the bona fide glucostat in the
      body. Moreover, and in contrast to rodent islets, glucagon input from the alpha
      cell to the insulin-secreting beta cell is necessary to fine-tune the distinctive
      human set point. These findings affect transplantation and regenerative
      approaches to treat diabetes because restoring normoglycemia may require more
      than replacing only the beta cells. Furthermore, therapeutic strategies using
      glucagon receptor antagonists as hypoglycemic agents need to be reassessed, as
      they may reset the overall glucostat in the organism.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), the cell's hydrogen carrier for redox
      enzymes, is well known for its role in redox reactions. More recently, it has
      emerged as a signaling molecule. By modulating NAD(+)-sensing enzymes, NAD(+)
      controls hundreds of key processes from energy metabolism to cell survival,
      rising and falling depending on food intake, exercise, and the time of day.
      NAD(+) levels steadily decline with age, resulting in altered metabolism and
      increased disease susceptibility. Restoration of NAD(+) levels in old or diseased
      animals can promote health and extend lifespan, prompting a search for safe and
      efficacious NAD-boosting molecules that hold the promise of increasing the body's
      resilience, not just to one disease, but to many, thereby extending healthy human
      lifespan.

AB  - Post-translational modification of lysine residues via reversible acylation
      occurs on proteins from diverse pathways, functions, and organisms. While nuclear
      protein acylation reflects the competing activities of enzymatic acyltransferases
      and deacylases, mitochondrial acylation appears to be driven mostly via a
      non-enzymatic mechanism. Three protein deacylases, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5,
      reside in the mitochondria and remove these modifications from targeted proteins 
      in an NAD(+)-dependent manner. Recent proteomic surveys of mitochondrial protein 
      acylation have identified the sites of protein acetylation, succinylation,
      glutarylation, and malonylation and their regulation by SIRT3 and SIRT5. Here, we
      review recent advances in this rapidly moving field, their biological
      significance, and their implications for mitochondrial function, metabolic
      regulation, and disease pathogenesis.

AB  - In this Minireview, we provide an epidemiologist's perspective on the debate and 
      recent advances in determining the relationship between diet and cardiovascular
      health. We conclude that, in order to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular 
      disease, there should be a greater emphasis on improving overall diet quality and
      food sources of macronutrients, such as dietary fats and carbohydrates. In
      addition, building a strong evidence base through high-quality intervention and
      observational studies is crucial for effective policy changes, which can greatly 
      improve the food environment and population health.

AB  - The initial metabolism of fructose is thought to primarily take place in the
      liver. Using stable isotope labeling combined with tissue and arterio-venous
      sampling, Jang et al. (2018) demonstrate that in mice, the small intestine is the
      primary site of fructose metabolism. This raises important questions about
      fructose handling in humans.

      cross-protection against pathogens mediated by the innate immune system. Using a 
      diet-based sterile inflammation model, Christ et al. (2018) have shown in a

AB  - Mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics and mitochondrial bioenergetics, including 
      oxidative phosphorylation and generation of ATP, are strongly clock controlled.
      Here we show that these circadian oscillations depend on circadian modification
      of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key mediator of mitochondrial fission. We 
      used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including human skin
      fibroblasts and DRP1-deficient or clock-deficient mice, to show that these
      dynamics are clock controlled via circadian regulation of DRP1. Genetic or
      pharmacological abrogation of DRP1 activity abolished circadian network dynamics 
      and mitochondrial respiratory activity and eliminated circadian ATP production.
      Pharmacological silencing of pathways regulating circadian metabolism and
      mitochondrial function (e.g., sirtuins, AMPK) also altered DRP1 phosphorylation, 
      and abrogation of DRP1 activity impaired circadian function. Our findings provide
      new insight into the crosstalk between the mitochondrial network and circadian
      cycles.

AB  - A carbohydrate-restricted diet is a widely recommended intervention for
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but a systematic perspective on the
      multiple benefits of this diet is lacking. Here, we performed a short-term
      intervention with an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein
      content in obese subjects with NAFLD and characterized the resulting alterations 
      in metabolism and the gut microbiota using a multi-omics approach. We observed
      rapid and dramatic reductions of liver fat and other cardiometabolic risk factors
      paralleled by (1) marked decreases in hepatic de novo lipogenesis; (2) large
      increases in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, reflecting increased
      mitochondrial beta-oxidation; and (3) rapid increases in folate-producing
      Streptococcus and serum folate concentrations. Liver transcriptomic analysis on
      biopsy samples from a second cohort revealed downregulation of the fatty acid
      synthesis pathway and upregulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism and
      fatty acid oxidation pathways. Our results highlight the potential of exploring
      diet-microbiota interactions for treating NAFLD.

AB  - Research on the biology of NAD(+) has been gaining momentum, providing many
      critical insights into the pathogenesis of age-associated functional decline and 
      diseases. In particular, two key NAD(+) intermediates, nicotinamide riboside (NR)
      and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), have been extensively studied over the
      past several years. Supplementing these NAD(+) intermediates has shown preventive
      and therapeutic effects, ameliorating age-associated pathophysiologies and
      disease conditions. Although the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fates of NMN and 
      NR are still under intensive investigation, these NAD(+) intermediates can
      exhibit distinct behavior, and their fates appear to depend on the tissue
      distribution and expression levels of NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes, nucleotidases,
      and presumptive transporters for each. A comprehensive concept that connects
      NAD(+) metabolism to the control of aging and longevity in mammals has been
      proposed, and the stage is now set to test whether these exciting preclinical
      results can be translated to improve human health.

AB  - Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is biphasic, with a rapid first phase and a 
      slowly developing sustained second phase; both are disturbed in type 2 diabetes
      (T2D). Biphasic secretion results from vastly different release probabilities of 
      individual insulin granules, but the morphological and molecular basis for this
      is unclear. Here, we show that human insulin secretion and exocytosis critically 
      depend on the availability of membrane-docked granules and that T2D is associated
      with a strong reduction in granule docking. Glucose accelerated granule docking, 
      and this effect was absent in T2D. Newly docked granules only slowly acquired
      release competence; this was regulated by major signaling pathways, but not
      glucose. Gene expression analysis indicated that key proteins involved in granule
      docking are downregulated in T2D, and overexpression of these proteins increased 
      granule docking. The findings establish granule docking as an important
      glucose-dependent step in human insulin secretion that is dysregulated in T2D.

TI  - Palmitic Acid Hydroxystearic Acids Activate GPR40, Which Is Involved in Their
      Beneficial Effects on Glucose Homeostasis.

AB  - Palmitic acid hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs) are endogenous lipids with
      anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. PAHSA levels are reduced in serum
      and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant people and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. 
      Here, we investigated whether chronic PAHSA treatment enhances insulin
      sensitivity and which receptors mediate PAHSA effects. Chronic PAHSA
      administration in chow- and HFD-fed mice raises serum and tissue PAHSA levels
      approximately 1.4- to 3-fold. This improves insulin sensitivity and glucose
      tolerance without altering body weight. PAHSA administration in chow-fed, but not
      HFD-fed, mice augments insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion.
      PAHSAs are selective agonists for GPR40, increasing Ca(+2) flux, but not
      intracellular cyclic AMP. Blocking GPR40 reverses improvements in glucose
      tolerance and insulin sensitivity in PAHSA-treated chow- and HFD-fed mice and
      directly inhibits PAHSA augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
      human islets. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor blockade in PAHSA-treated chow-fed mice
      reduces PAHSA effects on glucose tolerance, but not on insulin sensitivity. Thus,
      PAHSAs activate GPR40, which is involved in their beneficial metabolic effects.

AB  - The role of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in psychiatric disease is well
      established, but remains less explored in peripheral tissues. Exercise training
      activates kynurenine biotransformation in skeletal muscle, which protects from
      neuroinflammation and leads to peripheral kynurenic acid accumulation. Here we
      show that kynurenic acid increases energy utilization by activating G
      protein-coupled receptor Gpr35, which stimulates lipid metabolism, thermogenic,
      and anti-inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue. This suppresses weight
      gain in animals fed a high-fat diet and improves glucose tolerance. Kynurenic
      acid and Gpr35 enhance Pgc-1alpha1 expression and cellular respiration, and
      increase the levels of Rgs14 in adipocytes, which leads to enhanced
      beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, genetic deletion of Gpr35 causes 
      progressive weight gain and glucose intolerance, and sensitizes to the effects of
      high-fat diets. Finally, exercise-induced adipose tissue browning is compromised 
      in Gpr35 knockout animals. This work uncovers kynurenine metabolism as a pathway 
      with therapeutic potential to control energy homeostasis.

AB  - Excessive consumption of sweets is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A major 
      chemical feature of sweets is fructose. Despite strong ties between fructose and 
      disease, the metabolic fate of fructose in mammals remains incompletely
      understood. Here we use isotope tracing and mass spectrometry to track the fate
      of glucose and fructose carbons in vivo, finding that dietary fructose is cleared
      by the small intestine. Clearance requires the fructose-phosphorylating enzyme
      ketohexokinase. Low doses of fructose are approximately 90% cleared by the
      intestine, with only trace fructose but extensive fructose-derived glucose,
      lactate, and glycerate found in the portal blood. High doses of fructose (>/=1
      g/kg) overwhelm intestinal fructose absorption and clearance, resulting in
      fructose reaching both the liver and colonic microbiota. Intestinal fructose
      clearance is augmented both by prior exposure to fructose and by feeding. We
      propose that the small intestine shields the liver from otherwise toxic fructose 
      exposure.

AB  - Sterile inflammation after tissue damage is a ubiquitous response, yet it has the
      highest amplitude in the liver. This has major clinical consequences, for
      alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH and NASH) account for the
      majority of liver disease in industrialized countries and both lack therapy.
      Requirements for sustained sterile inflammation include increased oxidative
      stress and activation of the HIF-1alpha signaling pathway. We demonstrate the
      ability of digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, to protect from liver inflammation and
      damage in ASH and NASH. Digoxin was effective in maintaining cellular redox
      homeostasis and suppressing HIF-1alpha pathway activation. A proteomic screen
      revealed that digoxin binds pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and independently of PKM2 
      kinase activity results in chromatin remodeling and downregulation of HIF-1alpha 
      transactivation. These data identify PKM2 as a mediator and therapeutic target
      for regulating liver sterile inflammation, and demonstrate a novel role for
      digoxin that can effectively protect the liver from ASH and NASH.

AB  - Emerging and seminal studies have shown that cell metabolism influences gene
      expression by modifying the epigenome, which can regulate stem cell pluripotency,
      differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming. Core pluripotency factors and
      developmental regulators reciprocally control the expression of key metabolism
      genes and their encoded pathways. Recent technological advances enabling
      sensitive detection methods during early mammalian development revealed the
      state-specific and context-dependent coordination of signal transduction, histone
      modifications, and gene expression in developing, resting, and malnourished
      embryos. Here, we discuss metabolism as a potential driver of earliest cell fate 
      through its influence on the epigenome and gene expression in embryos and their
      in vitro surrogate pluripotent stem cells.

      (GPR40) is responsible for a major part of glucose-induced insulin secretion.
      This puzzling fact is now explained by Tunaru et al. (2018), who demonstrate that
      glucose-induced 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) amplifies insulin
      secretion through autocrine activation of FFAR1.

AB  - The mechanisms by which feeding and fasting drive rhythmic gene expression for
      physiological adaptation to daily rhythm in nutrient availability are not well
      understood. Here we show that, upon feeding, the RNA-binding protein NONO
      accumulates within speckle-like structures in liver cell nuclei. Combining
      RNA-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-seq), we find that an increased
      number of RNAs are bound by NONO after feeding. We further show that NONO binds
      and regulates the rhythmicity of genes involved in nutrient metabolism
      post-transcriptionally. Finally, we show that disrupted rhythmicity of NONO
      target genes has profound metabolic impact. Indeed, NONO-deficient mice exhibit
      impaired glucose tolerance and lower hepatic glycogen and lipids. Accordingly,
      these mice shift from glucose storage to fat oxidation, and therefore remain lean
      throughout adulthood. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NONO
      post-transcriptionally coordinates circadian mRNA expression of metabolic genes
      with the feeding/fasting cycle, thereby playing a critical role in energy
      homeostasis.

      Necessary Nutrients.

AB  - The control of uptake and utilization of necessary extracellular
      nutrients-glucose and glutamine-is an important aspect of B cell activation.
      Let-7 is a family of microRNAs known to be involved in metabolic control. Here,
      we employed several engineered mouse models, including B cell-specific
      overexpression of Lin28a or the let-7a-1/let-7d/let-7f-1 cluster (let-7adf) and
      knockout of individual let-7 clusters to show that let-7adf specifically inhibits
      T cell-independent (TI) antigen-induced immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody production.
      Both overexpression and deletion of let-7 in this cluster leads to altered TI-IgM
      production. Mechanistically, let-7adf suppresses the acquisition and utilization 
      of key nutrients, including glucose and glutamine, through directly targeting
      hexokinase 2 (Hk2) and by repressing a glutamine transporter Slc1a5 and a key
      degradation enzyme, glutaminase (Gls), a mechanism mediated by regulation of
      c-Myc. Our results suggest a novel role of let-7adf as a "metabolic brake" on B
      cell antibody production.

TI  - Basal Mitophagy Occurs Independently of PINK1 in Mouse Tissues of High Metabolic 
      Demand.

AB  - Dysregulated mitophagy has been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the
      role of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) in mediating depolarization-induced
      mitophagy in vitro. Elegant mouse reporters have revealed the pervasive nature of
      basal mitophagy in vivo, yet the role of PINK1 and tissue metabolic context
      remains unknown. Using mito-QC, we investigated the contribution of PINK1 to
      mitophagy in metabolically active tissues. We observed a high degree of mitophagy
      in neural cells, including PD-relevant mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and
      microglia. In all tissues apart from pancreatic islets, loss of Pink1 did not
      influence basal mitophagy, despite disrupting depolarization-induced Parkin
      activation. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence that PINK1 is
      detectable at basal levels and that basal mammalian mitophagy occurs
      independently of PINK1. This suggests multiple, yet-to-be-discovered pathways
      orchestrating mammalian mitochondrial integrity in a context-dependent fashion,
      and this has profound implications for our molecular understanding of vertebrate 
      mitophagy.

AB  - When mammalian cells are deprived of glutamine, exogenous asparagine rescues cell
      survival and growth. Here we report that this rescue results from use of
      asparagine in protein synthesis. All mammalian cell lines tested lacked cytosolic
      asparaginase activity and could not utilize asparagine to produce other amino
      acids or biosynthetic intermediates. Instead, most glutamine-deprived cell lines 
      are capable of sufficient glutamine synthesis to maintain essential amino acid
      uptake and production of glutamine-dependent biosynthetic precursors, with the
      exception of asparagine. While experimental introduction of cytosolic
      asparaginase could enhance the synthesis of glutamine and increase tricarboxylic 
      acid cycle anaplerosis and the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, cytosolic
      asparaginase suppressed the growth and survival of cells in glutamine-depleted
      medium in vitro and severely compromised the in vivo growth of tumor xenografts. 
      These results suggest that the lack of asparaginase activity represents an
      evolutionary adaptation to allow mammalian cells to survive pathophysiologic
      variations in extracellular glutamine.

AB  - Facultative animal-bacteria symbioses, which are critical determinants of animal 
      fitness, are largely assumed to be mutualistic. However, whether commensal
      bacteria benefit from the association has not been rigorously assessed. Using a
      simple and tractable gnotobiotic model- Drosophila mono-associated with one of
      its dominant commensals, Lactobacillus plantarum-we reveal that in addition to
      benefiting animal growth, this facultative symbiosis has a positive impact on
      commensal bacteria fitness. We find that bacteria encounter a strong cost during 
      gut transit, yet larvae-derived maintenance factors override this cost and
      increase bacterial population fitness, thus perpetuating symbiosis. In addition, 
      we demonstrate that the maintenance of the association is required for achieving 
      maximum animal growth benefits upon chronic undernutrition. Taken together, our
      study establishes a prototypical case of facultative nutritional mutualism,
      whereby a farming mechanism perpetuates animal-bacteria symbiosis, which bolsters
      fitness gains for both partners upon poor nutritional conditions.

AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of 
      metabolic and nutrient cues that integrates environmental inputs into downstream 
      signaling pathways to control cellular metabolism, growth, and survival. While
      numerous in vitro and in vivo studies reported the positive functions of mTORC1
      in the regulation of beta cell survival and proliferation under physiological
      conditions, more recent work demonstrates the opposite in the long term; this is 
      exemplified by the constitutive inappropriate hyper-activation of mTORC1 in
      diabetic islets or beta cells under conditions of increased beta cell stress and 
      metabolic demands. These recent findings uncover mTORC1's importance as an
      emerging significant player in the development and progression of beta cell
      failure in type 2 diabetes and suggest that mTORC1 may act as a "double edge
      sword" in the regulation of beta cell mass and function in response to metabolic 
      stress such as nutrient overload and insulin resistance.

AB  - Incretin hormones exert pleiotropic metabolic actions beyond the pancreas.
      Although the heart expresses both incretin receptors, the cardiac biology of GIP 
      receptor (GIPR) action remains incompletely understood. Here we show that GIPR
      agonism did not impair the response to cardiac ischemia. In contrast, genetic
      elimination of the Gipr reduced myocardial infarction (MI)-induced ventricular
      injury and enhanced survival associated with reduced hormone sensitive lipase
      (HSL) phosphorylation; it also increased myocardial triacylglycerol (TAG) stores.
      Conversely, direct GIPR agonism in the isolated heart reduced myocardial TAG
      stores and increased fatty acid oxidation. The cardioprotective phenotype in
      Gipr(-/-) mice was partially reversed by pharmacological activation or genetic
      overexpression of HSL. Selective Gipr inactivation in cardiomyocytes phenocopied 
      Gipr(-/-) mice, resulting in improved survival and reduced adverse remodeling
      following experimental MI. Hence, the cardiomyocyte GIPR regulates fatty acid
      metabolism and the adaptive response to ischemic cardiac injury. These findings
      have translational relevance for developing GIPR-based therapeutics.

AB  - Ghrelin, an appetite-stimulatory hormone secreted by the stomach, was discovered 
      as a ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Through GHSR,
      ghrelin stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, a function that evolved to
      protect against starvation-induced hypoglycemia. Though the biology mediated by
      ghrelin has been described in great detail, regulation of ghrelin action is
      poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of liver-expressed antimicrobial
      peptide 2 (LEAP2) as an endogenous antagonist of GHSR. LEAP2 is produced in the
      liver and small intestine, and its secretion is suppressed by fasting. LEAP2
      fully inhibits GHSR activation by ghrelin and blocks the major effects of ghrelin
      in vivo, including food intake, GH release, and maintenance of viable glucose
      levels during chronic caloric restriction. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies
      that block endogenous LEAP2 function enhance ghrelin action in vivo. Our findings
      reveal a mechanism for fine-tuning ghrelin action in response to changing
      environmental conditions.

AB  - Mammalian AMPK is known to be activated by falling cellular energy status,
      signaled by rising AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios. We review recent information about
      how this occurs but also discuss new studies suggesting that AMPK is able to
      sense glucose availability independently of changes in adenine nucleotides. The
      glycolytic intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is sensed by aldolase,
      which binds to the v-ATPase on the lysosomal surface. In the absence of FBP,
      interactions between aldolase and the v-ATPase are altered, allowing formation of
      an AXIN-based AMPK-activation complex containing the v-ATPase, Ragulator, AXIN,
      LKB1, and AMPK, causing increased Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activation.
      This nutrient-sensing mechanism activates AMPK but also primes it for further
      activation if cellular energy status subsequently falls. Glucose sensing at the
      lysosome, in which AMPK and other components of the activation complex act
      antagonistically with another key nutrient sensor, mTORC1, may have been one of
      the ancestral roles of AMPK.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a central regulator for detecting and adapting to
      cellular oxygen levels, transcriptionally activates genes modulating oxygen
      homeostasis and metabolic activation. Beyond this, HIF influences many other
      processes. Hypoxia, in part through HIF-dependent mechanisms, influences
      epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, which
      modulate hypoxia-responsive gene expression in cells. Hypoxia profoundly affects 
      expression of many noncoding RNAs classes that have clinicopathological
      implications in cancer. HIF can regulate noncoding RNAs production, while,
      conversely, noncoding RNAs can modulate HIF expression. There is recent evidence 
      for crosstalk between circadian rhythms and hypoxia-induced signaling, suggesting
      involvement of molecular clocks in adaptation to fluxes in nutrient and oxygen
      sensing. HIF induces increased production of cellular vesicles facilitating
      intercellular communication at a distance-for example, promoting angiogenesis in 
      hypoxic tumors. Understanding the complex networks underlying cellular and
      genomic regulation in response to hypoxia via HIF may identify novel and specific
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - A new study in Nature Medicine, by Ikeda et al. (2017), reports that calcium
      cycling in beige adipocytes elevates energy expenditure and glucose oxidation in 
      the absence of uncoupling protein 1. Thermogenic calcium cycling in beige fat is 
      mediated by SERCA2b and improves cold tolerance and metabolic status.

AB  - Adipose tissue depots can exist in close association with other organs, where
      they assume diverse, often non-traditional functions. In stem cell-rich skin,
      bone marrow, and mammary glands, adipocytes signal to and modulate organ
      regeneration and remodeling. Skin adipocytes and their progenitors signal to hair
      follicles, promoting epithelial stem cell quiescence and activation,
      respectively. Hair follicles signal back to adipocyte progenitors, inducing their
      expansion and regeneration, as in skin scars. In mammary glands and heart,
      adipocytes supply lipids to neighboring cells for nutritional and metabolic
      functions, respectively. Adipose depots adjacent to skeletal structures function 
      to absorb mechanical shock. Adipose tissue near the surface of skin and intestine
      senses and responds to bacterial invasion, contributing to the body's innate
      immune barrier. As the recognition of diverse adipose depot functions increases, 
      novel therapeutic approaches centered on tissue-specific adipocytes are likely to
      emerge for a range of cancers and regenerative, infectious, and autoimmune
      disorders.

AB  - Adipose tissues are complex organs, with central roles in energy homeostasis as
      well as local functions. Adipocytes develop in diverse, discrete locations
      throughout the body. Important regional differences in adipocytes exist, and
      diseases that affect adipose tissues often demonstrate depot-specific effects.
      Herein, we depict the widespread locations of major and minor rodent adipose
      depots. Depot-specific molecular and functional characteristics will be described
      in Part II.

AB  - [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) imaging has been invaluable
      for visualizing metabolically active adipose tissues in humans with potential
      anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects. To explore whether mice display
      human-like fat depots in anatomically comparable regions, we mapped fat depots
      using glucose or fatty acid imaging tracers, such as (18)F-FDG through PET/CT or 
      [(123/125)I]-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl-pentadecanoic acid with SPECT/CT imaging,
      to analogous depots in mice. Using this type of image analysis with both probes, 
      we define a large number of additional areas of high metabolic activity
      corresponding to novel fat pads. Histological and gene expression analyses
      validate these regions as bona fide fat pads. Our findings indicate that fat
      depots of rodents show a high degree of topological similarity to those of
      humans. Studies involving both glucose and lipid tracers indicate differential
      preferences for these substrates in different depots and also suggest that fatty 
      acid-based visualized approaches may reveal additional brown adipose tissue and
      beige depots in humans.

AB  - Exercise stimulates the release of molecules into the circulation, supporting the
      concept that inter-tissue signaling proteins are important mediators of
      adaptations to exercise. Recognizing that many circulating proteins are packaged 
      in extracellular vesicles (EVs), we employed quantitative proteomic techniques to
      characterize the exercise-induced secretion of EV-contained proteins. Following a
      1-hr bout of cycling exercise in healthy humans, we observed an increase in the
      circulation of over 300 proteins, with a notable enrichment of several classes of
      proteins that compose exosomes and small vesicles. Pulse-chase and intravital
      imaging experiments suggested EVs liberated by exercise have a propensity to
      localize in the liver and can transfer their protein cargo. Moreover, by
      employing arteriovenous balance studies across the contracting human limb, we
      identified several novel candidate myokines, released into circulation
      independently of classical secretion. These data identify a new paradigm by which
      tissue crosstalk during exercise can exert systemic biological effects.

AB  - While the cell-intrinsic pathways governing beige adipocyte development and
      phenotype have been increasingly delineated, comparatively little is known about 
      how beige adipocytes interact with other cell types in fat. Here, we introduce a 
      whole-tissue clearing method for adipose that permits immunolabeling and
      three-dimensional profiling of structures including thermogenic adipocytes and
      sympathetic innervation. We found that tissue architecture and sympathetic
      innervation differ significantly between subcutaneous and visceral depots.
      Subcutaneous fat demonstrates prominent regional variation in beige fat
      biogenesis with localization of UCP1(+) beige adipocytes to areas with dense
      sympathetic neurites. We present evidence that the density of sympathetic
      projections is dependent on PRDM16 in adipocytes, providing another potential
      mechanism underlying the metabolic benefits mediated by PRDM16. This powerful
      imaging tool highlights the interaction of tissue components during beige fat
      biogenesis and reveals a previously undescribed mode of regulation of the
      sympathetic nervous system by adipocytes.

TI  - Repression of Adipose Tissue Fibrosis through a PRDM16-GTF2IRD1 Complex Improves 
      Systemic Glucose Homeostasis.

AB  - Adipose tissue fibrosis is a hallmark of malfunction that is linked to insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes; however, what regulates this process remains
      unclear. Here we show that the PRDM16 transcriptional complex, a dominant
      activator of brown/beige adipocyte development, potently represses adipose tissue
      fibrosis in an uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-independent manner. By purifying the
      PRDM16 complex, we identified GTF2IRD1, a member of the TFII-I family of
      DNA-binding proteins, as a cold-inducible transcription factor that mediates the 
      repressive action of the PRDM16 complex on fibrosis. Adipocyte-selective
      expression of GTF2IRD1 represses adipose tissue fibrosis and improves systemic
      glucose homeostasis independent of body-weight loss, while deleting GTF2IRD1
      promotes fibrosis in a cell-autonomous manner. GTF2IRD1 represses the
      transcription of transforming growth factor beta-dependent pro-fibrosis genes by 
      recruiting PRDM16 and EHMT1 onto their promoter/enhancer regions. These results
      suggest a mechanism by which repression of obesity-associated adipose tissue
      fibrosis through the PRDM16 complex leads to an improvement in systemic glucose
      homeostasis.

AB  - Dietary habits that can induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are major
      colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors, but mechanisms linking nutrients, IBD, and 
      CRC are unknown. Using human data and mouse models, we show that mTORC1
      inactivation-induced chromosomal instability impairs intestinal crypt
      proliferation and regeneration, CDK4/6 dependently. This triggers interleukin
      (IL)-6-associated reparative inflammation, inducing crypt hyper-proliferation,
      wound healing, and CRC. Blocking IL-6 signaling or reactivating mTORC1 reduces
      inflammation-induced CRC, so mTORC1 activation suppresses tumorigenesis in IBD.
      Conversely, mTORC1 inactivation is beneficial in APC loss-dependent CRC. Thus,
      IL-6 blockers or protein-rich-diet-linked mTORC1 activation may prevent
      IBD-associated CRC. However, abolishing mTORC1 can mitigate CRC in predisposed
      patients with APC mutations. Our work reveals mTORC1 oncogenic and
      tumor-suppressive roles in intestinal epithelium and avenues to optimized and
      personalized therapeutic regimens for CRC.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are critical for cancer progression and chemoresistance.
      How lipid metabolism regulates CSCs and chemoresistance remains elusive. Here, we
      demonstrate that JAK/STAT3 regulates lipid metabolism, which promotes breast CSCs
      (BCSCs) and cancer chemoresistance. Inhibiting JAK/STAT3 blocks BCSC self-renewal
      and expression of diverse lipid metabolic genes, including carnitine
      palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B), which encodes the critical enzyme for fatty acid
      beta-oxidation (FAO). Moreover, mammary-adipocyte-derived leptin upregulates
      STAT3-induced CPT1B expression and FAO activity in BCSCs. Human
      breast-cancer-derived data suggest that the STAT3-CPT1B-FAO pathway promotes
      cancer cell stemness and chemoresistance. Blocking FAO and/or leptin
      re-sensitizes them to chemotherapy and inhibits BCSCs in mouse breast tumors in
      vivo. We identify a critical pathway for BCSC maintenance and breast cancer
      chemoresistance.

AB  - Amino acids are known regulators of cellular signaling and physiology, but how
      they are sensed intracellularly is not fully understood. Herein, we report that
      each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) senses its cognate amino acid sufficiency
      through catalyzing the formation of lysine aminoacylation (K-AA) on its specific 
      substrate proteins. At physiologic levels, amino acids promote ARSs bound to
      their substrates and form K-AAs on the varepsilon-amine of lysines in their
      substrates by producing reactive aminoacyl adenylates. The K-AA marks can be
      removed by deacetylases, such as SIRT1 and SIRT3, employing the same mechanism as
      that involved in deacetylation. These dynamically regulated K-AAs transduce
      signals of their respective amino acids. Reversible leucylation on ras-related
      GTP-binding protein A/B regulates activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      complex 1. Glutaminylation on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 suppresses
      apoptosis. We discovered non-canonical functions of ARSs and revealed systematic 
      and functional amino acid sensing and signal transduction networks.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases; thus, 
      understanding its metabolic circuitry is clinically important. Many studies of
      BAT compare rodents mildly cold to those severely cold. Here, we compared BAT
      remodeling between thermoneutral and mild-cold-adapted mice, conditions more
      relevant to humans. Although BAT is renowned for catabolic beta-oxidative
      capacity, we find paradoxically that the anabolic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) genes
      encoding ACLY, ACSS2, ACC, and FASN were among the most upregulated by mild cold 
      and that, in humans, DNL correlates with Ucp1 expression. The regulation and
      function of adipocyte DNL and its association with thermogenesis are not
      understood. We provide evidence suggesting that AKT2 drives DNL in adipocytes by 
      stimulating ChREBPbeta transcriptional activity and that cold induces the
      AKT2-ChREBP pathway in BAT to optimize fuel storage and thermogenesis. These data
      provide insight into adipocyte DNL regulation and function and illustrate the
      metabolic flexibility of thermogenesis.

AB  - Heightened effector function and prolonged persistence, the key attributes of Th1
      and Th17 cells, respectively, are key features of potent anti-tumor T cells.
      Here, we established ex vivo culture conditions to generate hybrid Th1/17 cells, 
      which persisted long-term in vivo while maintaining their effector function.
      Using transcriptomics and metabolic profiling approaches, we showed that the
      enhanced anti-tumor property of Th1/17 cells was dependent on the increased
      NAD(+)-dependent activity of the histone deacetylase Sirt1. Pharmacological or
      genetic inhibition of Sirt1 activity impaired the anti-tumor potential of Th1/17 
      cells. Importantly, T cells with reduced surface expression of the NADase CD38
      exhibited intrinsically higher NAD(+), enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, higher
      glutaminolysis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics that vastly improved tumor
      control. Lastly, blocking CD38 expression improved tumor control even when using 
      Th0 anti-tumor T cells. Thus, strategies targeting the CD38-NAD(+) axis could
      increase the efficacy of anti-tumor adoptive T cell therapy.

AB  - Caloric restriction rapidly reverses type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the mechanism(s) 
      of this reversal are poorly understood. Here we show that 3 days of a
      very-low-calorie diet (VLCD, one-quarter their typical intake) lowered plasma
      glucose and insulin concentrations in a rat model of T2D without altering body
      weight. The lower plasma glucose was associated with a 30% reduction in hepatic
      glucose production resulting from suppression of both gluconeogenesis from
      pyruvate carboxylase (VPC), explained by a reduction in hepatic acetyl-CoA
      content, and net hepatic glycogenolysis. In addition, VLCD resulted in reductions
      in hepatic triglyceride and diacylglycerol content and PKCvarepsilon
      translocation, associated with improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. Taken
      together, these data show that there are pleotropic mechanisms by which VLCD
      reverses hyperglycemia in a rat model of T2D, including reduced
      DAG-PKCvarepsilon-induced hepatic insulin resistance, reduced hepatic
      glycogenolysis, and reduced hepatic acetyl-CoA content, PC flux, and
      gluconeogenesis.

AB  - Central regulation of food intake is a key mechanism contributing to energy
      homeostasis. Many neural circuits that are thought to orchestrate feeding
      behavior overlap with the brain's reward circuitry both anatomically and
      functionally. Manipulation of numerous neural pathways can simultaneously
      influence food intake and reward. Two key systems underlying these
      processes-those controlling homeostatic and hedonic feeding-are often treated as 
      independent. Homeostatic feeding is necessary for basic metabolic processes and
      survival, while hedonic feeding is driven by sensory perception or pleasure.
      Despite this distinction, their functional and anatomical overlap implies
      considerable interaction that is often overlooked. Here, we argue that the
      neurocircuits controlling homeostatic feeding and hedonic feeding are not
      completely dissociable given the current data and urge researchers to assess
      behaviors extending beyond food intake in investigations of the neural control of
      feeding.

AB  - Pancreatic alpha cells retain considerable plasticity and can, under the right
      circumstances, transdifferentiate into functionally mature beta cells. In search 
      of a targetable mechanistic basis, a recent paper suggested that the widely used 
      anti-malaria drug artemether suppresses the alpha cell transcription factor Arx
      to promote transdifferentiation into beta cells. However, key initial experiments
      in this paper were carried out in islet cell lines, and most subsequent
      validation experiments implied transdifferentiation without direct demonstration 
      of alpha to beta cell conversion. Indeed, we find no evidence that artemether
      promotes transdifferentiation of primary alpha cells into beta cells. Moreover,
      artemether reduces Ins2 expression in primary beta cells >100-fold, suppresses
      glucose uptake, and abrogates beta cell calcium responses and insulin secretion
      in response to glucose. Our observations suggest that artemether induces general 
      islet endocrine cell dedifferentiation and call into question the utility of
      artemisinins to promote alpha to beta cell transdifferentiation in treating
      diabetes.

AB  - Menopause results in a progressive decline in 17beta-estradiol (E2) levels,
      increased adiposity, decreased insulin sensitivity, and a higher risk for type 2 
      diabetes. Estrogen therapies can help reverse these effects, but the mechanism(s)
      by which E2 modulates susceptibility to metabolic disease is not well understood.
      In young C57BL/6N mice, short-term ovariectomy decreased-whereas E2 therapy
      restored-mitochondrial respiratory function, cellular redox state (GSH/GSSG), and
      insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. E2 was detected by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry in mitochondrial membranes and varied according 
      to whole-body E2 status independently of ERalpha. Loss of E2 increased
      mitochondrial membrane microviscosity and H2O2 emitting potential, whereas E2
      administration in vivo and in vitro restored membrane E2 content, microviscosity,
      complex I and I + III activities, H2O2 emitting potential, and submaximal OXPHOS 
      responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that E2 directly modulates membrane
      biophysical properties and bioenergetic function in mitochondria, offering a
      direct mechanism by which E2 status broadly influences energy homeostasis.

AB  - The benefits of exercise training for cancer patients are becoming increasingly
      evident. Physical exercise has been shown to reduce cancer incidence and inhibit 
      tumor growth. Here we provide the status of the current molecular understanding
      of the effect of exercise on cancer. We propose that exercise has a role in
      controlling cancer progression through a direct effect on tumor-intrinsic
      factors, interplay with whole-body exercise effects, alleviation of
      cancer-related adverse events, and improvement of anti-cancer treatment efficacy.
      These findings have wide-ranging societal implications, as this understanding may
      lead to changes in cancer treatment strategies.

      Glucose-SGLT1-Sensing Glucoregulatory Pathway.

AB  - The gut microbiota alters energy homeostasis. In parallel, metformin regulates
      upper small intestinal sodium glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1), but whether
      changes of the microbiota or SGLT1-dependent pathways in the upper small
      intestine mediate metformin action is unknown. Here we report that upper small
      intestinal glucose sensing triggers an SGLT1-dependent pathway to lower glucose
      production in rodents. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding reduces glucose sensing and
      SGLT1 expression in the upper small intestine. Upper small intestinal metformin
      treatment restores SGLT1 expression and glucose sensing while shifting the upper 
      small intestinal microbiota partly by increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus. 
      Transplantation of upper small intestinal microbiota from metformin-treated HFD
      rats to the upper small intestine of untreated HFD rats also increases the upper 
      small intestinal abundance of Lactobacillus and glucose sensing via an
      upregulation of SGLT1 expression. Thus, we demonstrate that metformin alters
      upper small intestinal microbiota and impacts a glucose-SGLT1-sensing
      glucoregulatory pathway.

AB  - Diabetes is the result of having inadequate supply of functional
      insulin-producing beta cells. Two possible approaches for replenishing the beta
      cells are: (1) replacement by transplanting cadaveric islets or beta cells
      derived from human embryonic stem cells/induced pluripotent stem cells and (2)
      induction of endogenous regeneration. This review focuses on endogenous
      regeneration, which can follow two pathways: enhanced replication of existing
      beta cells and formation of new beta cells from cells not expressing insulin,
      either by conversion from a differentiated cell type (transdifferentiation) or
      differentiation from progenitors (neogenesis). Exciting progress on both pathways
      suggest that regeneration may have therapeutic promise.

AB  - NAFLD is closely linked with hepatic insulin resistance. Accumulation of hepatic 
      diacylglycerol activates PKC-epsilon, impairing insulin receptor activation and
      insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. Peripheral insulin resistance indirectly
      influences hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by increasing flux of substrates 
      that promote lipogenesis (glucose and fatty acids) and gluconeogenesis (glycerol 
      and fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA, an allosteric activator of pyruvate
      carboxylase). Weight loss with diet or bariatric surgery effectively treats
      NAFLD, but drugs specifically approved for NAFLD are not available. Some new
      pharmacological strategies act broadly to alter energy balance or influence
      pathways that contribute to NAFLD (e.g., agonists for PPAR gamma, PPAR
      alpha/delta, FXR and analogs for FGF-21, and GLP-1). Others specifically inhibit 
      key enzymes involved in lipid synthesis (e.g., mitochondrial pyruvate carrier,
      acetyl-CoA carboxylase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and monoacyl- and
      diacyl-glycerol transferases). Finally, a novel class of liver-targeted
      mitochondrial uncoupling agents increases hepatocellular energy expenditure,
      reversing the metabolic and hepatic complications of NAFLD.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease whose etiology
      involves complex interactions between the immune system and the intestinal
      microbiota. Recent studies by Rouxel et al. (2017) suggest that innate-like
      mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) may link gut integrity, the
      microbiota, and T1D.

AB  - In normal physiology, end-products of metabolism are excreted from the body. In
      tumors, these metabolic wastes accumulate due to deregulated metabolism and
      vascular insufficiency. Spinelli et al. (2017) show that breast cancer cells
      adapt to ammonia buildup by recycling it for amino acid synthesis, which can
      support cancer cell growth.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms and functional significance of pancreatic beta cell
      heterogeneity are an intensive area of investigation. In a recent Cell paper,
      Enge and colleagues (2017) performed single-cell RNA sequencing of human
      pancreatic cells and concluded that with age, pancreatic cells become
      transcriptionally noisy and accumulate somatic mutations.

AB  - Mitochondrial network remodeling between fused and fragmented states facilitates 
      mitophagy, interaction with other organelles, and metabolic flexibility. Aging is
      associated with a loss of mitochondrial network homeostasis, but cellular
      processes causally linking these changes to organismal senescence remain unclear.
      Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and dietary restriction
      (DR) promote longevity in C. elegans via maintaining mitochondrial network
      homeostasis and functional coordination with peroxisomes to increase fatty acid
      oxidation (FAO). Inhibiting fusion or fission specifically blocks AMPK- and
      DR-mediated longevity. Strikingly, however, preserving mitochondrial network
      homeostasis during aging by co-inhibition of fusion and fission is sufficient
      itself to increase lifespan, while dynamic network remodeling is required for
      intermittent fasting-mediated longevity. Finally, we show that increasing
      lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis requires FAO and
      peroxisomal function. Together, these data demonstrate that mechanisms that
      promote mitochondrial homeostasis and plasticity can be targeted to promote
      healthy aging.

AB  - Autophagy failure is associated with metabolic insufficiency. Although caloric
      restriction (CR) extends healthspan, its adherence in humans is poor. We
      established an isocaloric twice-a-day (ITAD) feeding model wherein ITAD-fed mice 
      consume the same food amount as ad libitum controls but at two short windows
      early and late in the diurnal cycle. We hypothesized that ITAD feeding will
      provide two intervals of intermeal fasting per circadian period and induce
      autophagy. We show that ITAD feeding modifies circadian autophagy and
      glucose/lipid metabolism that correlate with feeding-driven changes in
      circulating insulin. ITAD feeding decreases adiposity and, unlike CR, enhances
      muscle mass. ITAD feeding drives energy expenditure, lowers lipid levels,
      suppresses gluconeogenesis, and prevents age/obesity-associated metabolic
      defects. Using liver-, adipose-, myogenic-, and proopiomelanocortin
      neuron-specific autophagy-null mice, we mapped the contribution of
      tissue-specific autophagy to system-wide benefits of ITAD feeding. Our studies
      suggest that consuming two meals a day without CR could prevent the metabolic
      syndrome.

AB  - Mitochondrial fusion and fission are critical to heart health; genetically
      interrupting either is rapidly lethal. To understand whether it is loss of, or
      the imbalance between, fusion and fission that underlies observed cardiac
      phenotypes, we engineered mice in which Mfn-mediated fusion and Drp1-mediated
      fission could be concomitantly abolished. Compared to fusion-defective Mfn1/Mfn2 
      cardiac knockout or fission-defective Drp1 cardiac knockout mice, Mfn1/Mfn2/Drp1 
      cardiac triple-knockout mice survived longer and manifested a unique pathological
      form of cardiac hypertrophy. Over time, however, combined abrogation of fission
      and fusion provoked massive progressive mitochondrial accumulation that severely 
      distorted cardiomyocyte sarcomeric architecture. Mitochondrial biogenesis was not
      responsible for mitochondrial superabundance, whereas mitophagy was suppressed
      despite impaired mitochondrial proteostasis. Similar but milder defects were
      observed in aged hearts. Thus, cardiomyopathies linked to dynamic imbalance
      between fission and fusion are temporarily mitigated by forced mitochondrial
      adynamism at the cost of compromising mitochondrial quantity control and
      accelerating mitochondrial senescence.

      in IDH1/2 Mutant Tumors.

AB  - The oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is a signature biomarker in various 
      cancers, where it accumulates as a result of mutations in isocitrate
      dehydrogenase (IDH). The metabolic source of 2-HG, in a wide variety of cancers, 
      dictates both its generation and also potential therapeutic strategies, but this 
      remains difficult to access in vivo. Here, utilizing patient-derived
      chondrosarcoma cells harboring endogenous mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, we report
      that 2-HG can be rapidly generated from glutamine in vitro. Then, using
      hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI), we demonstrate that in vivo
      HP [1-(13)C] glutamine can be used to non-invasively measure glutamine-derived HP
      2-HG production. This can be readily modulated utilizing a selective IDH1
      inhibitor, opening the door to targeting glutamine-derived 2-HG therapeutically. 
      Rapid rates of HP 2-HG generation in vivo further demonstrate that, in a
      context-dependent manner, glutamine can be a primary carbon source for 2-HG
      production in mutant IDH tumors.

AB  - Breast tumor recurrence and metastasis represent the main causes of
      cancer-related death in women, and treatments are still lacking. Here, we define 
      the lipogenic enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) 1 as a key player in breast
      cancer metastasis. ACC1 phosphorylation was increased in invading cells both in
      murine and human breast cancer, serving as a point of convergence for leptin and 
      transforming growth factor (TGF) beta signaling. ACC1 phosphorylation was
      mediated by TGFbeta-activated kinase (TAK) 1, and ACC1 inhibition was
      indispensable for the elevation of cellular acetyl-CoA, the subsequent increase
      in Smad2 transcription factor acetylation and activation, and ultimately
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis induction. ACC1 deficiency
      worsened tumor recurrence upon primary tumor resection in mice, and ACC1
      phosphorylation levels correlated with metastatic potential in breast and lung
      cancer patients. Given the demonstrated effectiveness of anti-leptin receptor
      antibody treatment in halting ACC1-dependent tumor invasiveness, our work defines
      a "metabolocentric" approach in metastatic breast cancer therapy.

AB  - Tumors undergo nutrient stress and need to reprogram their metabolism to survive.
      The stroma may play a critical role in this process by providing nutrients to
      support the epithelial compartment of the tumor. Here we show that p62 deficiency
      in stromal fibroblasts promotes resistance to glutamine deprivation by the direct
      control of ATF4 stability through its p62-mediated polyubiquitination. ATF4
      upregulation by p62 deficiency in the stroma activates glucose carbon flux
      through a pyruvate carboxylase-asparagine synthase cascade that results in
      asparagine generation as a source of nitrogen for stroma and tumor epithelial
      proliferation. Thus, p62 directly targets nuclear transcription factors to
      control metabolic reprogramming in the microenvironment and repress
      tumorigenesis, and identifies ATF4 as a synthetic vulnerability in p62-deficient 
      tumor stroma.

AB  - Metabolism is a key regulator of cancer biology; however, its role in therapeutic
      resistance has remained largely unresolved. Several new studies disclose that
      mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation at least in part drive
      chemoresistance in cancer and thus have important implications for targeted and
      more effective chemotherapies.

AB  - In Drosophila, neuronal mitochondria that lack OXPHOS generate ROS-protective
      fatty acids and lipid droplets in associated glia. In this issue, Liu et al.
      (2017) demonstrate that neuronal lipid synthesis is driven by the glial lactate
      shuttle. This lipoprotein-dependent deposition of lipids may be at the origin of 
      glial specializations evolving in vertebrates.

AB  - We thought we knew how the heat-producing uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose
      tissue was activated: by fatty acids released upon lipid droplet breakdown in the
      brown adipocytes. However, two studies in this issue (Schreiber et al., 2017;
      Shin et al., 2017) imply that this classical model may not be valid: heat can be 
      produced in brown fat without intracellular lipolysis.

AB  - One of the barriers to revising the literature when new data are produced,
      demonstrating the lack of reproducibility of particular published findings, is
      the stigma associated with the current tools available, most notably the use of
      retractions. We suggest an additional tool: revisions, which could be linked to
      prior manuscripts by the original authors and by others (upon peer review). We
      hope new approaches such as the ability to revise prior reports will help to keep
      the literature up-to-date and representative of the most complete understanding
      of an issue.

AB  - Despite overwhelming basic science linking inflammation to the pathobiology of
      atherothrombosis, the specific clinical evidence indicating cardiovascular
      benefits from anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy has been lacking. The CANTOS
      trial (Ridker et al., 2017a) now provides the first largescale proof of concept
      that inflammasome targeting can reduce cardiovascular events-and, surprisingly,
      lung cancer.

AB  - Metabolic adaptations play a key role in fueling tumor growth. However, less is
      known regarding the metabolic changes that promote cancer progression to
      metastatic disease. Herein, we reveal that breast cancer cells that
      preferentially metastasize to the lung or bone display relatively high expression
      of PGC-1alpha compared with those that metastasize to the liver. PGC-1alpha
      promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and augments lung
      metastasis in vivo. Pro-metastatic capabilities of PGC-1alpha are linked to
      enhanced global bioenergetic capacity, facilitating the ability to cope with
      bioenergetic disruptors like biguanides. Indeed, biguanides fail to mitigate the 
      PGC-1alpha-dependent lung metastatic phenotype and PGC-1alpha confers resistance 
      to stepwise increases in metformin concentration. Overall, our results reveal
      that PGC-1alpha stimulates bioenergetic potential, which promotes breast cancer
      metastasis and facilitates adaptation to metabolic drugs.

AB  - The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that line the gut form a robust line of
      defense against ingested pathogens. We investigated the impact of infection with 
      the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium on mouse IEC metabolism using global
      proteomic and targeted metabolomics and lipidomics. The major signatures of the
      infection were upregulation of the sugar transporter Sglt4, aerobic glycolysis,
      and production of phosphocreatine, which mobilizes cytosolic energy. In contrast,
      biogenesis of mitochondrial cardiolipins, essential for ATP production, was
      inhibited, which coincided with increased levels of mucosal O2 and a reduction in
      colon-associated anaerobic commensals. In addition, IECs responded to infection
      by activating Srebp2 and the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Unexpectedly,
      infected IECs also upregulated the cholesterol efflux proteins AbcA1, AbcG8, and 
      ApoA1, resulting in higher levels of fecal cholesterol and a bloom of
      Proteobacteria. These results suggest that C. rodentium manipulates host
      metabolism to evade innate immune responses and establish a favorable gut
      ecosystem.

AB  - Despite the different physiologic functions of FGF19 and FGF21 as hormonal
      regulators of fed and fasted metabolism, their pharmacologic administration
      causes similar increases in energy expenditure, weight loss, and enhanced insulin
      sensitivity in obese animals. Here, in genetic loss-of-function studies of the
      shared co-receptor beta-Klotho, we show that these pharmacologic effects are
      mediated through a common, tissue-specific pathway. Surprisingly, FGF19 and FGF21
      actions in liver and adipose tissue are not required for their longer-term weight
      loss and glycemic effects. In contrast, beta-Klotho in neurons is essential for
      both FGF19 and FGF21 to cause weight loss and lower glucose and insulin levels.
      We further show an FGF21 mimetic antibody that activates the FGF receptor
      1/beta-Klotho complex also requires neuronal beta-Klotho for its metabolic
      effects. These studies highlight the importance of the nervous system in
      mediating the beneficial weight loss and glycemic effects of endocrine FGF drugs.

AB  - Lipid droplet (LD) lipolysis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is generally
      considered to be required for cold-induced nonshivering thermogenesis. Here, we
      show that mice lacking BAT Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58), a
      lipolytic activator essential for the stimulated LD lipolysis, have normal
      thermogenic capacity and are not cold sensitive. Relative to littermate controls,
      these animals had higher body temperatures when they were provided food during
      cold exposure. The increase in body temperature in the fed, cold-exposed knockout
      mice was associated with increased energy expenditure and with increased
      sympathetic innervation and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Mice lacking 
      CGI-58 in both BAT and WAT were cold sensitive, but only in the fasted state.
      Thus, LD lipolysis in BAT is not essential for cold-induced nonshivering
      thermogenesis in vivo. Rather, CGI-58-dependent LD lipolysis in BAT regulates WAT
      thermogenesis, and our data uncover an essential role of WAT lipolysis in fueling
      thermogenesis during fasting.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) activate and fuel UCP1-mediated non-shivering thermogenesis
      (NST) in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Release of FAs from intracellular fat stores
      by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is considered a key step in NST.
      Accordingly, the severe cold intolerance of global ATGL knockout (AKO) mice has
      been attributed to defective BAT lipolysis. Here we show that this conclusion is 
      incorrect. We demonstrate that although the BAT-specific loss of ATGL impairs BAT
      lipolysis and alters BAT morphology, it does not compromise the beta3-adrenergic 
      thermogenic response or cold-induced NST. Instead, NST depends on nutrient supply
      or lipolysis in white adipose tissue during fasting, suggesting that circulating 
      energy substrates are sufficient to fuel NST. Cold intolerance in AKO mice is not
      caused by BAT dysfunction as previously suspected but by severe cardiomyopathy.
      We conclude that functional NST requires adequate substrate supply and cardiac
      function, but does not depend on ATGL-mediated lipolysis in BAT.

AB  - Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce the formation of lipids in neurons 
      that are transferred to glia, where they form lipid droplets (LDs). We show that 
      glial and neuronal monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), fatty acid transport
      proteins (FATPs), and apolipoproteins are critical for glial LD formation. MCTs
      enable glia to secrete and neurons to absorb lactate, which is converted to
      pyruvate and acetyl-CoA in neurons. Lactate metabolites provide a substrate for
      synthesis of fatty acids, which are processed and transferred to glia by FATP and
      apolipoproteins. In the presence of high ROS, inhibiting lactate transfer or
      lowering FATP or apolipoprotein levels decreases glial LD accumulation in flies
      and in primary mouse glial-neuronal cultures. We show that human APOE can
      substitute for a fly glial apolipoprotein and that APOE4, an Alzheimer's disease 
      susceptibility allele, is impaired in lipid transport and promotes
      neurodegeneration, providing insights into disease mechanisms.

AB  - Over the past years, plenty of evidence has emerged illustrating how metabolism
      supports many aspects of cellular function and how metabolic reprogramming can
      drive cell differentiation and fate. Here, we present a method to assess the
      metabolic configuration of single cells within their native tissue
      microenvironment via the visualization and quantification of multiple enzymatic
      activities measured at saturating substrate conditions combined with subsequent
      cell type identification. After careful validation of the approach and to
      demonstrate its potential, we assessed the intracellular metabolic configuration 
      of different human immune cell populations in healthy and tumor colon tissue.
      Additionally, we analyzed the intercellular metabolic relationship between cancer
      cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in a breast cancer tissue array. This
      study demonstrates that the determination of metabolic configurations in single
      cells could be a powerful complementary tool for every researcher interested to
      study metabolic networks in situ.

TI  - MYC and MCL1 Cooperatively Promote Chemotherapy-Resistant Breast Cancer Stem
      Cells via Regulation of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation.

AB  - Most patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) develop drug
      resistance. MYC and MCL1 are frequently co-amplified in drug-resistant TNBC after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Herein, we demonstrate that MYC and MCL1 cooperate in
      the maintenance of chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) in TNBC. MYC
      and MCL1 increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) and the
      generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), processes involved in maintenance of
      CSCs. A mutant of MCL1 that cannot localize in mitochondria reduced mtOXPHOS, ROS
      levels, and drug-resistant CSCs without affecting the anti-apoptotic function of 
      MCL1. Increased levels of ROS, a by-product of activated mtOXPHOS, led to the
      accumulation of HIF-1alpha. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1alpha attenuated
      CSC enrichment and tumor initiation in vivo. These data suggest that (1) MYC and 
      MCL1 confer resistance to chemotherapy by expanding CSCs via mtOXPHOS and (2)
      targeting mitochondrial respiration and HIF-1alpha may reverse chemotherapy
      resistance in TNBC.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota has been implicated in insulin resistance, although
      evidence regarding causality in humans is scarce. We therefore studied the effect
      of lean donor (allogenic) versus own (autologous) fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) to male recipients with the metabolic syndrome. Whereas we 
      did not observe metabolic changes at 18 weeks after FMT, insulin sensitivity at 6
      weeks after allogenic FMT was significantly improved, accompanied by altered
      microbiota composition. We also observed changes in plasma metabolites such as
      gamma-aminobutyric acid and show that metabolic response upon allogenic FMT
      (defined as improved insulin sensitivity 6 weeks after FMT) is dependent on
      decreased fecal microbial diversity at baseline. In conclusion, the beneficial
      effects of lean donor FMT on glucose metabolism are associated with changes in
      intestinal microbiota and plasma metabolites and can be predicted based on
      baseline fecal microbiota composition.

AB  - The hypothalamus plays a key role in coordinating the physiological changes that 
      underlie mammalian aging. In a recent issue of Nature, Cai and colleagues (2017) 
      shed new light on the mechanism of this effect by providing evidence that
      hypothalamic stem cells may regulate aging through the release of microRNAs in
      exosomes.

AB  - Microglia are the macrophages of the brain and play an important role in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). In Cell, Ulland et al. (2017) recently reported that
      mutations in TREM2, a protein implicated in AD, disrupt microglial energy state
      and function, thus sabotaging the microglia's ability to defend the brain against
      amyloid plaques.

AB  - Chronic inflammation has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of
      diet-induced obesity. However, scarce therapeutic options are available to treat 
      obesity and the associated immunometabolic complications. Glucocorticoids are
      routinely employed for the management of inflammatory diseases, but their
      pleiotropic nature leads to detrimental metabolic side effects. We developed a
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-dexamethasone co-agonist in which GLP-1
      selectively delivers dexamethasone to GLP-1 receptor-expressing cells.
      GLP-1-dexamethasone lowers body weight up to 25% in obese mice by targeting the
      hypothalamic control of feeding and by increasing energy expenditure. This
      strategy reverses hypothalamic and systemic inflammation while improving glucose 
      tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The selective preference for GLP-1 receptor
      bypasses deleterious effects of dexamethasone on glucose handling, bone
      integrity, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Thus, GLP-1-directed
      glucocorticoid pharmacology represents a safe and efficacious therapy option for 
      diet-induced immunometabolic derangements and the resulting obesity.

AB  - Targeted cancer therapies that use genetics are successful, but principles for
      selectively targeting tumor metabolism that is also dependent on the environment 
      remain unknown. We now show that differences in rate-controlling enzymes during
      the Warburg effect (WE), the most prominent hallmark of cancer cell metabolism,
      can be used to predict a response to targeting glucose metabolism. We establish a
      natural product, koningic acid (KA), to be a selective inhibitor of GAPDH, an
      enzyme we characterize to have differential control properties over metabolism
      during the WE. With machine learning and integrated pharmacogenomics and
      metabolomics, we demonstrate that KA efficacy is not determined by the status of 
      individual genes, but by the quantitative extent of the WE, leading to a
      therapeutic window in vivo. Thus, the basis of targeting the WE can be encoded by
      molecular principles that extend beyond the status of individual genes.

TI  - Intermittent Fasting Promotes White Adipose Browning and Decreases Obesity by
      Shaping the Gut Microbiota.

AB  - While activation of beige thermogenesis is a promising approach for treatment of 
      obesity-associated diseases, there are currently no known pharmacological means
      of inducing beiging in humans. Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural
      strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly
      understood. Here, we show that an every-other-day fasting (EODF) regimen
      selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue and
      dramatically ameliorates obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. EODF
      treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to
      elevation of the fermentation products acetate and lactate and to the selective
      upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells.
      Microbiota-depleted mice are resistance to EODF-induced beiging, while
      transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted
      mice activates beiging and improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings provide
      a new gut-microbiota-driven mechanism for activating adipose tissue browning and 
      treating metabolic diseases.

AB  - Efferent signals from the central nervous system represent a key layer of
      regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT). However, the mechanism by which
      efferent neural signals control WAT metabolism remains to be better understood.
      Here, we exploit the volume fluorescence-imaging technique to visualize the
      neural arborizations in mouse inguinal WAT at single-fiber resolution. The
      imaging reveals a dense network of sympathetic arborizations that had been
      previously undetected by conventional methods, with sympathetic fibers being in
      close apposition to > 90% of adipocytes. We demonstrate that these sympathetic
      fibers originate from the celiac ganglia, which are activated by cold challenge. 
      Sympathetic-specific deletion of TrkA receptor or pharmacologic ablation by
      6-hydroxydopamine abolishes these intra-adipose arborizations and, as a result,
      cold-induced beiging of inguinal WAT. Furthermore, we find that local sympathetic
      arborizations function through beta-adrenergic receptors in this beiging process.
      These findings uncover an essential link connecting efferent neural signals with 
      metabolism of individual adipocytes.

AB  - Obesity is a key risk factor for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and
      although we understand the mechanisms regulating weight and energy balance, the
      causes of some forms of obesity remain enigmatic. Despite the well-established
      connections between lymphatics and lipids, and the fact that intestinal lacteals 
      play key roles in dietary fat absorption, the function of the lymphatic
      vasculature in adipose metabolism has only recently been recognized. It is well
      established that angiogenesis is tightly associated with the outgrowth of adipose
      tissue, as expanding adipose tissue requires increased nutrient supply from blood
      vessels. Results supporting a crosstalk between lymphatic vessels and adipose
      tissue, and linking lymphatic function with metabolic diseases, obesity, and
      adipose tissue, also started to accumulate in the last years. Here we review our 
      current knowledge of the mechanisms by which defective lymphatics contribute to
      obesity and fat accumulation in mouse models, as well as our understanding of the
      lymphatic-adipose tissue relationship.

AB  - Diet-induced thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism that limits
      weight gain in response to caloric excess and contributes to the relative
      stability of body weight in most individuals. We previously demonstrated that
      creatine enhances energy expenditure through stimulation of mitochondrial ATP
      turnover, but the physiological role and importance of creatine energetics in
      adipose tissue have not been explored. Here, we have inactivated the first and
      rate-limiting enzyme of creatine biosynthesis, glycine amidinotransferase (GATM),
      selectively in fat (Adipo-Gatm KO). Adipo-Gatm KO mice are prone to diet-induced 
      obesity due to the suppression of elevated energy expenditure that occurs in
      response to high-calorie feeding. This is paralleled by a blunted capacity for
      beta3-adrenergic activation of metabolic rate, which is rescued by dietary
      creatine supplementation. These results provide strong in vivo genetic support
      for a role of GATM and creatine metabolism in energy expenditure, diet-induced
      thermogenesis, and defense against diet-induced obesity.

AB  - The current obesity epidemic has focused a great deal of attention on cellular
      pathways of energy expenditure. While a crucial part of this process is
      diet-induced thermogenesis, the underlying mechanisms have remained unexplained. 
      In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Kazak et al. (2017) describe a new thermogenic 
      pathway in adipocytes that responds to diet overload, involving creatine cycling.
      These data suggest that this pathway might limit weight gain during
      overnutrition.

AB  - The canonical notion that type 1 diabetes (T1D) results following a complete
      destruction of beta cells has recently been questioned as small amounts of
      C-peptide are detectable in patients with long-standing disease. We analyzed
      protein and gene expression levels for proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, and islet 
      amyloid polypeptide within pancreatic tissues from T1D, autoantibody positive
      (Ab+), and control organs. Insulin and C-peptide levels were low to undetectable 
      in extracts from the T1D cohort; however, proinsulin and INS mRNA were detected
      in the majority of T1D pancreata. Interestingly, heterogeneous nuclear RNA
      (hnRNA) for insulin and INS-IGF2, both originating from the INS promoter, were
      essentially undetectable in T1D pancreata, arguing for a silent INS promoter.
      Expression of PCSK1, a convertase responsible for proinsulin processing, was
      reduced in T1D pancreata, supportive of persistent proinsulin. These data
      implicate the existence of beta cells enriched for inefficient insulin/C-peptide 
      production in T1D patients, potentially less susceptible to autoimmune
      destruction.

AB  - Dendritic cell (DC) activation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists causes rapid 
      glycolytic reprogramming that is required to meet the metabolic demands of their 
      immune activation. Recent efforts in the field have identified an important role 
      for extracellular glucose sourcing to support DC activation. However, the
      contributions of intracellular glucose stores to these processes have not been
      well characterized. We demonstrate that DCs possess intracellular glycogen stores
      and that cell-intrinsic glycogen metabolism supports the early effector functions
      of TLR-activated DCs. Inhibition of glycogenolysis significantly attenuates
      TLR-mediated DC maturation and impairs their ability to initiate lymphocyte
      activation. We further report that DCs exhibit functional compartmentalization of
      glucose- and glycogen-derived carbons, where these substrates preferentially
      contribute to distinct metabolic pathways. This work provides novel insights into
      nutrient homeostasis in DCs, demonstrating that differential utilization of
      glycogen and glucose metabolism regulates their optimal immune function.

AB  - Ketogenic diets recapitulate certain metabolic aspects of dietary restriction
      such as reliance on fatty acid metabolism and production of ketone bodies. We
      investigated whether an isoprotein ketogenic diet (KD) might, like dietary
      restriction, affect longevity and healthspan in C57BL/6 male mice. We find that
      Cyclic KD, KD alternated weekly with the Control diet to prevent obesity, reduces
      midlife mortality but does not affect maximum lifespan. A non-ketogenic high-fat 
      diet (HF) fed similarly may have an intermediate effect on mortality. Cyclic KD
      improves memory performance in old age, while modestly improving composite
      healthspan measures. Gene expression analysis identifies downregulation of
      insulin, protein synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis pathways as mechanisms
      common to KD and HF. However, upregulation of PPARalpha target genes is unique to
      KD, consistent across tissues, and preserved in old age. In all, we show that a
      non-obesogenic ketogenic diet improves survival, memory, and healthspan in aging 
      mice.

AB  - Calorie restriction, without malnutrition, has been shown to increase lifespan
      and is associated with a shift away from glycolysis toward beta-oxidation. The
      objective of this study was to mimic this metabolic shift using low-carbohydrate 
      diets and to determine the influence of these diets on longevity and healthspan
      in mice. C57BL/6 mice were assigned to a ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, or control 
      diet at 12 months of age and were either allowed to live their natural lifespan
      or tested for physiological function after 1 or 14 months of dietary
      intervention. The ketogenic diet (KD) significantly increased median lifespan and
      survival compared to controls. In aged mice, only those consuming a KD displayed 
      preservation of physiological function. The KD increased protein acetylation
      levels and regulated mTORC1 signaling in a tissue-dependent manner. This study
      demonstrates that a KD extends longevity and healthspan in mice.

AB  - The circadian clock orchestrates rhythms in physiology and behavior, allowing
      organismal adaptation to daily environmental changes. While food intake
      profoundly influences diurnal rhythms in the liver, how nutritional challenges
      are differentially interpreted by distinct tissue-specific clocks remains poorly 
      explored. Ketogenic diet (KD) is considered to have metabolic and therapeutic
      value, though its impact on circadian homeostasis is virtually unknown. We show
      that KD has profound and differential effects on liver and intestine clocks.
      Specifically, the amplitude of clock-controlled genes and BMAL1 chromatin
      recruitment are drastically altered by KD in the liver, but not in the intestine.
      KD induces nuclear accumulation of PPARalpha in both tissues but with different
      circadian phase. Also, gut and liver clocks respond differently to carbohydrate
      supplementation to KD. Importantly, KD induces serum and intestinal
      beta-hydroxyl-butyrate levels to robustly oscillate in a circadian manner, an
      event coupled to tissue-specific cyclic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and
      histone acetylation.

AB  - Cold-induced thermogenesis is an energy-demanding process that protects
      endotherms against a reduction in ambient temperature. Using non-targeted liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we identified elevated levels 
      of plasma acylcarnitines in response to the cold. We found that the liver
      undergoes a metabolic switch to provide fuel for brown fat thermogenesis by
      producing acylcarnitines. Cold stimulates white adipocytes to release free fatty 
      acids that activate the nuclear receptor HNF4alpha, which is required for
      acylcarnitine production in the liver and adaptive thermogenesis. Once in
      circulation, acylcarnitines are transported to brown adipose tissue, while uptake
      into white adipose tissue and liver is blocked. Finally, a bolus of L-carnitine
      or palmitoylcarnitine rescues the cold sensitivity seen with aging. Our data
      highlight an elegant mechanism whereby white adipose tissue provides long-chain
      fatty acids for hepatic carnitilation to generate plasma acylcarnitines as a fuel
      source for peripheral tissues in mice.

AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with metabolic defects and adipose
      tissue inflammation. Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) control tissue
      homeostasis by counteracting local inflammation. However, if and how T cells
      interlink environmental influences with adipocyte function remains unknown. Here,
      we report that enhancing sympathetic tone by cold exposure, beta3-adrenergic
      receptor (ADRB3) stimulation or a short-term high-calorie diet enhances Treg
      induction in vitro and in vivo. CD4(+) T cell proteomes revealed higher
      expression of Foxp3 regulatory networks in response to cold or ADRB3 stimulation 
      in vivo reflecting Treg induction. Specifically, Ragulator-interacting protein
      C17orf59, which limits mTORC1 activity, was upregulated in CD4(+) T cells by
      either ADRB3 stimulation or cold exposure, suggesting contribution to Treg
      induction. By loss- and gain-of-function studies, including Treg depletion and
      transfers in vivo, we demonstrated that a T cell-specific Stat6/Pten axis links
      cold exposure or ADRB3 stimulation with Foxp3(+) Treg induction and adipose
      tissue function. Our findings offer a new mechanistic model in which
      tissue-specific Tregs maintain adipose tissue function.

AB  - The mechanisms of action of some common medications remain unknown but, in some
      cases, may involve the microorganisms within us. A new study by Wu et al. (2017) 
      provides evidence that the type 2 diabetes drug metformin alters the gut
      microbiota, which in turn may mediate some of the drug's effects.

AB  - Manipulating thermogenesis could increase energy expenditure and improve
      metabolism. Brown fat is a major site of nonshivering thermogenesis, but other
      tissues, notably muscle and liver, can contribute to cold adaptation. In this
      issue, Simcox et al. (2017) demonstrate in cold-exposed mice that liver-generated
      acylcarnitines are required to fuel thermogenesis.

TI  - The FGF21-CCL11 Axis Mediates Beiging of White Adipose Tissues by Coupling
      Sympathetic Nervous System to Type 2 Immunity.

AB  - Type 2 cytokines are important signals triggering biogenesis of thermogenic beige
      adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) during cold acclimation. However, how
      cold activates type 2 immunity in WAT remains obscure. Here we show that
      cold-induced type 2 immune responses and beiging in subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) are 
      abrogated in mice with adipose-selective ablation of FGF21 or its co-receptor
      beta-Klotho, whereas such impairments are reversed by replenishment with
      chemokine CCL11. Mechanistically, FGF21 acts on adipocytes in an autocrine manner
      to promote the expression and secretion of CCL11 via activation of ERK1/2, which 
      drives recruitment of eosinophils into scWAT, leading to increases in
      accumulation of M2 macrophages, and proliferation and commitment of adipocyte
      precursors into beige adipocytes. These FGF21-elicited type 2 immune responses
      and beiging are blocked by CCL11 neutralization. Thus, the adipose-derived
      FGF21-CCL11 axis triggers cold-induced beiging and thermogenesis by coupling
      sympathetic nervous system to activation of type 2 immunity in scWAT.

AB  - Stem cell aging and exhaustion are considered important drivers of organismal
      aging. Age-associated declines in stem cell function are characterized by
      metabolic and epigenetic changes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these
      changes will likely reveal novel therapeutic targets for ameliorating
      age-associated phenotypes and for prolonging human healthspan. Recent studies
      have shown that metabolism plays an important role in regulating epigenetic
      modifications and that this regulation dramatically affects the aging process.
      This review focuses on current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of stem cell
      aging, and the links between cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation. In
      addition, we discuss how these interactions sense and respond to environmental
      stress in order to maintain stem cell homeostasis, and how environmental stimuli 
      regulate stem cell function. Additionally, we highlight recent advances in the
      development of therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate dysfunctional aged stem
      cells.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT)-dependent thermogenesis and its suggested augmenting
      hormone, FGF21, are potential therapeutic targets in current obesity and diabetes
      research. Here, we studied the role of UCP1 and FGF21 for metabolic homeostasis
      in the cold and dissected underlying molecular mechanisms using UCP1-FGF21
      double-knockout mice. We report that neither UCP1 nor FGF21, nor even
      compensatory increases of FGF21 serum levels in UCP1 knockout mice, are required 
      for defense of body temperature or for maintenance of energy metabolism and body 
      weight. Remarkably, cold-induced browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT)
      is FGF21 independent. Global RNA sequencing reveals major changes in response to 
      UCP1- but not FGF21-ablation in BAT, iWAT, and muscle. Markers of mitochondrial
      failure and inflammation are observed in BAT, but in particular the enhanced
      metabolic reprogramming in iWAT supports the thermogenic role of UCP1 and
      excludes an important thermogenic role of endogenous FGF21 in normal cold
      acclimation.

AB  - Mutations of mtDNA cause mitochondrial diseases and are implicated in
      age-associated diseases and aging. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are often present
      in a fraction of all mtDNA copies, and it has been widely debated whether the
      proportion of mutant genomes or the absolute number of wild-type molecules
      determines if oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) will be impaired. Here, we have 
      studied the male infertility phenotype of mtDNA mutator mice and demonstrate that
      decreasing mtDNA copy number worsens mitochondrial aberrations of spermatocytes
      and spermatids in testes, whereas an increase in mtDNA copy number rescues the
      fertility phenotype and normalizes testes morphology as well as spermatocyte
      proteome changes. The restoration of testes function occurs in spite of unaltered
      total mtDNA mutation load. We thus demonstrate that increased copy number of
      mtDNA can efficiently ameliorate a severe disease phenotype caused by mtDNA
      mutations, which has important implications for developing future strategies for 
      treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction elicits various stress responses in different model
      systems, but how these responses relate to each other and contribute to
      mitochondrial disease has remained unclear. Mitochondrial myopathy (MM) is the
      most common manifestation of adult-onset mitochondrial disease and shows a
      multifaceted tissue-specific stress response: (1) transcriptional response,
      including metabolic cytokines FGF21 and GDF15; (2) remodeling of one-carbon
      metabolism; and (3) mitochondrial unfolded protein response. We show that these
      processes are part of one integrated mitochondrial stress response (ISRmt), which
      is controlled by mTORC1 in muscle. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin downregulated
      all components of ISRmt, improved all MM hallmarks, and reversed the progression 
      of even late-stage MM, without inducing mitochondrial biogenesis. Our evidence

AB  - Triglyceride (TG) storage in adipose tissue provides the major reservoir for
      metabolic energy in mammals. During lipolysis, fatty acids (FAs) are hydrolyzed
      from adipocyte TG stores and transported to other tissues for fuel. For unclear
      reasons, a large portion of hydrolyzed FAs in adipocytes is re-esterified to TGs 
      in a "futile," ATP-consuming, energy dissipating cycle. Here we show that FA
      re-esterification during adipocyte lipolysis is mediated by DGAT1, an
      ER-localized DGAT enzyme. Surprisingly, this re-esterification cycle does not
      preserve TG mass but instead functions to protect the ER from lipotoxic stress
      and related consequences, such as adipose tissue inflammation. Our data reveal an
      important role for DGAT activity and TG synthesis generally in averting ER stress
      and lipotoxicity, with specifically DGAT1 performing this function during
      stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes.

AB  - Inhibiting lipogenesis prevents hepatic steatosis in rodents with insulin
      resistance. To determine if reducing lipogenesis functions similarly in humans,
      we developed MK-4074, a liver-specific inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1)
      and (ACC2), enzymes that produce malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. MK-4074
      administered to subjects with hepatic steatosis for 1 month lowered lipogenesis, 
      increased ketones, and reduced liver triglycerides by 36%. Unexpectedly, MK-4074 
      increased plasma triglycerides by 200%. To further investigate, mice that lack
      ACC1 and ACC2 in hepatocytes (ACC dLKO) were generated. Deletion of ACCs
      decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) concentrations in liver due to
      reduced malonyl-CoA, which is required for elongation of essential fatty acids.
      PUFA deficiency induced SREBP-1c, which increased GPAT1 expression and VLDL
      secretion. PUFA supplementation or siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPAT1 normalized
      plasma triglycerides. Thus, inhibiting lipogenesis in humans reduced hepatic
      steatosis, but inhibiting ACC resulted in hypertriglyceridemia due to activation 
      of SREBP-1c and increased VLDL secretion.

AB  - Beige adipocytes can interconvert between white and brown-like states and switch 
      between energy storage versus expenditure. Here we report that beige adipocyte
      plasticity is important for feeding-associated changes in energy expenditure and 
      is coordinated by the hypothalamus and the phosphatase TCPTP. A fasting-induced
      and glucocorticoid-mediated induction of TCPTP, inhibited insulin signaling in
      AgRP/NPY neurons, repressed the browning of white fat and decreased energy
      expenditure. Conversely feeding reduced hypothalamic TCPTP, to increase AgRP/NPY 
      neuronal insulin signaling, white adipose tissue browning and energy expenditure.
      The feeding-induced repression of hypothalamic TCPTP was defective in obesity.
      Mice lacking TCPTP in AgRP/NPY neurons were resistant to diet-induced obesity and
      had increased beige fat activity and energy expenditure. The deletion of
      hypothalamic TCPTP in obesity restored feeding-induced browning and increased
      energy expenditure to promote weight loss. Our studies define a hypothalamic
      switch that coordinates energy expenditure with feeding for the maintenance of
      energy balance.

AB  - Proper brain function requires a substantial energy supply, up to 20% of
      whole-body energy in humans, and brain activation produces large dynamic
      variations in energy demand. While local increases in cerebral blood flow are
      well known, the cellular responses to energy demand are controversial. During
      brain excitation, glycolysis of glucose to lactate temporarily exceeds the rate
      of mitochondrial fuel oxidation; although the increased energy demand occurs
      mainly within neurons, some have suggested this glycolysis occurs mainly in
      astrocytes, which then shuttle lactate to neurons as their primary fuel. Using
      metabolic biosensors in acute hippocampal slices and brains of awake mice, we
      find that neuronal metabolic responses to stimulation do not depend on astrocytic
      stimulation by glutamate release, nor do they require neuronal uptake of lactate;
      instead they reflect increased direct glucose consumption by neurons. Neuronal
      glycolysis temporarily outstrips oxidative metabolism, and provides a rapid
      response to increased energy demand.

AB  - The normal aging human brain experiences global decreases in metabolism, but
      whether this affects the topography of brain metabolism is unknown. Here we
      describe PET-based measurements of brain glucose uptake, oxygen utilization, and 
      blood flow in cognitively normal adults from 20 to 82 years of age. Age-related
      decreases in brain glucose uptake exceed that of oxygen use, resulting in loss of
      brain aerobic glycolysis (AG). Whereas the topographies of total brain glucose
      uptake, oxygen utilization, and blood flow remain largely stable with age, brain 
      AG topography changes significantly. Brain regions with high AG in young adults
      show the greatest change, as do regions with prolonged developmental
      transcriptional features (i.e., neoteny). The normal aging human brain thus
      undergoes characteristic metabolic changes, largely driven by global loss and
      topographic changes in brain AG.

AB  - Unimolecular dual incretins derived from hybridized glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) sequences have
      demonstrated synergistic reduction of adiposity in animal models and reductions
      of hyperglycemia in short-duration human trials. Here, we extend the
      characterization of NNC0090-2746 (also known as RG7697), a fatty-acylated dual
      agonist possessing in vitro balanced GIPR and GLP-1R agonism. In this 12-week,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2a trial, patients with type 2
      diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin received 1.8 mg of NNC0090-2746
      or placebo subcutaneously once daily. Liraglutide 1.8 mg (Victoza), starting with
      2-week dose escalation, was administered subcutaneously once daily as an
      open-label reference arm. Measurements were collected at regular intervals after 
      randomization. NNC0090-2746 significantly improved glycemic control and reduced
      body weight compared with placebo. Total cholesterol, alone among a range of
      lipid parameters, and leptin were both significantly reduced compared with
      placebo. Treatment with NNC0090-2746 was generally safe and well tolerated.

AB  - With the identification of ChREBP in 2001, our interest in understanding the
      molecular control of carbohydrate sensing has surged. While ChREBP was initially 
      studied as a master regulator of lipogenesis in liver and fat tissue, it is now
      clear that ChREBP functions as a central metabolic coordinator in a variety of
      cell types in response to environmental and hormonal signals, with wide
      implications in health and disease. Celebrating its sweet sixteenth birthday, we 
      review here the current knowledge about the function and regulation of ChREBP
      throughout usual and less explored tissues, to recapitulate ChREBP's role as a
      whole-body glucose sensor.

AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of
      cell growth that responds to a diverse set of environmental inputs, including
      amino acids. Over the past 10 years, a number of proteins have been identified
      that help transmit amino acid availability to mTORC1. However, amino acid sensors
      for this pathway have only recently been discovered. Here, we review these recent
      advances and highlight the variety of unexplored questions that emerge from the
      identification of these sensors.

AB  - A BMI in the normal range associates with a decreased risk of cardiometabolic
      disease and all-cause mortality. However, not all subjects in this BMI range have
      this low risk. Compared to people who are of normal weight and metabolically
      healthy, subjects who are of normal weight but metabolically unhealthy (
      approximately 20% of the normal weight adult population) have a greater than
      3-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality and/or cardiovascular events. Here we
      address to what extent major risk phenotypes determine metabolic health in lean
      compared to overweight and obese people and provide support for the existence of 
      a lipodystrophy-like phenotype in the general population. Furthermore, we
      highlight the molecular mechanisms that induce this phenotype. Finally, we
      propose strategies as to how this knowledge could be implemented in the
      prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases in different stages of
      adiposity in routine clinical practice.

AB  - The rise of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hallmark of menopause
      associated with osteoporosis and visceral adiposity. In Nature, Zaidi and
      colleagues (Liu et al., 2017) report that blocking FSH action reduces body fat by
      promoting brown/beige fat thermogenesis, potentially providing a new intervention
      for the treatment of menopause-related metabolic diseases.

AB  - Despite widespread consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs), the impact of 
      manipulating the perceived sweetness of food is unclear. Previously we reported
      that chronic consumption of the NNSs sucralose or L-glucose led to increased
      calories consumed post-exposure; however, a recent study suggested this effect
      occurs because NNSs acutely suppress food intake, leading to a caloric debt. Here
      we show that acute ingestion of sucralose in the context of a low-carbohydrate
      diet causes a pronounced increase in calories consumed. Moreover, neither
      sucralose nor L-glucose had a lasting effect on food intake during chronic
      exposure; however, both NNSs enhance food intake post-exposure. Together these
      data confirm that sucralose and L-glucose promote food intake under a variety of 
      experimental conditions.

AB  - Maintenance and modification of the cellular proteome are at the core of normal
      cellular physiology. Although insulin is well known for its control of glucose
      homeostasis, its critical role in maintaining proteome homeostasis (proteostasis)
      is less appreciated. Insulin signaling regulates protein synthesis and
      degradation as well as posttranslational modifications at the tissue level and
      coordinates proteostasis at the organism level. Here, we review regulation of
      proteostasis by insulin in postabsorptive, postprandial, and diabetic states. We 
      present the effects of insulin on amino acid flux in skeletal muscle and
      splanchnic tissues, the regulation of protein quality control, and turnover of
      mitochondrial protein pools in humans. We also review the current evidence for
      the mechanistic control of proteostasis by insulin and insulin-like growth factor
      1 receptors based on preclinical studies. Finally, we discuss irreversible
      posttranslational modifications of the proteome in diabetes and how future
      investigations will provide new insights into mechanisms of diabetic
      complications.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy is an increasingly successful strategy for the treatment of 
      patients who have advanced or conventional therapy-resistant cancers. T cells are
      key mediators of tumor destruction and their specificity for tumor-expressed
      antigens is of paramount importance, but other T cell-intrinsic qualities, such
      as durability, longevity, and functionality also play important roles in
      determining the efficacy of immunotherapy. The cellular energetic pathways that
      are utilized by T cells play a key role in regulating each of these qualities.
      Metabolic activity, which both regulates and is regulated by cellular signaling
      pathways and epigenetics, also profoundly influences the trajectories of T cell
      differentiation and fate. In this Review, we discuss how cell metabolism
      influences T cell anti-tumor activity, the metabolic qualities of
      highly-functional T cells, and strategies to modulate metabolism for improving
      the immune response to tumors.

AB  - Diet can alter the gut microbiota and shift its production of metabolites, which 
      affect systemic immune function. In Nature Immunology, Marino et al. (2017)
      explore diet-gut microbiome interactions in type 1 diabetes and identify
      mechanisms by which short-chain fatty acids prevent T cell destruction of
      pancreatic beta-cells.

AB  - Inflammasomes are protein complexes formed upon encounter of microbial or
      damage-associated stimuli. The main output of inflammasome assembly is activation
      of caspase-1, a protease involved in both pro-inflammatory and host-protective
      responses. Defined bacterial or viral ligands have been identified for the
      inflammasome-forming receptors AIM2, NLRP1, and NLRC4. The signals activating
      other inflammasomes, NLRP3, NLRP6, and pyrin, are less well understood. Recent
      studies implicated several low-molecular-weight compounds traditionally linked to
      metabolism, not immunity, in modulation of inflammasome signaling. Furthermore,
      genetic, pharmacological, or pathogen-mediated interference with energy
      metabolism also affects inflammasome activation. Here we review the findings on
      how microbial- and host-derived metabolites regulate activation of the NLRP3 and 
      NLRP6 inflammasomes. We discuss the different models of how glycolysis and
      mitochondrial metabolism control the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, we summarize
      the findings on metabolic control of pyrin and point to open questions to be
      addressed to broaden our understanding of metabolism-inflammasome interactions.

AB  - It has been appreciated for nearly 100 years that cancer cells are metabolically 
      distinct from resting tissues. More recently understood is that this metabolic
      phenotype is not unique to cancer cells but instead reflects characteristics of
      proliferating cells. Similar metabolic transitions also occur in the immune
      system as cells transition from resting state to stimulated effectors. A key
      finding in immune metabolism is that the metabolic programs of different cell
      subsets are distinctly associated with immunological function. Further,
      interruption of those metabolic pathways can shift immune cell fate to modulate
      immunity. These studies have identified numerous metabolic similarities between
      cancer and immune cells but also critical differences that may be exploited and
      that affect treatment of cancer and immunological diseases.

AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan in mammals, yet the mechanisms
      underlying its beneficial effects remain unknown. The manner in which CR has been
      implemented in longevity experiments is variable, with both timing and frequency 
      of meals constrained by work schedules. It is commonplace to find that nocturnal 
      rodents are fed during the daytime and meals are spaced out, introducing
      prolonged fasting intervals. Since implementation of feeding paradigms over the
      lifetime is logistically difficult, automation is critical, but existing systems 
      are expensive and not amenable to scale. We have developed a system that controls
      duration, amount, and timing of food availability and records feeding and
      voluntary wheel-running activity in mice. Using this system, mice were exposed to
      temporal or caloric restriction protocols. Mice under CR self-imposed a temporal 
      component by consolidating food intake and unexpectedly increasing wheel-running 
      activity during the rest phase, revealing previously unrecognized relationships
      among feeding, metabolism, and behavior.

AB  - Glycogenin is considered essential for glycogen synthesis, as it acts as a primer
      for the initiation of the polysaccharide chain. Against expectations,
      glycogenin-deficient mice (Gyg KO) accumulate high amounts of glycogen in
      striated muscle. Furthermore, this glycogen contains no covalently bound protein,
      thereby demonstrating that a protein primer is not strictly necessary for the
      synthesis of the polysaccharide in vivo. Strikingly, in spite of the higher
      glycogen content, Gyg KO mice showed lower resting energy expenditure and less
      resistance than control animals when subjected to endurance exercise. These
      observations can be attributed to a switch of oxidative myofibers toward
      glycolytic metabolism. Mice overexpressing glycogen synthase in the muscle showed
      similar alterations, thus indicating that this switch is caused by the excess of 
      glycogen. These results may explain the muscular defects of GSD XV patients, who 
      lack glycogenin-1 and show high glycogen accumulation in muscle.

AB  - Cellular metabolite balance and mitochondrial function are under circadian
      control, but the pathways connecting the molecular clock to these functions are
      unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) enables
      preferential utilization of lipids as fuel during exercise and is a major driver 
      of exercise endurance. We show here that the circadian repressors CRY1 and CRY2
      function as co-repressors for PPARdelta. Cry1(-/-);Cry2(-/-) myotubes and muscles
      exhibit elevated expression of PPARdelta target genes, particularly in the
      context of exercise. Notably, CRY1/2 seem to repress a distinct subset of
      PPARdelta target genes in muscle compared to the co-repressor NCOR1. In vivo,
      genetic disruption of Cry1 and Cry2 enhances sprint exercise performance in mice.
      Collectively, our data demonstrate that CRY1 and CRY2 modulate exercise
      physiology by altering the activity of several transcription factors, including
      CLOCK/BMAL1 and PPARdelta, and thereby alter energy storage and substrate
      selection for energy production.

AB  - Autophagy is crucial for neuronal integrity. Loss of key autophagic components
      leads to progressive neurodegeneration and structural defects in pre- and
      postsynaptic morphologies. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating autophagy
      in the brain remain elusive. Similarly, while it is widely accepted that protein 
      turnover is required for synaptic plasticity, the contribution of autophagy to
      the degradation of synaptic proteins is unknown. Here, we report that BDNF
      signaling via the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and the
      phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway suppresses autophagy in vivo.
      In addition, we demonstrate that suppression of autophagy is required for
      BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity and for memory enhancement under conditions of
      nutritional stress. Finally, we identify three key remodelers of postsynaptic
      densities as cargo of autophagy. Our results establish autophagy as a pivotal
      component of BDNF signaling, which is essential for BDNF-induced synaptic
      plasticity. This molecular mechanism underlies behavioral adaptations that
      increase fitness in times of scarcity.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs) act in the brain to modulate energy balance. We show that 
      central triiodothyronine (T3) regulates de novo lipogenesis in liver and lipid
      oxidation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) through the parasympathetic (PSNS) and
      sympathetic nervous system (SNS), respectively. Central T3 promotes hepatic
      lipogenesis with parallel stimulation of the thermogenic program in BAT. The
      action of T3 depends on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-induced regulation of
      two signaling pathways in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH):
      decreased ceramide-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which promotes BAT 
      thermogenesis, and increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which
      controls hepatic lipid metabolism. Of note, ablation of AMPKalpha1 in
      steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons of the VMH fully recapitulated the effect of
      central T3, pointing to this population in mediating the effect of central THs on
      metabolism. Overall, these findings uncover the underlying pathways through which
      central T3 modulates peripheral metabolism.

AB  - Olfactory inputs help coordinate food appreciation and selection, but their role 
      in systemic physiology and energy balance is poorly understood. Here we
      demonstrate that mice upon conditional ablation of mature olfactory sensory
      neurons (OSNs) are resistant to diet-induced obesity accompanied by increased
      thermogenesis in brown and inguinal fat depots. Acute loss of smell perception
      after obesity onset not only abrogated further weight gain but also improved fat 
      mass and insulin resistance. Reduced olfactory input stimulates sympathetic nerve
      activity, resulting in activation of beta-adrenergic receptors on white and brown
      adipocytes to promote lipolysis. Conversely, conditional ablation of the IGF1
      receptor in OSNs enhances olfactory performance in mice and leads to increased
      adiposity and insulin resistance. These findings unravel a new bidirectional
      function for the olfactory system in controlling energy homeostasis in response
      to sensory and hormonal signals.

TI  - Microglial Inflammatory Signaling Orchestrates the Hypothalamic Immune Response
      to Dietary Excess and Mediates Obesity Susceptibility.

AB  - Dietary excess triggers accumulation of pro-inflammatory microglia in the
      mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), but the components of this microgliosis and its
      metabolic consequences remain uncertain. Here, we show that microglial
      inflammatory signaling determines the immunologic response of the MBH to dietary 
      excess and regulates hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis in mice. Either
      pharmacologically depleting microglia or selectively restraining microglial
      NF-kappaB-dependent signaling sharply reduced microgliosis, an effect that
      includes prevention of MBH entry by bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells, and
      greatly limited diet-induced hyperphagia and weight gain. Conversely, forcing
      microglial activation through cell-specific deletion of the negative NF-kappaB
      regulator A20 induced spontaneous MBH microgliosis and cellular infiltration,
      reduced energy expenditure, and increased both food intake and weight gain even
      in absence of a dietary challenge. Thus, microglial inflammatory activation,
      stimulated by dietary excess, orchestrates a multicellular hypothalamic response 
      that mediates obesity susceptibility, providing a mechanistic rationale for
      non-neuronal approaches to treat metabolic diseases.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the development of obesity-associated
      insulin resistance. We demonstrate that in mice obesity promotes expansion of a
      distinct, interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R)a-expressing NK subpopulation, which also 
      expresses a number of other myeloid lineage genes such as the colony-stimulating 
      factor 1 receptor (Csf1r). Selective ablation of this Csf1r-expressing NK cell
      population prevents obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, conditional
      inactivation of IL6Ra or Stat3 in NK cells limits obesity-associated formation of
      these myeloid signature NK cells, protecting from obesity, insulin resistance,
      and obesity-associated inflammation. Also in humans IL6Ra(+) NK cells increase in
      obesity and correlate with markers of systemic low-grade inflammation, and their 
      gene expression profile overlaps with characteristic gene sets of NK cells in
      obese mice. Collectively, we demonstrate that obesity-associated inflammation and
      metabolic disturbances depend on interleukin-6/Stat3-dependent formation of a
      distinct NK population, which may provide a target for the treatment of obesity, 
      metaflammation-associated pathologies, and diabetes.

AB  - Elevated plasma glucose leads to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and death in
      type 2 diabetes. Glycogen accumulation, due to impaired metabolism, contributes
      to this "glucotoxicity" via dysregulated biochemical pathways promoting beta cell
      dysfunction. Here, we review emerging data, and re-examine published findings, on
      the role of glycogen in beta cells in normoglycemia and in diabetes.

TI  - Inhibition of IKKvarepsilon and TBK1 Improves Glucose Control in a Subset of
      Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.

AB  - Numerous studies indicate an inflammatory link between obesity and type 2
      diabetes. The inflammatory kinases IKKvarepsilon and TBK1 are elevated in
      obesity; their inhibition in obese mice reduces weight, insulin resistance, fatty
      liver and inflammation. Here we studied amlexanox, an inhibitor of IKKvarepsilon 
      and TBK1, in a proof-of-concept randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study of 42 obese patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease. Treatment of patients with amlexanox produced a statistically
      significant reduction in Hemoglobin A1c and fructosamine. Interestingly, a subset
      of drug responders also exhibited improvements in insulin sensitivity and hepatic
      steatosis. This subgroup was characterized by a distinct inflammatory gene
      expression signature from biopsied subcutaneous fat at baseline. They also
      exhibited a unique pattern of gene expression changes in response to amlexanox,
      consistent with increased energy expenditure. Together, these data suggest that
      dual-specificity inhibitors of IKKvarepsilon and TBK1 may be effective therapies 
      for metabolic disease in an identifiable subset of patients.

AB  - Renewed interest in immune cell metabolism has led to the emergence of a research
      field aimed at studying the importance of metabolic processes for an effective
      immune response. In addition to the adaptive immune system, cells of the myeloid 
      lineage have been shown to undergo robust metabolic changes upon activation.
      Whereas the specific metabolic requirements of myeloid cells after
      lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 stimulation have been extensively studied, recent
      evidence suggested that this model does not represent a metabolic blueprint for
      activated myeloid cells. Instead, different microbial stimuli, pathogens, or
      tissue microenvironments lead to specific and complex metabolic rewiring of
      myeloid cells. Here we present an overview of the metabolic heterogeneity in
      activated myeloid cells during health and disease. Directions for future research
      are suggested to ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities. The uniqueness
      of metabolic signatures accompanying different conditions will require
      tailor-made interventions to ultimately modulate aberrant myeloid cell activation
      during disease.

AB  - Fischer et al. (2017) recently reported that interleukin-4 (IL-4) does not
      increase adipose thermogenesis and that activated macrophages do not synthesize
      catecholamines. These findings are unexpected because IL-4 activation of
      macrophages has been proposed to have a pivotal role in cold-induced
      thermogenesis by stimulating macrophage catecholamine production to recruit
      thermogenic beige or brite fat.

AB  - Immune cell function and fate are intimately linked to engagement of metabolic
      pathways. The contribution of core metabolic pathways to immune cell
      bioenergetics has been vigorously investigated in recent years. However,
      precisely how other peripheral metabolic pathways support immune cells beyond
      energy generation is less well understood. Here we survey the literature and
      highlight recent advances in our understanding of several ancillary metabolic
      pathways and how they support processes beyond ATP production and ultimately
      contribute to protective immunity.

      autoglucosylation of glycogenin, a core protein in glycogen particles. In this
      edition of Cell Metabolism, Testoni et al. (2017) challenge this generally

      an increased amount of glycogen and not glycogen depletion.

      disease are unclear. A new study by Valdearcos et al. (2017) describes how
      sensing of high-fat diet by microglia, brain's resident innate immune cells,
      recruits additional bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells into the hypothalamus to
      produce inflammation and cause weight gain.

AB  - Cancer and stem cells appear to share a common metabolic profile that is
      characterized by high utilization of glucose through aerobic glycolysis. In the
      presence of sufficient nutrients, this metabolic strategy provides sufficient
      cellular ATP while additionally providing important metabolites necessary for the
      biosynthetic demands of continuous cell proliferation. Recent studies indicate
      that this metabolic profile is dependent on genes that regulate the fusion and
      fission of mitochondria. High levels of mitochondrial fission activity are
      associated with high proliferation and invasiveness in some cancer cells and with
      self-renewal and resistance to differentiation in some stem cells. These
      observations reveal new ways in which mitochondria regulate cell physiology,
      through their effects on metabolism and cell signaling.

AB  - The discovery of the obese gene and the demonstration that its encoded protein
      leptin can reverse obesity due to genetic deficiency of the hormone were landmark
      discoveries in endocrinology and metabolism. Regarding leptin's role in
      physiology, it is now established that falling leptin levels are a key signal of 
      the starved state in mice and humans. Repleting leptin reverses the starvation
      signal both in physiologic starvation and in obesity resulting from genetic
      leptin deficiency. Since its discovery, it has also been hypothesized that rising
      leptin levels caused by overfeeding provide a physiologic signal that
      orchestrates resistance to obesity. Although still widely believed, and possibly 
      true in some circumstances, this aspect of leptin physiology has not been
      experimentally demonstrated. It will be important to determine whether leptin or 
      as yet undiscovered factors are responsible for the well-documented capacity for 
      physiologic resistance to overfeeding.

AB  - High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) can inhibit inflammatory cytokine expression on 
      innate immune cells, but sometimes they promote cytokine production as suggested 
      in a recent article in Cell Metabolism by van der Vorst et al. (2017). Kopecky et
      al. point out that the origin, handling, and storage conditions of HDL
      preparations dictate their functional properties and can specifically affect
      immune cells to evoke a pro-inflammatory response.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is populated by a diverse, highly mutualistic
      microbial flora, which is known as the microbiome. Disruptions to the microbiome 
      have been shown to be associated with severe pathologies of the host, including
      metabolic disease, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Mood and behavior are 
      also susceptible to alterations in the gut microbiota. A particularly striking
      example of the symbiotic effects of the microbiome is the immune system, whose
      cells depend critically on a diverse array of microbial metabolites for normal
      development and behavior. This includes metabolites that are produced by bacteria
      from dietary components, metabolites that are produced by the host and
      biochemically modified by gut bacteria, and metabolites that are synthesized de
      novo by gut microbes. In this review, we highlight the role of the intestinal
      microbiome in human metabolic and inflammatory diseases and focus in particular
      on the molecular mechanisms that govern the gut-immune axis.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) is selectively expressed in the human
      kidney, where it executes reabsorption of filtered glucose with a high capacity; 
      it may be overactive in patients with diabetes, especially in the early,
      hyperfiltering stage of the disease. As a therapeutic target, SGLT2 has been
      successfully engaged by orally active, selective agents. Initially developed as
      antihyperglycemic drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors have deployed a range of in vivo
      actions. Consequences of their primary effect, i.e., profuse glycosuria and
      natriuresis, involve hemodynamic (plasma volume and blood pressure reduction) and
      metabolic pathways (increase in lipid oxidation and ketogenesis at the expense of
      carbohydrate utilization); the hormonal mediation extends to insulin, glucagon,
      and gastrointestinal peptides. Their initial trial in high-risk patients with
      diabetes has provided evidence for marked reduction of cardiovascular risk. This 
      review focuses on the quantitative pharmacology of SGLT2 inhibitors, which can be
      exploited to discover new physiology, in the heart, kidney, and brain.

TI  - Mitochondrial Dynamics Mediated by Mitofusin 1 Is Required for POMC Neuron
      Glucose-Sensing and Insulin Release Control.

AB  - Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are critical sensors of nutrient availability 
      implicated in energy balance and glucose metabolism control. However, the precise
      mechanisms underlying nutrient sensing in POMC neurons remain incompletely
      understood. We show that mitochondrial dynamics mediated by Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) in
      POMC neurons couple nutrient sensing with systemic glucose metabolism. Mice
      lacking MFN1 in POMC neurons exhibited defective mitochondrial architecture
      remodeling and attenuated hypothalamic gene expression programs during the
      fast-to-fed transition. This loss of mitochondrial flexibility in POMC neurons
      bidirectionally altered glucose sensing, causing abnormal glucose homeostasis due
      to defective insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Fed mice lacking MFN1 in
      POMC neurons displayed enhanced hypothalamic mitochondrial oxygen flux and
      reactive oxygen species generation. Central delivery of antioxidants was able to 
      normalize the phenotype. Collectively, our data posit MFN1-mediated mitochondrial
      dynamics in POMC neurons as an intrinsic nutrient-sensing mechanism and unveil an
      unrecognized link between this subset of neurons and insulin release.

AB  - Decreasing glucagon action lowers the blood glucose and may be useful
      therapeutically for diabetes. However, interrupted glucagon signaling leads to
      alpha cell proliferation. To identify postulated hepatic-derived circulating
      factor(s) responsible for alpha cell proliferation, we used
      transcriptomics/proteomics/metabolomics in three models of interrupted glucagon
      signaling and found that proliferation of mouse, zebrafish, and human alpha cells
      was mTOR and FoxP transcription factor dependent. Changes in hepatic amino acid
      (AA) catabolism gene expression predicted the observed increase in circulating
      AAs. Mimicking these AA levels stimulated alpha cell proliferation in a newly
      developed in vitro assay with L-glutamine being a critical AA. alpha cell
      expression of the AA transporter Slc38a5 was markedly increased in mice with
      interrupted glucagon signaling and played a role in alpha cell proliferation.
      These results indicate a hepatic alpha islet cell axis where glucagon regulates
      serum AA availability and AAs, especially L-glutamine, regulate alpha cell
      proliferation and mass via mTOR-dependent nutrient sensing.

AB  - Glucagon supports glucose homeostasis by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, in 
      part by promoting the uptake and conversion of amino acids into gluconeogenic
      precursors. Genetic disruption or pharmacologic inhibition of glucagon signaling 
      results in elevated plasma amino acids and compensatory glucagon hypersecretion
      involving expansion of pancreatic alpha cell mass. Recent findings indicate that 
      hyperaminoacidemia triggers pancreatic alpha cell proliferation via an
      mTOR-dependent pathway. We confirm and extend these findings by demonstrating
      that glucagon pathway blockade selectively increases expression of the
      sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter Slc38a5 in a subset of highly
      proliferative alpha cells and that Slc38a5 controls the pancreatic response to
      glucagon pathway blockade; most notably, mice deficient in Slc38a5 exhibit
      markedly decreased alpha cell hyperplasia to glucagon pathway blockade-induced
      hyperaminoacidemia. These results show that Slc38a5 is a key component of the
      feedback circuit between glucagon receptor signaling in the liver and
      amino-acid-dependent regulation of pancreatic alpha cell mass in mice.

TI  - N-acyl Taurines and Acylcarnitines Cause an Imbalance in Insulin Synthesis and

AB  - The processes contributing to beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D) are 
      uncertain, largely because it is difficult to access beta cells in their intact
      immediate environment. We examined the pathophysiology of beta cells under T2D
      progression directly in pancreatic tissues. We used MALDI imaging of Langerhans
      islets (LHIs) within mouse tissues or from human tissues to generate in
      situ-omics data, which we supported with in vitro experiments. Molecular
      interaction networks provided information on functional pathways and molecules.
      We found that stearoylcarnitine accumulated in beta cells, leading to arrest of
      insulin synthesis and energy deficiency via excessive beta-oxidation and
      depletion of TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation metabolites. Acetylcarnitine
      and an accumulation of N-acyl taurines, a group not previously detected in beta
      cells, provoked insulin secretion. Thus, beta cell dysfunction results from
      enhanced insulin secretion combined with an arrest of insulin synthesis.

AB  - Decreased growth hormone (GH) and thyroid hormone (TH) signaling are associated
      with longevity and metabolic fitness. The mechanisms underlying these benefits
      are poorly understood, but may overlap with those of dietary restriction (DR),
      which imparts similar benefits. Recently we discovered that hydrogen sulfide
      (H2S) is increased upon DR and plays an essential role in mediating DR benefits
      across evolutionary boundaries. Here we found increased hepatic H2S production in
      long-lived mouse strains of reduced GH and/or TH action, and in a cell-autonomous
      manner upon serum withdrawal in vitro. Negative regulation of hepatic H2S
      production by GH and TH was additive and occurred via distinct mechanisms, namely
      direct transcriptional repression of the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine
      gamma-lyase (CGL) by TH, and substrate-level control of H2S production by GH.
      Mice lacking CGL failed to downregulate systemic T4 metabolism and circulating
      IGF-1, revealing an essential role for H2S in the regulation of key
      longevity-associated hormones.

AB  - Besides circadian rhythms, oscillations cycling with a 12 hr period exist.
      However, the prevalence, origin, regulation, and function of mammalian 12 hr
      rhythms remain elusive. Utilizing an unbiased mathematical approach identifying
      all superimposed oscillations, we uncovered prevalent 12 hr gene expression and
      metabolic rhythms in mouse liver, coupled with a physiological 12 hr unfolded
      protein response oscillation. The mammalian 12 hr rhythm is cell autonomous,
      driven by a dedicated 12 hr pacemaker distinct from the circadian clock, and can 
      be entrained in vitro by metabolic and ER stress cues. Mechanistically, we
      identified XBP1s as a transcriptional regulator of the mammalian 12 hr clock.
      Downregulation of the 12 hr gene expression strongly correlates with human
      hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, implying its importance in maintaining
      metabolic homeostasis. The mammalian 12 hr rhythm of gene expression also is
      conserved in nematodes and crustaceans, indicating an ancient origin of the 12 hr
      clock. Our work sheds new light on how perturbed biological rhythms contribute to
      human disease.

AB  - T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming with major changes in cellular energy
      metabolism during activation. In patients with mitochondrial disease, clinical
      data were marked by frequent infections and immunodeficiency, prompting us to
      explore the consequences of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction in T cells.
      Since cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is a critical regulator of OXPHOS, we created a 
      mouse model with isolated dysfunction in T cells by targeting a gene, COX10, that
      produces mitochondrial disease in humans. COX dysfunction resulted in increased
      apoptosis following activation in vitro and immunodeficiency in vivo. Select T
      cell effector subsets were particularly affected; this could be traced to their
      bioenergetic requirements. In summary, the findings presented herein emphasize
      the role of COX particularly in T cells as a metabolic checkpoint for cell fate
      decisions following T cell activation, with heterogeneous effects in T cell
      subsets. In addition, our studies highlight the utility of translational models
      that recapitulate human mitochondrial disease for understanding immunometabolism.

AB  - Bread is consumed daily by billions of people, yet evidence regarding its
      clinical effects is contradicting. Here, we performed a randomized crossover
      trial of two 1-week-long dietary interventions comprising consumption of either
      traditionally made sourdough-leavened whole-grain bread or industrially made
      white bread. We found no significant differential effects of bread type on
      multiple clinical parameters. The gut microbiota composition remained person
      specific throughout this trial and was generally resilient to the intervention.
      We demonstrate statistically significant interpersonal variability in the
      glycemic response to different bread types, suggesting that the lack of
      phenotypic difference between the bread types stems from a person-specific
      effect. We further show that the type of bread that induces the lower glycemic
      response in each person can be predicted based solely on microbiome data prior to
      the intervention. Together, we present marked personalization in both bread
      metabolism and the gut microbiome, suggesting that understanding dietary effects 
      requires integration of person-specific factors.

AB  - Intestinal gluconeogenesis is a recently identified function influencing energy
      homeostasis. Intestinal gluconeogenesis induced by specific nutrients releases
      glucose, which is sensed by the nervous system surrounding the portal vein. This 
      initiates a signal positively influencing parameters involved in glucose control 
      and energy management controlled by the brain. This knowledge has extended our
      vision of the gut-brain axis, classically ascribed to gastrointestinal hormones. 
      Our work raises several questions relating to the conditions under which
      intestinal gluconeogenesis proceeds and may provide its metabolic benefits. It
      also leads to questions on the advantage conferred by its conservation through a 
      process of natural selection.

AB  - In animal models, the physiological systems involved in metabolic homeostasis
      exhibit a sex difference. Investigators often use male rodents because they show 
      metabolic disease better than females. Thus, females are not used precisely
      because of an acknowledged sex difference that represents an opportunity to
      understand novel factors reducing metabolic disease more in one sex than the
      other. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate to consider sex as a
      biological variable in preclinical research places new demands on investigators
      and peer reviewers who often lack expertise in model systems and experimental
      paradigms used in the study of sex differences. This Perspective discusses
      experimental design and interpretation in studies addressing the mechanisms of
      sex differences in metabolic homeostasis and disease, using animal models and
      cells. We also highlight current limitations in research tools and attitudes that
      threaten to delay progress in studies of sex differences in basic animal
      research.

AB  - The specific immunological components linking metabolic stresses to liver
      inflammation and systemic metabolic pathologies in obesity are not entirely

AB  - Hydrolysis of circulating triglycerides is carried out by the enzyme lipoprotein 
      lipase, which is transported and anchored to the capillary wall by the protein
      GPIHBP1. Recent evidence indicates that certain individuals develop
      autoantibodies against GPIHBP1, impairing lipoprotein lipase function and leading
      to markedly elevated plasma triglyceride levels (Beigneux et al., 2017).

      Predisposition to Binge Eating-like Phenotype.

AB  - Binge eating (BE) is a common aberrant form of eating behavior, characterized by 
      overconsumption of food in a brief period of time. Recurrent episodes of BE
      constitute the BE disorder, which mostly affects females and is associated with
      early-life adversities. Here, we show that corticotropin releasing factor
      (CRF)-induced prenatal stress (PNS) in late gestation predisposes female
      offspring to BE-like behavior that coincides with hypomethylation of hypothalamic
      miR-1a and downstream dysregulation of the melanocortin system through Pax7/Pax3.
      Moreover, exposing the offspring to a methyl-balanced diet during adolescence
      prevents the dysregulation and predisposition from being triggered. We
      demonstrate that gestational programming, per se, will not lead to BE-like
      behavior, but pre-existing alterations due to prenatal programming are revealed
      only when challenged during adolescence. We provide experimental evidence for
      long-term epigenetic abnormalities stemming from PNS in predisposing female
      offspring to BE disorder as well as a potential non-invasive prevention strategy.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs during aging, but its impact on tissue
      senescence is unknown. Here, we find that sedentary but not active humans display
      an age-related decline in the mitochondrial protein, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), that
      is associated with muscle loss. In adult mice, acute, muscle-specific deletion of
      Opa1 induces a precocious senescence phenotype and premature death. Conditional
      and inducible Opa1 deletion alters mitochondrial morphology and function but not 
      DNA content. Mechanistically, the ablation of Opa1 leads to ER stress, which
      signals via the unfolded protein response (UPR) and FoxOs, inducing a catabolic
      program of muscle loss and systemic aging. Pharmacological inhibition of ER
      stress or muscle-specific deletion of FGF21 compensates for the loss of Opa1,
      restoring a normal metabolic state and preventing muscle atrophy and premature
      death. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction in the muscle can trigger a cascade of
      signaling initiated at the ER that systemically affects general metabolism and
      aging.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are associated
      with increased cardiovascular disease and reduced plasma high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL) levels. HDL mediates cholesterol efflux from immune cells via the ATP
      binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1/G1). The significance of impaired 
      cholesterol efflux pathways in autoimmunity is unknown. We observed that
      Abca1/g1-deficient mice develop enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) and glomerulonephritis
      suggestive of SLE. This lupus-like phenotype was recapitulated in mice with
      knockouts of Abca1/g1 in dendritic cells (DCs), but not in macrophages or T
      cells. DC-Abca1/g1 deficiency increased LN and splenic CD11b(+) DCs, which
      displayed cholesterol accumulation and inflammasome activation, increased cell
      surface levels of the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor, 
      and enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion. Consequently, DC-Abca1/g1
      deficiency enhanced T cell activation and Th1 and Th17 cell polarization. Nlrp3
      inflammasome deficiency diminished the enlarged LNs and enhanced Th1 cell
      polarization. These findings identify an essential role of DC cholesterol efflux 
      pathways in maintaining immune tolerance.

AB  - Immune cells function in diverse metabolic environments. Tissues with low glucose
      and high lactate concentrations, such as the intestinal tract or ischemic
      tissues, frequently require immune responses to be more pro-tolerant, avoiding
      unwanted reactions against self-antigens or commensal bacteria. T-regulatory
      cells (Tregs) maintain peripheral tolerance, but how Tregs function in
      low-glucose, lactate-rich environments is unknown. We report that the Treg
      transcription factor Foxp3 reprograms T cell metabolism by suppressing Myc and
      glycolysis, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation, and increasing nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide oxidation. These adaptations allow Tregs a metabolic
      advantage in low-glucose, lactate-rich environments; they resist lactate-mediated
      suppression of T cell function and proliferation. This metabolic phenotype may
      explain how Tregs promote peripheral immune tolerance during tissue injury but
      also how cancer cells evade immune destruction in the tumor microenvironment.
      Understanding Treg metabolism may therefore lead to novel approaches for
      selective immune modulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Biological features acquired or lost during the tumorigenic process are a source 
      for the discovery of molecular cues relevant to cancer. The latest study led by

AB  - The hypothalamic control of metabolism appears to be a puzzle that cannot be
      explained by neuronal function alone. Zhang and colleagues (2017) add a few new
      pieces by demonstrating that astrocytes critically modulate neural circuits
      controlling energy homeostasis through nutritional-status-dependent morphological
      plasticity and IKKbeta/NF-kappaB signaling, which modulate extracellular
      neurotransmitter bioavailability.

AB  - Nearby cells can support stem cell differentiation, but the metabolic activities 
      in stem cell niches are unknown. A recent study (Rodriguez-Colman et al., 2017)
      reveals a metabolic partnership in the intestinal stem cell niche: glycolysis in 
      niche Paneth cells provides lactate to drive mitochondrial oxidative
      phosphorylation in intestinal stem cells.

AB  - DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a central player in DNA double-strand
      break (DSB) repair, shows emerging roles in metabolic regulation. In this issue
      of Cell Metabolism, Park et al. (2017) elucidate a molecular mechanism whereby
      DNA-PK negatively regulates AMPK, contributing to metabolic and fitness decline
      during aging.

AB  - Intense intermittent exercise, or interval training, is a powerful stimulus to
      induce many of the physiological adaptations typically associated with
      traditional, moderate-intensity continuous training. While coaches and athletes
      have recognized the value of interval training to enhance performance for over a 
      century, recent scientific interest has focused on the application of this
      training method for health promotion. Despite renewed attention, the mechanistic 
      basis for the physiological remodeling that occurs after interval training and
      the role that the stochastic nature of this type of exercise plays in mediating
      adaptive responses remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Bariatric surgery has evolved from a very effective treatment of weight to a
      treatment of "metabolism" and end-organ damage. Even though surgery was designed 
      with the aim of causing mechanical restriction and calorie malabsorption,
      mechanistic work in humans and rodents over the last 10 years or so has informed 
      us that this could not be further from the truth. Dietary, pharmacological, and
      medical device interventions for weight loss and metabolic control have also
      evolved rapidly only very recently. In this Crosstalk we discuss how close we are
      to harnessing the clinical efficacy of surgery through a metabolic "polypill."

AB  - Pancreatic beta and alpha cells play essential roles in maintaining glucose
      homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which these distinct cell populations are
      generated, expand, and mature during pancreas development remain unclear. In this
      study, we addressed this critical question by performing a single-cell
      transcriptomic analysis of mouse beta and alpha cells sorted from fetal to adult 
      stages. We discovered that beta and alpha cells use different regulatory
      strategies for their maturation and that cell proliferation peaks at different
      developmental times. However, the quiescent and proliferative cells in both the
      beta lineage and alpha lineage are synchronous in their maturation states. The
      heterogeneity of juvenile beta cells reflects distinct cell-cycling phases,
      origins, and maturation states, whereas adult beta cells are relatively
      homogeneous at the transcriptomic level. These analyses provide not only a
      high-resolution roadmap for islet lineage development but also insights into the 
      mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity, cell number expansion, and maturation of
      both beta and alpha cells.

AB  - Management of energy stores is critical during endurance exercise; a shift in
      substrate utilization from glucose toward fat is a hallmark of trained muscle.
      Here we show that this key metabolic adaptation is both dependent on muscle
      PPARdelta and stimulated by PPARdelta ligand. Furthermore, we find that muscle
      PPARdelta expression positively correlates with endurance performance in BXD
      mouse reference populations. In addition to stimulating fatty acid metabolism in 
      sedentary mice, PPARdelta activation potently suppresses glucose catabolism and
      does so without affecting either muscle fiber type or mitochondrial content. By
      preserving systemic glucose levels, PPARdelta acts to delay the onset of
      hypoglycemia and extends running time by approximately 100 min in treated mice.
      Collectively, these results identify a bifurcated PPARdelta program that
      underlies glucose sparing and highlight the potential of PPARdelta-targeted
      exercise mimetics in the treatment of metabolic disease, dystrophies, and,
      unavoidably, the enhancement of athletic performance.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the specific mechanism(s) by which
      PPARbeta regulates mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle. We discovered that
      PPARbeta increases PGC-1alpha by protecting it from degradation by binding to
      PGC-1alpha and limiting ubiquitination. PPARbeta also induces an increase in
      nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) expression, resulting in increases in
      mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and MEF2A, for which NRF-1 is a
      transcription factor. There was also an increase in AMP kinase phosphorylation
      mediated by an NRF-1-induced increase in CAM kinase kinase-beta (CaMKKbeta).
      Knockdown of PPARbeta resulted in large decreases in the levels of PGC-1alpha and
      mitochondrial proteins and a marked attenuation of the exercise-induced increase 
      in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, PPARbeta induces an increase in
      PGC-1alpha protein, and PPARbeta is a transcription factor for NRF-1. Thus,
      PPARbeta plays essential roles in the maintenance and adaptive increase in
      mitochondrial enzymes in skeletal muscle by exercise.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cell mass for appropriate blood glucose control is established
      during early postnatal life. beta cell proliferative capacity declines
      postnatally, but the extrinsic cues and intracellular signals that cause this
      decline remain unknown. To obtain a high-resolution map of beta cell
      transcriptome dynamics after birth, we generated single-cell RNA-seq data of beta
      cells from multiple postnatal time points and ordered cells based on
      transcriptional similarity using a new analytical tool. This analysis captured
      signatures of immature, proliferative beta cells and established high expression 
      of amino acid metabolic, mitochondrial, and Srf/Jun/Fos transcription factor
      genes as their hallmark feature. Experimental validation revealed high metabolic 
      activity in immature beta cells and a role for reactive oxygen species and
      Srf/Jun/Fos transcription factors in driving postnatal beta cell proliferation
      and mass expansion. Our work provides the first high-resolution molecular
      characterization of state changes in postnatal beta cells and paves the way for
      the identification of novel therapeutic targets to stimulate beta cell
      regeneration.

AB  - The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a potential therapeutic target for
      metabolic diseases based on its reported actions in the liver and skeletal
      muscle. We evaluated two distinct direct activators of AMPK: a non-selective
      activator of all AMPK complexes, PF-739, and an activator selective for AMPK
      beta1-containing complexes, PF-249. In cells and animals, both compounds were
      effective at activating AMPK in hepatocytes, but only PF-739 was capable of
      activating AMPK in skeletal muscle. In diabetic mice, PF-739, but not PF-249,
      caused a rapid lowering of plasma glucose levels that was diminished in the
      absence of skeletal muscle, but not liver, AMPK heterotrimers and was the result 
      of an increase in systemic glucose disposal with no impact on hepatic glucose
      production. Studies of PF-739 in cynomolgus monkeys confirmed translation of the 
      glucose lowering and established activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle as a
      potential therapeutic approach to treat diabetic patients.

AB  - Hallmarks of aging that negatively impact health include weight gain and reduced 
      physical fitness, which can increase insulin resistance and risk for many
      diseases, including type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanism(s) for these
      phenomena is poorly understood. Here we report that aging increases DNA breaks
      and activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in skeletal muscle, which
      suppresses mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, and physical fitness.
      DNA-PK phosphorylates threonines 5 and 7 of HSP90alpha, decreasing its chaperone 
      function for clients such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is
      critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. Decreasing DNA-PK
      activity increases AMPK activity and prevents weight gain, decline of
      mitochondrial function, and decline of physical fitness in middle-aged mice and
      protects against type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, DNA-PK is one of the drivers of 
      the metabolic and fitness decline during aging, and therefore DNA-PK inhibitors
      may have therapeutic potential in obesity and low exercise capacity.

AB  - BMP2 and TGFbeta1 are functional antagonists of pathological remodeling in the
      arteries, heart, and lung; however, the mechanisms in VSMCs, and their
      disturbance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are unclear. We found a
      pro-proliferative TGFbeta1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in VSMCs, and PPARgamma as inhibitory
      regulator of TGFbeta1-Stat3-FoxO1 and TGFbeta1-Smad3/4, by physically interacting
      with Stat3 and Smad3. TGFbeta1 induces fibrosis-related genes and miR-130a/301b, 
      suppressing PPARgamma. Conversely, PPARgamma inhibits TGFbeta1-induced
      mitochondrial activation and VSMC proliferation, and regulates two glucose
      metabolism-related enzymes, platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP, a
      PPARgamma target, via miR-331-5p) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3G
      (PPP1R3G, a Smad3 target). PPARgamma knockdown/deletion in VSMCs activates
      TGFbeta1 signaling. The PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone reverses PAH and inhibits 
      the TGFbeta1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in TGFbeta1-overexpressing mice. We identified
      PPARgamma as a missing link between BMP2 and TGFbeta1 pathways in VSMCs.
      PPARgamma activation can be beneficial in TGFbeta1-associated diseases, such as
      PAH, parenchymal lung diseases, and Marfan's syndrome.

      Induction of Naive Pluripotency.

AB  - Naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) utilize both glycolysis and oxidative
      phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to satisfy their metabolic demands. However, it is
      unclear how somatic cells acquire this hybrid energy metabolism during
      reprogramming toward naive pluripotency. Here, we show that when transduced with 
      Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) into murine fibroblasts, Zic3 and Esrrb
      synergistically enhance the reprogramming efficiency by regulating cellular
      metabolic pathways. These two transcription factors (TFs) cooperatively activate 
      glycolytic metabolism independently of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). In
      contrast, the regulatory modes of the TFs on OXPHOS are antagonistic: Zic3
      represses OXPHOS, whereas Esrrb activates it. Therefore, when introduced with
      Zic3, Esrrb restores OXPHOS activity, which is essential for efficient
      reprogramming. In addition, Esrrb-mediated OXPHOS activation is critical for the 
      conversion of primed PSCs into the naive state. Our study suggests that the
      combinatorial function of TFs achieves an appropriate balance of metabolic
      pathways to induce naive PSCs.

AB  - Central regulation of metabolic physiology is mediated critically through
      neuronal functions; however, whether astrocytes are also essential remains
      unclear. Here we show that the high-order processes of astrocytes in the
      mediobasal hypothalamus displayed shortening in fasting and elongation in fed
      status. Chronic overnutrition and astrocytic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB upregulation
      similarly impaired astrocytic plasticity, leading to sustained shortening of
      high-order processes. In physiology, astrocytic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB upregulation
      resulted in early-onset effects, including glucose intolerance and blood pressure
      rise, and late-onset effects, including body weight and fat gain. Appropriate
      inhibition in astrocytic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB protected against chronic
      overnutrition impairing astrocytic plasticity and these physiological functions. 
      Mechanistically, astrocytic regulation of hypothalamic extracellular GABA level
      and therefore BDNF expression were found partly accountable. Hence, astrocytic
      process plasticity and IKKbeta/NF-kappaB play significant roles in central
      control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight as well as the central 
      induction of these physiological disorders leading to disease.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies control glycemia in type 2
      diabetic (T2D) patients. However, in some patients the treatment must be
      discontinued, defining a state of GLP-1 resistance. In animal models we
      identified a specific set of ileum bacteria impairing the GLP-1-activated
      gut-brain axis for the control of insulin secretion and gastric emptying. Using
      prediction algorithms, we identified bacterial pathways related to amino acid
      metabolism and transport system modules associated to GLP-1 resistance. The
      conventionalization of germ-free mice demonstrated their role in enteric neuron
      biology and the gut-brain-periphery axis. Altogether, insulin secretion and
      gastric emptying require functional GLP-1 receptor and neuronal nitric oxide
      synthase in the enteric nervous system within a eubiotic gut microbiota
      environment. Our data open a novel route to improve GLP-1-based therapies.

AB  - The presence of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
      the most important predictor of liver mortality. There are limited data on the
      diagnostic accuracy of gut microbiota-derived signature for predicting the
      presence of advanced fibrosis. In this prospective study, we characterized the
      gut microbiome compositions using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of DNA
      extracted from stool samples. This study included 86 uniquely well-characterized 
      patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, of which 72 had mild/moderate (stage 0-2
      fibrosis) NAFLD, and 14 had advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 fibrosis). We
      identified a set of 40 features (p < 0.006), which included 37 bacterial species 
      that were used to construct a Random Forest classifier model to distinguish
      mild/moderate NAFLD from advanced fibrosis. The model had a robust diagnostic
      accuracy (AUC 0.936) for detecting advanced fibrosis. This study provides
      preliminary evidence for a fecal-microbiome-derived metagenomic signature to
      detect advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.

AB  - The liking and selective ingestion of palatable foods-including sweets-is
      biologically controlled, and dysfunction of this regulation may promote unhealthy
      eating, obesity, and disease. The hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) 
      reduces sweet consumption in rodents and primates, whereas knockout of Fgf21
      increases sugar consumption in mice. To investigate the relevance of these
      findings in humans, we genotyped variants in the FGF21 locus in participants from
      the Danish Inter99 cohort (n = 6,514) and examined their relationship with a
      detailed range of food and ingestive behaviors. This revealed statistically
      significant associations between FGF21 rs838133 and increased consumption of
      candy, as well as nominal associations with increased alcohol intake and daily
      smoking. Moreover, in a separate clinical study, plasma FGF21 levels increased
      acutely after oral sucrose ingestion and were elevated in fasted sweet-disliking 
      individuals. These data suggest the liver may secrete hormones that influence
      eating behavior.

AB  - Autophagy is a critical cellular process that generally protects cells and
      organisms from stressors such as nutrient deprivation. In addition to its role in
      normal physiology, autophagy plays a role in pathological processes such as
      cancer. Indeed, there has been substantial work exploring the complex and
      context-dependent role of autophagy in cancer. One of the emerging themes is that
      in certain cancer types, autophagy is important to support tumor growth;
      therefore, inhibiting autophagy as a therapeutic approach is actively being
      tested in clinical trials. A key mechanism of how autophagy promotes the growth
      and survival of various cancers is its ability to support cellular metabolism.
      The diverse metabolic fuel sources that can be produced by autophagy provide
      tumors with metabolic plasticity and can allow them to thrive in what can be an
      austere microenvironment. Therefore, understanding how autophagy can fuel
      cellular metabolism will enable more effective combinatorial therapeutic
      strategies.

AB  - Metabolic flexibility is the ability to respond or adapt to conditional changes
      in metabolic demand. This broad concept has been propagated to explain insulin
      resistance and mechanisms governing fuel selection between glucose and fatty
      acids, highlighting the metabolic inflexibility of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
      In parallel, contemporary exercise physiology research has helped to identify
      potential mechanisms underlying altered fuel metabolism in obesity and diabetes. 
      Advances in "omics" technologies have further stimulated additional basic and
      clinical-translational research to further interrogate mechanisms for improved
      metabolic flexibility in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue with the goal of
      preventing and treating metabolic disease.

AB  - Exercise elicits coordinated multi-organ responses including skeletal muscle,
      vasculature, heart, and lung. In the short term, the output of the heart
      increases to meet the demand of strenuous exercise. Long-term exercise instigates
      remodeling of the heart including growth and adaptive molecular and cellular
      re-programming. Signaling pathways such as the insulin-like growth factor
      1/PI3K/Akt pathway mediate many of these responses. Exercise-induced, or
      physiologic, cardiac growth contrasts with growth elicited by pathological
      stimuli such as hypertension. Comparing the molecular and cellular underpinnings 
      of physiologic and pathologic cardiac growth has unveiled phenotype-specific
      signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs. Studies suggest that 
      exercise pathways likely antagonize pathological pathways, and exercise training 
      is often recommended for patients with chronic stable heart failure or following 
      myocardial infarction. Herein, we summarize the current understanding of the
      structural and functional cardiac responses to exercise as well as signaling
      pathways and downstream effector molecules responsible for these adaptations.

AB  - Many of the established positive health benefits of exercise have been documented
      by historical discoveries in the field of exercise physiology. These
      investigations often assess limits: the limits of performance, or the limits of
      exercise-induced health benefits. Indeed, several key findings have been informed
      by studying highly trained athletes, in addition to healthy or unhealthy people. 
      Recent progress has been made in regard to skeletal muscle metabolism and
      personalized exercise regimes. In this perspective, we review some of the
      historical milestones of exercise physiology, discuss how these inform
      contemporary knowledge, and speculate on future questions.

TI  - Muramyl Dipeptide-Based Postbiotics Mitigate Obesity-Induced Insulin Resistance
      via IRF4.

AB  - Intestinal dysbiosis contributes to obesity and insulin resistance, but
      intervening with antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics can be limited by
      specificity or sustained changes in microbial composition. Postbiotics include
      bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides, which have been shown to
      promote insulin resistance during metabolic endotoxemia. We found that bacterial 
      cell wall-derived muramyl dipeptide (MDP) is an insulin-sensitizing postbiotic
      that requires NOD2. Injecting MDP lowered adipose inflammation and reduced
      glucose intolerance in obese mice without causing weight loss or altering the
      composition of the microbiome. MDP reduced hepatic insulin resistance during
      obesity and low-level endotoxemia. NOD1-activating muropeptides worsened glucose 
      tolerance. IRF4 distinguished opposing glycemic responses to different types of
      peptidoglycan and was required for MDP/NOD2-induced insulin sensitization and
      lower metabolic tissue inflammation during obesity and endotoxemia. IRF4 was
      dispensable for exacerbated glucose intolerance via NOD1. Mifamurtide, an
      MDP-based drug with orphan drug status, was an insulin sensitizer at clinically
      relevant doses in obese mice.

AB  - The intricate connection between the circadian clock and metabolism remains
      poorly understood. We used high temporal resolution metabolite profiling to
      explore clock regulation of mouse liver and cell-autonomous metabolism. In liver,
      approximately 50% of metabolites were circadian, with enrichment of nucleotide,
      amino acid, and methylation pathways. In U2 OS cells, 28% were circadian,
      including amino acids and NAD biosynthesis metabolites. Eighteen metabolites
      oscillated in both systems and a subset of these in primary hepatocytes. These 18
      metabolites were enriched in methylation and amino acid pathways. To assess clock
      dependence of these rhythms, we used genetic perturbation. BMAL1 knockdown
      diminished metabolite rhythms, while CRY1 or CRY2 perturbation generally
      shortened or lengthened rhythms, respectively. Surprisingly, CRY1 knockdown
      induced 8 hr rhythms in amino acid, methylation, and vitamin metabolites,
      decoupling metabolite from transcriptional rhythms, with potential impact on
      nutrient sensing in vivo. These results provide the first comprehensive views of 
      circadian liver and cell-autonomous metabolism.

AB  - The DNA methylation levels of certain CpG sites are thought to reflect the pace
      of human aging. Here, we developed a robust predictor of mouse biological age
      based on 90 CpG sites derived from partial blood DNA methylation profiles. The
      resulting clock correctly determines the age of mouse cohorts, detects the
      longevity effects of calorie restriction and gene knockouts, and reports
      rejuvenation of fibroblast-derived iPSCs. The data show that mammalian DNA
      methylomes are characterized by CpG sites that may represent the organism's
      biological age. They are scattered across the genome, they are distinct in human 
      and mouse, and their methylation gradually changes with age. The clock derived
      from these sites represents a biomarker of aging and can be used to determine the
      biological age of organisms and evaluate interventions that alter the rate of
      aging.

AB  - The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster of the Rieske protein, UQCRFS1, is essential for
      Complex III (CIII) activity, though the mechanism for Fe-S cluster transfer has
      not previously been elucidated. Recent studies have shown that the co-chaperone
      HSC20, essential for Fe-S cluster biogenesis of SDHB, directly binds LYRM7,
      formerly described as a chaperone that stabilizes UQCRFS1 prior to its insertion 
      into CIII. Here we report that a transient subcomplex involved in CIII assembly, 
      composed of LYRM7 bound to UQCRFS1, interacts with components of an Fe-S transfer
      complex, consisting of HSC20, its cognate chaperone HSPA9, and the holo-scaffold 
      ISCU. Binding of HSC20 to the LYR motif of LYRM7 in a pre-assembled UQCRFS1-LYRM7
      intermediate in the mitochondrial matrix facilitates Fe-S cluster transfer to
      UQCRFS1. The five Fe-S cluster subunits of Complex I also interact with HSC20 to 
      acquire their clusters, highlighting the crucial role of HSC20 in the assembly of
      the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

AB  - FGF21 is an endocrine hormone that regulates energy homeostasis and insulin
      sensitivity. The mechanism of FGF21 action and the tissues responsible for these 
      effects have been controversial, with both adipose tissues and the central
      nervous system having been identified as the target site mediating
      FGF21-dependent increases in insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and weight 
      loss. Here we show that, while FGF21 signaling to adipose tissue is required for 
      the acute insulin-sensitizing effects of FGF21, FGF21 signaling to adipose tissue
      is not required for its chronic effects to increase energy expenditure and lower 
      body weight. Also, in contrast to previous studies, we found that adiponectin is 
      dispensable for the metabolic effects of FGF21 in increasing insulin sensitivity 
      and energy expenditure. Instead, FGF21 acutely enhances insulin sensitivity
      through actions on brown adipose tissue. Our data reveal that the acute and
      chronic effects of FGF21 can be dissociated through adipose-dependent and
      -independent mechanisms.

AB  - Postnatal maintenance or regeneration of pancreatic beta cells is considered to
      occur exclusively via the replication of existing beta cells, but clinically
      meaningful restoration of human beta cell mass by proliferation has never been
      achieved. We discovered a population of immature beta cells that is present
      throughout life and forms from non-beta precursors at a specialized
      micro-environment or "neogenic niche" at the islet periphery. These cells express
      insulin, but lack other key beta cell markers, and are transcriptionally
      immature, incapable of sensing glucose, and unable to support calcium influx.
      They constitute an intermediate stage in the transdifferentiation of alpha cells 
      to cells that are functionally indistinguishable from conventional beta cells. We
      thus identified a lifelong source of new beta cells at a specialized site within 
      healthy islets. By comparing co-existing immature and mature beta cells within
      healthy islets, we stand to learn how to mature insulin-expressing cells into
      functional beta cells.

AB  - We hypothesized that the known heterogeneity of pancreatic beta cells was due to 
      subpopulations of beta cells at different stages of their life cycle with
      different functional capacities and that further changes occur with metabolic
      stress and aging. We identified new markers of aging in beta cells, including
      IGF1R. In beta cells IGF1R expression correlated with age, dysfunction, and
      expression of known age markers p16(ink4a), p53BP1, and senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase. The new markers showed striking heterogeneity both within and
      between islets in both mouse and human pancreas. Acute induction of insulin
      resistance with an insulin receptor antagonist or chronic ER stress resulted in
      increased expression of aging markers, providing insight into how metabolic
      stress might accelerate dysfunction and decline of beta cells. These novel
      findings about beta cell and islet heterogeneity, and how they change with age,
      open up an entirely new set of questions about the pathogenesis of type 2
      diabetes.

AB  - In cells experiencing unrelieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the ER
      transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase)-IRE1alpha-endonucleolytically
      degrades ER-localized mRNAs to promote apoptosis. Here we find that the ABL
      family of tyrosine kinases rheostatically enhances IRE1alpha's enzymatic
      activities, thereby potentiating ER stress-induced apoptosis. During ER stress,
      cytosolic ABL kinases localize to the ER membrane, where they bind, scaffold, and
      hyperactivate IRE1alpha's RNase. Imatinib-an anti-cancer tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor-antagonizes the ABL-IRE1alpha interaction, blunts IRE1alpha RNase
      hyperactivity, reduces pancreatic beta cell apoptosis, and reverses type 1
      diabetes (T1D) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. A mono-selective
      kinase inhibitor that allosterically attenuates IRE1alpha's RNase-KIRA8-also
      efficaciously reverses established diabetes in NOD mice by sparing beta cells and
      preserving their physiological function. Our data support a model wherein
      ER-stressed beta cells contribute to their own demise during T1D pathogenesis and
      implicate the ABL-IRE1alpha axis as a drug target for the treatment of an
      autoimmune disease.

AB  - Cholestasis is a common complication of sepsis, and the increased plasma levels
      of bile acids are predictive of sepsis-associated mortality. However, the exact
      mechanism by which cholestasis aggravates sepsis development remains elusive.
      Here, we show that bile acids are danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
      that can activate both signal 1 and 2 of the NLRP3 inflammasome in inflammatory
      macrophages. Mechanistically, bile acids induce a prolonged calcium influx and
      activate the NLRP3 inflammasome synergistically with ATP. Experimental
      cholestasis sensitizes, while cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, protects
      mice from LPS-induced sepsis. FXR negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via
      physical interaction with NLRP3 and caspase 1. Fxr-null mice are more sensitive, 
      while FXR-overexpressing mice are more resistant, to endoxemia shock. These
      findings suggest that bile acids and FXR play pivotal roles in sepsis via
      controlling the NLRP3 inflammasome, and that targeting FXR may represent a
      therapeutic strategy for cholestasis-associated sepsis.

AB  - Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacylases that regulate several aspects of
      metabolism and aging. In contrast to the other mammalian sirtuins, the primary
      enzymatic activity of mitochondrial sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) and its overall role in
      metabolic control have remained enigmatic. Using a combination of phylogenetics, 
      structural biology, and enzymology, we show that SIRT4 removes three acyl
      moieties from lysine residues: methylglutaryl (MG)-, hydroxymethylglutaryl
      (HMG)-, and 3-methylglutaconyl (MGc)-lysine. The metabolites leading to these
      post-translational modifications are intermediates in leucine oxidation, and we
      show a primary role for SIRT4 in controlling this pathway in mice. Furthermore,
      we find that dysregulated leucine metabolism in SIRT4KO mice leads to elevated
      basal and stimulated insulin secretion, which progressively develops into glucose
      intolerance and insulin resistance. These findings identify a robust enzymatic
      activity for SIRT4, uncover a mechanism controlling branched-chain amino acid
      flux, and position SIRT4 as a crucial player maintaining insulin secretion and
      glucose homeostasis during aging.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the formation of acyl protein modifications remain
      poorly understood. By investigating the reactivity of endogenous acyl-CoA
      metabolites, we found a class of acyl-CoAs that undergo intramolecular catalysis 
      to form reactive intermediates that non-enzymatically modify proteins. Based on
      this mechanism, we predicted, validated, and characterized a protein
      modification: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl(HMG)-lysine. In a model of altered
      HMG-CoA metabolism, we found evidence of two additional protein modifications:
      3-methylglutaconyl(MGc)-lysine and 3-methylglutaryl(MG)-lysine. Using
      quantitative proteomics, we compared the "acylomes" of two reactive acyl-CoA
      species, namely HMG-CoA and glutaryl-CoA, which are generated in different
      pathways. We found proteins that are uniquely modified by each reactive
      metabolite, as well as common proteins and pathways. We identified the
      tricarboxylic acid cycle as a pathway commonly regulated by acylation and
      validated malate dehydrogenase as a key target. These data uncover a fundamental 
      relationship between reactive acyl-CoA species and proteins and define a new
      regulatory paradigm in metabolism.

AB  - Cold and other environmental factors induce "browning" of white fat
      depots-development of beige adipocytes with morphological and functional
      resemblance to brown fat. Similar to brown fat, beige adipocytes are assumed to
      express mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are thermogenic due to the 
      UCP1-mediated H(+) leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, this
      assumption has never been tested directly. Herein we patch clamped the inner
      mitochondrial membrane of beige and brown fat to provide a direct comparison of
      their thermogenic H(+) leak (IH). All inguinal beige adipocytes had robust
      UCP1-dependent IH comparable to brown fat, but it was about three times less
      sensitive to purine nucleotide inhibition. Strikingly, only approximately 15% of 
      epididymal beige adipocytes had IH, while in the rest UCP1-dependent IH was
      undetectable. Despite the absence of UCP1 in the majority of epididymal beige
      adipocytes, these cells employ prominent creatine cycling as a UCP1-independent
      thermogenic mechanism.

AB  - Since the discovery of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR),
      researchers have been engaged in intensive efforts to resolve physiological
      functions of IR and its major downstream targets, insulin receptor substrate 1
      (Irs1) and Irs2. Studies conducted using systemic and tissue-specific
      gene-knockout mice of IR, Irs1, and Irs2 have revealed the physiological roles of
      these molecules in each tissue and interactions among multiple tissues. In
      obesity and type 2 diabetes, selective downregulation of Irs2 and its downstream 
      actions to cause reduced insulin actions was associated with increased insulin
      actions through Irs1 in variety tissues. Thus, we propose the novel concept of
      "organ- and pathway-specific imbalanced insulin action" in obesity and type 2
      diabetes, which includes and extends "selective insulin resistance." This Review 
      focuses on recent progress in understanding insulin signaling and insulin

AB  - In addition to their bioenergetic intracellular function, several classical
      metabolites act as extracellular signaling molecules activating cell-surface
      G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), similar to hormones and neurotransmitters.
      "Signaling metabolites" generated from nutrients or by gut microbiota target
      primarily enteroendocrine, neuronal, and immune cells in the lamina propria of
      the gut mucosa and the liver and, through these tissues, the rest of the body. In
      contrast, metabolites from the intermediary metabolism act mainly as metabolic
      stress-induced autocrine and paracrine signals in adipose tissue, the liver, and 
      the endocrine pancreas. Importantly, distinct metabolite GPCRs act as efficient
      pro- and anti-inflammatory regulators of key immune cells, and signaling
      metabolites may thus function as important drivers of the low-grade inflammation 
      associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The concept of key metabolites as
      ligands for specific GPCRs has broadened our understanding of metabolic signaling
      significantly and provides a number of novel potential drug targets.

AB  - Respiratory chain dysfunction plays an important role in human disease and aging.
      It is now well established that the individual respiratory complexes can be
      organized into supercomplexes, and structures for these macromolecular
      assemblies, determined by electron cryo-microscopy, have been described recently.
      Nevertheless, the reason why supercomplexes exist remains an enigma. The widely
      held view that they enhance catalysis by channeling substrates is challenged by
      both structural and biophysical information. Here, we evaluate and discuss data
      and hypotheses on the structures, roles, and assembly of respiratory-chain
      supercomplexes and propose a future research agenda to address unanswered
      questions.

AB  - During conditions of impaired bile flow (cholestasis), increased serum bile acids
      (BAs) are prognostic markers of sepsis. In this issue, Hao et al. (2017) show
      that the BA receptor FXR binds NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages and inhibits
      activation of inflammasome components, thus reducing endotoxemia in cholestasis.

AB  - Adipocyte-targeted therapies could potentially combat obesity and metabolic
      disorders; however, our understanding of adipogenesis and the characterization of
      the various adipose tissues are incomplete. In this issue, Bertholet et al.
      (2017) report the existence of two types of heat-producing beige-like adipocytes,
      those with and those without the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).

      releases small vesicles known as exosomes. Thomou et al. (2017) now show that
      exosomes secreted by brown fat carry miRNAs that regulate the liver. Thus, AT
      exosomes might have therapeutic and diagnostic relevance for metabolic disorders.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is necessary for normal gluco-regulation, and it 
      has been widely presumed that this function reflects the actions of GLP-1
      released from enteroendocrine L cells. To test the relative importance of
      intestinal versus pancreatic sources of GLP-1 for physiological regulation of
      glucose, we administered a GLP-1R antagonist, exendin-[9-39] (Ex9), to mice with 
      tissue-specific reactivation of the preproglucagon gene (Gcg). Ex9 impaired
      glucose tolerance in wild-type mice but had no impact on Gcg-null or GLP-1R KO
      mice, suggesting that Ex9 is a true and specific GLP-1R antagonist. Unexpectedly,
      Ex-9 had no effect on blood glucose in mice with restoration of intestinal Gcg.
      In contrast, pancreatic reactivation of Gcg fully restored the effect of Ex9 to
      impair both oral and i.p. glucose tolerance. These findings suggest an
      alternative model whereby islet GLP-1 also plays an important role in regulating 
      glucose homeostasis.

AB  - Investigation of cell-cycle kinetics in mammalian pancreatic beta cells has
      mostly focused on transition from the quiescent (G0) to G1 phase. Here, we report
      that centromere protein A (CENP-A), which is required for chromosome segregation 
      during the M-phase, is necessary for adaptive beta cell proliferation.
      Receptor-mediated insulin signaling promotes DNA-binding activity of FoxM1 to
      regulate expression of CENP-A and polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) by modulating
      cyclin-dependent kinase-1/2. CENP-A deposition at the centromere is augmented by 
      PLK1 to promote mitosis, while knocking down CENP-A limits beta cell
      proliferation and survival. CENP-A deficiency in beta cells leads to impaired
      adaptive proliferation in response to pregnancy, acute and chronic insulin
      resistance, and aging in mice. Insulin-stimulated CENP-A/PLK1 protein expression 
      is blunted in islets from patients with type 2 diabetes. These data implicate the
      insulin-FoxM1/PLK1/CENP-A pathway-regulated mitotic cell-cycle progression as an 
      essential component in the beta cell adaptation to delay and/or prevent
      progression to diabetes.

AB  - In an approach aimed at defining interacting partners of ceramide synthases
      (CerSs), we found that fatty acyl-CoA synthase ACSL5 interacts with all CerSs. We
      demonstrate that ACSL5-generated FA-CoA was utilized with de novo ceramide for
      the generation of acylceramides, poorly studied ceramide metabolites.
      Functionally, inhibition of ceramide channeling to acylceramide enhanced
      accumulation of de novo ceramide and resulted in augmentation of
      ceramide-mediated apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that acylceramide
      generation is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) on lipid
      droplets. In summary, this study identifies a metabolic pathway of acylceramide
      generation and its sequestration in LDs in cells and in livers of mice on a
      high-fat diet. The study also implicates this pathway in ceramide-mediated
      apoptosis, and has implications in co-regulation of triglyceride and sphingolipid
      metabolisms.

AB  - The gut microbiome participates in numerous physiologic functions and
      communicates intimately with the host immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are
      critical components of intestinal innate immunity. We report a prominent role for
      antimicrobials secreted by pancreatic acini in shaping the gut microbiome that is
      essential for intestinal innate immunity, barrier function, and survival.
      Deletion of the Ca(2+) channel Orai1 in pancreatic acini of adult mice resulted
      in 60%-70% mortality within 3 weeks. Despite robust activation of the intestinal 
      innate immune response, mice lacking acinar Orai1 exhibited intestinal bacterial 
      outgrowth and dysbiosis, ultimately causing systemic translocation, inflammation,
      and death. While digestive enzyme supplementation was ineffective, treatments
      constraining bacterial outgrowth (purified liquid diet, broad-spectrum
      antibiotics) rescued survival, feeding, and weight gain. Pancreatic levels of
      cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) were reduced, and supplement
      of synthetic CRAMP prevented intestinal disease. These findings reveal a critical
      role for antimicrobial pancreatic secretion in gut innate immunity.

TI  - Matching Dietary Amino Acid Balance to the In Silico-Translated Exome Optimizes
      Growth and Reproduction without Cost to Lifespan.

AB  - Balancing the quantity and quality of dietary protein relative to other nutrients
      is a key determinant of evolutionary fitness. A theoretical framework for
      defining a balanced diet would both reduce the enormous workload to optimize
      diets empirically and represent a breakthrough toward tailoring diets to the
      needs of consumers. Here, we report a simple and powerful in silico technique
      that uses the genome information of an organism to define its dietary amino acid 
      requirements. We show for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that such
      "exome-matched" diets are more satiating, enhance growth, and increase
      reproduction relative to non-matched diets. Thus, early life fitness traits can
      be enhanced at low levels of dietary amino acids that do not impose a cost to
      lifespan. Exome matching also enhanced mouse growth, indicating that it can be
      applied to other organisms whose genome sequence is known.

AB  - The molecular transducers of benefits from different exercise modalities remain
      incompletely defined. Here we report that 12 weeks of high-intensity aerobic
      interval (HIIT), resistance (RT), and combined exercise training enhanced insulin
      sensitivity and lean mass, but only HIIT and combined training improved aerobic
      capacity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. HIIT revealed a more
      robust increase in gene transcripts than other exercise modalities, particularly 
      in older adults, although little overlap with corresponding individual protein
      abundance was noted. HIIT reversed many age-related differences in the proteome, 
      particularly of mitochondrial proteins in concert with increased mitochondrial
      protein synthesis. Both RT and HIIT enhanced proteins involved in translational
      machinery irrespective of age. Only small changes of methylation of DNA promoter 
      regions were observed. We provide evidence for predominant exercise regulation at
      the translational level, enhancing translational capacity and proteome abundance 
      to explain phenotypic gains in muscle mitochondrial function and hypertrophy in
      all ages.

AB  - Systems biology uses mathematical models to analyze large datasets and simulate
      system behavior. It enables integrative analysis of different types of data and
      can thereby provide new insight into complex biological systems. Here will be
      discussed the challenges of using systems medicine for advancing the development 
      of personalized and precision medicine to treat metabolic diseases like insulin
      resistance, obesity, NAFLD, NASH, and cancer. It will be illustrated how the
      concept of genome-scale metabolic models can be used for integrative analysis of 
      big data with the objective of identifying novel biomarkers that are foundational
      for personalized and precision medicine.

AB  - Both human and animal studies indicate that environmental exposures experienced
      during early life can robustly influence risk for adult disease. Moreover,
      environmental exposures experienced by parents during either intrauterine or
      postnatal life can also influence the health of their offspring, thus initiating 
      a cycle of disease risk across generations. In this Perspective, we focus on
      epigenetic mechanisms in germ cells, including DNA methylation, histone
      modification, and non-coding RNAs, which collectively may provide a non-genetic
      molecular legacy of prior environmental exposures and influence transcriptional
      regulation, developmental trajectories, and adult disease risk in offspring.

AB  - A number of molecular pathways play key roles in transmitting information in
      addition to the genomic sequence-epigenetic information-from one generation to
      the next. However, so-called epigenetic marks also impact an enormous variety of 
      physiological processes, even under circumstances that do not result in heritable
      consequences. Perhaps inevitably, the epigenetic regulatory machinery is highly
      responsive to metabolic cues, as, for example, central metabolites are the
      substrates for the enzymes that catalyze the deposition of covalent modifications
      on histones, DNA, and RNA. Interestingly, in addition to the effects that
      metabolites exert over biological regulation in somatic cells, over the past
      decade multiple studies have shown that ancestral nutrition can alter the
      metabolic phenotype of offspring, raising the question of how metabolism
      regulates the epigenome of germ cells. Here, we review the widespread links
      between metabolism and epigenetic modifications, both in somatic cells and in the
      germline.

AB  - Except in rare cases, obesity tends to be a consequence of both an unhealthy
      lifestyle and a genetic susceptibility to gain weight. With more than 200 common 
      genetic variants identified, there is a growing interest in developing
      personalized preventive and treatment strategies to predict an individual's
      obesity risk. We review the literature on the prediction of obesity and show that
      models based on the established genetic variants have poorer predictive ability
      than traditional predictors, such as family history of obesity and childhood
      obesity. Current findings suggest that opportunities for precision medicine in
      common obesity may be limited.

AB  - Nutrition is paramount in shaping all aspects of animal biology. In addition, the
      influence of the intestinal microbiota on physiology is now widely recognized.
      Given that diet also shapes the intestinal microbiota, this raises the question
      of how the nutritional environment and microbial assemblages together influence
      animal physiology. This research field constitutes a new frontier in the field of
      organismal biology that needs to be addressed. Here we review recent studies
      using animal models and humans and propose an integrative framework within which 
      to define the study of the diet-physiology-microbiota systems and ultimately link
      it to human health. Nutritional Geometry sits centrally in the proposed framework
      and offers means to define diet compositions that are optimal for individuals and
      populations.

AB  - In addition to the immune system's traditional roles of conferring
      anti-infectious and anti-neoplastic protection, it has been recently implicated
      in the regulation of systemic metabolic homeostasis. This cross-talk between the 
      immune and the metabolic systems is pivotal in promoting "metabolic health"
      throughout the life of an organism and plays fundamental roles in its adaptation 
      to ever-changing environmental makeups and nutritional availability.
      Perturbations in this intricate immune-metabolic cross-talk contribute to the
      tendency to develop altered metabolic states that may culminate in metabolic
      disorders such as malnutrition, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and
      other features of the metabolic syndrome. Regulators of immune-metabolic
      interactions include host genetics, nutritional status, and the intestinal
      microbiome. In this Perspective, we highlight current understanding of
      immune-metabolism interactions, illustrate differences among individuals and
      between populations in this respect, and point toward future avenues of research 
      possibly enabling immune harnessing as means of personalized treatment for common
      metabolic disorders.

TI  - Converting Adult Pancreatic Islet alpha Cells into beta Cells by Targeting Both
      Dnmt1 and Arx.

AB  - Insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in mice can slowly regenerate from
      glucagon-producing alpha cells in settings like beta cell loss, but the basis of 
      this conversion is unknown. Moreover, it remains unclear if this intra-islet cell
      conversion is relevant to diseases like type 1 diabetes (T1D). We show that the
      alpha cell regulators Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) and DNA methyltransferase
      1 (Dnmt1) maintain alpha cell identity in mice. Within 3 months of Dnmt1 and Arx 
      loss, lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed extensive alpha
      cell conversion into progeny resembling native beta cells. Physiological studies 
      demonstrated that converted alpha cells acquire hallmark beta cell
      electrophysiology and show glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In T1D patients,
      subsets of glucagon-expressing cells show loss of DNMT1 and ARX and produce
      insulin and other beta cell factors, suggesting that DNMT1 and ARX maintain alpha
      cell identity in humans. Our work reveals pathways regulated by Arx and Dnmt1
      that are sufficient for achieving targeted generation of beta cells from adult
      pancreatic alpha cells.

AB  - The etiology of hypertension, the world's biggest killer, remains poorly
      understood, with treatments targeting the established symptom, not the cause. The
      development of hypertension involves increased sympathetic nerve activity that,
      in experimental hypertension, may be driven by excessive respiratory modulation. 
      Using selective viral and cell lesion techniques, we identify adrenergic C1
      neurons in the medulla oblongata as critical for respiratory-sympathetic
      entrainment and the development of experimental hypertension. We also show that a
      cohort of young, normotensive humans, selected for an exaggerated blood pressure 
      response to exercise and thus increased hypertension risk, has enhanced
      respiratory-related blood pressure fluctuations. These studies pinpoint a
      specific neuronal target for ameliorating excessive sympathetic activity during
      the developmental phase of hypertension and identify a group of pre-hypertensive 
      subjects that would benefit from targeting these cells.

      Obesity-Induced Adipose Tissue Fibrosis.

AB  - Obesity-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) fibrosis is believed to accelerate WAT
      dysfunction. However, the cellular origin of WAT fibrosis remains unclear. Here, 
      we show that adipocyte platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha-positive
      (PDGFRalpha(+)) progenitors adopt a fibrogenic phenotype in obese mice prone to
      visceral WAT fibrosis. More specifically, a subset of PDGFRalpha(+) cells with
      high CD9 expression (CD9(high)) originates pro-fibrotic cells whereas their
      CD9(low) counterparts, committed to adipogenesis, are almost completely lost in
      the fibrotic WAT. PDGFRalpha pathway activation promotes a phenotypic shift
      toward PDGFRalpha(+)CD9(high) fibrogenic cells, driving pathological remodeling
      and altering WAT function in obesity. These findings translated to human obesity 
      as the frequency of CD9(high) progenitors in omental WAT (oWAT) correlates with
      oWAT fibrosis level, insulin-resistance severity, and type 2 diabetes.
      Collectively, our data demonstrate that in addition to representing a WAT
      adipogenic niche, different PDGFRalpha(+) cell subsets modulate obesity-induced
      WAT fibrogenesis and are associated with loss of metabolic fitness.

AB  - Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons regulate energy and glucose
      metabolism. Intracellular mechanisms that enable these neurons to respond to
      changes in metabolic environment are ill defined. Here we show reduced expression
      of activated dynamin-related protein (pDRP1), a mitochondrial fission regulator, 
      in POMC neurons of fed mice. These POMC neurons displayed increased mitochondrial
      size and aspect ratio compared to POMC neurons of fasted animals. Inducible
      deletion of DRP1 of mature POMC neurons (Drp1(fl/fl)-POMC-cre:ER(T2)) resulted in
      improved leptin sensitivity and glucose responsiveness. In
      Drp1(fl/fl)-POMC-cre:ER(T2) mice, POMC neurons showed increased mitochondrial
      size, ROS production, and neuronal activation with increased expression of Kcnj11
      mRNA regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Furthermore,
      deletion of DRP1 enhanced the glucoprivic stimulus in these neurons, causing
      their stronger inhibition and a greater activation of counter-regulatory
      responses to hypoglycemia that were PPAR dependent. Together, these data unmasked
      a role for mitochondrial fission in leptin sensitivity and glucose sensing of
      POMC neurons.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of severe renal disease,
      and few treatment options are available today that prevent the progressive loss
      of renal function. DKD is characterized by altered glomerular filtration and
      proteinuria. A common observation in DKD is the presence of renal steatosis, but 
      the mechanism(s) underlying this observation and to what extent they contribute
      to disease progression are unknown. Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B)
      controls muscle lipid accumulation through regulation of endothelial fatty acid
      transport. Here, we demonstrate in experimental mouse models of DKD that renal
      VEGF-B expression correlates with the severity of disease. Inhibiting VEGF-B
      signaling in DKD mouse models reduces renal lipotoxicity, re-sensitizes podocytes
      to insulin signaling, inhibits the development of DKD-associated pathologies, and
      prevents renal dysfunction. Further, we show that elevated VEGF-B levels are
      found in patients with DKD, suggesting that VEGF-B antagonism represents a novel 
      approach to treat DKD.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that involves
      immune-mediated destruction of beta cells. How beta cells respond to immune
      attack is unknown. We identified a population of beta cells during the
      progression of T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that survives immune attack. 
      This population develops from normal beta cells confronted with islet
      infiltrates. Pathways involving cell movement, growth and proliferation, immune
      responses, and cell death and survival are activated in these cells. There is
      reduced expression of beta cell identity genes and diabetes antigens and
      increased immune inhibitory markers and stemness genes. This new subpopulation is
      resistant to killing when diabetes is precipitated with cyclophosphamide. Human
      beta cells show similar changes when cultured with immune cells. These changes
      may account for the chronicity of the disease and the long-term survival of beta 
      cells in some patients.

AB  - Spurred by current research policy, we are witnessing a significant growth in the
      number of studies that observe and describe sexual diversities in human
      physiology and sex prevalence in a large number of pathologies. Yet we are far
      from the comprehension of the mechanisms underpinning these differences, which
      are the result of a long evolutionary history. This Essay is meant to underline
      female reproductive function as a driver for the positive selection of the
      specific physiological features that explain male and female differential
      susceptibility to diseases and metabolic disturbances, in particular. A clear
      understanding of the causes underlying sexual dimorphisms in the physio-pathology
      is crucial for precision medicine.

TI  - Obesity-Induced Metabolic Stress Leads to Biased Effector Memory CD4(+) T Cell
      Differentiation via PI3K p110delta-Akt-Mediated Signals.

AB  - Low-grade systemic inflammation associated to obesity leads to cardiovascular
      complications, caused partly by infiltration of adipose and vascular tissue by
      effector T cells. The signals leading to T cell differentiation and tissue
      infiltration during obesity are poorly understood. We tested whether saturated
      fatty acid-induced metabolic stress affects differentiation and trafficking
      patterns of CD4(+) T cells. Memory CD4(+) T cells primed in high-fat diet-fed
      donors preferentially migrated to non-lymphoid, inflammatory sites, independent
      of the metabolic status of the hosts. This was due to biased CD4(+) T cell
      differentiation into CD44(hi)-CCR7(lo)-CD62L(lo)-CXCR3(+)-LFA1(+) effector
      memory-like T cells upon priming in high-fat diet-fed animals. Similar phenotype 
      was observed in obese subjects in a cohort of free-living people. This
      developmental bias was independent of any crosstalk between CD4(+) T cells and
      dendritic cells and was mediated via direct exposure of CD4(+) T cells to
      palmitate, leading to increased activation of a PI3K p110delta-Akt-dependent
      pathway upon priming.

AB  - Intermittent PTH administration builds bone mass and prevents fractures, but its 
      mechanism of action is unclear. We genetically deleted the PTH/PTHrP receptor
      (PTH1R) in mesenchymal stem cells using Prx1Cre and found low bone formation,
      increased bone resorption, and high bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). Bone
      marrow adipocytes traced to Prx1 and expressed classic adipogenic markers and
      high receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (Rankl) expression.
      RANKL levels were also elevated in bone marrow supernatant and serum, but
      undetectable in other adipose depots. By cell sorting, Pref1(+)RANKL(+) marrow
      progenitors were twice as great in mutant versus control marrow. Intermittent PTH
      administration to control mice reduced BMAT significantly. A similar finding was 
      noted in male osteoporotic patients. Thus, marrow adipocytes exhibit osteogenic
      and adipogenic characteristics, are uniquely responsive to PTH, and secrete
      RANKL. These studies reveal an important mechanism for PTH's therapeutic action
      through its ability to direct mesenchymal cell fate.

AB  - Ca(2+) signals were reported to control lipid homeostasis, but the Ca(2+)
      channels and pathways involved are largely unknown. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry
      (SOCE) is a ubiquitous Ca(2+) influx pathway regulated by stromal interaction
      molecule 1 (STIM1), STIM2, and the Ca(2+) channel ORAI1. We show that
      SOCE-deficient mice accumulate pathological amounts of lipid droplets in the
      liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Cells from patients with loss-of-function
      mutations in STIM1 or ORAI1 show a similar phenotype, suggesting a cell-intrinsic
      role for SOCE in the regulation of lipid metabolism. SOCE is crucial to induce
      mobilization of fatty acids from lipid droplets, lipolysis, and mitochondrial
      fatty acid oxidation. SOCE regulates cyclic AMP production and the expression of 
      neutral lipases as well as the transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism,
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha
      (PGC-1alpha), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha).
      SOCE-deficient cells upregulate lipophagy, which protects them from lipotoxicity.
      Our data provide evidence for an important role of SOCE in lipid metabolism.

AB  - Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a critical metabolic signaling molecule that
      regulates gluconeogenesis, pyruvate oxidation, protein acetylation, and steroid
      and fatty acid biosynthesis; however, measurements of this metabolite using
      standard biochemical approaches are technically demanding, and there is currently
      no method to non-invasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA content in vivo. To this
      end, we developed and validated a method to non-invasively detect differences in 
      hepatic acetyl-CoA content in vivo across a 5-fold range of physiological
      acetyl-CoA concentrations by assessing the turnover of
      [(13)C4]beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB). Here, we show a strong correlation (R(2)
      = 0.86, p < 0.0001) between hepatic acetyl-CoA content and beta-OHB turnover in
      rats with varying degrees of fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. These 
      studies demonstrate that beta-OHB turnover can be used as a surrogate to
      non-invasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA content, thereby allowing researchers to
      further elucidate the role of this metabolite in the regulation of hepatic
      gluconeogenesis and other metabolic processes in vivo.

AB  - While high-caloric diet impairs insulin response to cause hyperglycemia, whether 
      and how counter-regulatory hormones are modulated by high-caloric diet is largely
      unknown. We find that enhanced response of Drosophila adipokinetic hormone (AKH, 
      the glucagon homolog) in the fat body is essential for hyperglycemia associated
      with a chronic high-sugar diet. We show that the activin type I receptor Baboon
      (Babo) autonomously increases AKH signaling without affecting insulin signaling
      in the fat body via, at least, increase of Akh receptor (AkhR) expression.
      Further, we demonstrate that Activin-beta (Actbeta), an activin ligand
      predominantly produced in the enteroendocrine cells (EEs) of the midgut, is
      upregulated by chronic high-sugar diet and signals through Babo to promote AKH
      action in the fat body, leading to hyperglycemia. Importantly, activin signaling 
      in mouse primary hepatocytes also increases glucagon response and
      glucagon-induced glucose production, indicating a conserved role for activin in
      enhancing AKH/glucagon signaling and glycemic control.

AB  - Elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have recently been
      implicated in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but the
      molecular mechanisms are unknown. In a mouse model of impaired BCAA catabolism
      (knockout [KO]), we found that chronic accumulation of BCAAs suppressed glucose
      metabolism and sensitized the heart to ischemic injury. High levels of BCAAs
      selectively disrupted mitochondrial pyruvate utilization through inhibition of
      pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity. Furthermore, downregulation of the
      hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in KO hearts decreased protein O-linked
      N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification and inactivated PDH, resulting in
      significant decreases in glucose oxidation. Although the metabolic remodeling in 
      KO did not affect baseline cardiac energetics or function, it rendered the heart 
      vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Promoting BCAA catabolism or
      normalizing glucose utilization by overexpressing GLUT1 in the KO heart rescued
      the metabolic and functional outcome. These observations revealed a novel role of
      BCAA catabolism in regulating cardiac metabolism and stress response.

AB  - WNK kinases, along with their upstream regulators (CUL3/KLHL3) and downstream
      targets (the SPAK/OSR1 kinases and the cation-Cl(-) cotransporters [CCCs]),
      comprise a signaling cascade essential for ion homeostasis in the kidney and
      nervous system. Recent work has furthered our understanding of the WNKs in
      epithelial transport, cell volume homeostasis, and GABA signaling, and uncovered 
      novel roles for this pathway in immune cell function and cell proliferation.

AB  - Ketone body metabolism is a central node in physiological homeostasis. In this
      review, we discuss how ketones serve discrete fine-tuning metabolic roles that
      optimize organ and organism performance in varying nutrient states and protect
      from inflammation and injury in multiple organ systems. Traditionally viewed as
      metabolic substrates enlisted only in carbohydrate restriction, observations
      underscore the importance of ketone bodies as vital metabolic and signaling
      mediators when carbohydrates are abundant. Complementing a repertoire of known
      therapeutic options for diseases of the nervous system, prospective roles for
      ketone bodies in cancer have arisen, as have intriguing protective roles in heart
      and liver, opening therapeutic options in obesity-related and cardiovascular
      disease. Controversies in ketone metabolism and signaling are discussed to
      reconcile classical dogma with contemporary observations.

AB  - Thermogenesis converts the chemical energy of nutrients into heat, and this is
      associated to improved metabolic performance. In a previous issue of Cell
      Metabolism, Berry et al. (2017) reported that the progenitors of thermogenic
      beige adipocytes lose functionality with aging, and this process can be reversed 
      with strategies that eliminate senescent cells.

AB  - Rao and colleagues (2017) reveal how Salmonella limits anorexia in mice,
      protecting them and promoting the spread of infection. The mechanism involves
      inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome limiting vagal nerve stimulation by
      IL-1beta, which in turn promotes appetite. A possible new therapeutic approach
      for treating anorexia in multiple diseases is proposed.

AB  - Hankir and colleagues (2017) show that gastric bypass surgery in rats enhances
      the sensitivity of cells in the gut to dietary lipids. In turn, these cells
      signal to stimulate dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum to inhibit fat

AB  - During immune challenge, T lymphocytes engage pathways of anabolic metabolism to 
      support clonal expansion and the development of effector functions. Here we
      report a critical role for the non-essential amino acid serine in effector T cell
      responses. Upon activation, T cells upregulate enzymes of the serine, glycine,
      one-carbon (SGOC) metabolic network, and rapidly increase processing of serine
      into one-carbon metabolism. We show that extracellular serine is required for
      optimal T cell expansion even in glucose concentrations sufficient to support T
      cell activation, bioenergetics, and effector function. Restricting dietary serine
      impairs pathogen-driven expansion of T cells in vivo, without affecting overall
      immune cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, serine supplies glycine and one-carbon 
      units for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in proliferating T cells, and
      one-carbon units from formate can rescue T cells from serine deprivation. Our
      data implicate serine as a key immunometabolite that directly modulates adaptive 
      immunity by controlling T cell proliferative capacity.

AB  - Lifestyle factors, including diet, play an important role in the survival of
      cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic links
      between diet and particular oncogenic mutations in human cancers remain unclear. 
      We recently reported that the ketone body acetoacetate selectively enhances BRAF 
      V600E mutant-dependent MEK1 activation in human cancers. Here we show that a
      high-fat ketogenic diet increased serum levels of acetoacetate, leading to
      enhanced tumor growth potential of BRAF V600E-expressing human melanoma cells in 
      xenograft mice. Treatment with hypolipidemic agents to lower circulating
      acetoacetate levels or an inhibitory homolog of acetoacetate, dehydroacetic acid,
      to antagonize acetoacetate-BRAF V600E binding attenuated BRAF V600E tumor growth.
      These findings reveal a signaling basis underlying a pathogenic role of dietary
      fat in BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma, providing insights into the design of
      conceptualized "precision diets" that may prevent or delay tumor progression
      based on an individual's specific oncogenic mutation profile.

AB  - Indirect evidence from human studies suggests that brown adipose tissue (BAT)
      thermogenesis is fueled predominantly by fatty acids hydrolyzed from
      intracellular triglycerides (TGs). However, no direct experimental evidence to
      support this assumption currently exists in humans. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the role of intracellular TG in BAT thermogenesis, in cold-exposed men.
      Using positron emission tomography with (11)C-acetate and
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, we showed that oral nicotinic acid (NiAc)
      administration, an inhibitor of intracellular TG lipolysis, suppressed the
      cold-induced increase in BAT oxidative metabolism and glucose uptake, despite no 
      difference in BAT blood flow. There was a commensurate increase in shivering
      intensity and shift toward a greater reliance on glycolytic muscle fibers without
      modifying total heat production. Together, these findings show that intracellular
      TG lipolysis is critical for BAT thermogenesis and provides experimental evidence
      for a reciprocal role of BAT thermogenesis and shivering in cold-induced
      thermogenesis in humans.

AB  - A promising approach to treating obesity is to increase diet-induced
      thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), but the regulation of this process
      remains unclear. Here we find that CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) is expressed in BAT
      and upregulated upon refeeding. Mice lacking CLK2 in adipose tissue exhibit
      exacerbated obesity and decreased energy expenditure during high-fat diet
      intermittent fasting. Additionally, tissue oxygen consumption and protein levels 
      of UCP1 are reduced in CLK2-deficient BAT. Phosphorylation of CREB, a
      transcriptional activator of UCP1, is markedly decreased in BAT cells lacking
      CLK2 due to enhanced CREB dephosphorylation. Mechanistically, CREB
      dephosphorylation is rescued by the inhibition of PP2A, a phosphatase that
      targets CREB. Our results suggest that CLK2 is a regulatory component of
      diet-induced thermogenesis in BAT through increased CREB-dependent expression of 
      UCP1.

AB  - Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes. However, knowledge of the full effects of metformin on biochemical
      pathways and processes in its primary target tissue, the liver, is limited. One
      established effect of metformin is to decrease cellular energy levels. The
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      complex 1 (mTORC1) are key regulators of metabolism that are respectively
      activated and inhibited in acute response to cellular energy depletion. Here we
      show that metformin robustly inhibits mTORC1 in mouse liver tissue and primary
      hepatocytes. Using mouse genetics, we find that at the lowest concentrations of
      metformin that inhibit hepatic mTORC1 signaling, this inhibition is dependent on 
      AMPK and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex (TSC complex).
      Finally, we show that metformin profoundly inhibits hepatocyte protein synthesis 
      in a manner that is largely dependent on its ability to suppress mTORC1
      signaling.

AB  - The metabolic stress hormone FGF21 is highly expressed in exocrine pancreas,
      where its levels are increased by refeeding and chemically induced pancreatitis. 
      However, its function in the exocrine pancreas remains unknown. Here, we show
      that FGF21 stimulates digestive enzyme secretion from pancreatic acinar cells
      through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism that requires signaling through a
      tyrosine kinase receptor complex composed of an FGF receptor and beta-Klotho.
      Mice lacking FGF21 accumulate zymogen granules and are susceptible to pancreatic 
      ER stress, an effect that is reversed by administration of recombinant FGF21.
      Mice carrying an acinar cell-specific deletion of beta-Klotho also accumulate
      zymogen granules but are refractory to FGF21-stimulated secretion. Like the
      classical post-prandial secretagogue, cholecystokinin (CCK), FGF21 triggers
      intracellular calcium release via PLC-IP3R signaling. However, unlike CCK, FGF21 
      does not induce protein synthesis, thereby preventing protein accumulation. Thus,
      pancreatic FGF21 is a digestive enzyme secretagogue whose physiologic function is
      to maintain acinar cell proteostasis.

AB  - Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) elicits hunger responses to increase the
      chances of surviving starvation: an inhibition of metabolism and an increase in
      feeding. Here we elucidate a key central circuit mechanism through which
      hypothalamic NPY signals drive these hunger responses. GABAergic neurons in the
      intermediate and parvicellular reticular nuclei (IRt/PCRt) of the medulla
      oblongata, which are activated by NPY-triggered neural signaling from the
      hypothalamus, potentially through the nucleus tractus solitarius, mediate the
      NPY-induced inhibition of metabolic thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT)
      via their innervation of BAT sympathetic premotor neurons. Intriguingly, the
      GABAergic IRt/PCRt neurons innervating the BAT sympathetic premotor region also
      innervate the masticatory motor region, and stimulation of the IRt/PCRt elicits
      mastication and increases feeding as well as inhibits BAT thermogenesis. These
      results indicate that GABAergic IRt/PCRt neurons mediate hypothalamus-derived
      hunger signaling by coordinating both autonomic and feeding motor systems to
      reduce energy expenditure and to promote feeding.

AB  - Insulin and IGF1 signaling are important for adipose tissue development and
      function; however, their role in mature adipocytes is unclear. Mice with a
      tamoxifen-inducible knockout of insulin and/or IGF1 receptors (IR/IGF1R)
      demonstrate a rapid loss of white and brown fat due to increased lipolysis and
      adipocyte apoptosis. This results in insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,
      hepatosteatosis, islet hyperplasia with hyperinsulinemia, and cold intolerance.
      This phenotype, however, resolves over 10-30 days due to a proliferation of
      preadipocytes and rapid regeneration of both brown and white adipocytes as
      identified by mTmG lineage tracing. This cycle can be repeated with a second
      round of receptor inactivation. Leptin administration prior to tamoxifen
      treatment blocks development of the metabolic syndrome without affecting
      adipocyte loss or regeneration. Thus, IR is critical in adipocyte maintenance,
      and this loss of adipose tissue stimulates regeneration of brown/white fat and
      reversal of metabolic syndrome associated with fat loss.

AB  - Bariatric surgery remains the single most effective long-term treatment modality 
      for morbid obesity, achieved mainly by lowering caloric intake through as yet
      ill-defined mechanisms. Here we show in rats that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      (RYGB)-like rerouting of ingested fat mobilizes lower small intestine production 
      of the fat-satiety molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). This was associated with
      vagus nerve-driven increases in dorsal striatal dopamine release. We also
      demonstrate that RYGB upregulates striatal dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) expression
      specifically under high-fat diet feeding conditions. Mechanistically, interfering
      with local OEA, vagal, and dorsal striatal D1R signaling negated the beneficial
      effects of RYGB on fat intake and preferences. These findings delineate a
      molecular/systems pathway through which bariatric surgery improves feeding
      behavior and may aid in the development of novel weight loss strategies that
      similarly modify brain reward circuits compromised in obesity.

AB  - Macrophages play pivotal roles in both the induction and resolution phases of
      inflammatory processes. Macrophages have been shown to synthesize
      anti-inflammatory fatty acids in an LXR-dependent manner, but whether the
      production of these species contributes to the resolution phase of inflammatory
      responses has not been established. Here, we identify a biphasic program of gene 
      expression that drives production of anti-inflammatory fatty acids 12-24 hr
      following TLR4 activation and contributes to downregulation of mRNAs encoding
      pro-inflammatory mediators. Unexpectedly, rather than requiring LXRs, this late
      program of anti-inflammatory fatty acid biosynthesis is dependent on SREBP1 and
      results in the uncoupling of NFkappaB binding from gene activation. In contrast
      to previously identified roles of SREBP1 in promoting production of IL1beta
      during the induction phase of inflammation, these studies provide evidence that
      SREBP1 also contributes to the resolution phase of TLR4-induced gene activation
      by reprogramming macrophage lipid metabolism.

AB  - Recent studies have uncovered thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in
      human pancreatic beta cells. beta cell lncRNAs are often cell type specific and
      exhibit dynamic regulation during differentiation or upon changing glucose
      concentrations. Although these features hint at a role of lncRNAs in beta cell
      gene regulation and diabetes, the function of beta cell lncRNAs remains largely
      unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of beta cell-specific
      lncRNAs and transcription factors using transcript knockdowns and co-expression
      network analysis. This revealed lncRNAs that function in concert with
      transcription factors to regulate beta cell-specific transcriptional networks. We
      further demonstrate that the lncRNA PLUTO affects local 3D chromatin structure
      and transcription of PDX1, encoding a key beta cell transcription factor, and
      that both PLUTO and PDX1 are downregulated in islets from donors with type 2
      diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. These results implicate lncRNAs in the
      regulation of beta cell-specific transcription factor networks.

AB  - Obesity is associated with physical inactivity, which exacerbates the health
      consequences of weight gain. However, the mechanisms that mediate this
      association are unknown. We hypothesized that deficits in dopamine signaling
      contribute to physical inactivity in obesity. To investigate this, we quantified 
      multiple aspects of dopamine signaling in lean and obese mice. We found that
      D2-type receptor (D2R) binding in the striatum, but not D1-type receptor binding 
      or dopamine levels, was reduced in obese mice. Genetically removing D2Rs from
      striatal medium spiny neurons was sufficient to reduce motor activity in lean
      mice, whereas restoring Gi signaling in these neurons increased activity in obese
      mice. Surprisingly, although mice with low D2Rs were less active, they were not
      more vulnerable to diet-induced weight gain than control mice. We conclude that
      deficits in striatal D2R signaling contribute to physical inactivity in obesity, 
      but inactivity is more a consequence than a cause of obesity.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple metabolic complications.
      Physical activity is known to increase mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, 
      counteracting age-related decline in muscle function and protecting against
      metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Here, we investigated the effect of 4
      months of exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondria electron transport
      chain complexes and supercomplexes in 26 healthy, sedentary older adults.
      Exercise differentially modulated respiratory complexes. Complex I was the most
      upregulated complex and not stoichiometrically associated to the other complexes.
      In contrast to the other complexes, complex I was almost exclusively found
      assembled in supercomplexes in muscle mitochondria. Overall, supercomplex content
      was increased after exercise. In particular, complexes I, III, and IV were
      redistributed to supercomplexes in the form of I+III2+IV. Taken together, our
      results provide the first evidence that exercise affects the stoichiometry of
      supercomplex formation in humans and thus reveal a novel adaptive mechanism for
      increased energy demand.

AB  - Most of the biological understanding of mechanisms underlying coronary artery
      disease (CAD) derives from studies of mouse models. The identification of
      multiple CAD loci and strong candidate genes in large human genome-wide
      association studies (GWASs) presented an opportunity to examine the relevance of 
      mouse models for the human disease. We comprehensively reviewed the mouse
      literature, including 827 literature-derived genes, and compared it to human
      data. First, we observed striking concordance of risk factors for atherosclerosis
      in mice and humans. Second, there was highly significant overlap of mouse genes
      with human genes identified by GWASs. In particular, of the 46 genes with strong 
      association signals in CAD GWASs that were studied in mouse models, all but one
      exhibited consistent effects on atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Third, we
      compared 178 CAD-associated pathways derived from human GWASs with 263 from mouse
      studies and observed that the majority were consistent between the species.

AB  - The global epidemic of obesity and its associated chronic diseases is largely
      attributed to an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure. While
      physical exercise remains the best solution, the development of muscle-targeted
      "exercise mimetics" may soon provide a pharmaceutical alternative to battle an
      increasingly sedentary lifestyle. At the same time, these advances are fueling a 
      raging debate on their escalating use as performance-enhancing drugs in
      high-profile competitions such as the Olympics.

AB  - T cell-directed immunosuppression only transiently delays the loss of beta cell
      function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. We argue here that the underlying
      disease process is carried by innate immune reactivity. Inducing a non-polarized 
      functional state of local innate immunity will support regulatory T cell
      development and beta cell proliferation.

AB  - Mitochondria were first postulated to contribute to aging more than 40 years ago.
      During the following decades, multiple lines of evidence in model organisms and
      humans showed that impaired mitochondrial function can contribute to
      age-associated disease phenotypes and aging. However, in contrast to the original
      theory favoring oxidative damage as a cause for mtDNA mutations, there are now
      strong data arguing that most mammalian mtDNA mutations originate as replication 
      errors made by the mtDNA polymerase. Currently, a substantial amount of
      mitochondrial research is focused on finding ways to either remove or counteract 
      the effects of mtDNA mutations with the hope of extending the human health- and
      lifespan. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the formation of
      mtDNA mutations and their impact on mitochondrial function. We also critically
      discuss proposed pathways interlinked with mammalian mtDNA mutations and suggest 
      future research strategies to elucidate the role of mtDNA mutations in aging.

AB  - Metabolomics, or the comprehensive profiling of small molecule metabolites in
      cells, tissues, or whole organisms, has undergone a rapid technological evolution
      in the past two decades. These advances have led to the application of
      metabolomics to defining predictive biomarkers for incident cardiometabolic
      diseases and, increasingly, as a blueprint for understanding those diseases'
      pathophysiologic mechanisms. Progress in this area and challenges for the future 
      are reviewed here.

AB  - Classical views posit G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor 1s (CB1Rs) at the
      cell surface with cytosolic Gialpha-mediated signal transduction.
      Hebert-Chatelain et al. (2016) instead place CB1Rs at mitochondria limiting
      neuronal respiration by soluble adenylyl cyclase-dependent modulation of complex 
      I activity. Thus, neuronal bioenergetics link to synaptic plasticity and,
      globally, learning and memory.

TI  - A Leptin Analog Locally Produced in the Brain Acts via a Conserved Neural Circuit
      to Modulate Obesity-Linked Behaviors in Drosophila.

AB  - Leptin, a typically adipose-derived "satiety hormone," has a well-established
      role in weight regulation. Here we describe a functionally conserved model of
      genetically induced obesity in Drosophila by manipulating the fly leptin analog
      unpaired 1 (upd1). Unexpectedly, cell-type-specific knockdown reveals upd1 in the
      brain, not the adipose tissue, mediates obesity-related traits. Disrupting
      brain-derived upd1 in flies leads to all the hallmarks of mammalian obesity:
      increased attraction to food cues, increased food intake, and increased weight.
      These effects are mediated by domeless receptors on neurons expressing Drosophila
      neuropeptide F, the orexigenic mammalian neuropeptide Y homolog. In vivo
      two-photon imaging reveals upd1 and domeless inhibit this hedonic signal in fed
      animals. Manipulations along this central circuit also create hypersensitivity to
      obesogenic conditions, emphasizing the critical interplay between biological
      predisposition and environment in overweight and obesity prevalence. We propose
      adipose- and brain-derived upd/leptin may control differing features of weight
      regulation through distinct neural circuits.

AB  - The transcription factor EB (TFEB) is an essential component of lysosomal
      biogenesis and autophagy for the adaptive response to food deprivation. To
      address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used
      muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Here, we show that TFEB
      controls metabolic flexibility in muscle during exercise and that this action is 
      independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator1alpha
      (PGC1alpha). Indeed, TFEB translocates into the myonuclei during physical
      activity and regulates glucose uptake and glycogen content by controlling
      expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and pathways related to
      glucose homeostasis. In addition, TFEB induces the expression of genes involved
      in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation.
      This coordinated action optimizes mitochondrial substrate utilization, thus
      enhancing ATP production and exercise capacity. These findings identify TFEB as a
      critical mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism.

      adipocytes declines with age. This creates a clinical roadblock to potential
      therapeutic use in older individuals, who constitute a large percentage of the
      obesity epidemic. Here we show that aging murine and human beige progenitor cells
      display a cellular aging, senescence-like phenotype that accounts for their
      age-dependent failure. Activating the senescence pathway, either genetically or
      pharmacologically, in young beige progenitors induces premature cellular
      senescence and blocks their potential to form cold-induced beige adipocytes.
      Conversely, genetically or pharmacologically reversing cellular aging by
      targeting the p38/MAPK-p16(Ink4a) pathway in aged mouse or human beige progenitor
      cells rejuvenates cold-induced beiging. This in turn increases glucose
      sensitivity. Collectively, these data indicate that anti-aging or senescence
      modalities could be a strategy to induce beiging, thereby improving metabolic
      health in aging humans.

AB  - Diet influences health and patterns of disease in populations. How different
      diets do this and why outcomes of diets vary between individuals are complex and 
      involve interaction with the gut microbiome. A major challenge for predicting
      health outcomes of the host-microbiome dynamic is reconciling the effects of
      different aspects of diet (food composition or intake rate) on the system. Here
      we show that microbial community assembly is fundamentally shaped by a dichotomy 
      in bacterial strategies to access nitrogen in the gut environment. Consequently, 
      the pattern of dietary protein intake constrains the host-microbiome dynamic in
      ways that are common to a very broad range of diet manipulation strategies. These
      insights offer a mechanism for the impact of high protein intake on metabolic
      health and form the basis for a general theory of the impact of different diet
      strategies on host-microbiome outcomes.

TI  - High-Density Lipoproteins Exert Pro-inflammatory Effects on Macrophages via
      Passive Cholesterol Depletion and PKC-NF-kappaB/STAT1-IRF1 Signaling.

AB  - Membrane cholesterol modulates a variety of cell signaling pathways and
      functions. While cholesterol depletion by high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) has
      potent anti-inflammatory effects in various cell types, its effects on
      inflammatory responses in macrophages remain elusive. Here we show overt
      pro-inflammatory effects of HDL-mediated passive cholesterol depletion and lipid 
      raft disruption in murine and human primary macrophages in vitro. These
      pro-inflammatory effects were confirmed in vivo in peritoneal macrophages from
      apoA-I transgenic mice, which have elevated HDL levels. In line with these
      findings, the innate immune responses required for clearance of P. aeruginosa
      bacterial infection in lung were compromised in mice with low HDL levels.
      Expression analysis, ChIP-PCR, and combinatorial pharmacological and genetic
      intervention studies unveiled that both native and reconstituted HDL enhance
      Toll-like-receptor-induced signaling by activating a PKC-NF-kappaB/STAT1-IRF1
      axis, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine expression. HDL's
      pro-inflammatory activity supports proper functioning of macrophage immune
      responses.

AB  - Pharmacological inhibition of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) enzyme
      potentiates incretin action and is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes.
      Nevertheless, the precise cells and tissues critical for incretin degradation and
      glucose homeostasis remain unknown. Here, we use mouse genetics and pharmacologic
      DPP4 inhibition to identify DPP4(+) cell types essential for incretin action.
      Although enterocyte DPP4 accounted for substantial intestinal DPP4 activity,
      ablation of enterocyte DPP4 in Dpp4(Gut-/-) mice did not produce alterations in
      plasma DPP4 activity, incretin hormone levels, and glucose tolerance. In
      contrast, endothelial cell (EC)-derived DPP4 contributed substantially to levels 
      of soluble plasma DPP4 activity, incretin degradation, and glucose control.
      Surprisingly, DPP4(+) cells of bone marrow origin mediated the selective
      degradation of fasting GIP, but not GLP-1. Collectively, these findings identify 
      distinct roles for DPP4 in the EC versus the bone marrow compartment for
      selective incretin degradation and DPP4i-mediated glucoregulation.

AB  - Circadian clocks are self-sustainable endogenous oscillators, present in
      virtually every cell, driving daily cycles of metabolism and physiology. The
      molecular mechanism of the circadian clock is based on interconnected
      transcriptional and translational feedback loops. While many studies have
      addressed circadian rhythms of the transcriptome and, to a lesser extent, the
      proteome, none have investigated the phosphoproteome. We apply mass
      spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to obtain the first global in vivo
      quantification of circadian phosphorylation in mammals. Of more than 20,000
      phosphosites, 25% significantly oscillate in the mouse liver, including novel
      sites on core clock proteins. The extent and amplitude of phosphorylation cycles 
      far exceeds those observed in RNA and protein abundance. Our data indicate a
      dominant regulatory role for phosphorylation-dependent circadian tuning of
      signaling pathways. This allows the organism to integrate different signals and
      rapidly and economically respond to daily changes in nutrient availability and
      physiological states.

AB  - Diurnal oscillations of gene expression controlled by the circadian clock and its
      connected feeding rhythm enable organisms to coordinate their physiologies with
      daily environmental cycles. While available techniques yielded crucial insights
      into regulation at the transcriptional level, much less is known about temporally
      controlled functions within the nucleus and their regulation at the protein
      level. Here, we quantified the temporal nuclear accumulation of proteins and
      phosphoproteins from mouse liver by SILAC proteomics. We identified around 5,000 
      nuclear proteins, over 500 of which showed a diurnal accumulation. Parallel
      analysis of the nuclear phosphoproteome enabled the inference of the temporal
      activity of kinases accounting for rhythmic phosphorylation. Many identified
      rhythmic proteins were parts of nuclear complexes involved in transcriptional
      regulation, ribosome biogenesis, DNA repair, and the cell cycle and its
      potentially associated diurnal rhythm of hepatocyte polyploidy. Taken together,
      these findings provide unprecedented insights into the diurnal regulatory
      landscape of the mouse liver nucleus.

AB  - Circadian regulation is critically important in maintaining metabolic and
      physiological homeostasis. However, little is known about the possible influence 
      of the clock on physiological abnormalities occurring under pathological
      conditions. Here, we report the discovery that hypoxia, a condition that causes
      catastrophic bodily damage, is gated by the circadian clock in vivo. Hypoxia
      signals conversely regulate the clock by slowing the circadian cycle and
      dampening the amplitude of oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. ChIP-seq
      analyses of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1A and the core clock component BMAL1
      revealed crosstalk between hypoxia and the clock at the genome level. Further,
      severe consequences caused by acute hypoxia, such as those that occur with heart 
      attacks, were correlated with defects in circadian rhythms. We propose that the
      clock plays functions in fine-tuning hypoxic responses under pathophysiological
      conditions. We argue that the clock can, and likely should, be exploited
      therapeutically to reduce the severity of fatal hypoxia-related diseases.

AB  - Circadian clocks are encoded by a transcription-translation feedback loop that
      aligns energetic processes with the solar cycle. We show that genetic disruption 
      of the clock activator BMAL1 in skeletal myotubes and fibroblasts increased
      levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) under hypoxic
      conditions. Bmal1(-/-) myotubes displayed reduced anaerobic glycolysis,
      mitochondrial respiration with glycolytic fuel, and transcription of HIF1alpha
      targets Phd3, Vegfa, Mct4, Pk-m, and Ldha, whereas abrogation of the clock
      repressors CRY1/2 stabilized HIF1alpha in response to hypoxia. HIF1alpha bound
      directly to core clock gene promoters, and, when co-expressed with BMAL1, led to 
      transactivation of PER2-LUC and HRE-LUC reporters. Further, genetic stabilization
      of HIF1alpha in Vhl(-/-) cells altered circadian transcription. Finally,
      induction of clock and HIF1alpha target genes in response to strenuous exercise
      varied according to the time of day in wild-type mice. Collectively, our results 
      reveal bidirectional interactions between circadian and HIF pathways that
      influence metabolic adaptation to hypoxia.

AB  - The mammalian circadian system consists of a master clock in the brain that
      synchronizes subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues. The master clock
      maintains phase coherence in peripheral cells through systemic cues such as
      feeding-fasting and temperature cycles. Here, we examined the role of oxygen as a
      resetting cue for circadian clocks. We continuously measured oxygen levels in
      living animals and detected daily rhythms in tissue oxygenation. Oxygen cycles,
      within the physiological range, were sufficient to synchronize cellular clocks in
      a HIF1alpha-dependent manner. Furthermore, several clock genes responded to
      changes in oxygen levels through HIF1alpha. Finally, we found that a moderate
      reduction in oxygen levels for a short period accelerates the adaptation of
      wild-type but not of HIF1alpha-deficient mice to the new time in a jet lag
      protocol. We conclude that oxygen, via HIF1alpha activation, is a resetting cue
      for circadian clocks and propose oxygen modulation as therapy for jet lag.

AB  - Mitochondrial complex I is the largest integral membrane enzyme of the
      respiratory chain and consists of 44 different subunits encoded in the
      mitochondrial and nuclear genome. Its biosynthesis is a highly complicated and
      multifaceted process involving at least 14 additional assembly factors. How these
      subunits assemble into a functional complex I and where the assembly factors come
      into play is largely unknown. Here, we applied a dynamic complexome profiling
      approach to elucidate the assembly of human mitochondrial complex I and its
      further incorporation into respiratory chain supercomplexes. We delineate the
      stepwise incorporation of all but one subunit into a series of distinct assembly 
      intermediates and their association with known and putative assembly factors,
      which had not been implicated in this process before. The resulting detailed and 
      comprehensive model of complex I assembly is fully consistent with recent
      structural data and the remarkable modular architecture of this multiprotein
      complex.

AB  - Evolution of metazoans resulted in the specialization of cellular and tissue
      function. This was accomplished by division of labor, which allowed tissue
      parenchymal cells to prioritize their core functions while ancillary functions
      were delegated to tissue accessory cells, such as immune, stromal, and
      endothelial cells. In metabolic organs, the accessory cells communicate with
      their clients, the tissue parenchymal cells, to optimize cellular processes,
      allowing organisms to adapt to changes in their environment. Here, we discuss
      tissue immunometabolism from this vantage point and use examples from adipose
      tissues (white, beige, and brown) and liver to outline the general principles by 
      which accessory cells support metabolic homeostasis in parenchymal cells. A
      corollary of this model is that disruption of communication between client and
      accessory cells might predispose metabolic organs to the development of disease.

AB  - One-carbon (1C) metabolism, mediated by the folate cofactor, supports multiple
      physiological processes. These include biosynthesis (purines and thymidine),
      amino acid homeostasis (glycine, serine, and methionine), epigenetic maintenance,
      and redox defense. Both within eukaryotic cells and across organs, 1C metabolic
      reactions are compartmentalized. Here we review the fundamentals of mammalian 1C 
      metabolism, including the pathways active in different compartments, cell types, 
      and biological states. Emphasis is given to recent discoveries enabled by modern 
      genetics, analytical chemistry, and isotope tracing. An emerging theme is the
      biological importance of mitochondrial 1C reactions, both for producing 1C units 
      that are exported to the cytosol and for making additional products, including
      glycine and NADPH. Increased clarity regarding differential folate pathway usage 
      in cancer, stem cells, development, and adult physiology is reviewed and
      highlights new opportunities for selective therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of liver disease
      worldwide. However, the molecular basis of how benign steatosis progresses to
      NASH is incompletely understood, which has limited the identification of
      therapeutic targets. Here we show that the transcription regulator TAZ (WWTR1) is
      markedly higher in hepatocytes in human and murine NASH liver than in normal or
      steatotic liver. Most importantly, silencing of hepatocyte TAZ in murine models
      of NASH prevented or reversed hepatic inflammation, hepatocyte death, and
      fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, hepatocyte-targeted expression of TAZ in a
      model of steatosis promoted NASH features, including fibrosis. In vitro and in
      vivo mechanistic studies revealed that a key mechanism linking hepatocyte TAZ to 
      NASH fibrosis is TAZ/TEA domain (TEAD)-mediated induction of Indian hedgehog
      (Ihh), a secretory factor that activates fibrogenic genes in hepatic stellate
      cells. In summary, TAZ represents a previously unrecognized factor that
      contributes to the critical process of steatosis-to-NASH progression.

AB  - NAD(+) availability decreases with age and in certain disease conditions.
      Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD(+) intermediate, has been shown to
      enhance NAD(+) biosynthesis and ameliorate various pathologies in mouse disease
      models. In this study, we conducted a 12-month-long NMN administration to regular
      chow-fed wild-type C57BL/6N mice during their normal aging. Orally administered
      NMN was quickly utilized to synthesize NAD(+) in tissues. Remarkably, NMN
      effectively mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice. Without any
      obvious toxicity or deleterious effects, NMN suppressed age-associated body
      weight gain, enhanced energy metabolism, promoted physical activity, improved
      insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile, and ameliorated eye function and
      other pathophysiologies. Consistent with these phenotypes, NMN prevented
      age-associated gene expression changes in key metabolic organs and enhanced
      mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitonuclear protein imbalance in skeletal 
      muscle. These effects of NMN highlight the preventive and therapeutic potential
      of NAD(+) intermediates as effective anti-aging interventions in humans.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis leads to cirrhosis and cancer in a rising number of 
      patients with metabolic syndrome. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Wang et al.
      (2016) identify the transcriptional co-activator Taz as a driver of inflammation 
      and fibrosis through the induction of Indian hedgehog in hepatocytes, which
      stimulates fibrogenesis by hepatic stellate cells.

AB  - Brown-like adipocytes exist in several adipose depots including white (WAT) as
      well as brown (BAT). Activation of these UCP1(+) cells is a potential therapeutic
      strategy to combat obesity. Studies have shown that posttranslational
      modifications of PPARgamma regulate select adipocyte programs. Deacetylation of
      K268 and K293 in the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma by Sirt1 induces browning
      of WAT. Phosphorylation of S273 of PPARgamma by CDK5 or ERK stimulates a
      diabetogenic program of gene expression in WAT. Here, we report that roscovitine,
      a CDK inhibitor, prevents S273 phosphorylation and promotes formation of UCP1(+) 
      (brite) adipocytes in WAT. It also enhances energy expenditure as well as
      prevents diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Analysis of
      fluorescence-activated cell-sorted UCP1(+) adipocytes shows that the mRNA
      signature of brite adipocytes is distinct from beige adipocytes, which arise
      through catecholamine signaling. These results suggest that brown-like adipocytes
      in WAT may arise from multiple origins.

AB  - Age dominates as a risk factor for human atherosclerosis, yet the underlying
      mechanisms remain elusive. A recent report described accumulation of senescent
      cells in atheromata of hypercholesterolemic mice and provides novel insights into
      how genes expressed by aging cells associate with the characteristics of human
      plaques implicated in cardiovascular events.

AB  - Intermediary metabolism provides substrates that shape epigenetic status, but
      whether this interaction can be responsible for oncogenesis is largely unknown.
      In a recent issue of Nature, Kottakis et al. (2016) now show that the common
      tumor suppressor gene LKB1 can function by mediating this connection through an
      LKB1/AMPK/mTOR signaling axis.

AB  - Cholesterol homeostasis is achieved by balancing rates of endogenous synthesis,
      absorption, and elimination. Although biliary secretion into the intestinal lumen
      is classically considered as the only significant route for cholesterol
      elimination, Jakulj et al. (2016) reveal in this issue how transintestinal
      cholesterol excretion (TICE) accounts for substantial cholesterol losses.

      Programs in Trained Immunity.

AB  - Induction of trained immunity (innate immune memory) is mediated by activation of
      immune and metabolic pathways that result in epigenetic rewiring of cellular
      functional programs. Through network-level integration of transcriptomics and
      metabolomics data, we identify glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and the cholesterol
      synthesis pathway as indispensable for the induction of trained immunity by
      beta-glucan in monocytes. Accumulation of fumarate, due to glutamine
      replenishment of the TCA cycle, integrates immune and metabolic circuits to
      induce monocyte epigenetic reprogramming by inhibiting KDM5 histone demethylases.
      Furthermore, fumarate itself induced an epigenetic program similar to
      beta-glucan-induced trained immunity. In line with this, inhibition of
      glutaminolysis and cholesterol synthesis in mice reduced the induction of trained
      immunity by beta-glucan. Identification of the metabolic pathways leading to
      induction of trained immunity contributes to our understanding of innate immune
      memory and opens new therapeutic avenues.

AB  - Liver fat accumulation precedes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, an increasing
      cause of end-stage liver disease. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required for
      hepatic triglyceride homeostasis, and sterol regulatory element binding protein
      (SREBP) regulates the lipogenic response to feeding, but the crosstalk between
      these pathways is unknown. Here we show that inactivation of SREBP by hepatic
      deletion of SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) abrogates the increase in
      lipogenesis caused by loss of HDAC3, but fatty acid oxidation remains defective. 
      This combination leads to accumulation of lipid intermediates and to an energy
      drain that collectively cause oxidative stress, inflammation, liver damage, and, 
      ultimately, synthetic lethality. Remarkably, this phenotype is prevented by
      ectopic expression of nuclear SREBP1c, revealing a surprising benefit of de novo 
      lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis in preventing lipotoxicity. These results 
      demonstrate that HDAC3 and SCAP control symbiotic pathways of liver lipid
      metabolism that are critical for suppression of lipotoxicity.

AB  - Except for conversion to bile salts, there is no major cholesterol degradation
      pathway in mammals. Efficient excretion from the body is therefore a crucial
      element in cholesterol homeostasis. Yet, the existence and importance of
      cholesterol degradation pathways in humans is a matter of debate. We quantified
      cholesterol fluxes in 15 male volunteers using a cholesterol balance approach.
      Ten participants repeated the protocol after 4 weeks of treatment with ezetimibe,
      an inhibitor of intestinal and biliary cholesterol absorption. Under basal
      conditions, about 65% of daily fecal neutral sterol excretion was bile derived,
      with the remainder being contributed by direct transintestinal cholesterol
      excretion (TICE). Surprisingly, ezetimibe induced a 4-fold increase in
      cholesterol elimination via TICE. Mouse studies revealed that most of
      ezetimibe-induced TICE flux is mediated by the cholesterol transporter
      Abcg5/Abcg8. In conclusion, TICE is active in humans and may serve as a novel
      target to stimulate cholesterol elimination in patients at risk for
      cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Adipocytes package incoming fatty acids into triglycerides and other
      glycerolipids, with only a fraction spilling into a parallel biosynthetic pathway
      that produces sphingolipids. Herein, we demonstrate that subcutaneous adipose
      tissue of type 2 diabetics contains considerably more sphingolipids than
      non-diabetic, BMI-matched counterparts. Whole-body and adipose tissue-specific
      inhibition/deletion of serine palmitoyltransferase (Sptlc), the first enzyme in
      the sphingolipid biosynthesis cascade, in mice markedly altered adipose
      morphology and metabolism, particularly in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The
      reduction in adipose sphingolipids increased brown and beige/brite adipocyte
      numbers, mitochondrial activity, and insulin sensitivity. The manipulation also
      increased numbers of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the adipose bed and
      induced secretion of insulin-sensitizing adipokines. By comparison, deletion of
      serine palmitoyltransferase from macrophages had no discernible effects on
      metabolic homeostasis or adipose function. These data indicate that newly
      synthesized adipocyte sphingolipids are nutrient signals that drive changes in
      the adipose phenotype to influence whole-body energy expenditure and nutrient
      metabolism.

AB  - Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the major pathway for ATP production in
      humans. Deficiencies in OXPHOS can arise from mutations in either mitochondrial
      or nuclear genomes and comprise the largest collection of inborn errors of
      metabolism. At present we lack a complete catalog of human genes and pathways
      essential for OXPHOS. Here we introduce a genome-wide CRISPR "death screen" that 
      actively selects dying cells to reveal human genes required for OXPHOS, inspired 
      by the classic observation that human cells deficient in OXPHOS survive in
      glucose but die in galactose. We report 191 high-confidence hits essential for
      OXPHOS, including 72 underlying known OXPHOS diseases. Our screen reveals a
      functional module consisting of NGRN, WBSCR16, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, and FASTKD2
      that regulates the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and intra-mitochondrial translation.
      Our work yields a rich catalog of genes required for OXPHOS and, more generally, 
      demonstrates the power of death screening for functional genomic analysis.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) control adaptation to low oxygen
      environments by activating genes involved in metabolism, angiogenesis, and redox 
      homeostasis. The finding that HIFs are also regulated by small molecule
      metabolites highlights the need to understand the complexity of their cellular
      regulation. Here we use a forward genetic screen in near-haploid human cells to
      identify genes that stabilize HIFs under aerobic conditions. We identify two
      mitochondrial genes, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) and lipoic acid synthase
      (LIAS), which when mutated stabilize HIF1alpha in a non-hydroxylated form.
      Disruption of OGDH complex activity in OGDH or LIAS mutants promotes
      L-2-hydroxyglutarate formation, which inhibits the activity of the HIFalpha
      prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and TET 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases. We also
      find that PHD activity is decreased in patients with homozygous germline
      mutations in lipoic acid synthesis, leading to HIF1 activation. Thus, mutations
      affecting OGDHC activity may have broad implications for epigenetic regulation
      and tumorigenesis.

      Microenvironment-Regulated Cancer Cell Growth.

AB  - Reactive stromal cells are an integral part of tumor microenvironment (TME) and
      interact with cancer cells to regulate their growth. Although targeting stromal
      cells could be a viable therapy to regulate the communication between TME and
      cancer cells, identification of stromal targets that make cancer cells vulnerable
      has remained challenging and elusive. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized
      mechanism whereby metabolism of reactive stromal cells is reprogrammed through an
      upregulated glutamine anabolic pathway. This dysfunctional stromal metabolism
      confers atypical metabolic flexibility and adaptive mechanisms in stromal cells, 
      allowing them to harness carbon and nitrogen from noncanonical sources to
      synthesize glutamine in nutrient-deprived conditions existing in TME. Using an
      orthotopic mouse model for ovarian carcinoma, we find that co-targeting glutamine
      synthetase in stroma and glutaminase in cancer cells reduces tumor weight,
      nodules, and metastasis. We present a synthetic lethal approach to target tumor
      stroma and cancer cells simultaneously for desirable therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - In patients with cancer, the wasting syndrome, cachexia, is associated with
      caloric deficiency. Here, we describe tumor-induced alterations of the host
      metabolic response to caloric deficiency that cause intratumoral immune
      suppression. In pre-cachectic mice with transplanted colorectal cancer or
      autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we find that IL-6 reduces
      the hepatic ketogenic potential through suppression of PPARalpha, the
      transcriptional master regulator of ketogenesis. When these mice are challenged
      with caloric deficiency, the resulting relative hypoketonemia triggers a marked
      rise in glucocorticoid levels. Multiple intratumoral immune pathways are
      suppressed by this hormonal stress response. Moreover, administering
      corticosterone to elevate plasma corticosterone to a level that is lower than
      that occurring in cachectic mice abolishes the response of mouse PDA to an
      immunotherapy that has advanced to clinical trials. Therefore, tumor-induced IL-6
      impairs the ketogenic response to reduced caloric intake, resulting in a systemic
      metabolic stress response that blocks anti-cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - The connection between obesity-induced insulin resistance and inflammation is
      established, but targeting inflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha and IL-1beta
      have had limited success improving insulin sensitivity in patients. Now, Li et
      al. (2016) indicate that galectin-3 could be a targetable link between
      inflammation and insulin sensitivity.

AB  - In this issue, Wenes et al. (2016) show that REDD1, an mTOR inhibitor induced by 
      hypoxia, enhances glycolysis in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Metabolic
      competition for glucose between TAMs and endothelial cells leads to an abnormal, 
      leaky vascular network. Targeting REDD1 normalizes glycolysis in TAMs, stabilizes
      the vascular network, and inhibits metastasis.

AB  - IFN-gamma is a critical inflammatory cytokine that is closely regulated to
      cellular metabolic status and requires high rates of glycolysis. It has now been 
      shown that a key mechanism to link these pathways is through maintenance of
      acetyl-CoA and epigenetic regulation of the IFNG locus.

AB  - Cancers can derive metabolic support from the stromal cells that surround them. A
      new study in Cell Metabolism (Yang et al., 2016) describes how ovarian cancer
      cells can satisfy their need for glutamine by stimulating glutamine production in
      adjacent fibroblasts, highlighting a metabolic dependence that might be targeted 
      for therapy.

AB  - Hypoxic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) acquire angiogenic and
      immunosuppressive properties. Yet it remains unknown if metabolic changes
      influence these functions. Here, we argue that hypoxic TAMs strongly upregulate
      the expression of REDD1, a negative regulator of mTOR. REDD1-mediated mTOR
      inhibition hinders glycolysis in TAMs and curtails their excessive angiogenic
      response, with consequent formation of abnormal blood vessels. Accordingly, REDD1
      deficiency in TAMs leads to the formation of smoothly aligned, pericyte-covered, 
      functional vessels, which prevents vessel leakiness, hypoxia, and metastases.
      Mechanistically, highly glycolytic REDD1-deficient TAMs outcompete endothelial
      cells for glucose usage that thwarts vascular hyperactivation and promotes the
      formation of quiescent vascular junctions. Tuning down glycolysis in REDD1
      knockout TAMs re-establishes abnormal angiogenesis and metastases. On this basis,
      we prove that the anti-tumor effect of mTOR inhibitors is partly countered by the
      deleterious outcome of these drugs on TAMs. Our data provide a functional link
      between TAM metabolism and tumor angiogenesis.

AB  - Repurposing metformin for cancer therapy is attractive due to its safety profile,
      epidemiological evidence, and encouraging data from human clinical trials.
      Although it is known to systemically affect glucose metabolism in liver, muscle, 
      gut, and other tissues, the molecular determinants that predict a patient
      response in cancer remain unknown. Here, we carry out an integrative metabolomics
      analysis of metformin action in ovarian cancer. Metformin accumulated in patient 
      biopsies, and pathways involving nucleotide metabolism, redox, and energy status,
      all related to mitochondrial metabolism, were affected in treated tumors.
      Strikingly, a metabolic signature obtained from a patient with an exceptional
      clinical outcome mirrored that of a responsive animal tumor. Mechanistically, we 
      demonstrate with stable isotope tracing that these metabolic signatures are due
      to an inability to adapt nutrient utilization in the mitochondria. This analysis 
      provides new insights into mitochondrial metabolism and may lead to more precise 
      indications of metformin in cancer.

AB  - Metformin use is associated with reduced cancer mortality, but how metformin
      impacts cancer outcomes is controversial. Although metformin can act on cells
      autonomously to inhibit tumor growth, the doses of metformin that inhibit
      proliferation in tissue culture are much higher than what has been described in
      vivo. Here, we show that the environment drastically alters sensitivity to
      metformin and other complex I inhibitors. We find that complex I supports
      proliferation by regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+, and
      metformin's anti-proliferative effect is due to loss of NAD+/NADH homeostasis and
      inhibition of aspartate biosynthesis. However, complex I is only one of many
      inputs that determines the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio, and dependency on complex I 
      is dictated by the activity of other pathways that affect NAD+ regeneration and
      aspartate levels. This suggests that cancer drug sensitivity and resistance are
      not intrinsic properties of cancer cells, and demonstrates that the environment
      can dictate sensitivity to therapies that impact cell metabolism.

AB  - Elevated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression is associated with poor
      outcome in tumor patients. Here we show that LDHA-associated lactic acid
      accumulation in melanomas inhibits tumor surveillance by T and NK cells. In
      immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, tumors with reduced lactic acid production
      (Ldha(low)) developed significantly slower than control tumors and showed
      increased infiltration with IFN-gamma-producing T and NK cells. However, in
      Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice, lacking lymphocytes and NK cells, and in Ifng(-/-)
      mice, Ldha(low) and control cells formed tumors at similar rates.
      Pathophysiological concentrations of lactic acid prevented upregulation of
      nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in T and NK cells, resulting in
      diminished IFN-gamma production. Database analyses revealed negative correlations
      between LDHA expression and T cell activation markers in human melanoma patients.
      Our results demonstrate that lactic acid is a potent inhibitor of function and
      survival of T and NK cells leading to tumor immune escape.

AB  - The role of essential amino acids in metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is
      now well established, whereas the role of non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) in
      malignancy remains less clear. Here, we have identified an important role for the
      NEAA proline in the tumorigenic potential of a subset of cancer cells. By
      profiling a large panel of cancer cell lines, we observed that proline
      consumption and expression of proline biosynthesis enzymes were well correlated
      with clonogenic and tumorigenic potential. Moreover, proline starvation or
      inhibition of proline biosynthesis enzymes impaired clonogenic/tumorigenic
      potential. Cancer cells exhibiting dependency on exogenous proline displayed
      hyperactivation of the mTORC1-mediated 4EBP1 signaling axis, as well as
      unresolved ER stress. Exogenous proline alleviated ER stress and promoted
      cellular homeostasis and clonogenicity. Increased dependence on proline may
      therefore define a specific vulnerability in some cancers that can be exploited
      by proline depletion.

AB  - The human endocrine pancreas consists of multiple cell types and plays a critical
      role in glucose homeostasis. Here, we apply mass cytometry technology to measure 
      all major islet hormones, proliferative markers, and readouts of signaling
      pathways involved in proliferation at single-cell resolution. Using this
      innovative technology, we simultaneously examined baseline proliferation levels
      of all endocrine cell types from birth through adulthood, as well as in response 
      to the mitogen harmine. High-dimensional analysis of our marker protein
      expression revealed three major clusters of beta cells within individuals.
      Proliferating beta cells are confined to two of the clusters.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized
      by progressive neurodegeneration and cerebellar ataxia. A-T is causally linked to
      defects in ATM, a master regulator of the response to and repair of DNA
      double-strand breaks. The molecular basis of cerebellar atrophy and
      neurodegeneration in A-T patients is unclear. Here we report and examine the
      significance of increased PARylation, low NAD(+), and mitochondrial dysfunction
      in ATM-deficient neurons, mice, and worms. Treatments that replenish
      intracellular NAD(+) reduce the severity of A-T neuropathology, normalize
      neuromuscular function, delay memory loss, and extend lifespan in both animal
      models. Mechanistically, treatments that increase intracellular NAD(+) also
      stimulate neuronal DNA repair and improve mitochondrial quality via mitophagy.
      This work links two major theories on aging, DNA damage accumulation, and
      mitochondrial dysfunction through nuclear DNA damage-induced
      nuclear-mitochondrial signaling, and demonstrates that they are important
      pathophysiological determinants in premature aging of A-T, pointing to
      therapeutic interventions.

      an accumulation of the oncometabolite fumarate. Sciacovelli et al. (2016)
      demonstrate an epigenetically dependent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
      mediated by modulation of the miR-200 cluster and TET demethylation in response
      to fumarate accumulation.

AB  - In this issue, Fang et al. (2016) show that both the DNA repair defect and
      mitochondrial dysfunction in ATM(-/-) cells or mice are mitigated by the
      anti-aging compound nicotinamide riboside or a SIRT1 activator. This broad
      suppression by activating the NAD(+)/SIRT1 axis may generally apply to diseases
      and aging maladies.

TI  - Defining the Nutritional and Metabolic Context of FGF21 Using the Geometric
      Framework.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is the first known endocrine signal activated
      by protein restriction. Although FGF21 is robustly elevated in low-protein
      environments, increased FGF21 is also seen in various other contexts such as
      fasting, overfeeding, ketogenic diets, and high-carbohydrate diets, leaving its
      nutritional context and physiological role unresolved and controversial. Here, we
      use the Geometric Framework, a nutritional modeling platform, to help reconcile
      these apparently conflicting findings in mice confined to one of 25 diets that
      varied in protein, carbohydrate, and fat content. We show that FGF21 was elevated
      under low protein intakes and maximally when low protein was coupled with high
      carbohydrate intakes. Our results explain how elevation of FGF21 occurs both
      under starvation and hyperphagia, and show that the metabolic outcomes associated
      with elevated FGF21 depend on the nutritional context, differing according to
      whether the animal is in a state of under- or overfeeding.

AB  - The "thrifty gene hypothesis" suggests genetic susceptibility to obesity arises
      because of positive selection for alleles that favored fat deposition and
      survival during famines. We used public domain data to locate signatures of
      positive selection based on derived allele frequency, genetic diversity, long
      haplotypes, and differences between populations at SNPs identified in genome-wide
      association studies (GWASs) for BMI. We used SNPs near the lactase (LCT),
      SLC24A5, and SLC45A2 genes as positive controls and 120 randomly selected SNPs as
      negative controls. We found evidence for positive selection (p < 0.05) at nine
      out of 115 BMI SNPs. However, five of these involved positive selection for the
      protective allele (i.e., for leanness). The widespread absence of signatures of
      positive selection, combined with selection favoring leanness at some alleles,
      does not support the suggestion that obesity provided a selective advantage to
      survive famines, or any other selective advantage.

AB  - To systemically identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulating energy
      metabolism, we performed transcriptome analyses to simultaneously profile mRNAs
      and lncRNAs in key metabolic organs in mice under pathophysiologically
      representative metabolic conditions. Of 4,759 regulated lncRNAs,
      function-oriented filters yield 359 tissue-specifically regulated and
      metabolically sensitive lncRNAs that are predicted by lncRNA-mRNA correlation
      analyses to function in diverse aspects of energy metabolism. Specific
      regulations of liver metabolically sensitive lncRNAs (lncLMS) by nutrients,
      metabolic hormones, and key transcription factors were further defined in primary
      hepatocytes. Combining genome-wide screens, bioinformatics function predictions, 
      and cell-based analyses, we developed an integrative roadmap to identify lncRNA
      metabolic regulators. An lncLMS was experimentally confirmed in mice to suppress 
      lipogenesis by forming a negative feedback loop in the SREBP1c pathway. Taken
      together, this study supports that a class of lncRNAs function as important
      metabolic regulators and establishes a framework for systemically investigating
      the role of lncRNAs in physiological homeostasis.

AB  - Hormone-secreting cells within pancreatic islets of Langerhans play important
      roles in metabolic homeostasis and disease. However, their transcriptional
      characterization is still incomplete. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of
      thousands of human islet cells from healthy and type 2 diabetic donors. We could 
      define specific genetic programs for each individual endocrine and exocrine cell 
      type, even for rare delta, gamma, epsilon, and stellate cells, and revealed
      subpopulations of alpha, beta, and acinar cells. Intriguingly, delta cells
      expressed several important receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of
      these cells in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes
      previously associated with obesity or diabetes were found to correlate with BMI. 
      Finally, comparing healthy and T2D transcriptomes in a cell-type resolved manner 
      uncovered candidates for future functional studies. Altogether, our analyses
      demonstrate the utility of the generated single-cell gene expression resource.

AB  - Using high-throughput screening we identified small molecules that suppress
      superoxide and/or H2O2 production during reverse electron transport through
      mitochondrial respiratory complex I (site IQ) without affecting oxidative
      phosphorylation (suppressors of site IQ electron leak, "S1QELs"). S1QELs
      diminished endogenous oxidative damage in primary astrocytes cultured at ambient 
      or low oxygen tension, showing that site IQ is a normal contributor to
      mitochondrial superoxide-H2O2 production in cells. They diminished stem cell
      hyperplasia in Drosophila intestine in vivo and caspase activation in a
      cardiomyocyte cell model driven by endoplasmic reticulum stress, showing that
      superoxide-H2O2 production by site IQ is involved in cellular stress signaling.
      They protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury in perfused mouse heart,
      showing directly that superoxide-H2O2 production by site IQ is a major
      contributor to this pathology. S1QELs are tools for assessing the contribution of
      site IQ to cell physiology and pathology and have great potential as therapeutic 
      leads.

AB  - Pancreatic islet cells are critical for maintaining normal blood glucose levels, 
      and their malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. We used
      single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of 1,492 human
      pancreatic alpha, beta, delta, and PP cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes
      organ donors. We identified cell-type-specific genes and pathways as well as 245 
      genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes
      have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth.
      Comparison of gene profiles in mouse and human alpha and beta cells revealed
      species-specific expression. All data are available for online browsing and
      download and will hopefully serve as a resource for the islet research community.

AB  - Promoting brown adipose tissue (BAT) development is an attractive strategy for
      the treatment of obesity, as activated BAT dissipates energy through
      thermogenesis; however, the mechanisms controlling BAT formation are not fully
      understood. We hypothesized that as a master regulator of energy metabolism,
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may play a direct role in the process and
      found that AMPKalpha1 (PRKAA1) ablation reduced Prdm16 expression and impaired
      BAT development. During early brown adipogenesis, the cellular levels of
      alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG), a key metabolite required for TET-mediated DNA
      demethylation, were profoundly increased and required for active DNA
      demethylation of the Prdm16 promoter. AMPKalpha1 ablation reduced isocitrate
      dehydrogenase 2 activity and cellular alphaKG levels. Remarkably, postnatal AMPK 
      activation with AICAR or metformin rescued obesity-induced suppression of brown
      adipogenesis and thermogenesis. In summary, AMPK is essential for the epigenetic 
      control of BAT development through alphaKG, thus linking a metabolite to
      progenitor cell differentiation and thermogenesis.

TI  - Connexin 43 Mediates White Adipose Tissue Beiging by Facilitating the Propagation
      of Sympathetic Neuronal Signals.

AB  - "Beige" adipocytes reside in white adipose tissue (WAT) and dissipate energy as
      heat. Several studies have shown that cold temperature can activate
      pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC) neurons and increase sympathetic neuronal 
      tone to regulate WAT beiging. WAT, however, is traditionally known to be sparsely
      innervated. Details regarding the neuronal innervation and, more importantly, the
      propagation of the signal within the population of "beige" adipocytes are sparse.
      Here, we demonstrate that beige adipocytes display an increased cell-to-cell
      coupling via connexin 43 (Cx43) gap junction channels. Blocking of Cx43 channels 
      by 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid decreases POMC-activation-induced adipose tissue
      beiging. Adipocyte-specific deletion of Cx43 reduces WAT beiging to a level
      similar to that observed in denervated fat pads. In contrast, overexpression of
      Cx43 is sufficient to promote beiging even with mild cold stimuli. These data
      reveal the importance of cell-to-cell communication, effective in cold-induced
      WAT beiging, for the propagation of limited neuronal inputs in adipose tissue.

AB  - Itaconate is a newly discovered mammalian metabolite bearing significant
      implications for our understanding of cellular immunometabolism and antimicrobial
      defense. Here, we explore recent findings regarding the role of itaconate in the 
      innate immune response and highlight the emerging principle that metabolites can 
      have distinct immunological functions independent of bioenergetics.

AB  - Intercellular mitochondrial transfer has been shown in tumor models, following
      lung injury and in xenotransplants of leukemic cells, but trafficking between
      cells in the brain remains unexplored. A suggestion that mitochondria move from
      astrocytes to neurons in a model of ischemia in a recent article in Nature by
      Hayakawa et al. (2016) should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Ketone body metabolites serve as alternative energy substrates during prolonged
      fasting, calorie restriction, or reduced carbohydrate (CHO) availability. Using a
      ketone ester supplement, Cox et al. (2016) demonstrate that acute nutritional
      ketosis alters substrate utilization patterns during exercise, reduces lactate
      production, and improves time-trial performance in elite cyclists.

AB  - The pulsatility of insulin release is disturbed early in type 2 diabetes, but it 
      is not clear whether specialized pacemaker cells drive islet oscillations. In
      this issue of Cell Metabolism, Johnston et al. (2016) show that specialized hubs,
      identified as 1%-10% of beta cells with more active mitochondria and less
      insulin, synchronize beta cell oscillations.

AB  - Contrary to dogma, much physiological regulation utilizes learning from past
      experience to make responses that preemptively and effectively neutralize
      anticipated regulatory challenges. Understanding physiological regulation
      therefore requires expanding explanatory models beyond homeostasis and allostasis
      to emphasize the prominence of conditioning.

AB  - Adipose-resident invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are key players in
      metabolic regulation. iNKT cells are innate lipid sensors, and their activation, 
      using their prototypic ligand alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer), induces
      weight loss and restores glycemic control in obesity. Here, iNKT activation
      induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production and thermogenic browning
      of white fat. Complete metabolic analysis revealed that iNKT cell activation
      induced increased body temperature, V02, VC02, and fatty acid oxidation, without 
      affecting food intake or activity. FGF21 induction played a major role in iNKT
      cell-induced weight loss, as FGF21 null mice lost significantly less weight after
      alphaGalCer treatment. The glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist,
      liraglutide, also activated iNKT cells in humans and mice. In iNKT-deficient
      mice, liraglutide promoted satiety but failed to induce FGF21, resulting in less 
      weight loss. These findings reveal an iNKT cell-FGF21 axis that defines a new
      immune-mediated pathway that could be targeted for glycemic control and weight
      regulation.

AB  - Caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan from yeast to mammals, delays onset of 
      age-associated diseases, and improves metabolic health. We show that CR
      stimulates development of functional beige fat within the subcutaneous and
      visceral adipose tissue, contributing to decreased white fat and adipocyte size
      in lean C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice kept at room temperature or at thermoneutrality
      and in obese leptin-deficient mice. These metabolic changes are mediated by
      increased eosinophil infiltration, type 2 cytokine signaling, and M2 macrophage
      polarization in fat of CR animals. Suppression of the type 2 signaling, using
      Il4ra(-/-), Stat6(-/-), or mice transplanted with Stat6(-/-) bone marrow-derived 
      hematopoietic cells, prevents the CR-induced browning and abrogates the
      subcutaneous fat loss and the metabolic improvements induced by CR. These results
      provide insights into the overall energy homeostasis during CR, and they suggest 
      beige fat development as a common feature in conditions of negative energy
      balance.

AB  - Beige adipocytes gained much attention as an alternative cellular target in
      anti-obesity therapy. While recent studies have identified a number of regulatory
      circuits that promote beige adipocyte differentiation, the molecular basis of
      beige adipocyte maintenance remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that beige
      adipocytes progressively lose their morphological and molecular characteristics
      after withdrawing external stimuli and directly acquire white-like
      characteristics bypassing an intermediate precursor stage. The beige-to-white
      adipocyte transition is tightly coupled to a decrease in mitochondria, increase
      in autophagy, and activation of MiT/TFE transcription factor-mediated lysosome
      biogenesis. The autophagy pathway is crucial for mitochondrial clearance during
      the transition; inhibiting autophagy by uncoupled protein 1
      (UCP1(+))-adipocyte-specific deletion of Atg5 or Atg12 prevents beige adipocyte
      loss after withdrawing external stimuli, maintaining high thermogenic capacity
      and protecting against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. The present
      study uncovers a fundamental mechanism by which autophagy-mediated mitochondrial 
      clearance controls beige adipocyte maintenance, thereby providing new
      opportunities to counteract obesity.

AB  - The estimated heritability of human BMI is close to 75%, but identified genetic
      variants explain only a small fraction of interindividual body-weight variation. 
      Inherited epigenetic variants identified in mouse models named "metastable
      epialleles" could in principle explain this "missing heritability." We provide
      evidence that methylation in a variably methylated region (VMR) in the
      pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC), particularly in postmortem human
      laser-microdissected melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-positive neurons, is
      strongly associated with individual BMI. Using cohorts from different ethnic
      backgrounds, including a Gambian cohort, we found evidence suggesting that
      methylation of the POMC VMR is established in the early embryo and that offspring
      methylation correlates with the paternal somatic methylation pattern.
      Furthermore, it is associated with levels of maternal one-carbon metabolites at
      conception and stable during postnatal life. Together, these data suggest that
      the POMC VMR may be a human metastable epiallele that influences body-weight
      regulation.

AB  - Transcriptional and chromatin regulations mediate the liver response to nutrient 
      availability. The role of chromatin factors involved in hormonal regulation in
      response to fasting is not fully understood. We have identified SETDB2, a
      glucocorticoid-induced putative epigenetic modifier, as a positive regulator of
      GR-mediated gene activation in liver. Insig2a increases during fasting to limit
      lipid synthesis, but the mechanism of induction is unknown. We show Insig2a
      induction is GR-SETDB2 dependent. SETDB2 facilitates GR chromatin enrichment and 
      is key to glucocorticoid-dependent enhancer-promoter interactions. INSIG2 is a
      negative regulator of SREBP, and acute glucocorticoid treatment decreased active 
      SREBP during refeeding or in livers of Ob/Ob mice, both systems of elevated
      SREBP-1c-driven lipogenesis. Knockdown of SETDB2 or INSIG2 reversed the
      inhibition of SREBP processing. Overall, these studies identify a GR-SETDB2
      regulatory axis of hepatic transcriptional reprogramming and identify SETDB2 as a
      potential target for metabolic disorders with aberrant glucocorticoid actions.

AB  - Dietary iron intake and systemic iron balance are implicated in colorectal cancer
      (CRC) development, but the means by which iron contributes to CRC are unclear.
      Gene expression and functional studies demonstrated that the cellular iron
      importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), is highly expressed in CRC through
      hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha-dependent transcription. Colon-specific Dmt1
      disruption resulted in a tumor-selective inhibitory effect of proliferation in
      mouse colon tumor models. Proteomic and genomic analyses identified an
      iron-regulated signaling axis mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), JAK1,
      and STAT3 in CRC progression. A pharmacological inhibitor of DMT1 antagonized the
      ability of iron to promote tumor growth in a CRC mouse model and a
      patient-derived CRC enteroid orthotopic model. Our studies implicate a
      growth-promoting signaling network instigated by elevated intracellular iron
      levels in tumorigenesis, offering molecular insights into how a key dietary
      component may contribute to CRC.

AB  - The circadian clock is a ubiquitous timekeeping system that organizes the
      behavior and physiology of organisms over the day and night. Current models rely 
      on transcriptional networks that coordinate circadian gene expression of
      thousands of transcripts. However, recent studies have uncovered phylogenetically
      conserved redox rhythms that can occur independently of transcriptional cycles.
      Here we identify the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a critical source of the
      redox cofactor NADPH, as an important regulator of redox and transcriptional
      oscillations. Our results show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the
      PPP prolongs the period of circadian rhythms in human cells, mouse tissues, and
      fruit flies. These metabolic manipulations also cause a remodeling of circadian
      gene expression programs that involves the circadian transcription factors BMAL1 
      and CLOCK, and the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2. Thus, the PPP
      regulates circadian rhythms via NADPH metabolism, suggesting a pivotal role for
      NADPH availability in circadian timekeeping.

AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergo coordinated epigenetic and metabolic changes 
      to differentiate properly. However, the precise mechanisms by which these
      alterations are fine-tuned in the early stages of differentiation have not been
      identified. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphoserine aminotransferase 1
      (Psat1), an Oct4/Sox2/Nanog (OSN) target protein, regulates changes in
      alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), determining the fate of mouse ESCs (mESCs).
      Maintaining Psat1 levels was essential for mESC self-renewal and pluripotency.
      Moderate knockdown (KD) of Psat1 in mESCs lowered DNA 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine
      (5'-hmC) and increased histone methylation levels by downregulating permissive
      amounts of alpha-KG, ultimately accelerating differentiation. We found that
      intracellular alpha-KG declined transiently during differentiation and that its
      dysregulation by treatment with dimethyl-alpha-KG impeded differentiation.
      Further, by in vivo teratoma formation assay, pluripotency of Psat1 KD mESCs was 
      impaired, especially into the ectodermal lineage. Thus, we have established how
      Psat1 is regulated in maintaining intracellular alpha-KG levels and determining
      the fate of mESCs.

AB  - Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can self-renew or differentiate from naive or more 
      differentiated, primed, pluripotent states established by specific culture
      conditions. Increased intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) was shown to
      favor self-renewal in naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The effect of
      alphaKG or alphaKG/succinate levels on differentiation from primed human PSCs
      (hPSCs) or mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) remains unknown. We examined primed
      hPSCs and EpiSCs and show that increased alphaKG or alphaKG-to-succinate ratios
      accelerate, and elevated succinate levels delay, primed PSC differentiation.
      alphaKG has been shown to inhibit the mitochondrial ATP synthase and to regulate 
      epigenome-modifying dioxygenase enzymes. Mitochondrial uncoupling did not impede 
      alphaKG-accelerated primed PSC differentiation. Instead, alphaKG induced, and
      succinate impaired, global histone and DNA demethylation in primed PSCs. The data
      support alphaKG promotion of self-renewal or differentiation depending on the
      pluripotent state.

AB  - The arrangement of beta cells within islets of Langerhans is critical for insulin
      release through the generation of rhythmic activity. A privileged role for
      individual beta cells in orchestrating these responses has long been suspected,
      but not directly demonstrated. We show here that the beta cell population in situ
      is operationally heterogeneous. Mapping of islet functional architecture revealed
      the presence of hub cells with pacemaker properties, which remain stable over
      recording periods of 2 to 3 hr. Using a dual optogenetic/photopharmacological
      strategy, silencing of hubs abolished coordinated islet responses to glucose,
      whereas specific stimulation restored communication patterns. Hubs were
      metabolically adapted and targeted by both pro-inflammatory and glucolipotoxic
      insults to induce widespread beta cell dysfunction. Thus, the islet is wired by
      hubs, whose failure may contribute to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Exercise represents a major challenge to whole-body homeostasis. To meet this
      challenge, myriad acute and adaptive responses take place at multiple cellular
      and systemic levels. The molecular bases of skeletal muscle adaptations to
      exercise are mediated by an array of signaling events, pre- and
      post-transcriptional processes, regulation of translation, and ultimately the
      increased abundance and/or maximal activity of key proteins with roles in energy 
      provision.

AB  - Bioenergetic preferences of cancer cells foster tumor acidosis that in turn leads
      to dramatic reduction in glycolysis and glucose-derived acetyl-coenzyme A
      (acetyl-CoA). Here, we show that the main source of this critical two-carbon
      intermediate becomes fatty acid (FA) oxidation in acidic pH-adapted cancer cells.
      FA-derived acetyl-CoA not only fuels the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
      supports tumor cell respiration under acidosis, but also contributes to
      non-enzymatic mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, thereby restraining complex
      I activity and ROS production. Also, while oxidative metabolism of glutamine
      supports the canonical TCA cycle in acidic conditions, reductive carboxylation of
      glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate sustains FA synthesis. Concomitance of FA
      oxidation and synthesis is enabled upon sirtuin-mediated histone deacetylation
      and consecutive downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC2 making
      mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA degradation compatible with cytosolic lipogenesis.
      Perturbations of these regulatory processes lead to tumor growth inhibitory
      effects further identifying FA metabolism as a critical determinant of tumor cell
      proliferation under acidosis.

AB  - High-fat diet (HFD) induces low-grade chronic inflammation and insulin
      resistance. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying HFD-induced
      chronic inflammation in peripheral insulin-responsive tissues. Here, we show that
      colonic pro-inflammatory macrophages regulate insulin sensitivity under HFD
      conditions. To investigate the pathophysiological role of colonic macrophages, we
      generated macrophage-specific chemokine (C-C Motif) receptor 2 (Ccr2) knockout
      (M-Ccr2KO) and intestinal epithelial cell-specific tamoxifen-inducible Ccl2
      knockout (Vil-Ccl2KO) mice. Both strains exhibited similar body weight to control
      under HFD. However, they exhibited decreased infiltration of colonic
      pro-inflammatory macrophages, decreased intestinal permeability, and inactivation
      of the colonic inflammasome. Interestingly, they showed significantly improved
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with decreased chronic inflammation of 
      adipose tissue. Therefore, inhibition of pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration
      prevents HFD-induced insulin resistance and could be a novel therapeutic approach
      for type 2 diabetes.

      restriction imposes functional limitations on tissue physiology remains unknown. 
      We examined this question in murine skeletal muscle by specifically depleting
      Nampt, an essential enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway. Knockout mice exhibited a 
      dramatic 85% decline in intramuscular NAD content, accompanied by fiber
      degeneration and progressive loss of both muscle strength and treadmill
      endurance. Administration of the NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside rapidly
      ameliorated functional deficits and restored muscle mass despite having only a
      modest effect on the intramuscular NAD pool. Additionally, lifelong
      overexpression of Nampt preserved muscle NAD levels and exercise capacity in aged
      mice, supporting a critical role for tissue-autonomous NAD homeostasis in
      maintaining muscle mass and function.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in mammalian thermoregulation.
      The component of BAT mitochondria that permits this function is the inner
      membrane carrier protein uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). To the best of our
      knowledge, no studies have directly quantified UCP1 function in human BAT.
      Further, whether human and rodent BAT have comparable thermogenic function
      remains unknown. We employed high-resolution respirometry to determine the
      respiratory capacity, coupling control, and, most importantly, UCP1 function of
      human supraclavicular BAT and rodent interscapular BAT. Human BAT was sensitive
      to the purine nucleotide GDP, providing the first direct evidence that human BAT 
      mitochondria have thermogenically functional UCP1. Further, our data demonstrate 
      that human and rodent BAT have similar UCP1 function per mitochondrion. These
      data indicate that human and rodent BAT are qualitatively similar in terms of
      UCP1 function.

      Primates, and Rodents.

AB  - Human genetics studies have implicated GALNT2, encoding GalNAc-T2, as a regulator
      of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) metabolism, but the mechanisms
      relating GALNT2 to HDL-C remain unclear. We investigated the impact of homozygous
      GALNT2 deficiency on HDL-C in humans and mammalian models. We identified two
      humans homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in GALNT2 who demonstrated low
      HDL-C. We also found that GALNT2 loss of function in mice, rats, and nonhuman
      primates decreased HDL-C. O-glycoproteomics studies of a human GALNT2-deficient
      subject validated ANGPTL3 and ApoC-III as GalNAc-T2 targets. Additional
      glycoproteomics in rodents identified targets influencing HDL-C, including
      phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). GALNT2 deficiency reduced plasma PLTP
      activity in humans and rodents, and in mice this was rescued by reconstitution of
      hepatic Galnt2. We also found that GALNT2 GWAS SNPs associated with reduced HDL-C
      also correlate with lower hepatic GALNT2 expression. These results posit GALNT2
      as a direct modulator of HDL metabolism across mammals.

AB  - The development of LXR agonists for the treatment of coronary artery disease has 
      been challenged by undesirable properties in animal models. Here we show the
      effects of an LXR agonist on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and neutrophils in 
      human subjects. BMS-852927, a novel LXRbeta-selective compound, had favorable
      profiles in animal models with a wide therapeutic index in cynomolgus monkeys and
      mice. In healthy subjects and hypercholesterolemic patients, reverse cholesterol 
      transport pathways were induced similarly to that in animal models. However,
      increased plasma and hepatic TG, plasma LDL-C, apoB, apoE, and CETP and decreased
      circulating neutrophils were also evident. Furthermore, similar increases in
      LDL-C were observed in normocholesterolemic subjects and statin-treated patients.
      The primate model markedly underestimated human lipogenic responses and did not
      predict human neutrophil effects. These studies demonstrate both beneficial and
      adverse LXR agonist clinical responses and emphasize the importance of further
      translational research in this area.

      Recommendations for Standardized FDG-PET/CT Experiments in Humans.

AB  - Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) presence, metabolic activity, and estimated mass
      are typically measured by imaging [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in
      response to cold exposure in regions of the body expected to contain BAT, using
      positron emission tomography combined with X-ray computed tomography
      (FDG-PET/CT). Efforts to describe the epidemiology and biology of human BAT are
      hampered by diverse experimental practices, making it difficult to directly
      compare results among laboratories. An expert panel was assembled by the National
      Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases on November 4, 2014 to
      discuss minimal requirements for conducting FDG-PET/CT experiments of human BAT, 
      data analysis, and publication of results. This resulted in Brown Adipose
      Reporting Criteria in Imaging STudies (BARCIST 1.0). Since there are no fully
      validated best practices at this time, panel recommendations are meant to enhance
      comparability across experiments, but not to constrain experimental design or the
      questions that can be asked.

      effects of empagliflozin in high-risk diabetic patients, but the underlying

      of myocardial ketone oxidation is far from clear.

AB  - Immune cell recognition of bacterial products usually occurs via specific pattern
      recognition receptors, but new research recently published in Cell by Wolf et al.
      (2016) demonstrates that the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase can act as an innate
      immune sensor by binding to bacterial derived N-acetylglucosamine (NAG).

AB  - The early events linking diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin
      resistance remain poorly understood. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Kawano et 
      al. (2016) show that infiltration of colonic pro-inflammatory macrophages
      orchestrated by the intestinal CCL2/CCR2 axis kick-starts this process during
      high-fat-diet feeding.

AB  - Studies show that physical exercise can affect a range of brain and cognitive
      functions. However, little is known about the peripheral signals that initiate
      these central changes. Moon et al. (2016) provide exciting new evidence that a
      novel myokine, cathepsin B (CTSB), released with exercise is associated with
      improved memory.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are 24-hr oscillations that control a variety of biological
      processes in living systems, including two hallmarks of cancer, cell division and
      metabolism. Circadian rhythm disruption by shift work is associated with greater 
      risk for cancer development and poor prognosis, suggesting a putative
      tumor-suppressive role for circadian rhythm homeostasis. Using a genetically
      engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, we have characterized the effects 
      of circadian rhythm disruption on lung tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that both
      physiologic perturbation (jet lag) and genetic mutation of the central circadian 
      clock components decreased survival and promoted lung tumor growth and
      progression. The core circadian genes Per2 and Bmal1 were shown to have
      cell-autonomous tumor-suppressive roles in transformation and lung tumor
      progression. Loss of the central clock components led to increased c-Myc
      expression, enhanced proliferation, and metabolic dysregulation. Our findings
      demonstrate that both systemic and somatic disruption of circadian rhythms
      contribute to cancer progression.

AB  - Ketosis, the metabolic response to energy crisis, is a mechanism to sustain life 
      by altering oxidative fuel selection. Often overlooked for its metabolic
      potential, ketosis is poorly understood outside of starvation or diabetic crisis.
      Thus, we studied the biochemical advantages of ketosis in humans using a ketone
      ester-based form of nutrition without the unwanted milieu of endogenous ketone
      body production by caloric or carbohydrate restriction. In five separate studies 
      of 39 high-performance athletes, we show how this unique metabolic state improves
      physical endurance by altering fuel competition for oxidative respiration.
      Ketosis decreased muscle glycolysis and plasma lactate concentrations, while
      providing an alternative substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. Ketosis
      increased intramuscular triacylglycerol oxidation during exercise, even in the
      presence of normal muscle glycogen, co-ingested carbohydrate and elevated
      insulin. These findings may hold clues to greater human potential and a better
      understanding of fuel metabolism in health and disease.

AB  - Pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency is a rare cause of severe intractable obesity.
      Two patients have experienced dramatic weight loss in response to setmelanotide, 
      a melanocortin-4 receptor activator. The drug has potential in broader
      populations, but caution is warranted as it may act at other melanocortin
      receptors.

AB  - Vertebrate cells carry two different genomes, nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial
      (mtDNA), both encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Because of
      the extensive interactions, adaptive coevolution of the two genomes must occur to
      ensure normal mitochondrial function. To investigate whether incompatibilities
      between these two genomes could contribute to interspecies reproductive barriers,
      we performed reciprocal mtDNA replacement (MR) in zygotes between widely
      divergent Mus m. domesticus (B6) and conplastic Mus m. musculus (PWD) mice.
      Transfer of MR1 cybrid embryos (B6nDNA-PWDmtDNA) supported normal development of 
      F1 offspring with reduced male fertility but unaffected reproductive fitness in
      females. Furthermore, donor PWD mtDNA was faithfully transmitted through the
      germline into F2 and F3 generations. In contrast, reciprocal MR2
      (PWDnDNA-B6mtDNA) produced high embryonic loss and stillborn rates, suggesting an
      association between mitochondrial function and infertility. These results
      strongly suggest that functional incompatibility between nuclear and
      mitochondrial genomes contributes to interspecies reproductive isolation in
      mammals.

AB  - Peripheral processes that mediate beneficial effects of exercise on the brain
      remain sparsely explored. Here, we show that a muscle secretory factor, cathepsin
      B (CTSB) protein, is important for the cognitive and neurogenic benefits of
      running. Proteomic analysis revealed elevated levels of CTSB in conditioned
      medium derived from skeletal muscle cell cultures treated with AMP-kinase agonist
      AICAR. Consistently, running increased CTSB levels in mouse gastrocnemius muscle 
      and plasma. Furthermore, recombinant CTSB application enhanced expression of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and doublecortin (DCX) in adult
      hippocampal progenitor cells through a mechanism dependent on the multifunctional
      protein P11. In vivo, in CTSB knockout (KO) mice, running did not enhance adult
      hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory function. Interestingly, in Rhesus
      monkeys and humans, treadmill exercise elevated CTSB in plasma. In humans,
      changes in CTSB levels correlated with fitness and hippocampus-dependent memory
      function. Our findings suggest CTSB as a mediator of effects of exercise on
      cognition.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver
      disease, and there is great interest in understanding the potential role of
      alterations in mitochondrial metabolism in its pathogenesis. To address this
      question, we assessed rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in subjects with
      and without NAFLD by monitoring the rate of (13)C labeling in hepatic
      [5-(13)C]glutamate and [1-(13)C]glutamate by (13)C MRS during an infusion of
      [1-(13)C]acetate. We found that rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation were
      similar between NAFLD and control subjects. We also assessed rates of hepatic
      pyruvate cycling during an infusion of [3-(13)C]lactate by monitoring the (13)C
      label in hepatic [2-(13)C]alanine and [2-(13)C]glutamate and found that this flux
      was also similar between groups and more than 10-fold lower than previously
      reported. Contrary to previous studies, we show that hepatic mitochondrial
      oxidation and pyruvate cycling are not altered in NAFLD and do not account for
      the hepatic fat accumulation.

AB  - Beneficial effects of dietary fiber on glucose and energy homeostasis have long
      been described, focusing mostly on the production of short-chain fatty acids by
      the gut commensal bacteria. However, bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber also
      produces large amounts of succinate and, to date, no study has focused on the
      role of succinate on host metabolism. Here, we fed mice a fiber-rich diet and
      found that succinate was the most abundant carboxylic acid in the cecum. Dietary 
      succinate was identified as a substrate for intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), a
      process that improves glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, dietary succinate
      improved glucose and insulin tolerance in wild-type mice, but those effects were 
      absent in mice deficient in IGN. Conventional mice colonized with the succinate
      producer Prevotella copri exhibited metabolic benefits, which could be related to
      succinate-activated IGN. Thus, microbiota-produced succinate is a previously
      unsuspected bacterial metabolite improving glycemic control through activation of
      IGN.

AB  - The discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans presents a new
      therapeutic target for metabolic disease; however, little is known about the
      regulation of human BAT. Chronic glucocorticoid excess causes obesity in humans, 
      and glucocorticoids suppress BAT activation in rodents. We tested whether
      glucocorticoids regulate BAT activity in humans. In vivo, the glucocorticoid
      prednisolone acutely increased (18)fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by BAT (measured
      using PET/CT) in lean healthy men during mild cold exposure (16 degrees C-17
      degrees C). In addition, prednisolone increased supraclavicular skin temperature 
      (measured using infrared thermography) and energy expenditure during cold, but
      not warm, exposure in lean subjects. In vitro, glucocorticoids increased
      isoprenaline-stimulated respiration and UCP-1 in human primary brown adipocytes, 
      but substantially decreased isoprenaline-stimulated respiration and UCP-1 in
      primary murine brown and beige adipocytes. The highly species-specific regulation
      of BAT function by glucocorticoids may have important implications for the
      translation of novel treatments to activate BAT to improve metabolic health.

AB  - Brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues play distinct roles in maintaining
      whole-body energy homeostasis, and their dysfunction can contribute to
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes. The AMP-activated 
      protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular energy sensor, but its role in regulating BAT
      and WAT metabolism is unclear. We generated an inducible model for deletion of
      the two AMPK beta subunits in adipocytes (ibeta1beta2AKO) and found that
      ibeta1beta2AKO mice were cold intolerant and resistant to beta-adrenergic
      activation of BAT and beiging of WAT. BAT from ibeta1beta2AKO mice had
      impairments in mitochondrial structure, function, and markers of mitophagy. In
      response to a high-fat diet, ibeta1beta2AKO mice more rapidly developed liver
      steatosis as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. Thus, AMPK in adipocytes is
      vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, responding to pharmacological
      agents and thermal stress, and protecting against nutrient-overload-induced NAFLD
      and insulin resistance.

AB  - Naive T cell stimulation activates anabolic metabolism to fuel the transition
      from quiescence to growth and proliferation. Here we show that naive CD4(+) T
      cell activation induces a unique program of mitochondrial biogenesis and
      remodeling. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified protein dynamics during T cell
      activation. We identified substantial remodeling of the mitochondrial proteome
      over the first 24 hr of T cell activation to generate mitochondria with a
      distinct metabolic signature, with one-carbon metabolism as the most induced
      pathway. Salvage pathways and mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, fed by serine,
      contribute to purine and thymidine synthesis to enable T cell proliferation and
      survival. Genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial serine catabolic enzyme SHMT2
      impaired T cell survival in culture and antigen-specific T cell abundance in
      vivo. Thus, during T cell activation, mitochondrial proteome remodeling generates
      specialized mitochondria with enhanced one-carbon metabolism that is critical for
      T cell activation and survival.

AB  - Mutant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) can be viewed as selfish genetic elements
      that persist in a state of heteroplasmy despite having potentially deleterious
      metabolic consequences. We sought to study regulation of selfish mtDNA dynamics. 
      We establish that the large 3.1-kb deletion-bearing mtDNA variant uaDf5 is a
      selfish genome in Caenorhabditis elegans. Next, we show that uaDf5 mutant mtDNA
      replicates in addition to, not at the expense of, wild-type mtDNA. These data
      suggest the existence of a homeostatic copy-number control that is exploited by
      uaDf5 to "hitchhike" to high frequency. We also observe activation of the
      mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) in uaDf5 animals. Loss of
      UPR(mt) causes a decrease in uaDf5 frequency, whereas its constitutive activation
      increases uaDf5 levels. UPR(mt) activation protects uaDf5 from mitophagy. Taken
      together, we propose that mtDNA copy-number control and UPR(mt) represent two
      homeostatic response mechanisms that play important roles in regulating selfish
      mitochondrial genome dynamics.

AB  - Non-nutritive sweeteners like sucralose are consumed by billions of people. While
      animal and human studies have demonstrated a link between synthetic sweetener
      consumption and metabolic dysregulation, the mechanisms responsible remain
      unknown. Here we use a diet supplemented with sucralose to investigate the
      long-term effects of sweet/energy imbalance. In flies, chronic sweet/energy
      imbalance promoted hyperactivity, insomnia, glucose intolerance, enhanced sweet
      taste perception, and a sustained increase in food and calories consumed, effects
      that are reversed upon sucralose removal. Mechanistically, this response was
      mapped to the ancient insulin, catecholamine, and NPF/NPY systems and the energy 
      sensor AMPK, which together comprise a novel neuronal starvation response
      pathway. Interestingly, chronic sweet/energy imbalance promoted increased food
      intake in mammals as well, and this also occurs through an NPY-dependent
      mechanism. Together, our data show that chronic consumption of a sweet/energy
      imbalanced diet triggers a conserved neuronal fasting response and increases the 
      motivation to eat.

TI  - Effects of Gut Microbiota Manipulation by Antibiotics on Host Metabolism in Obese
      Humans: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial.

AB  - The gut microbiota has been implicated in obesity and cardiometabolic diseases,
      although evidence in humans is scarce. We investigated how gut microbiota
      manipulation by antibiotics (7-day administration of amoxicillin, vancomycin, or 
      placebo) affects host metabolism in 57 obese, prediabetic men. Vancomycin, but
      not amoxicillin, decreased bacterial diversity and reduced Firmicutes involved in
      short-chain fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, concomitant with altered plasma 
      and/or fecal metabolite concentrations. Adipose tissue gene expression of
      oxidative pathways was upregulated by antibiotics, whereas immune-related
      pathways were downregulated by vancomycin. Antibiotics did not affect
      tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, energy/substrate metabolism, postprandial
      hormones and metabolites, systemic inflammation, gut permeability, and adipocyte 
      size. Importantly, energy harvest, adipocyte size, and whole-body insulin
      sensitivity were not altered at 8-week follow-up, despite a still considerably
      altered microbial composition, indicating that interference with adult microbiota
      by 7-day antibiotic treatment has no clinically relevant impact on metabolic
      health in obese humans.

AB  - Many complex diseases have historically proven to be defiant to the best
      mono-therapeutic approaches. Several examples of combination therapies have
      largely overcome such challenges, notably for the treatment of severe
      hypertension and tuberculosis. Obesity and its consequences, such as type 2
      diabetes, have proven to be equally resistant to therapeutic approaches based on 
      single medicines. Proper management of type 2 diabetes often requires adjunctive 
      medications, and the recent registration of a few compound mixtures has set the
      precedent for combinatorial treatment of obesity. On the other hand, double or
      triple therapeutic combinations are more difficult to advance to regulatory
      approval than single molecules. More recently, several classes of novel
      unimolecular combination therapeutics have emerged with superior efficacy than
      currently prescribed options and pose the potential to reverse obesity and type 2
      diabetes. Here, we summarize the discovery, pre-clinical validation, and first
      clinical test of such peptide hormone poly-agonist drug candidates.

AB  - New "omics" tools are accelerating our ability to connect genomic variation to
      complex traits. Williams et al. (2016) reveal the power of layering quantitative 
      proteomics and metabolomics measurements into a "systems genetics" analysis of
      recombinant inbred mouse strains to unravel new aspects of mitochondrial
      metabolism.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and T cell autoimmunity have been independently
      implicated in Parkinson disease pathogenesis. In a recent publication in Cell,
      Matheoud et al. (2016) link them by describing a new mechanism, activated in
      familial forms of Parkinson disease, in which mitochondrial proteins are
      processed for recognition by CD8+ T cells.

AB  - Numerous studies have connected the gut microbiome with diet-induced obesity;
      however, mechanistic explanations for the host-microbial interactions are needed.
      Perry et al. (2016) present studies suggesting that microbially produced acetate 
      (MPA) increases post-prandial insulin release via a sequential and integrated
      gut, brain, and pancreatic signaling network promoting energy retention.

AB  - GDF11 was reported to decline with age and to have muscle and heart rejuvenating 
      effects. These reports were disputed. A Cell Metabolism paper now shows that in
      human beings, GDF11 does not decline with age and is actually a risk factor for
      frailty and other morbidities (Schafer et al., 2016).

AB  - Remodeling of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a metabolic adaptation
      accompanying inflammatory macrophage activation. During this process, endogenous 
      metabolites can adopt regulatory roles that govern specific aspects of
      inflammatory response, as recently shown for succinate, which regulates the
      pro-inflammatory IL-1beta-HIF-1alpha axis. Itaconate is one of the most highly
      induced metabolites in activated macrophages, yet its functional significance
      remains unknown. Here, we show that itaconate modulates macrophage metabolism and
      effector functions by inhibiting succinate dehydrogenase-mediated oxidation of
      succinate. Through this action, itaconate exerts anti-inflammatory effects when
      administered in vitro and in vivo during macrophage activation and
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using newly generated Irg1(-/-) mice, which lack the
      ability to produce itaconate, we show that endogenous itaconate regulates
      succinate levels and function, mitochondrial respiration, and inflammatory
      cytokine production during macrophage activation. These studies highlight
      itaconate as a major physiological regulator of the global metabolic rewiring and
      effector functions of inflammatory macrophages.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1, produced predominantly in enteroendocrine cells,
      controls glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis through regulation of islet
      hormone secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and food intake, enabling
      development of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of diabetes and
      obesity. GLP-1 also acts on the immune system to suppress inflammation, and
      GLP-1R signaling in multiple tissues impacts cardiovascular function in health
      and disease. Here we review how GLP-1 and clinically approved GLP-1R agonists
      engage mechanisms that influence the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
      We discuss how GLP-1R agonists modify inflammation, cardiovascular physiology,
      and pathophysiology in normal and diabetic animals through direct and indirect
      mechanisms and review human studies illustrating mechanisms linking GLP-1R
      signaling to modification of the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. The
      risks and benefits of GLP-1R agonists are updated in light of recent data
      suggesting that GLP-1R agonists favorably modify outcomes in diabetic subjects at
      high risk for cardiovascular events.

AB  - To investigate the biological processes that are altered in obese subjects, we
      generated cell-specific integrated networks (INs) by merging genome-scale
      metabolic, transcriptional regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks.
      We performed genome-wide transcriptomics analysis to determine the global gene
      expression changes in the liver and three adipose tissues from obese subjects
      undergoing bariatric surgery and integrated these data into the cell-specific
      INs. We found dysregulations in mannose metabolism in obese subjects and
      validated our predictions by detecting mannose levels in the plasma of the lean
      and obese subjects. We observed significant correlations between plasma mannose
      levels, BMI, and insulin resistance (IR). We also measured plasma mannose levels 
      of the subjects in two additional different cohorts and observed that an
      increased plasma mannose level was associated with IR and insulin secretion. We
      finally identified mannose as one of the best plasma metabolites in explaining
      the variance in obesity-independent IR.

AB  - The gut microbiota is considered a metabolic "organ" that not only facilitates
      harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food but also produces
      numerous metabolites that signal through their cognate receptors to regulate host
      metabolism. One such class of metabolites, bile acids, is produced in the liver
      from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut microbiota. These
      bioconversions modulate the signaling properties of bile acids via the nuclear
      farnesoid X receptor and the G protein-coupled membrane receptor 5, which
      regulate numerous metabolic pathways in the host. Conversely, bile acids can
      modulate gut microbial composition both directly and indirectly through
      activation of innate immune genes in the small intestine. Thus, host metabolism
      can be affected through microbial modifications of bile acids, which lead to
      altered signaling via bile acid receptors, but also by altered microbiota
      composition.

AB  - The sexually dimorphic distribution of adipose tissue influences the development 
      of obesity-associated pathologies. The accumulation of visceral white adipose
      tissue (VWAT) that occurs in males is detrimental to metabolic health, while
      accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SWAT) seen in females may be
      protective. Here, we show that adipocyte hyperplasia contributes directly to the 
      differential fat distribution between the sexes. In male mice, high-fat diet
      (HFD) induces adipogenesis specifically in VWAT, while in females HFD induces
      adipogenesis in both VWAT and SWAT in a sex hormone-dependent manner. We also
      show that the activation of adipocyte precursors (APs), which drives adipocyte
      hyperplasia in obesity, is regulated by the adipose depot microenvironment and
      not by cell-intrinsic mechanisms. These findings indicate that APs are plastic
      cells, which respond to both local and systemic signals that influence their
      differentiation potential independent of depot origin. Therefore, depot-specific 
      AP niches coordinate adipose tissue growth and distribution.

AB  - The marked (18)F-flurodeoxyglucose uptake by brown adipose tissue (BAT) enabled
      its identification in human positron emission tomography imaging studies. In this
      Perspective, we discuss how glucose extraction by BAT and beige adipose tissue
      (BeAT) sufficiently impacts on glycemic control. We then present a unique
      overview of the central circuits modulated by gluco-regulatory hormones,
      temperature, and glucose itself, which converge on sympathetic preganglionic
      neurons and whose activation syphon circulating glucose into BAT/BeAT. Targeted
      stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system at specific nodes to selectively
      recruit BAT/BeAT may represent a safe and effective means of treating diabetes.

AB  - Maintenance of body temperature in cold-exposed animals requires induction of
      thermogenesis and management of fuel. Here, we demonstrated that reducing ambient
      temperature attenuated diet-induced obesity (DIO), which was associated with
      increased iBAT thermogenesis and a plasma bile acid profile similar to that of
      germ-free mice. We observed a marked shift in the microbiome composition at the
      phylum and family levels within 1 day of acute cold exposure and after 4 weeks at
      12 degrees C. Gut microbiota was characterized by increased levels of
      Adlercreutzia, Mogibacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Desulfovibrio and reduced
      levels of Bacilli, Erysipelotrichaceae, and the genus rc4-4. These genera have
      been associated with leanness and obesity, respectively. Germ-free mice fed a
      high-fat diet at room temperature gained less adiposity and improved glucose
      tolerance when transplanted with caecal microbiota of mice housed at 12 degrees C
      compared to mice transplanted with microbiota from 29 degrees C. Thus, a
      microbiota-liver-BAT axis may mediate protection against obesity at reduced
      temperature.

AB  - Growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a transforming growth factor beta
      superfamily member with a controversial role in aging processes. We have
      developed a highly specific LC-MS/MS assay to quantify GDF11, resolved from its
      homolog, myostatin (MSTN), based on unique amino acid sequence features. Here, we
      demonstrate that MSTN, but not GDF11, declines in healthy men throughout aging.
      Neither GDF11 nor MSTN levels differ as a function of age in healthy women. In an
      independent cohort of older adults with severe aortic stenosis, we show that
      individuals with higher GDF11 were more likely to be frail and have diabetes or
      prior cardiac conditions. Following valve replacement surgery, higher GDF11 at
      surgical baseline was associated with rehospitalization and multiple adverse
      events. Cumulatively, our results show that GDF11 levels do not decline
      throughout aging but are associated with comorbidity, frailty, and greater
      operative risk in older adults with cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels decrease during aging and are
      involved in age-related metabolic decline. To date, the mechanism responsible for
      the age-related reduction in NAD has not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate
      that expression and activity of the NADase CD38 increase with aging and that CD38
      is required for the age-related NAD decline and mitochondrial dysfunction via a
      pathway mediated at least in part by regulation of SIRT3 activity. We also
      identified CD38 as the main enzyme involved in the degradation of the NAD
      precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in vivo, indicating that CD38 has a
      key role in the modulation of NAD-replacement therapy for aging and metabolic
      diseases.

AB  - Cells can enter quiescent states in which cell cycling and growth are suspended. 
      We find that during a long developmental arrest (quiescence) induced by
      starvation, newly hatched C. elegans acquire features associated with impaired
      proteostasis and aging: mitochondrial fission, ROS production, protein
      aggregation, decreased proteotoxic-stress resistance, and at the organismal
      level, decline of mobility and high mortality. All signs of aging but one, the
      presence of protein aggregates, were reversed upon return to development induced 
      by feeding. The endoplasmic reticulum receptor IRE-1 is completely required for
      recovery, and the downstream transcription factor XBP-1, as well as a protein
      kinase, KGB-1, are partially required. Interestingly, kgb-1(-) mutants that do
      recover fail to reverse aging-like mitochondrial phenotypes and have a short
      adult lifespan. Our study describes the first pathway that reverses phenotypes of
      aging at the exit of prolonged quiescence.

AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) is the most robust non-genetic intervention to delay
      aging. However, there are a number of emerging experimental variables that alter 
      CR responses. We investigated the role of sex, strain, and level of CR on health 
      and survival in mice. CR did not always correlate with lifespan extension,
      although it consistently improved health across strains and sexes.
      Transcriptional and metabolomics changes driven by CR in liver indicated
      anaplerotic filling of the Krebs cycle together with fatty acid fueling of
      mitochondria. CR prevented age-associated decline in the liver proteostasis
      network while increasing mitochondrial number, preserving mitochondrial
      ultrastructure and function with age. Abrogation of mitochondrial function
      negated life-prolonging effects of CR in yeast and worms. Our data illustrate the
      complexity of CR in the context of aging, with a clear separation of outcomes
      related to health and survival, highlighting complexities of translation of CR
      into human interventions.

AB  - Circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioactive osteocalcin double during
      aerobic exercise at the time levels of insulin decrease. In contrast, circulating
      levels of osteocalcin plummet early during adulthood in mice, monkeys, and humans
      of both genders. Exploring these observations revealed that osteocalcin signaling
      in myofibers is necessary for adaptation to exercise by favoring uptake and
      catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, the main nutrients of myofibers.
      Osteocalcin signaling in myofibers also accounts for most of the exercise-induced
      release of interleukin-6, a myokine that promotes adaptation to exercise in part 
      by driving the generation of bioactive osteocalcin. We further show that
      exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to enhance the exercise capacity of young
      mice and to restore to 15-month-old mice the exercise capacity of 3-month-old
      mice. This study uncovers a bone-to-muscle feedforward endocrine axis that favors
      adaptation to exercise and can reverse the age-induced decline in exercise
      capacity.

AB  - Aging has been targeted by genetic and dietary manipulation and by drugs in order
      to increase lifespan and health span in numerous models. Metformin, which has
      demonstrated protective effects against several age-related diseases in humans,
      will be tested in the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial, as the initial
      step in the development of increasingly effective next-generation drugs.

AB  - Most animals alternate periods of feeding with periods of fasting often
      coinciding with sleep. Upon >24 hr of fasting, humans, rodents, and other mammals
      enter alternative metabolic phases, which rely less on glucose and more on ketone
      body-like carbon sources. Both intermittent and periodic fasting result in
      benefits ranging from the prevention to the enhanced treatment of diseases.
      Similarly, time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which food consumption is restricted
      to certain hours of the day, allows the daily fasting period to last >12 hr, thus
      imparting pleiotropic benefits. Understanding the mechanistic link between
      nutrients and the fasting benefits is leading to the identification of
      fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) that achieve changes similar to those caused by
      fasting. Given the pleiotropic and sustained benefits of TRF and FMDs, both basic
      science and translational research are warranted to develop fasting-associated
      interventions into feasible, effective, and inexpensive treatments with the
      potential to improve healthspan.

AB  - Primary aging is the progressive and inevitable process of bodily deterioration
      during adulthood. In skeletal muscle, primary aging causes defective
      mitochondrial energetics and reduced muscle mass. Secondary aging refers to
      additional deleterious structural and functional age-related changes caused by
      diseases and lifestyle factors. Secondary aging can exacerbate deficits in
      mitochondrial function and muscle mass, concomitant with the development of
      skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Exercise opposes deleterious effects of
      secondary aging by preventing the decline in mitochondrial respiration,
      mitigating aging-related loss of muscle mass and enhancing insulin sensitivity.
      This review focuses on mechanisms by which exercise promotes "healthy aging" by
      inducing modifications in skeletal muscle.

AB  - Sex differences in longevity can provide insights into novel mechanisms of aging,
      yet they have been little studied. Surprisingly, sex-specific longevity patterns 
      are best known in wild animals. Evolutionary hypotheses accounting for longevity 
      patterns in natural populations include differential vulnerability to
      environmental hazards, differential intensity of sexual selection, and distinct
      patterns of parental care. Mechanistic hypotheses focus on hormones, asymmetric
      inheritance of sex chromosomes and mitochondria. Virtually all intensively
      studied species show conditional sex differences in longevity. Humans are the
      only species in which one sex is known to have a ubiquitous survival advantage.
      Paradoxically, although women live longer, they suffer greater morbidity
      particularly late in life. This mortality-morbidity paradox may be a consequence 
      of greater connective tissue responsiveness to sex hormones in women. Human
      females' longevity advantage may result from hormonal influences on inflammatory 
      and immunological responses, or greater resistance to oxidative damage; current
      support for these mechanisms is weak.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a complex stress response that permanently arrests the
      proliferation of cells at risk for oncogenic transformation. However, senescent
      cells can also drive phenotypes associated with aging. Although the
      senescence-associated growth arrest prevents the development of cancer, and the
      metabolism of cancer cells has been studied in depth, the metabolic causes and
      consequences of cellular senescence were largely unexplored until recently. New
      findings reveal key roles for several aspects of cellular metabolism in the
      establishment and control of senescent phenotypes. These discoveries have
      important implications for both cancer and aging. In this review, we highlight
      some of the recent links between metabolism and phenotypes that are commonly
      associated with senescent cells.

AB  - Since the discovery that rapamycin, a small molecule inhibitor of the protein
      kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), can extend the lifespan of model
      organisms including mice, interest in understanding the physiological role and
      molecular targets of this pathway has surged. While mTOR was already well known
      as a regulator of growth and protein translation, it is now clear that mTOR
      functions as a central coordinator of organismal metabolism in response to both
      environmental and hormonal signals. This review discusses recent developments in 
      our understanding of how mTOR signaling is regulated by nutrients and the role of
      the mTOR signaling pathway in key metabolic tissues. Finally, we discuss the
      molecular basis for the negative metabolic side effects associated with rapamycin
      treatment, which may serve as barriers to the adoption of rapamycin or similar
      compounds for the treatment of diseases of aging and metabolism.

AB  - Mutations resulting in reduced signaling of the growth hormone/insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1) axis are associated with increased life- and
      healthspan across model organisms. Similar findings have been noted in human
      cohorts with functional mutations in the somatotropic axis, suggesting that this 
      pathway may also be relevant to human aging and protection from age-related
      diseases. While epidemiological data indicate that low circulating IGF-1 level
      may protect aging populations from cancer, results remain inconclusive regarding 
      most other diseases. We propose that studies in humans and animals need to
      consider differences in sex, pathway function, organs, and time-specific effects 
      of GH/IGF-1 signaling in order to better define the role of the somatotropic axis
      in aging. Agents that modulate signaling of the GH/IGF-1 pathway are available
      for human use, but before they can be implemented in clinical studies that target
      aging and age-related diseases, researchers need to address the challenges
      discussed in this Review.

AB  - Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) has often been argued to be a physiological
      defense against obesity, but no empirical proof of its effectiveness in limiting 
      human body weight gain is available. We here propose an immune explanation of
      DIT-i.e., that it results from the coevolution of host and gut microbiota
      (especially Firmicutes) that ferment ingested food and proliferate, causing
      periodic, vagally mediated increases in thermogenesis aimed at curtailing their
      expansion. Because of this evolutionary adaptive significance related to the
      immune system, DIT is not effective as an "adaptation" to maintain a certain body
      mass. Were DIT an effective adaptation to prevent obesity, the current obesity
      epidemic might not have occurred.

AB  - Chemo- or radiotherapy against dividing cells in the brain can promote obesity.
      Djogo et al. (2016) suggest that the loss of NG2 glia and diminished leptin
      action in the median eminence underlie this response, likely due to the loss of
      dendrites originating in the adjacent arcuate nucleus.

AB  - The genetic mechanisms mediating longevity and maximum lifespan of the human
      species are likely different than those explaining differences in life expectancy
      and healthspan across individuals. Both of these perspectives are important and
      can be separated and explored using genomic data.

TI  - Zfp423 Maintains White Adipocyte Identity through Suppression of the Beige Cell
      Thermogenic Gene Program.

AB  - The transcriptional regulators Ebf2 and Prdm16 establish and maintain the brown
      and/or beige fat cell identity. However, the mechanisms operating in white
      adipocytes to suppress the thermogenic gene program and maintain an
      energy-storing phenotype are less understood. Here, we report that the
      transcriptional regulator Zfp423 is critical for maintaining white adipocyte
      identity through suppression of the thermogenic gene program. Zfp423 expression
      is enriched in white versus brown adipocytes and suppressed upon cold exposure.
      Doxycycline-inducible inactivation of Zfp423 in mature adipocytes, combined with 
      beta-adrenergic stimulation, triggers a conversion of differentiated
      adiponectin-expressing inguinal and gonadal adipocytes into beige-like
      adipocytes; this reprogramming event is sufficient to prevent and reverse
      diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, Zfp423 acts in
      adipocytes to inhibit the activity of Ebf2 and suppress Prdm16 activation. These 
      data identify Zfp423 as a molecular brake on adipocyte thermogenesis and suggest 
      a therapeutic strategy to unlock the thermogenic potential of white adipocytes in
      obesity.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a role in energy and
      glucose metabolism in humans. However, the physiological significance of human
      BAT in lipid metabolism remains unknown. We studied 16 overweight/obese men
      during prolonged, non-shivering cold and thermoneutral conditions using stable
      isotopic tracer methodologies in conjunction with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamps and BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT) biopsies. BAT volume was
      significantly associated with increased whole-body lipolysis, triglyceride-free
      fatty acid (FFA) cycling, FFA oxidation, and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. 
      Functional analysis of BAT and WAT demonstrated the greater thermogenic capacity 
      of BAT compared to WAT, while molecular analysis revealed a cold-induced
      upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism only in BAT. The accelerated
      mobilization and oxidation of lipids upon BAT activation supports a putative role
      for BAT in the regulation of lipid metabolism in humans.

AB  - During insulin-resistant states such as type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), insulin
      fails to suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP) yet promotes lipid synthesis. 
      This metabolic state has been termed "selective insulin resistance" to indicate a
      defect in one arm of the insulin-signaling cascade, potentially downstream of
      Akt. Here we demonstrate that Akt-dependent activation of mTORC1 and inhibition
      of Foxo1 are required and sufficient for de novo lipogenesis, suggesting that
      hepatic insulin signaling is likely to be intact in insulin-resistant states.
      Moreover, cell-nonautonomous suppression of HGP by insulin depends on a reduction
      of adipocyte lipolysis and serum FFAs but is independent of vagal efferents or
      glucagon signaling. These data are consistent with a model in which, during T2DM,
      intact liver insulin signaling drives enhanced lipogenesis while excess
      circulating FFAs become a dominant inducer of nonsuppressible HGP.

TI  - Reversal of Cytosolic One-Carbon Flux Compensates for Loss of the Mitochondrial
      Folate Pathway.

AB  - One-carbon (1C) units for purine and thymidine synthesis can be generated from
      serine by cytosolic or mitochondrial folate metabolism. The mitochondrial 1C
      pathway is consistently overexpressed in cancer. Here, we show that most but not 
      all proliferating mammalian cell lines use the mitochondrial pathway as the
      default for making 1C units. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mitochondrial pathway knockout activates cytosolic
      1C-unit production. This reversal in cytosolic flux is triggered by depletion of 
      a single metabolite, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF), and enables
      rapid cell growth in nutrient-replete conditions. Loss of the mitochondrial
      pathway, however, renders cells dependent on extracellular serine to make 1C
      units and on extracellular glycine to make glutathione. HCT-116 colon cancer
      xenografts lacking mitochondrial 1C pathway activity generate the 1C units
      required for growth by cytosolic serine catabolism. Loss of both pathways
      precludes xenograft formation. Thus, either mitochondrial or cytosolic 1C
      metabolism can support tumorigenesis, with the mitochondrial pathway required in 
      nutrient-poor conditions.

TI  - CRFR1 in AgRP Neurons Modulates Sympathetic Nervous System Activity to Adapt to
      Cold Stress and Fasting.

AB  - Signaling by the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR1) plays an 
      important role in mediating the autonomic response to stressful challenges.
      Multiple hypothalamic nuclei regulate sympathetic outflow. Although CRFR1 is
      highly expressed in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus, the identity
      of these neurons and the role of CRFR1 here are presently unknown. Our studies
      show that nearly half of Arc-CRFR1 neurons coexpress agouti-related peptide
      (AgRP), half of which originate from POMC precursors. Arc-CRFR1 neurons are
      innervated by CRF neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and CRF
      application decreases AgRP(+)CRFR1(+) neurons' excitability. Despite similar
      anatomy in both sexes, only female mice selectively lacking CRFR1 in AgRP neurons
      showed a maladaptive thermogenic response to cold and reduced hepatic glucose
      production during fasting. Thus, CRFR1, in a subset of AgRP neurons, plays a
      regulatory role that enables appropriate sympathetic nervous system activation
      and consequently protects the organism from hypothermia and hypoglycemia.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global pandemic. Genome-wide association studies
      (GWASs) have identified >100 genetic variants associated with the disease,
      including a common variant in the melatonin receptor 1 b gene (MTNR1B). Here, we 
      demonstrate increased MTNR1B expression in human islets from risk G-allele
      carriers, which likely leads to a reduction in insulin release, increasing T2D
      risk. Accordingly, in insulin-secreting cells, melatonin reduced cAMP levels, and
      MTNR1B overexpression exaggerated the inhibition of insulin release exerted by
      melatonin. Conversely, mice with a disruption of the receptor secreted more
      insulin. Melatonin treatment in a human recall-by-genotype study reduced insulin 
      secretion and raised glucose levels more extensively in risk G-allele carriers.
      Thus, our data support a model where enhanced melatonin signaling in islets
      reduces insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia and greater future risk of
      T2D. The findings also imply that melatonin physiologically serves to inhibit
      nocturnal insulin release.

AB  - mtDNA sequence alterations are challenging to generate but desirable for basic
      studies and potential correction of mtDNA diseases. Here, we report a new method 
      for transferring isolated mitochondria into somatic mammalian cells using a
      photothermal nanoblade, which bypasses endocytosis and cell fusion. The nanoblade
      rescued the pyrimidine auxotroph phenotype and respiration of rho0 cells that
      lack mtDNA. Three stable isogenic nanoblade-rescued clones grown in uridine-free 
      medium showed distinct bioenergetics profiles. Rescue lines 1 and 3 reestablished
      nucleus-encoded anapleurotic and catapleurotic enzyme gene expression patterns
      and had metabolite profiles similar to the parent cells from which the rho0
      recipient cells were derived. By contrast, rescue line 2 retained a rho0 cell
      metabolic phenotype despite growth in uridine-free selection. The known influence
      of metabolite levels on cellular processes, including epigenome modifications and
      gene expression, suggests metabolite profiling can help assess the quality and
      function of mtDNA-modified cells.

TI  - Mitochondrial OXA Translocase Plays a Major Role in Biogenesis of Inner-Membrane 
      Proteins.

AB  - The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors three protein translocases. Presequence 
      translocase and carrier translocase are essential for importing nuclear-encoded
      proteins. The oxidase assembly (OXA) translocase is required for exporting
      mitochondrial-encoded proteins; however, different views exist about its
      relevance for nuclear-encoded proteins. We report that OXA plays a dual role in
      the biogenesis of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. First, a systematic
      analysis of OXA-deficient mitochondria led to an unexpected expansion of the
      spectrum of OXA substrates imported via the presequence pathway. Second,
      biogenesis of numerous metabolite carriers depends on OXA, although they are not 
      imported by the presequence pathway. We show that OXA is crucial for the
      biogenesis of the Tim18-Sdh3 module of the carrier translocase. The export
      translocase OXA is thus required for the import of metabolite carriers by
      promoting assembly of the carrier translocase. We conclude that OXA is of central
      importance for the biogenesis of the mitochondrial inner membrane.

AB  - Heart muscle maintains blood circulation, while skeletal muscle powers skeletal
      movement. Despite having similar myofibrilar sarcomeric structures, these
      striated muscles differentially express specific sarcomere components to meet
      their distinct contractile requirements. The mechanism responsible is still
      unclear. We show here that preservation of the identity of the two striated
      muscle types depends on epigenetic repression of the alternate lineage gene
      program by the chromatin remodeling complex Chd4/NuRD. Loss of Chd4 in the heart 
      triggers aberrant expression of the skeletal muscle program, causing severe
      cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Conversely, genetic depletion of Chd4 in
      skeletal muscle causes inappropriate expression of cardiac genes and myopathy. In
      both striated tissues, mitochondrial function was also dependent on the Chd4/NuRD
      complex. We conclude that an epigenetic mechanism controls cardiac and skeletal
      muscle structural and metabolic identities and that loss of this regulation leads
      to hybrid striated muscle tissues incompatible with life.

AB  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are unique bone-marrow-derived cells that

      Furthermore, pDCs also promote T cell tolerance in sterile-inflammation
      conditions. However, the immunomodulatory role of aortic pDCs in atherosclerosis 
      has been poorly understood. Here, we identified functional mouse and human pDCs
      in the aortic intima and showed that selective, inducible pDC depletion in mice
      exacerbates atherosclerosis. Aortic pDCs expressed CCR9 and indoleamine
      2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), an enzyme involved in driving the generation of
      regulatory T cells (Tregs). As a consequence, loss of pDCs resulted in decreased 
      numbers of Tregs and reduced IL-10 levels in the aorta. Moreover, antigen
      presentation by pDCs expanded antigen-specific Tregs in the atherosclerotic
      aorta. Notably, Tregs ablation affected pDC homeostasis in diseased aorta.
      Accordingly, pDCs in human atherosclerotic aortas colocalized with Tregs.
      Collectively, we identified a mechanism of atheroprotection mediated by
      tolerogenic aortic pDCs.

AB  - The lateral parabrachial nucleus is a conduit for visceral signals that cause
      anorexia. We previously identified a subset of neurons located in the external
      lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBel) that express calcitonin gene-related peptide 
      (CGRP) and inhibit feeding when activated by illness mimetics. We report here
      that in otherwise normal mice, functional inactivation of CGRP neurons markedly
      increases meal size, with meal frequency being reduced in a compensatory manner, 
      and renders mice insensitive to the anorexic effects of meal-related satiety
      peptides. Furthermore, CGRP neurons are directly innervated by orexigenic
      hypothalamic AgRP neurons, and photostimulation of AgRP fibers supplying the PBel
      delays satiation by inhibiting CGRP neurons, thereby contributing to AgRP-driven 
      hyperphagia. By establishing a role for CGRP neurons in the control of meal
      termination and as a downstream mediator of feeding elicited by AgRP neurons,
      these findings identify a node in which hunger and satiety circuits interact to
      control feeding behavior.

AB  - While leptin is a well-known regulator of body fat mass, it remains unclear how
      circulating leptin is sensed centrally to maintain energy homeostasis. Here we
      show that genetic and pharmacological ablation of adult NG2-glia (also known as
      oligodendrocyte precursors), but not microglia, leads to primary leptin
      resistance and obesity in mice. We reveal that NG2-glia contact the dendritic
      processes of arcuate nucleus leptin receptor (LepR) neurons in the median
      eminence (ME) and that these processes degenerate upon NG2-glia elimination,
      which explains the consequential attenuation of these neurons' molecular and
      electrical responses to leptin. Our data therefore indicate that LepR dendrites
      in the ME represent the principal conduits of leptin's anorexigenic action and
      that NG2-glia are essential for their maintenance. Given that ME-directed
      X-irradiation confirmed the pharmacological and genetically mediated ablation
      effects on body weight, our findings provide a rationale for the known obesity
      risk associated with cranial radiation therapy.

AB  - Human mitochondria produce ATP and metabolites to support development and
      maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondria harbor multiple copies of a
      maternally inherited, non-nuclear genome (mtDNA) that encodes for 13 subunit
      proteins of the respiratory chain. Mutations in mtDNA occur mainly in the 24
      non-coding genes, with specific mutations implicated in early death,
      neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and diabetes. A significant
      barrier to new insights in mitochondrial biology and clinical applications for
      mtDNA disorders is our general inability to manipulate the mtDNA sequence.
      Microinjection, cytoplasmic fusion, nucleic acid import strategies, targeted
      endonucleases, and newer approaches, which include the transfer of genomic DNA,
      somatic cell reprogramming, and a photothermal nanoblade, attempt to change the
      mtDNA sequence in target cells with varying efficiencies and limitations. Here,
      we discuss the current state of manipulating mammalian mtDNA and provide an
      outlook for mitochondrial reverse genetics, which could further enable
      mitochondrial research and therapies for mtDNA diseases.

AB  - Metabolism research has made tremendous progress over the last several decades in
      establishing the adipocyte as a central rheostat in the regulation of systemic
      nutrient and energy homeostasis. Operating at multiple levels of control, the
      adipocyte communicates with organ systems to adjust gene expression,
      glucoregulatory hormone exocytosis, enzymatic reactions, and nutrient flux to
      equilibrate the metabolic demands of a positive or negative energy balance. The
      identification of these mechanisms has great potential to identify novel targets 
      for the treatment of diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Herein, we review 
      the central role of the adipocyte in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis,
      highlighting three critical mediators: adiponectin, leptin, and fatty acids.

TI  - A Deletion in the Canine POMC Gene Is Associated with Weight and Appetite in
      Obesity-Prone Labrador Retriever Dogs.

AB  - Sequencing of candidate genes for obesity in Labrador retriever dogs identified a
      14 bp deletion in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) with an allele frequency of 12%.
      The deletion disrupts the beta-MSH and beta-endorphin coding sequences and is
      associated with body weight (per allele effect of 0.33 SD), adiposity, and
      greater food motivation. Among other dog breeds, the deletion was only found in
      the closely related flat-coat retriever (FCR), where it is similarly associated
      with body weight and food motivation. The mutation is significantly more common
      in Labrador retrievers selected to become assistance dogs than pets. In
      conclusion, the deletion in POMC is a significant modifier of weight and appetite
      in Labrador retrievers and FCRs and may influence other behavioral traits.

AB  - Although men with testosterone deficiency are at increased risk for type 2
      diabetes (T2D), previous studies have ignored the role of testosterone and the
      androgen receptor (AR) in pancreatic beta cells. We show that male mice lacking
      AR in beta cells (betaARKO) exhibit decreased glucose-stimulated insulin
      secretion (GSIS), leading to glucose intolerance. The AR agonist
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) enhances GSIS in cultured male islets, an effect that
      is abolished in betaARKO(-/y) islets and human islets treated with an AR
      antagonist. In beta cells, DHT-activated AR is predominantly extranuclear and
      enhances GSIS by increasing islet cAMP and activating the protein kinase A. In
      mouse and human islets, the insulinotropic effect of DHT depends on activation of
      the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, and accordingly, DHT amplifies the 
      incretin effect of GLP-1. This study identifies AR as a novel receptor that
      enhances beta cell function, a finding with implications for the prevention of
      T2D in aging men.

AB  - Intensive efforts are focused on identifying regulators of human pancreatic islet
      cell growth and maturation to accelerate development of therapies for diabetes.
      After birth, islet cell growth and function are dynamically regulated; however,
      establishing these age-dependent changes in humans has been challenging. Here, we
      describe a multimodal strategy for isolating pancreatic endocrine and exocrine
      cells from children and adults to identify age-dependent gene expression and
      chromatin changes on a genomic scale. These profiles revealed distinct
      proliferative and functional states of islet alpha cells or beta cells and
      histone modifications underlying age-dependent gene expression changes.
      Expression of SIX2 and SIX3, transcription factors without prior known functions 
      in the pancreas and linked to fasting hyperglycemia risk, increased with age
      specifically in human islet beta cells. SIX2 and SIX3 were sufficient to enhance 
      insulin content or secretion in immature beta cells. Our work provides a unique
      resource to study human-specific regulators of islet cell maturation and
      function.

AB  - Human platelets acutely increase mitochondrial energy generation following
      stimulation. Herein, a lipidomic circuit was uncovered whereby the substrates for
      this are exclusively provided by cPLA2, including multiple fatty acids and
      oxidized species that support energy generation via beta-oxidation. This
      indicates that acute lipid membrane remodeling is required to support energetic
      demands during platelet activation. Phospholipase activity is linked to energy
      metabolism, revealing cPLA2 as a central regulator of both lipidomics and energy 
      flux. Using a lipidomic approach (LipidArrays), we also estimated the total
      number of lipids in resting, thrombin-activated, and aspirinized platelets.
      Significant diversity between genetically unrelated individuals and a wealth of
      species was revealed. Resting platelets demonstrated approximately 5,600 unique
      species, with only approximately 50% being putatively identified. Thrombin
      elevated approximately 900 lipids >2-fold with 86% newly appearing and 45%
      inhibited by aspirin supplementation, indicating COX-1 is required for major
      activation-dependent lipidomic fluxes. Many lipids were structurally identified. 
      With approximately 50% of the lipids being absent from databases, a major
      opportunity for mining lipids relevant to human health and disease is presented.

AB  - Mammary epithelial cells transition between periods of proliferation and
      quiescence during development, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy, and as a result
      of oncogenic transformation. Utilizing an organotypic 3D tissue culture model
      coupled with quantitative metabolomics and proteomics, we identified significant 
      differences in glutamate utilization between proliferating and quiescent cells.
      Relative to quiescent cells, proliferating cells catabolized more glutamate via
      transaminases to couple non-essential amino acid (NEAA) synthesis to
      alpha-ketoglutarate generation and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis. As
      cells transitioned to quiescence, glutamine consumption and transaminase
      expression were reduced, while glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) was induced,
      leading to decreased NEAA synthesis. Highly proliferative human tumors display
      high transaminase and low GLUD expression, suggesting that proliferating cancer
      cells couple glutamine consumption to NEAA synthesis to promote biosynthesis.
      These findings describe a competitive and partially redundant relationship
      between transaminases and GLUD, and they reveal how coupling of glutamate-derived
      carbon and nitrogen metabolism can be regulated to support cell proliferation.

TI  - Chronic Activation of gamma2 AMPK Induces Obesity and Reduces beta Cell Function.
PG  - 821-36

AB  - Despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology determining
      systemic energy homeostasis, the treatment of obesity remains a medical
      challenge. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed as
      an attractive strategy for the treatment of obesity and its complications. AMPK
      is a conserved, ubiquitously expressed, heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase
      whose short-term activation has multiple beneficial metabolic effects. Whether
      these translate into long-term benefits for obesity and its complications is
      unknown. Here, we observe that mice with chronic AMPK activation, resulting from 
      mutation of the AMPK gamma2 subunit, exhibit ghrelin signaling-dependent
      hyperphagia, obesity, and impaired pancreatic islet insulin secretion. Humans
      bearing the homologous mutation manifest a congruent phenotype. Our studies
      highlight that long-term AMPK activation throughout all tissues can have adverse 
      metabolic consequences, with implications for pharmacological strategies seeking 
      to chronically activate AMPK systemically to treat metabolic disease.

AB  - Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has long been considered a 
      cause of aging. However, recent studies have implicated ROS as essential
      secondary messengers. Here we show that the site of ROS production significantly 
      contributes to their apparent dual nature. We report that ROS increase with age
      as mitochondrial function deteriorates. However, we also demonstrate that
      increasing ROS production specifically through respiratory complex I reverse
      electron transport extends Drosophila lifespan. Reverse electron transport
      rescued pathogenesis induced by severe oxidative stress, highlighting the
      importance of the site of ROS production in signaling. Furthermore, preventing
      ubiquinone reduction, through knockdown of PINK1, shortens lifespan and
      accelerates aging; phenotypes that are rescued by increasing reverse electron
      transport. These results illustrate that the source of a ROS signal is vital in
      determining its effects on cellular physiology and establish that manipulation of
      ubiquinone redox state is a valid strategy to delay aging.

AB  - Impaired angiogenesis has been implicated in adipose tissue dysfunction and the
      development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Here, we report the
      unexpected finding that vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) gene
      transduction into mice inhibits obesity-associated inflammation and improves
      metabolic health without changes in body weight or ectopic lipid deposition.
      Mechanistically, the binding of VEGFB to VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1, also known as
      Flt1) activated the VEGF/VEGFR2 pathway and increased capillary density, tissue
      perfusion, and insulin supply, signaling, and function in adipose tissue.
      Furthermore, endothelial Flt1 gene deletion enhanced the effect of VEGFB,
      activating the thermogenic program in subcutaneous adipose tissue, which
      increased the basal metabolic rate, thus preventing diet-induced obesity and
      related metabolic complications. In obese and insulin-resistant mice, Vegfb gene 
      transfer, together with endothelial Flt1 gene deletion, induced weight loss and
      mitigated the metabolic complications, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of
      the VEGFB/VEGFR1 pathway.

AB  - Adaptation of organisms to ever-changing nutritional environments relies on
      sensor tissues and systemic signals. Identification of these signals would help
      understand the physiological crosstalk between organs contributing to growth and 
      metabolic homeostasis. Here we show that Eiger, the Drosophila TNF-alpha, is a
      metabolic hormone that mediates nutrient response by remotely acting on
      insulin-producing cells (IPCs). In the condition of nutrient shortage, a
      metalloprotease of the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) family is active in fat
      body (adipose-like) cells, allowing the cleavage and release of adipose Eiger in 
      the hemolymph. In the brain IPCs, Eiger activates its receptor Grindelwald,
      leading to JNK-dependent inhibition of insulin production. Therefore, we have
      identified a humoral connexion between the fat body and the brain
      insulin-producing cells relying on TNF-alpha that mediates adaptive response to
      nutrient deprivation.

AB  - T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy
      associated with Notch pathway mutations. While both normal activated and leukemic
      T cells can utilize aerobic glycolysis to support proliferation, it is unclear to
      what extent these cell populations are metabolically similar and if differences
      reveal T-ALL vulnerabilities. Here we show that aerobic glycolysis is
      surprisingly less active in T-ALL cells than proliferating normal T cells and
      that T-ALL cells are metabolically distinct. Oncogenic Notch promoted glycolysis 
      but also induced metabolic stress that activated 5' AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). 
      Unlike stimulated T cells, AMPK actively restrained aerobic glycolysis in T-ALL
      cells through inhibition of mTORC1 while promoting oxidative metabolism and
      mitochondrial Complex I activity. Importantly, AMPK deficiency or inhibition of
      Complex I led to T-ALL cell death and reduced disease burden. Thus, AMPK
      simultaneously inhibits anabolic growth signaling and is essential to promote
      mitochondrial pathways that mitigate metabolic stress and apoptosis in T-ALL.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cells undergo postnatal maturation to achieve maximal
      glucose-responsive insulin secretion, an energy intensive process. We identify
      estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) expression as a hallmark of adult, but
      not neonatal beta cells. Postnatal induction of ERRgamma drives a transcriptional
      network activating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the electron
      transport chain, and ATP production needed to drive glucose-responsive insulin
      secretion. Mice deficient in beta cell-specific ERRgamma expression are glucose
      intolerant and fail to secrete insulin in response to a glucose challenge.
      Notably, forced expression of ERRgamma in iPSC-derived beta-like cells enables
      glucose-responsive secretion of human insulin in vitro, obviating in vivo
      maturation to achieve functionality. Moreover, these cells rapidly rescue
      diabetes when transplanted into beta cell-deficient mice. These results identify 
      a key role for ERRgamma in beta cell metabolic maturation, and offer a
      reproducible, quantifiable, and scalable approach for in vitro generation of
      functional human beta cell therapeutics.

AB  - Dysregulation of circadian rhythms is associated with metabolic dysfunction, yet 
      it is unclear whether enhancing clock function can ameliorate metabolic
      disorders. In an unbiased chemical screen using fibroblasts expressing PER2::Luc,
      we identified Nobiletin (NOB), a natural polymethoxylated flavone, as a clock
      amplitude-enhancing small molecule. When administered to diet-induced obese (DIO)
      mice, NOB strongly counteracted metabolic syndrome and augmented energy
      expenditure and locomotor activity in a Clock gene-dependent manner. In db/db
      mutant mice, the clock is also required for the mitigating effects of NOB on
      metabolic disorders. In DIO mouse liver, NOB enhanced clock protein levels and
      elicited pronounced gene expression remodeling. We identified retinoid acid
      receptor-related orphan receptors as direct targets of NOB, revealing a
      pharmacological intervention that enhances circadian rhythms to combat metabolic 
      disease via the circadian gene network.

AB  - Cell metabolism and growth are matched to nutrient availability via the
      amino-acid-regulated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).
      Transporters have emerged as important amino acid sensors controlling mTOR
      recruitment and activation at the surface of multiple intracellular compartments.
      Classically, this has involved late endosomes and lysosomes, but now, in a recent
      twist, also the Golgi apparatus. Here we propose a model in which specific amino 
      acids in assorted compartments activate different mTORC1 complexes, which may
      have distinct drug sensitivities and functions. We will discuss the implications 
      of this for mTORC1 function in health and disease.

AB  - The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) is a central region known to
      maintain glucose homeostasis. Toda et al. (2016) unravel a new mechanism
      underlying VMH-dependent regulation of systemic glucose homeostasis via
      uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-mediated control of mitochondrial dynamics and
      activation of glucose-excited neurons.

AB  - One of the most predictable aspects of conscious life is the daily sleep-wake
      cycle, which is programmed by an internal clock that exerts broad effects on
      behavior and physiology. Studies of He et al. (2016) identify a small molecule
      clock modulator that improves metabolism, revealing that enhancing circadian
      function benefits health.

AB  - Thrombosis plays an important role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Platelet
      activation is an essential step in the genesis and propagation of
      atherothrombotic complications. In a recent publication, Zhu and colleagues
      report that gut microbe-derived TMAO enhances platelet responsiveness and
      thrombosis, providing a novel mechanistic connection between microbes and CVD
      (Zhu et al., 2016).

AB  - Unraveling the mechanism VEGF-receptors modulating metabolism has therapeutic
      implications. In this issue, Robciuc et al. (2016) demonstrate that VEGF-B, by
      displacing VEGF-A from VEGFR1 and activating VEGFR2, increases adipose tissue
      vascularity, improves insulin sensitivity, diminishes obesity, and alleviates
      metabolic syndrome.

AB  - High sodium intake is a major risk factor for developing hypertension in
      diabetes. Promotion of sodium excretion reduces cardiometabolic lesions in
      diabetes. However, the interaction between sodium intake and glucose homeostasis 
      remains elusive. Here, we report that high sodium intake remarkably increased
      natriuresis in wild-type mice, but this effect was blunted in adipose-specific
      PPARdelta knockout mice and diabetic mice. PPARdelta activation in perirenal fat 
      by agonist or high sodium intake inhibited renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
      (SGLT2) function, which is mediated by increased production of adipose
      adiponectin. In addition, high salt intake-induced natriuresis was impaired in
      diabetic states because of renal SGLT2 dysfunction. Type 2 diabetic patients with
      uncontrolled hyperglycemia had less natriuresis that was correlated to their
      plasma adiponectin levels. Our findings provide insights into the distinctive
      role of the PPARdelta/adiponectin/SGLT2 pathway in the regulation of sodium and
      glucose homeostasis.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are uniquely dependent on aerobic glycolysis
      to generate ATP. However, the importance of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
      has not been elucidated. Detailed amino acid profiling has revealed that
      glutamine is indispensable for the survival of hPSCs. Under glucose- and
      glutamine-depleted conditions, hPSCs quickly died due to the loss of ATP.
      Metabolome analyses showed that hPSCs oxidized pyruvate poorly and that glutamine
      was the main energy source for OXPHOS. hPSCs were unable to utilize
      pyruvate-derived citrate due to negligible expression of aconitase 2 (ACO2) and
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3 (IDH2/3) and high expression of ATP-citrate lyase.
      Cardiomyocytes with mature mitochondria were not able to survive without glucose 
      and glutamine, although they were able to use lactate to synthesize pyruvate and 
      glutamate. This distinguishing feature of hPSC metabolism allows preparation of
      clinical-grade cell sources free of undifferentiated hPSCs, which prevents tumor 
      formation during stem cell therapy.

      Insulin Resistance in Obesity.

AB  - Obesity-induced inflammation mediated by immune cells in adipose tissue appears
      to participate in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. We show that natural
      killer (NK) cells in adipose tissue play an important role. High-fat diet (HFD)
      increases NK cell numbers and the production of proinflammatory cytokines,
      notably TNFalpha, in epididymal, but not subcutaneous, fat depots. When NK cells 
      were depleted either with neutralizing antibodies or genetic ablation in
      E4bp4(+/-) mice, obesity-induced insulin resistance improved in parallel with
      decreases in both adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) numbers, and ATM and adipose
      tissue inflammation. Conversely, expansion of NK cells following IL-15
      administration or reconstitution of NK cells into E4bp4(-/-) mice increased both 
      ATM numbers and adipose tissue inflammation and exacerbated HFD-induced insulin
      resistance. These results indicate that adipose NK cells control ATMs as an
      upstream regulator potentially by producing proinflammatory mediators, including 
      TNFalpha, and thereby contribute to the development of obesity-induced insulin
      resistance.

AB  - High abundance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is linked to lower glycaemia in
      humans, leading to the belief that BAT may protect against diabetes. The
      relationship between BAT glucose utilization and systemic glucose homeostasis has
      not been defined. In this paper we have characterized glycaemic excursions and
      BAT thermogenic responses in human brown adipocytes, BAT explants, and healthy
      adults through supraclavicular temperature profiling, revealing their circadian
      coupling in vivo and in vitro, orchestrated by UCP1, GLUT4, and Rev-erbalpha
      biorhythms. Extent of glycated haemoglobin also correlated positively with
      environmental temperature among community-dwelling patients. These data uncover
      potential crosstalk between BAT and glucose regulatory pathways, evident on
      cellular, tissue, individual, and population levels, and provide impetus to
      search for BAT harnessing strategies for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction affects cellular energy metabolism, but less is known
      about the consequences for cytoplasmic biosynthetic reactions. We report that
      mtDNA replication disorders caused by TWINKLE mutations-mitochondrial myopathy
      (MM) and infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA)-remodel cellular dNTP
      pools in mice. MM muscle shows tissue-specific induction of the mitochondrial
      folate cycle, purine metabolism, and imbalanced and increased dNTP pools,
      consistent with progressive mtDNA mutagenesis. IOSCA-TWINKLE is predicted to
      hydrolyze dNTPs, consistent with low dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in the
      disease. MM muscle also modifies the cytoplasmic one-carbon cycle,
      transsulfuration, and methylation, as well as increases glucose uptake and its
      utilization for de novo serine and glutathione biosynthesis. Our evidence
      indicates that the mitochondrial replication machinery communicates with
      cytoplasmic dNTP pools and that upregulation of glutathione synthesis through
      glucose-driven de novo serine biosynthesis contributes to the metabolic stress
      response. These results are important for disorders with primary or secondary
      mtDNA instability and offer targets for metabolic therapy.

AB  - Although 5%-10% weight loss is routinely recommended for people with obesity, the
      precise effects of 5% and further weight loss on metabolic health are unclear. We
      conducted a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of 5.1% +/-
      0.9% (n = 19), 10.8% +/- 1.3% (n = 9), and 16.4% +/- 2.1% (n = 9) weight loss and
      weight maintenance (n = 14) on metabolic outcomes. 5% weight loss improved
      adipose tissue, liver and muscle insulin sensitivity, and beta cell function,
      without a concomitant change in systemic or subcutaneous adipose tissue markers
      of inflammation. Additional weight loss further improved beta cell function and
      insulin sensitivity in muscle and caused stepwise changes in adipose tissue mass,
      intrahepatic triglyceride content, and adipose tissue expression of genes
      involved in cholesterol flux, lipid synthesis, extracellular matrix remodeling,
      and oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that moderate 5% weight loss
      improves metabolic function in multiple organs simultaneously, and progressive
      weight loss causes dose-dependent alterations in key adipose tissue biological
      pathways.

AB  - Both epidemiologic and experimental animal studies demonstrate that chronic
      psychological stress exerts adverse effects on the initiation and/or progression 
      of many diseases. However, intergenerational effects of this environmental
      information remains poorly understood. Here, using a C57BL/6 mouse model of
      restraint stress, we show that offspring of stressed fathers exhibit
      hyperglycemia due to enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis and elevated expression of 
      PEPCK. Mechanistically, we identify an epigenetic alteration at the promoter
      region of the Sfmbt2 gene, a maternally imprinted polycomb gene, leading to a
      downregulation of intronic microRNA-466b-3p, which post-transcriptionally
      inhibits PEPCK expression. Importantly, hyperglycemia in F1 mice is reversed by
      RU486 treatment in fathers, and dexamethasone administration in F0 mice
      phenocopies the roles of restraint stress. Thus, we provide evidence showing the 
      effects of paternal psychological stress on the regulation of glucose metabolism 
      in offspring, which may have profound implications for our understanding of
      health and disease risk inherited from fathers.

AB  - Dietary restriction (DR) is the most powerful natural means to extend lifespan.
      Although several genes can mediate responses to alternate DR regimens, no single 
      genetic intervention has recapitulated the full effects of DR, and no unified
      system is known for different DR regimens. Here we obtain temporally resolved
      transcriptomes during calorie restriction and intermittent fasting in
      Caenorhabditis elegans and find that early and late responses involve metabolism 
      and cell cycle/DNA damage, respectively. We uncover three network modules of DR
      regulators by their target specificity. By genetic manipulations of nodes
      representing discrete modules, we induce transcriptomes that progressively
      resemble DR as multiple nodes are perturbed. Targeting all three nodes
      simultaneously results in extremely long-lived animals that are refractory to DR.
      These results and dynamic simulations demonstrate that extensive feedback
      controls among regulators may be leveraged to drive the regulatory circuitry to a
      younger steady state, recapitulating the full effect of DR.

AB  - Organismal homeostasis relies on coherent interactions among tissues,
      specifically between brain-driven functions and peripheral metabolic organs.
      Hypothalamic circuits compute metabolic information to optimize energetic
      resources, but the role of the circadian clock in these pathways remains unclear.
      We have generated mice with targeted ablation of the core-clock gene Bmal1 within
      Sf1-neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). While this mutation does not 
      affect the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the VMH clock
      controls cyclic thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a tissue that
      governs energy balance by dissipating chemical energy as heat. VMH-driven control
      is exerted through increased adrenergic signaling within the sympathetic nervous 
      system, without affecting the BAT's endogenous clock. Moreover, we show that the 
      VMH circadian clock computes light and feeding inputs to modulate basal energy
      expenditure. Thus, we reveal a previously unsuspected circuit where an
      SCN-independent, hypothalamic circadian clock controls BAT function, energy
      expenditure, and thermogenesis.

AB  - FGF21 plays a central role in energy, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. To
      characterize the pharmacologic effects of FGF21, we administered a long-acting
      FGF21 analog, PF-05231023, to obese cynomolgus monkeys. PF-05231023 caused a
      marked decrease in food intake that led to reduced body weight. To assess the
      effects of PF-05231023 in humans, we conducted a placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending-dose study in overweight/obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
      PF-05231023 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in body weight, improved
      plasma lipoprotein profile, and increased adiponectin levels. Importantly, there 
      were no significant effects of PF-05231023 on glycemic control. PF-05231023
      treatment led to dose-dependent changes in multiple markers of bone formation and
      resorption and elevated insulin-like growth factor 1. The favorable effects of
      PF-05231023 on body weight support further evaluation of this molecule for the
      treatment of obesity. Longer studies are needed to assess potential direct
      effects of FGF21 on bone in humans.

AB  - AMPK senses decreased cellular energy levels, triggering mitochondrial autophagy 
      or mitophagy through activating ULK1 and inhibiting mTORC1. In a recent report,
      Toyama et al. (2016) show that activated AMPK phosphorylation of MFF is critical 
      for mitochondrial fission. Unphosphorylatable MFF mutants block mitophagy,
      connecting AMPK to mitochondrial fission and to mitophagy.

      Intestinal Uptake.

AB  - Gastro-intestinal exclusion by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves glucose
      metabolism, independent of weight loss. Although changes in intestinal bile
      trafficking have been shown to play a role, the underlying mechanisms are
      unclear. We performed RYGB in minipigs and showed that the intestinal uptake of
      ingested glucose is blunted in the bile-deprived alimentary limb (AL). Glucose
      uptake in the AL was restored by the addition of bile, and this effect was
      abolished when active glucose intestinal transport was blocked with phlorizin.
      Sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 remained expressed in the AL, while intraluminal
      sodium content was markedly decreased. Adding sodium to the AL had the same
      effect as bile on glucose uptake. It also increased postprandial blood glucose
      response in conscious minipigs following RYGB. The decrease in intestinal uptake 
      of glucose after RYGB was confirmed in humans. Our results demonstrate that bile 
      diversion affects postprandial glucose metabolism by modulating sodium-glucose
      intestinal cotransport.

AB  - Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and disease recurrence. Yet the
      mechanisms behind this protection remain to be elucidated. In this study,
      tumor-bearing mice randomized to voluntary wheel running showed over 60%
      reduction in tumor incidence and growth across five different tumor models.
      Microarray analysis revealed training-induced upregulation of pathways associated
      with immune function. NK cell infiltration was significantly increased in tumors 
      from running mice, whereas depletion of NK cells enhanced tumor growth and
      blunted the beneficial effects of exercise. Mechanistic analyses showed that NK
      cells were mobilized by epinephrine, and blockade of beta-adrenergic signaling
      blunted training-dependent tumor inhibition. Moreover, epinephrine induced a
      selective mobilization of IL-6-sensitive NK cells, and IL-6-blocking antibodies
      blunted training-induced tumor suppression, intratumoral NK cell infiltration,
      and NK cell activation. Together, these results link exercise, epinephrine, and
      IL-6 to NK cell mobilization and redistribution, and ultimately to control of
      tumor growth.

AB  - Activation of brown and beige fat can reduce obesity and improve glucose
      homeostasis through nonshivering thermogenesis. Whether brown or beige fat also
      secretes paracrine or endocrine factors to promote and amplify adaptive
      thermogenesis is not fully explored. Here we identify Slit2, a 180 kDa member of 
      the Slit extracellular protein family, as a PRDM16-regulated secreted factor from
      beige fat cells. In isolated cells and in mice, full-length Slit2 is cleaved to
      generate several smaller fragments, and we identify an active thermogenic moiety 
      as the C-terminal fragment. This Slit2-C fragment of 50 kDa promotes adipose
      thermogenesis, augments energy expenditure, and improves glucose homeostasis in
      vivo. Mechanistically, Slit2 induces a robust activation of PKA signaling, which 
      is required for its prothermogenic activity. Our findings establish a previously 
      unknown peripheral role for Slit2 as a beige fat secreted factor that has
      therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity and related metabolic
      disorders.

AB  - Incretin mimetics are frequently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because
      they potentiate beta cell response to glucose. Clinical evidence showing
      short-term benefits of such therapeutics (e.g., liraglutide) is abundant;
      however, there have been several recent reports of unexpected complications in
      association with incretin mimetic therapy. Importantly, clinical evidence on the 
      potential effects of such agents on the beta cell and islet function during
      long-term, multiyear use remains lacking. We now show that prolonged daily
      liraglutide treatment of >200 days in humanized mice, transplanted with human
      pancreatic islets in the anterior chamber of the eye, is associated with
      compromised release of human insulin and deranged overall glucose homeostasis.
      These findings raise concern about the chronic potentiation of beta cell function
      through incretin mimetic therapy in diabetes.

AB  - Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
      Abundant data indicate that low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are causal for ASCVD; 
      a new class of LDL-lowering medicines, the PCSK9 inhibitors, will address much
      unmet medical need. Human genetics suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
      (TRL) are pro-atherogenic and have pointed to a number of protein regulators of
      lipoprotein lipase activity that are candidates for therapeutic targeting.
      Finally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol does not appear to be
      causally associated with protection from ASCVD, reinforced by the failure of
      three CETP inhibitors in CV outcome trials, but HDL function remains of interest.

AB  - Glucagon drives hepatic gluconeogenesis and maintains blood glucose levels during
      fasting. The mechanism that attenuates glucagon action following refeeding is not
      understood. The present study demonstrates an increase in perivenous liver
      hypoxia immediately after feeding, which stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor
      2alpha (HIF2alpha) in liver. The transient postprandial increase in hepatic
      HIF2alpha attenuates glucagon signaling. Hepatocyte-specific disruption of
      HIF2alpha increases postprandial blood glucose and potentiates the glucagon
      response. Independent of insulin/AKT signaling, activation of hepatic HIF2alpha
      resulted in lower blood glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and decreased
      gluconeogenesis due to blunted hepatic glucagon action. Mechanistically,
      HIF2alpha abrogated glucagon-PKA signaling by activating cAMP-phosphodiesterases 
      in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner. Repression of glucagon signaling by HIF2alpha
      ameliorated hyperglycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetes and acute
      insulin-resistant animal models. This study reveals that HIF2alpha is essential
      for the acute postprandial regulation of hepatic glucagon signaling and suggests 
      HIF2alpha as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of diabetes.

      and Brown Adipose Tissues.

AB  - FGF21 decreases plasma triglycerides (TGs) in rodents and humans; however, the
      underlying mechanism or mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we examined
      the role of FGF21 in production and disposal of TG-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in
      mice. Treatment with pharmacological doses of FGF21 acutely reduced plasma
      non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), liver TG content, and VLDL-TG secretion. In
      addition, metabolic turnover studies revealed that FGF21 facilitated the
      catabolism of TRL in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT).
      FGF21-dependent TRL processing was strongly attenuated in CD36-deficient mice and
      transgenic mice lacking lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissues. Insulin resistance
      in diet-induced obese and ob/ob mice shifted FGF21 responses from WAT toward
      energy-combusting BAT. In conclusion, FGF21 lowers plasma TGs through a dual
      mechanism: first, by reducing NEFA plasma levels and consequently hepatic VLDL
      lipidation and, second, by increasing CD36 and LPL-dependent TRL disposal in WAT 
      and BAT.

AB  - Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with chronic inflammation in
      metabolic tissues such as adipose tissue and the liver. Recently, growing
      evidence has implicated the intestinal immune system as an important contributor 
      to metabolic disease. Obesity predisposes to altered intestinal immunity and is
      associated with changes to the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function,
      gut-residing innate and adaptive immune cells, and oral tolerance to luminal
      antigens. Accordingly, the gut immune system may represent a novel therapeutic
      target for systemic inflammation in insulin resistance. This review discusses the
      emerging field of intestinal immunity in obesity-related insulin resistance and
      how it affects metabolic disease.

AB  - Cultured cells convert glucose to lactate, and glutamine is the major source of
      tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle carbon, but whether the same metabolic phenotype
      is found in tumors is less studied. We infused mice with lung cancers with
      isotope-labeled glucose or glutamine and compared the fate of these nutrients in 
      tumor and normal tissue. As expected, lung tumors exhibit increased lactate
      production from glucose. However, glutamine utilization by both lung tumors and
      normal lung was minimal, with lung tumors showing increased glucose contribution 
      to the TCA cycle relative to normal lung tissue. Deletion of enzymes involved in 
      glucose oxidation demonstrates that glucose carbon contribution to the TCA cycle 
      is required for tumor formation. These data suggest that understanding nutrient
      utilization by tumors can predict metabolic dependencies of cancers in vivo.
      Furthermore, these data argue that the in vivo environment is an important
      determinant of the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells.

AB  - Phospholipids are important determinants of membrane biophysical properties, but 
      the impact of membrane acyl chain composition on dietary-lipid absorption is
      unknown. Here we demonstrate that the LXR-responsive phospholipid-remodeling
      enzyme Lpcat3 modulates intestinal fatty acid and cholesterol absorption and is
      required for survival on a high-fat diet. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine
      thrive on carbohydrate-based chow but lose body weight rapidly and become
      moribund on a triglyceride-rich diet. Lpcat3-dependent incorporation of
      polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids is required for the efficient
      transport of dietary lipids into enterocytes. Furthermore, loss of Lpcat3
      amplifies the production of gut hormones, including GLP-1 and oleoylethanolamide,
      in response to high-fat feeding, contributing to the paradoxical cessation of
      food intake in the setting of starvation. These results reveal that membrane
      phospholipid composition is a gating factor in passive lipid absorption and
      implicate LXR-Lpcat3 signaling in a gut-brain feedback loop that couples
      absorption to food intake.

AB  - Nuclear receptors (NRs) are key regulators of gene expression and physiology.
      Nearly half of all human NRs lack endogenous ligands including estrogen-related
      receptor alpha (ERRalpha). ERRalpha has important roles in cancer, metabolism,
      and skeletal homeostasis. Affinity chromatography of tissue lipidomes with the
      ERRalpha ligand-binding domain (LBD) and subsequent transcriptional assays
      identified cholesterol as an endogenous ERRalpha agonist. Perturbation of
      cholesterol biosynthesis or inhibition of ERRalpha revealed the interdependence
      of cholesterol and ERRalpha. In bone, the effects of cholesterol, statin, and
      bisphosphonate on osteoclastogenesis require ERRalpha; and consequently,
      cholesterol-induced bone loss or bisphosphonate osteoprotection is lost in
      ERRalpha knockout mice. Furthermore, statin induction of muscle toxicity and
      cholesterol suppression of macrophage cytokine secretion are impaired by loss or 
      inhibition of ERRalpha. These findings reveal a key step in ERRalpha regulation
      and explain the actions of two highly prescribed drugs, statins and
      bisphosphonates.

      Bioenergetics to Support Postimplantation Bone Cell Survival.

AB  - Cell-based therapy is a promising strategy in regenerative medicine, but the poor
      survival rate of the implanted cells remains a major challenge and limits
      clinical translation. We preconditioned periosteal cells to the hypoxic and
      ischemic environment of the bone defect site by deleting prolyl hydroxylase
      domain-containing protein 2 (PHD2), resulting in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha
      (HIF-1alpha) stabilization. This strategy increased postimplantation cell
      survival and improved bone regeneration. The enhanced cell viability was
      angiogenesis independent but relied on combined changes in glutamine and glycogen
      metabolism. HIF-1alpha stabilization stimulated glutaminase-mediated glutathione 
      synthesis, maintaining redox homeostasis at baseline and during oxidative or
      nutrient stress. Simultaneously, HIF-1alpha signaling increased glycogen storage,
      preventing an energy deficit during nutrient or oxygen deprivation.
      Pharmacological inhibition of PHD2 recapitulated the adaptations in glutamine and
      glycogen metabolism and, consequently, the beneficial effects on cell survival.
      Thus, targeting cellular metabolism is an appealing strategy for bone
      regeneration and cell-based therapy in general.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a damage response characterized by a stable cell-cycle
      arrest and an intense secretion of cytokines. In this issue of Cell Metabolism,
      Wiley et al. (2016) report that, in the case of mitochondrial damage, senescence 
      occurs with an atypical secretory phenotype, in both adipose tissue and skin.

AB  - Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury occurs when blood supply to an organ is
      disrupted--ischemia--and then restored--reperfusion--leading to a burst of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria. It has been tacitly assumed that
      ROS production during IR is a non-specific consequence of oxygen interacting with
      dysfunctional mitochondria upon reperfusion. Recently, this view has changed,
      suggesting that ROS production during IR occurs by a defined mechanism. Here we
      survey the metabolic factors underlying IR injury and propose a unifying
      mechanism for its causes that makes sense of the huge amount of disparate data in
      this area and provides testable hypotheses and new directions for therapies.

TI  - Deletion or Inhibition of the Oxygen Sensor PHD1 Protects against Ischemic Stroke
      via Reprogramming of Neuronal Metabolism.

AB  - The oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) regulate cellular
      metabolism, but their role in neuronal metabolism during stroke is unknown. Here 
      we report that PHD1 deficiency provides neuroprotection in a murine model of
      permanent brain ischemia. This was not due to an increased collateral vessel
      network. Instead, PHD1(-/-) neurons were protected against oxygen-nutrient
      deprivation by reprogramming glucose metabolism. Indeed, PHD1(-/-) neurons
      enhanced glucose flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway by
      diverting glucose away from glycolysis. As a result, PHD1(-/-) neurons increased 
      their redox buffering capacity to scavenge oxygen radicals in ischemia.
      Intracerebroventricular injection of PHD1-antisense oligonucleotides reduced the 
      cerebral infarct size and neurological deficits following stroke. These data
      identify PHD1 as a regulator of neuronal metabolism and a potential therapeutic
      target in ischemic stroke.

AB  - SDHAF1 mutations cause a rare mitochondrial complex II (CII) deficiency, which
      manifests as infantile leukoencephalopathy with elevated levels of serum and
      white matter succinate and lactate. Here, we demonstrate that SDHAF1 contributes 
      to iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster incorporation into the Fe-S subunit of CII, SDHB.
      SDHAF1 transiently binds to aromatic peptides of SDHB through an arginine-rich
      region in its C terminus and specifically engages a Fe-S donor complex,
      consisting of the scaffold, holo-ISCU, and the co-chaperone-chaperone pair,
      HSC20-HSPA9, through an LYR motif near its N-terminal domain. Pathogenic
      mutations of SDHAF1 abrogate binding to SDHB, which impairs biogenesis of
      holo-SDHB and results in LONP1-mediated degradation of SDHB. Riboflavin treatment
      was found to ameliorate the neurologic condition of patients. We demonstrate that
      riboflavin enhances flavinylation of SDHA and reduces levels of succinate and
      Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1alpha and -2alpha, explaining the favorable
      response of patients to riboflavin.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone induced by various metabolic
      stresses, including ketogenic and high-carbohydrate diets, that regulates energy 
      homeostasis. In humans, SNPs in and around the FGF21 gene have been associated
      with macronutrient preference, including carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake.
      Here we show that FGF21 administration markedly reduces sweet and alcohol
      preference in mice and sweet preference in cynomolgus monkeys. In mice, these
      effects require the FGF21 co-receptor beta-Klotho in the central nervous system
      and correlate with reductions in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus
      accumbens. Since analogs of FGF21 are currently undergoing clinical evaluation
      for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, our findings raise the
      possibility that FGF21 administration could affect nutrient preference and other 
      reward behaviors in humans.

TI  - FGF21 Mediates Endocrine Control of Simple Sugar Intake and Sweet Taste
      Preference by the Liver.

AB  - The liver is an important integrator of nutrient metabolism, yet no liver-derived
      factors regulating nutrient preference or carbohydrate appetite have been
      identified. Here we show that the liver regulates carbohydrate intake through
      production of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which markedly 
      suppresses consumption of simple sugars, but not complex carbohydrates, proteins,
      or lipids. Genetic loss of FGF21 in mice increases sucrose consumption, whereas
      acute administration or overexpression of FGF21 suppresses the intake of both
      sugar and non-caloric sweeteners. FGF21 does not affect chorda tympani nerve
      responses to sweet tastants, instead reducing sweet-seeking behavior and meal
      size via neurons in the hypothalamus. This liver-to-brain hormonal axis likely
      represents a negative feedback loop as hepatic FGF21 production is elevated by
      sucrose ingestion. We conclude that the liver functions to regulate
      macronutrient-specific intake by producing an endocrine satiety signal that acts 
      centrally to suppress the intake of "sweets."

AB  - The mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) is a major determinant and
      indicator of cell fate, but it is not possible to assess small changes in
      Deltapsim within cells or in vivo. To overcome this, we developed an approach
      that utilizes two mitochondria-targeted probes each containing a
      triphenylphosphonium (TPP) lipophilic cation that drives their accumulation in
      response to Deltapsim and the plasma membrane potential (Deltapsip). One probe
      contains an azido moiety and the other a cyclooctyne, which react together in a
      concentration-dependent manner by "click" chemistry to form MitoClick. As the
      mitochondrial accumulation of both probes depends exponentially on Deltapsim and 
      Deltapsip, the rate of MitoClick formation is exquisitely sensitive to small
      changes in these potentials. MitoClick accumulation can then be quantified by
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach enables 
      assessment of subtle changes in membrane potentials within cells and in the mouse
      heart in vivo.

      II-Induced Hypertension via the NKCC2 Co-transporter in the Nephron.

AB  - Hypertension is among the most prevalent and catastrophic chronic diseases
      worldwide. While the efficacy of renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in
      lowering blood pressure illustrates that the RAS is broadly activated in human
      hypertension, the frequent failure of RAS inhibition to prevent or reverse
      hypertensive organ damage highlights the need for novel therapies to combat
      RAS-dependent hypertension. We previously discovered elevated levels of the
      macrophage cytokine IL-1 in the kidney in a murine model of RAS-mediated
      hypertension. Here we report that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) deficiency or blockade
      limits blood pressure elevation in this model by mitigating sodium reabsorption
      via the NKCC2 co-transporter in the nephron. In this setting, IL-1R1 activation
      prevents intra-renal myeloid cells from maturing into Ly6C(+)Ly6G(-) macrophages 
      that elaborate nitric oxide, a natriuretic hormone that suppresses NKCC2
      activity. By revealing how the innate immune system regulates tubular sodium
      transport, these experiments should lead to new immunomodulatory
      anti-hypertensive therapies.

AB  - Cellular senescence permanently arrests cell proliferation, often accompanied by 
      a multi-faceted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Loss of
      mitochondrial function can drive age-related declines in the function of many
      post-mitotic tissues, but little is known about how mitochondrial dysfunction
      affects mitotic tissues. We show here that several manipulations that compromise 
      mitochondrial function in proliferating human cells induce a senescence growth
      arrest with a modified SASP that lacks the IL-1-dependent inflammatory arm. Cells
      that underwent mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS) had lower 
      NAD+/NADH ratios, which caused both the growth arrest and prevented the
      IL-1-associated SASP through AMPK-mediated p53 activation. Progeroid mice that
      rapidly accrue mtDNA mutations accumulated senescent cells with a MiDAS SASP in
      vivo, which suppressed adipogenesis and stimulated keratinocyte differentiation
      in cell culture. Our data identify a distinct senescence response and provide a
      mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction can drive aging phenotypes.

AB  - Obesity is a heritable disorder, with children of obese fathers at higher risk of
      developing obesity. Environmental factors epigenetically influence somatic
      tissues, but the contribution of these factors to the establishment of epigenetic
      patterns in human gametes is unknown. Here, we hypothesized that weight loss
      remodels the epigenetic signature of spermatozoa in human obesity. Comprehensive 
      profiling of the epigenome of sperm from lean and obese men showed similar
      histone positioning, but small non-coding RNA expression and DNA methylation
      patterns were markedly different. In a separate cohort of morbidly obese men,
      surgery-induced weight loss was associated with a dramatic remodeling of sperm
      DNA methylation, notably at genetic locations implicated in the central control
      of appetite. Our data provide evidence that the epigenome of human spermatozoa
      dynamically changes under environmental pressure and offers insight into how
      obesity may propagate metabolic dysfunction to the next generation.

AB  - Cachexia is a wasting syndrome associated with elevated basal energy expenditure 
      and loss of adipose and muscle tissues. It accompanies many chronic diseases
      including renal failure and cancer and is an important risk factor for mortality.
      Our recent work demonstrated that tumor-derived PTHrP drives adipose tissue
      browning and cachexia. Here, we show that PTH is involved in stimulating a
      thermogenic gene program in 5/6 nephrectomized mice that suffer from cachexia.
      Fat-specific knockout of PTHR blocked adipose browning and wasting. Surprisingly,
      loss of PTHR in fat tissue also preserved muscle mass and improved muscle
      strength. Similarly, PTHR knockout mice were resistant to cachexia driven by
      tumors. Our results demonstrate that PTHrP and PTH mediate wasting through a
      common mechanism involving PTHR, and there exists an unexpected crosstalk
      mechanism between wasting of fat tissue and skeletal muscle. Targeting the
      PTH/PTHrP pathway may have therapeutic uses in humans with cachexia.

AB  - The expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) in obesity involves de novo
      differentiation of new adipocytes; however, the cellular origin of these cells
      remains unclear. Here, we utilize Zfp423(GFP) reporter mice to characterize
      adipose mural (Pdgfrbeta(+)) cells with varying levels of the preadipocyte
      commitment factor Zfp423. We find that adipose tissue contains distinct mural
      populations, with levels of Zfp423 distinguishing adipogenic from
      inflammatory-like mural cells. Using our "MuralChaser" lineage tracking system,
      we uncover adipose perivascular cells as developmental precursors of adipocytes
      formed in obesity, with adipogenesis and precursor abundance regulated in a
      depot-dependent manner. Interestingly, Pdgfrbeta(+) cells do not significantly
      contribute to the initial cold-induced recruitment of beige adipocytes in WAT; it
      is only after prolonged cold exposure that these cells differentiate into beige
      adipocytes. These results provide genetic evidence for a mural cell origin of
      white adipocytes in obesity and suggest that beige adipogenesis may originate
      from multiple sources.

AB  - The composition of gut microbiota has been associated with host metabolic
      phenotypes, but it is not known if gut bacteria may influence host appetite. Here
      we show that regular nutrient provision stabilizes exponential growth of E. coli,
      with the stationary phase occurring 20 min after nutrient supply accompanied by
      bacterial proteome changes, suggesting involvement of bacterial proteins in host 
      satiety. Indeed, intestinal infusions of E. coli stationary phase proteins
      increased plasma PYY and their intraperitoneal injections suppressed acutely food
      intake and activated c-Fos in hypothalamic POMC neurons, while their repeated
      administrations reduced meal size. ClpB, a bacterial protein mimetic of
      alpha-MSH, was upregulated in the E. coli stationary phase, was detected in
      plasma proportional to ClpB DNA in feces, and stimulated firing rate of
      hypothalamic POMC neurons. Thus, these data show that bacterial proteins produced
      after nutrient-induced E. coli growth may signal meal termination. Furthermore,
      continuous exposure to E. coli proteins may influence long-term meal pattern.

AB  - Although discussion of the obesity epidemic had become a cocktail party cliche,
      its impact on public health cannot be dismissed. In the past decade, cancer had
      joined the list of chronic debilitating diseases whose risk is substantially
      increased by hypernutrition. Here we discuss recent advances in understanding how
      obesity increases cancer risk and propose a unifying hypothesis according to
      which the major tumor-promoting mechanism triggered by hypernutrition is the
      indolent inflammation that takes place at particular organ sites, including
      liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms by which excessive
      fat deposition feeds this tumor-promoting inflammatory flame are diverse and
      tissue specific.

AB  - Tumorigenesis is dependent on the reprogramming of cellular metabolism as both
      direct and indirect consequence of oncogenic mutations. A common feature of
      cancer cell metabolism is the ability to acquire necessary nutrients from a
      frequently nutrient-poor environment and utilize these nutrients to both maintain
      viability and build new biomass. The alterations in intracellular and
      extracellular metabolites that can accompany cancer-associated metabolic
      reprogramming have profound effects on gene expression, cellular differentiation,
      and the tumor microenvironment. In this Perspective, we have organized known
      cancer-associated metabolic changes into six hallmarks: (1) deregulated uptake of
      glucose and amino acids, (2) use of opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition, 
      (3) use of glycolysis/TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthesis and NADPH
      production, (4) increased demand for nitrogen, (5) alterations in
      metabolite-driven gene regulation, and (6) metabolic interactions with the
      microenvironment. While few tumors display all six hallmarks, most display
      several. The specific hallmarks exhibited by an individual tumor may ultimately
      contribute to better tumor classification and aid in directing treatment.

      The answer to this question is central to the understanding of the causes and
      (potentially) the therapy of type 2 diabetes. In this issue of Cell Metabolism,
      El Ouaamari et al. (2016) report that increased production of the protease
      inhibitor SerpinB1 in the liver links insulin resistance to stimulation of
      beta-cell proliferation.

TI  - NANOG Metabolically Reprograms Tumor-Initiating Stem-like Cells through
      Tumorigenic Changes in Oxidative Phosphorylation and Fatty Acid Metabolism.

AB  - Stem cell markers, including NANOG, have been implicated in various cancers;
      however, the functional contribution of NANOG to cancer pathogenesis has remained
      unclear. Here, we show that NANOG is induced by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
      signaling via phosphorylation of E2F1 and that downregulation of Nanog slows down
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression induced by alcohol western diet and
      hepatitis C virus protein in mice. NANOG ChIP-seq analyses reveal that NANOG
      regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolic pathways
      required to maintain tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TICs). NANOG represses
      mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, as well as ROS
      generation, and activates fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to support TIC self-renewal 
      and drug resistance. Restoration of OXPHOS activity and inhibition of FAO renders
      TICs susceptible to a standard care chemotherapy drug for HCC, sorafenib. This
      study provides insights into the mechanisms of NANOG-mediated generation of TICs,
      tumorigenesis, and chemoresistance through reprogramming of mitochondrial

AB  - Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are not unlike common diseases. They often
      present as a spectrum of disease phenotypes that correlates poorly with the
      severity of the disease-causing mutations. This greatly impacts patient care and 
      reveals fundamental gaps in our knowledge of disease modifying biology. Systems
      biology approaches that integrate multi-omics data into molecular networks have
      significantly improved our understanding of complex diseases. Similar approaches 
      to study IEM are rare despite their complex nature. We highlight that existing
      common disease-derived datasets and networks can be repurposed to generate novel 
      mechanistic insight in IEM and potentially identify candidate modifiers. While
      understanding disease pathophysiology will advance the IEM field, the ultimate
      goal should be to understand per individual how their phenotype emerges given
      their primary mutation on the background of their whole genome, not unlike
      personalized medicine. We foresee that panomics and network strategies combined
      with recent experimental innovations will facilitate this.

AB  - Although compensatory islet hyperplasia in response to insulin resistance is a
      recognized feature in diabetes, the factor(s) that promote beta cell
      proliferation have been elusive. We previously reported that the liver is a
      source for such factors in the liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mouse, an 
      insulin resistance model that manifests islet hyperplasia. Using proteomics we
      show that serpinB1, a protease inhibitor, which is abundant in the hepatocyte
      secretome and sera derived from LIRKO mice, is the liver-derived secretory
      protein that regulates beta cell proliferation in humans, mice, and zebrafish.
      Small-molecule compounds, that partially mimic serpinB1 effects of inhibiting
      elastase activity, enhanced proliferation of beta cells, and mice lacking
      serpinB1 exhibit attenuated beta cell compensation in response to insulin
      resistance. Finally, SerpinB1 treatment of islets modulated proteins in
      growth/survival pathways. Together, these data implicate serpinB1 as an
      endogenous protein that can potentially be harnessed to enhance functional beta
      cell mass in patients with diabetes.

AB  - The integrative physiology of inter-organ communication in lipophagy regulation
      is not well understood. Lipophagy and the cytosolic lipases ATGL and HSL
      contribute to lipid droplet (LD) mobilization; however, whether autophagy
      proteins engage with lipases to promote lipid utilization remains unknown. Here, 
      we show that cold induces autophagy in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and
      activates lipophagy in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver in mice. Targeted
      activation of autophagy in POMC neurons via intra-hypothalamic rapamycin is
      sufficient to trigger lipid utilization in room temperature-housed mice.
      Conversely, inhibiting autophagy in POMC neurons or in peripheral tissues or
      denervating BAT blocks lipid utilization. Unexpectedly, the autophagosome marker 
      LC3 is mechanistically coupled to ATGL-mediated lipolysis. ATGL exhibits
      LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, and mutating a single LIR motif on ATGL
      displaces ATGL from LD and disrupts lipolysis. Thus, cold-induced activation of
      central autophagy activates lipophagy and cytosolic lipases in a complementary
      manner to mediate lipolysis in peripheral tissues.

AB  - The impact of mitochondrial protein acetylation status on neuronal function and
      vulnerability to neurological disorders is unknown. Here we show that the
      mitochondrial protein deacetylase SIRT3 mediates adaptive responses of neurons to
      bioenergetic, oxidative, and excitatory stress. Cortical neurons lacking SIRT3
      exhibit heightened sensitivity to glutamate-induced calcium overload and
      excitotoxicity and oxidative and mitochondrial stress; AAV-mediated Sirt3 gene
      delivery restores neuronal stress resistance. In models relevant to Huntington's 
      disease and epilepsy, Sirt3(-/-) mice exhibit increased vulnerability of striatal
      and hippocampal neurons, respectively. SIRT3 deficiency results in
      hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins, including superoxide
      dismutase 2 and cyclophilin D. Running wheel exercise increases the expression of
      Sirt3 in hippocampal neurons, which is mediated by excitatory glutamatergic
      neurotransmission and is essential for mitochondrial protein acetylation
      homeostasis and the neuroprotective effects of running. Our findings suggest that
      SIRT3 plays pivotal roles in adaptive responses of neurons to physiological
      challenges and resistance to degeneration.

AB  - The role of lactate in the brain has been controversial. In this issue, Machler
      et al. (2015) present data from in vivo experiments suggesting that there is a
      downward gradient of lactate in the brain. They provide a mechanistic basis for
      the proposed export of lactate from astrocytes to neurons.

AB  - Reductions in calorie intake contribute significantly to the positive outcome of 
      bariatric surgeries. However, the physiological mechanisms linking the rerouting 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to reductions in sugar cravings remain uncertain.
      We show that a duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) intervention inhibits maladaptive
      sweet appetite by acting on dopamine-responsive striatal circuitries. DJB
      disrupted the ability of recurrent sugar exposure to promote sweet appetite in
      sated animals, thereby revealing a link between recurrent duodenal sugar influx
      and maladaptive sweet intake. Unlike ingestion of a low-calorie sweetener,
      ingestion of sugar was associated with significant dopamine effluxes in the
      dorsal striatum, with glucose infusions into the duodenum inducing greater
      striatal dopamine release than equivalent jejunal infusions. Consistently,
      optogenetic activation of dopamine-excitable cells of the dorsal striatum was
      sufficient to restore maladaptive sweet appetite in sated DJB mice. Our findings 
      point to a causal link between striatal dopamine signaling and the outcomes of
      bariatric interventions.

AB  - Investigating lactate dynamics in brain tissue is challenging, partly because in 
      vivo data at cellular resolution are not available. We monitored lactate in
      cortical astrocytes and neurons of mice using the genetically encoded FRET sensor
      Laconic in combination with two-photon microscopy. An intravenous lactate
      injection rapidly increased the Laconic signal in both astrocytes and neurons,
      demonstrating high lactate permeability across tissue. The signal increase was
      significantly smaller in astrocytes, pointing to higher basal lactate levels in
      these cells, confirmed by a one-point calibration protocol. Trans-acceleration of
      the monocarboxylate transporter with pyruvate was able to reduce intracellular
      lactate in astrocytes but not in neurons. Collectively, these data provide in
      vivo evidence for a lactate gradient from astrocytes to neurons. This gradient is
      a prerequisite for a carrier-mediated lactate flux from astrocytes to neurons and
      thus supports the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle model, in which
      astrocyte-derived lactate acts as an energy substrate for neurons.

AB  - Long-term survival and antitumor immunity of adoptively transferred CD8(+) T
      cells is dependent on their metabolic fitness, but approaches to isolate
      therapeutic T cells based on metabolic features are not well established. Here we
      utilized a lipophilic cationic dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) to
      identify and isolate metabolically robust T cells based on their mitochondrial
      membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Comprehensive metabolomic and gene expression
      profiling demonstrated global features of improved metabolic fitness in
      low-DeltaPsim-sorted CD8(+) T cells. Transfer of these low-DeltaPsim T cells was 
      associated with superior long-term in vivo persistence and an enhanced capacity
      to eradicate established tumors compared with high-DeltaPsim cells. Use of
      DeltaPsim-based sorting to enrich for cells with superior metabolic features was 
      observed in CD8(+), CD4(+) T cell subsets, and long-term hematopoietic stem
      cells. This metabolism-based approach to cell selection may be broadly applicable
      to therapies involving the transfer of HSC or lymphocytes for the treatment of
      viral-associated illnesses and cancer.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cells are mostly post-mitotic, but it is unclear what locks them 
      in this state. Perturbations including uncontrolled hyperglycemia can drive beta 
      cells into more pliable states with reduced cellular insulin levels, increased
      beta cell proliferation, and hormone mis-expression, but it is unknown whether
      reduced insulin production itself plays a role. Here, we define the effects of
      approximately 50% reduced insulin production in
      Ins1(-/-):Ins2(f/f):Pdx1Cre(ERT):mTmG mice prior to robust hyperglycemia.
      Transcriptome, proteome, and network analysis revealed alleviation of chronic
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, indicated by reduced Ddit3, Trib3, and Atf4
      expression; reduced Xbp1 splicing; and reduced phospho-eIF2alpha. This state was 
      associated with hyper-phosphorylation of Akt, which is negatively regulated by
      Trib3, and with cyclinD1 upregulation. Remarkably, beta cell proliferation was
      increased 2-fold after reduced insulin production independently of hyperglycemia.
      Eventually, recombined cells mis-expressed glucagon in the hyperglycemic state.
      We conclude that the normally high rate of insulin production suppresses beta
      cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner.

AB  - VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling inhibitors are widely used in
      different cancer types; however, patient selection remains a challenge. Analyses 
      of samples from a phase III clinical trial in metastatic colorectal cancer
      testing chemotherapy versus chemotherapy with the small molecule VEGF receptors
      inhibitor cediranib identified circulating leptin levels, BMI, and a tumor
      metabolic and angiogenic gene expression signature associated with improved
      clinical outcome in patients treated with cediranib. Patients with a glycolytic
      and hypoxic/angiogenic profile were associated with increased benefit from
      cediranib, whereas patients with a high lipogenic, oxidative phosphorylation and 
      serine biosynthesis signature did not gain benefit. These findings translated to 
      pre-clinical tumor xenograft models where the same metabolic gene expression
      profiles were associated with in vivo sensitivity to cediranib as monotherapy.
      These findings suggest a link between patient physiology, tumor biology, and
      response to antiangiogenics, which may guide patient selection for VEGF therapy
      in the future.

AB  - Endogenous circadian clocks orchestrate several metabolic and signaling pathways 
      that are known to modulate lifespan, suggesting clocks as potential targets for
      manipulation of metabolism and lifespan. We report here that the core circadian
      clock genes, timeless (tim) and period (per), are required for the metabolic and 
      lifespan responses to DR in Drosophila. Consistent with the involvement of a
      circadian mechanism, DR enhances the amplitude of cycling of most circadian clock
      genes, including tim, in peripheral tissues. Mass-spectrometry-based lipidomic
      analysis suggests a role of tim in cycling of specific medium chain triglycerides
      under DR. Furthermore, overexpression of tim in peripheral tissues improves its
      oscillatory amplitude and extends lifespan under ad libitum conditions.
      Importantly, effects of tim on lifespan appear to be mediated through enhanced
      fat turnover. These findings identify a critical role for specific clock genes in
      modulating the effects of nutrient manipulation on fat metabolism and aging.

AB  - Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is activated by Caspase-1 in inflammasome complexes and
      has anti-obesity effects; however, it is not known which inflammasome regulates
      this process. We found that mice lacking the NLRP1 inflammasome phenocopy mice
      lacking IL-18, with spontaneous obesity due to intrinsic lipid accumulation. This
      is exacerbated when the mice are fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-protein
      diet, but not when mice are fed a HFD with low energy density (high fiber).
      Furthermore, mice with an activating mutation in NLRP1, and hence increased
      IL-18, have decreased adiposity and are resistant to diet-induced metabolic
      dysfunction. Feeding these mice a HFD further increased plasma IL-18
      concentrations and strikingly resulted in loss of adipose tissue mass and fatal
      cachexia, which could be prevented by genetic deletion of IL-18. Thus, NLRP1 is
      an innate immune sensor that functions in the context of metabolic stress to
      produce IL-18, preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Chronic, low-grade inflammation triggered by excess intake of dietary lipids has 
      been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, such as
      obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Although
      considerable evidence supports a causal association between inflammation and
      metabolic diseases, most tests of this link have been performed in cold-stressed 
      mice that are housed below their thermoneutral zone. We report here that
      thermoneutral housing of mice has a profound effect on the development of
      metabolic inflammation, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. Mice housed at
      thermoneutrality develop metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue and in the
      vasculature at an accelerated rate. Unexpectedly, this increased inflammatory
      response contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis but not insulin
      resistance. These findings not only suggest that metabolic inflammation can be
      uncoupled from obesity-associated insulin resistance, but also point to how
      thermal stress might limit our ability to faithfully model human diseases in
      mice.

AB  - The mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming have been revealed at multiple
      levels. However, the lack of tools to monitor different reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) has left their distinct signals and roles in reprogramming unknown. We
      hypothesized that mitochondrial flashes (mitoflashes), recently identified
      spontaneous bursts of mitochondrial superoxide signaling, play a role in
      reprogramming. Here we show that the frequency of mitoflashes transiently
      increases, accompanied by flash amplitude reduction, during the early stages of
      reprogramming. This transient activation of mitoflashes at the early stage
      enhances reprogramming, whereas sustained activation impairs reprogramming. The
      reprogramming-promoting function of mitoflashes occurs via the upregulation of
      Nanog expression that is associated with decreases in the methylation status of
      the Nanog promoter through Tet2 occupancy. Together our findings provide a
      previously unknown role for superoxide signaling mediated epigenetic regulation
      in cell fate determination.

      Muscle in Response to Muscle-Wasting Stimuli.

AB  - (Cell Metabolism 16, 613-624; November 7, 2012) In the article, we reported that 
      the expression of a mitochondrial specific E3 ligase, Mul1, was induced in
      response to wasting conditions, and that increased Mul1 expression caused
      mitophagy and muscle wasting. Following an investigation by Nanyang Technological
      University, it was determined that the first author, Sudarsanareddy Lokireddy,
      falsified data in Figures 2D, 4B, 6D, 6E, and S5B. Although other work has linked
      Mul1 with mitophagy, in order to protect the integrity of science as well as of
      our laboratory and institutes, we are retracting the paper. We sincerely
      apologize to our colleagues and readers for any adverse consequences that this
      may have caused. The co-authors agree with this statement, with the exception of 
      the first author, Sudarsanareddy Lokireddy.

TI  - Hypothalamic Amylin Acts in Concert with Leptin to Regulate Food Intake.

AB  - In this report we evaluated the functions of hypothalamic amylin in vivo and in
      vitro. Profiling of hypothalamic neurons revealed that islet amyloid polypeptide 
      (Iapp, precursor to amylin) is expressed in neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, 
      arcuate nucleus, medial preoptic area, and elsewhere. Hypothalamic expression of 
      lapp is markedly decreased in ob/ob mice and normalized by exogenous leptin. In
      slices, amylin and leptin had similar electrophysiologic effects on lateral
      hypothalamic leptin receptor ObRb-expressing neurons, while the amylin antagonist
      AC187 inhibited their activity and blunted the effect of leptin. Finally, i.c.v. 
      infusion of AC187 acutely reduced the anorectic effects of leptin. These data
      show that hypothalamic amylin is transcriptionally regulated by leptin, that it
      can act directly on ObRb neurons in concert with leptin, and that it regulates
      feeding. These findings provide a potential mechanism for the increased efficacy 
      of a metreleptin/pramlintide combination therapy for obesity.

AB  - Prospects for using the gut microbiome for personalized medicine are substantial 
      since the gut microbiome is known to modulate metabolism and varies substantially
      among individuals. Zeevi et al. (2015) demonstrate that the gut microbiota can be
      used to predict individualized blood glucose responses to particular foods, which
      differ between individuals.

AB  - In adipose tissue, there is a delicate balance between storing and expending
      energy. In this issue, Shinoda et al. (2015) use phosphoproteomics to identify
      casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a suppressor of brown adipocyte formation, providing
      insights into how adipose tissue regulates its composition of white versus brown 
      adipocytes.

AB  - The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in cancer is
      controversial because of their context-dependent ability to promote or suppress
      tumorigenesis. Piskounova et al. (2015) now show that ROS limit distant
      metastasis: only cells with increased antioxidant capacity are able to succeed in
      their purpose to metastasize.

AB  - Gut dysbiosis is associated with development of metabolic syndrome in Tlr5(-/-)
      mice, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this issue, Singh et al.
      (2015) report that augmented SCFA levels play a deleterious role in metabolic
      syndrome by promoting conversion of SFA to oleate in Tlr5(-/-) mice via increased
      liver SCD1expression.

TI  - Oncogenic Myc Induces Expression of Glutamine Synthetase through Promoter
      Demethylation.

AB  - c-Myc is known to promote glutamine usage by upregulating glutaminase (GLS),
      which converts glutamine to glutamate that is catabolized in the TCA cycle. Here 
      we report that in a number of human and murine cells and cancers, Myc induces
      elevated expression of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL), also termed glutamine
      synthetase (GS), which catalyzes the de novo synthesis of glutamine from
      glutamate and ammonia. This is through upregulation of a Myc transcriptional
      target thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which promotes active demethylation of the 
      GS promoter and its increased expression. Elevated expression of GS promotes cell
      survival under glutamine limitation, while silencing of GS decreases cell
      proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. Upon GS overexpression, increased
      glutamine enhances nucleotide synthesis and amino acid transport. These results
      demonstrate an unexpected role of Myc in inducing glutamine synthesis and suggest
      a molecular connection between DNA demethylation and glutamine metabolism in
      Myc-driven cancers.

AB  - The essential role of the brain in maintaining energy homeostasis has motivated
      the drive to define the neural circuitry that integrates external and internal
      stimuli to enact appropriate and consequential metabolic and behavioral
      responses. The hypothalamus has received significant attention in this regard
      given its ability to influence feeding behavior, yet organisms rely on a much
      broader diversity and distribution of neuronal networks to regulate both energy
      intake and expenditure. Because energy balance is a fundamental determinant of
      survival and success of an organism, it is not surprising that emerging data
      connect circuits controlling feeding and energy balance with higher brain
      functions and degenerative processes. In this review, we will highlight both
      classically defined and emerging aspects of brain control of energy homeostasis.

TI  - Fetuin B Is a Secreted Hepatocyte Factor Linking Steatosis to Impaired Glucose
      Metabolism.

AB  - Liver steatosis is associated with the development of insulin resistance and the 
      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that protein signals
      originating from steatotic hepatocytes communicate with other cells to modulate
      metabolic phenotypes. We show that the secreted factors from steatotic
      hepatocytes induce pro-inflammatory signaling and insulin resistance in cultured 
      cells. Next, we identified 168 hepatokines, of which 32 were differentially
      secreted in steatotic versus non-steatotic hepatocytes. Targeted analysis showed 
      that fetuin B was increased in humans with liver steatosis and patients with type
      2 diabetes. Fetuin B impaired insulin action in myotubes and hepatocytes and
      caused glucose intolerance in mice. Silencing of fetuin B in obese mice improved 
      glucose tolerance. We conclude that the protein secretory profile of hepatocytes 
      is altered with steatosis and is linked to inflammation and insulin resistance.
      Therefore, preventing steatosis may limit the development of dysregulated glucose
      metabolism in settings of overnutrition.

AB  - Skeletal muscle fibers differentiate into specific fiber types with distinct
      metabolic properties determined by their reliance on oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS). Using in vivo approaches, we find that OXPHOS-dependent fibers,
      compared to glycolytic fibers, contain elongated mitochondrial networks with
      higher fusion rates that are dependent on the mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2. Switching
      of a glycolytic fiber to an oxidative IIA type is associated with elongation of
      mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial fusion is linked to metabolic state. 
      Furthermore, we reveal that mitochondrial proteins are compartmentalized to
      discrete domains centered around their nuclei of origin. The domain dimensions
      are dependent on fiber type and are regulated by the mitochondrial dynamics
      proteins Mfn1, Mfn2, and Mff. Our results indicate that mitochondrial dynamics is
      tailored to fiber type physiology and provides a rationale for the segmental
      defects characteristic of aged and diseased muscle fibers.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health by interacting with
      host diet, but there is substantial inter-individual variation in the response to
      diet. Here we compared the gut microbiota composition of healthy subjects who
      exhibited improved glucose metabolism following 3-day consumption of barley
      kernel-based bread (BKB) with those who responded least to this dietary
      intervention. The Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio was higher in responders than
      non-responders after BKB. Metagenomic analysis showed that the gut microbiota of 
      responders was enriched in Prevotella copri and had increased potential to
      ferment complex polysaccharides after BKB. Finally, germ-free mice transplanted
      with microbiota from responder human donors exhibited improved glucose metabolism
      and increased abundance of Prevotella and liver glycogen content compared with
      germ-free mice that received non-responder microbiota. Our findings indicate that
      Prevotella plays a role in the BKB-induced improvement in glucose metabolism
      observed in certain individuals, potentially by promoting increased glycogen
      storage.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5
      (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis.
      Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent
      metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral
      lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type
      littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1
      expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and 
      hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice.
      Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of
      hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also 
      ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results
      underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of
      metabolic diseases.

AB  - Catecholamines promote lipolysis both in brown and white adipocytes, whereas the 
      same stimuli preferentially activate thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Molecular
      mechanisms for the adipose-selective activation of thermogenesis remain poorly
      understood. Here, we employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to map global and
      temporal phosphorylation profiles in brown, beige, and white adipocytes under
      beta3-adrenenoceptor activation and identified kinases responsible for the
      adipose-selective phosphorylation profiles. We found that casein kinase2 (CK2)
      activity is preferentially higher in white adipocytes than brown/beige
      adipocytes. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of CK2 in white adipocytes
      activates the thermogenic program in response to cAMP stimuli. Such activation is
      largely through reduced CK2-mediated phosphorylation of class I HDACs. Notably,
      inhibition of CK2 promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and leads to an increase in
      whole-body energy expenditure and ameliorates diet-induced obesity and insulin
      resistance. These results indicate that CK2 is a plausible target to rewire the
      beta3-adrenenoceptor signaling cascade that promotes thermogenesis in adipocytes.

TI  - Leptin Deficiency Shifts Mast Cells toward Anti-Inflammatory Actions and Protects
      Mice from Obesity and Diabetes by Polarizing M2 Macrophages.

AB  - Mast cells (MCs) contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. This
      study demonstrates that leptin deficiency slants MCs toward anti-inflammatory
      functions. MCs in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of lean humans and mice express 
      negligible leptin. Adoptive transfer of leptin-deficient MCs expanded ex vivo
      mitigates diet-induced and pre-established obesity and diabetes in mice.
      Mechanistic studies show that leptin-deficient MCs polarize macrophages from M1
      to M2 functions because of impaired cell signaling and an altered balance between
      pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, but do not affect T cell differentiation.
      Rampant body weight gain in ob/ob mice, a strain that lacks leptin, associates
      with reduced MC content in WAT. In ob/ob mice, genetic depletion of MCs
      exacerbates obesity and diabetes, and repopulation of ex vivo expanded ob/ob MCs 
      ameliorates these diseases.

TI  - Activation of Cardiac Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 Causes Left Ventricular
      Hypertrophy.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health threat that increases
      risk of death due to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular
      hypertrophy (LVH). Novel therapeutic targets are needed to design treatments to
      alleviate the cardiovascular burden of CKD. Previously, we demonstrated that
      circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 rise
      progressively in CKD and induce LVH through an unknown FGF receptor
      (FGFR)-dependent mechanism. Here, we report that FGF23 exclusively activates
      FGFR4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase Cgamma/calcineurin/nuclear
      factor of activated T cell signaling. A specific FGFR4-blocking antibody inhibits
      FGF23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates LVH in rats
      with CKD. Mice lacking FGFR4 do not develop LVH in response to elevated FGF23,
      whereas knockin mice carrying an FGFR4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously
      develop LVH. Thus, FGF23 promotes LVH by activating FGFR4, thereby establishing
      FGFR4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in CKD.

TI  - MYC Disrupts the Circadian Clock and Metabolism in Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1009-19

AB  - The MYC oncogene encodes MYC, a transcription factor that binds the genome
      through sites termed E-boxes (5'-CACGTG-3'), which are identical to the binding
      sites of the heterodimeric CLOCK-BMAL1 master circadian transcription factor.
      Hence, we hypothesized that ectopic MYC expression perturbs the clock by
      deregulating E-box-driven components of the circadian network in cancer cells. We
      report here that deregulated expression of MYC or N-MYC disrupts the molecular
      clock in vitro by directly inducing REV-ERBalpha to dampen expression and
      oscillation of BMAL1, and this could be rescued by knockdown of REV-ERB.
      REV-ERBalpha expression predicts poor clinical outcome for N-MYC-driven human
      neuroblastomas that have diminished BMAL1 expression, and re-expression of
      ectopic BMAL1 in neuroblastoma cell lines suppresses their clonogenicity.
      Further, ectopic MYC profoundly alters oscillation of glucose metabolism and
      perturbs glutaminolysis. Our results demonstrate an unsuspected link between
      oncogenic transformation and circadian and metabolic dysrhythmia, which we
      surmise to be advantageous for cancer.

AB  - Tumor cells frequently undergo metabolic reprogramming, but it is unknown how
      these metabolic changes relate to drug resistance. A recent article now
      demonstrates that PI3K/AKT signaling causes a metabolic switch from
      glutaminolysis to aerobic glycolysis in Notch-dependent T cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

AB  - In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Zwighaft and colleagues (Zwighaft et al., 2015)
      describe a novel mechanism through which intracellular polyamines regulate
      circadian rhythms. These findings are significant, as they add yet another layer 
      of complexity to the interplay between environmental, dietary, and organismal
      factors in the molecular control of daily behavioral oscillations.

AB  - The carotid body has long been recognized as the body's primary acute oxygen
      sensor. For decades, this organ has been reluctant to reveal mechanisms
      underlying its sensory activity. In this issue of Cell Metabolism,
      Fernandez-Aguera et al. (2015) take us closer to a fuller understanding of this
      fundamental process.

TI  - A Comprehensive Analysis of Replicative Lifespan in 4,698 Single-Gene Deletion
      Strains Uncovers Conserved Mechanisms of Aging.

AB  - Many genes that affect replicative lifespan (RLS) in the budding yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae also affect aging in other organisms such as C. elegans 
      and M. musculus. We performed a systematic analysis of yeast RLS in a set of
      4,698 viable single-gene deletion strains. Multiple functional gene clusters were
      identified, and full genome-to-genome comparison demonstrated a significant
      conservation in longevity pathways between yeast and C. elegans. Among the
      mechanisms of aging identified, deletion of tRNA exporter LOS1 robustly extended 
      lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of mechanistic Target of
      Rapamycin (mTOR) exclude Los1 from the nucleus in a Rad53-dependent manner.
      Moreover, lifespan extension from deletion of LOS1 is nonadditive with DR or mTOR
      inhibition, and results in Gcn4 transcription factor activation. Thus, the DNA
      damage response and mTOR converge on Los1-mediated nuclear tRNA export to
      regulate Gcn4 activity and aging.

TI  - IL-17A Is Increased in Humans with Primary Hyperparathyroidism and Mediates
      PTH-Induced Bone Loss in Mice.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common cause of bone loss that is modeled
      by continuous PTH (cPTH) infusion. Here we show that the inflammatory cytokine
      IL-17A is upregulated by PHPT in humans and cPTH in mice. In humans, IL-17A is
      normalized by parathyroidectomy. In mice, treatment with anti-IL-17A antibody and
      silencing of IL-17A receptor IL-17RA prevent cPTH-induced osteocytic and
      osteoblastic RANKL production and bone loss. Mechanistically, cPTH stimulates
      conventional T cell production of TNFalpha (TNF), which increases the
      differentiation of IL-17A-producing Th17 cells via TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)
      signaling in CD4(+) cells. Moreover, cPTH enhances the sensitivity of naive
      CD4(+) cells to TNF via GalphaS/cAMP/Ca(2+) signaling. Accordingly, conditional
      deletion of GalphaS in CD4(+) cells and treatment with the calcium channel
      blocker diltiazem prevents Th17 cell expansion and blocks cPTH-induced bone loss.
      Neutralization of IL-17A and calcium channel blockers may thus represent novel
      therapeutic strategies for hyperparathyroidism.

TI  - A Liver-Bone Endocrine Relay by IGFBP1 Promotes Osteoclastogenesis and Mediates
      FGF21-Induced Bone Resorption.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) promotes insulin sensitivity but causes bone 
      loss. It elevates bone resorption by an undefined non-osteoclast-autonomous
      mechanism. We have detected a pro-osteoclastogenic activity in the hepatic
      secretome that is increased by FGF21 and largely attributed to insulin-like
      growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1). Ex vivo osteoclast differentiation and 
      in vivo bone resorption are both enhanced by recombinant IGFBP1 but suppressed by
      an IGFBP1-blocking antibody. Anti-IGFBP1 treatment attenuates ovariectomy-induced
      osteoporosis and abolishes FGF21-induced bone loss while maintaining its
      insulin-sensitizing metabolic benefit. Mechanistically, IGFBP1 functions via its 
      RGD domain to bind to its receptor integrin beta1 on osteoclast precursors,
      thereby potentiating RANKL-stimulated Erk-phosphorylation and NFATc1 activation. 
      Consequently, osteoclastic integrin beta1 deletion confers resistance to the
      resorption-enhancing effects of both IGFBP1 and FGF21. Therefore, the hepatokine 
      IGFBP1 is a critical liver-bone hormonal relay that promotes osteoclastogenesis
      and bone resorption as well as an essential mediator of FGF21-induced bone loss.

TI  - Identification of AMPK Phosphorylation Sites Reveals a Network of Proteins
      Involved in Cell Invasion and Facilitates Large-Scale Substrate Prediction.

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central energy gauge that regulates
      metabolism and has been increasingly involved in non-metabolic processes and
      diseases. However, AMPK's direct substrates in non-metabolic contexts are largely
      unknown. To better understand the AMPK network, we use a chemical genetics screen
      coupled to a peptide capture approach in whole cells, resulting in identification
      of direct AMPK phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, the high-confidence AMPK
      substrates contain many proteins involved in cell motility, adhesion, and
      invasion. AMPK phosphorylation of the RHOA guanine nucleotide exchange factor
      NET1A inhibits extracellular matrix degradation, an early step in cell invasion. 
      The identification of direct AMPK phosphorylation sites also facilitates
      large-scale prediction of AMPK substrates. We provide an AMPK motif matrix and a 
      pipeline to predict additional AMPK substrates from quantitative
      phosphoproteomics datasets. As AMPK is emerging as a critical node in aging and
      pathological processes, our study identifies potential targets for therapeutic
      strategies.

TI  - Circadian Clock Control by Polyamine Levels through a Mechanism that Declines
      with Age.

AB  - Polyamines are essential polycations present in all living cells. Polyamine
      levels are maintained from the diet and de novo synthesis, and their decline with
      age is associated with various pathologies. Here we show that polyamine levels
      oscillate in a daily manner. Both clock- and feeding-dependent mechanisms
      regulate the daily accumulation of key enzymes in polyamine biosynthesis through 
      rhythmic binding of BMAL1:CLOCK to conserved DNA elements. In turn, polyamines
      control the circadian period in cultured cells and animals by regulating the
      interaction between the core clock repressors PER2 and CRY1. Importantly, we
      found that the decline in polyamine levels with age in mice is associated with a 
      longer circadian period that can be reversed upon polyamine supplementation in
      the diet. Our findings suggest a crosstalk between circadian clocks and polyamine
      biosynthesis and open new possibilities for nutritional interventions against the
      decay in clock's function with age.

AB  - O2 sensing is essential for mammalian homeostasis. Peripheral chemoreceptors such
      as the carotid body (CB) contain cells with O2-sensitive K(+) channels, which are
      inhibited by hypoxia to trigger fast adaptive cardiorespiratory reflexes. How
      variations of O2 tension (PO2) are detected and the mechanisms whereby these
      changes are conveyed to membrane ion channels have remained elusive. We have
      studied acute O2 sensing in conditional knockout mice lacking mitochondrial
      complex I (MCI) genes. We inactivated Ndufs2, which encodes a protein that
      participates in ubiquinone binding. Ndufs2-null mice lose the hyperventilatory
      response to hypoxia, although they respond to hypercapnia. Ndufs2-deficient CB
      cells have normal functions and ATP content but are insensitive to changes in
      PO2. Our data suggest that chemoreceptor cells have a specialized
      succinate-dependent metabolism that induces an MCI state during hypoxia,
      characterized by the production of reactive oxygen species and accumulation of
      reduced pyridine nucleotides, which signal neighboring K(+) channels.

AB  - Maintaining physiologic iron concentrations in tissues is critical for metabolism
      and host defense. Iron absorption in the duodenum, recycling of iron from
      senescent erythrocytes, and iron mobilization from storage in macrophages and
      hepatocytes constitute the major iron flows into plasma for distribution to
      tissues, predominantly for erythropoiesis. All iron transfer to plasma occurs
      through the iron exporter ferroportin. The concentration of functional
      membrane-associated ferroportin is controlled by its ligand, the iron-regulatory 
      hormone hepcidin, and fine-tuned by regulatory mechanisms serving iron
      homeostasis, oxygen utilization, host defense, and erythropoiesis. Fundamental
      questions about the structure and biology of ferroportin remain to be answered.

AB  - Exercise is essential in regulating energy metabolism and whole-body insulin
      sensitivity. To explore the exercise signaling network, we undertook a global
      analysis of protein phosphorylation in human skeletal muscle biopsies from
      untrained healthy males before and after a single high-intensity exercise bout,
      revealing 1,004 unique exercise-regulated phosphosites on 562 proteins. These
      included substrates of known exercise-regulated kinases (AMPK, PKA, CaMK, MAPK,
      mTOR), yet the majority of kinases and substrate phosphosites have not previously
      been implicated in exercise signaling. Given the importance of AMPK in
      exercise-regulated metabolism, we performed a targeted in vitro AMPK screen and
      employed machine learning to predict exercise-regulated AMPK substrates. We
      validated eight predicted AMPK substrates, including AKAP1, using targeted
      phosphoproteomics. Functional characterization revealed an undescribed role for
      AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of AKAP1 in mitochondrial respiration. These data 
      expose the unexplored complexity of acute exercise signaling and provide insights
      into the role of AMPK in mitochondrial biochemistry.

AB  - S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) link one-carbon
      metabolism to methylation status. However, it is unknown whether regulation of
      SAM and SAH by nutrient availability can be directly sensed to alter the kinetics
      of key histone methylation marks. We provide evidence that the status of
      methionine metabolism is sufficient to determine levels of histone methylation by
      modulating SAM and SAH. This dynamic interaction led to rapid changes in H3K4me3,
      altered gene transcription, provided feedback regulation to one-carbon
      metabolism, and could be fully recovered upon restoration of methionine.
      Modulation of methionine in diet led to changes in metabolism and histone
      methylation in the liver. In humans, methionine variability in fasting serum was 
      commensurate with concentrations needed for these dynamics and could be partly
      explained by diet. Together these findings demonstrate that flux through
      methionine metabolism and the sensing of methionine availability may allow direct
      communication to the chromatin state in cells.

AB  - A diurnal rhythm of eating-fasting promotes health, but the eating pattern of
      humans is rarely assessed. Using a mobile app, we monitored ingestion events in
      healthy adults with no shift-work for several days. Most subjects ate frequently 
      and erratically throughout wakeful hours, and overnight fasting duration
      paralleled time in bed. There was a bias toward eating late, with an estimated
      <25% of calories being consumed before noon and >35% after 6 p.m. "Metabolic
      jetlag" resulting from weekday/weekend variation in eating pattern akin to travel
      across time zones was prevalent. The daily intake duration (95% interval)
      exceeded 14.75 hr for half of the cohort. When overweight individuals with >14 hr
      eating duration ate for only 10-11 hr daily for 16 weeks assisted by a data
      visualization (raster plot of dietary intake pattern, "feedogram") that we
      developed, they reduced body weight, reported being energetic, and improved
      sleep. Benefits persisted for a year.

AB  - Canonical protein phosphatase 3/calcineurin signaling is central to numerous
      physiological processes. Here we provide evidence that calcineurin plays a
      pivotal role in controlling systemic energy and body weight homeostasis.
      Knockdown of calcineurin in Drosophila melanogaster led to a decrease in body
      weight and energy stores, and increased energy expenditure. In mice, global
      deficiency of catalytic subunit Ppp3cb, and tissue-specific ablation of
      regulatory subunit Ppp3r1 from skeletal muscle, but not adipose tissue or liver, 
      led to protection from high-fat-diet-induced obesity and comorbid sequelae.
      Ser637 hyperphosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in skeletal
      muscle of calcineurin-deficient mice was associated with mitochondrial elongation
      into power-cable-shaped filaments and increased mitochondrial respiration, but
      also with attenuated exercise performance. Our data suggest that calcineurin acts
      as highly conserved pivot for the adaptive metabolic responses to environmental
      changes such as high-fat, high-sugar diets or exercise.

AB  - Mass isotopomer multi-ordinate spectral analysis (MIMOSA) is a step-wise flux
      analysis platform to measure discrete glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolic
      rates. Importantly, direct citrate synthesis rates were obtained by deconvolving 
      the mass spectra generated from [U-(13)C6]-D-glucose labeling for
      position-specific enrichments of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, and
      citrate. Comprehensive steady-state and dynamic analyses of key metabolic rates
      (pyruvate dehydrogenase, beta-oxidation, pyruvate carboxylase, isocitrate
      dehydrogenase, and PEP/pyruvate cycling) were calculated from the
      position-specific transfer of (13)C from sequential precursors to their products.
      Important limitations of previous techniques were identified. In INS-1 cells,
      citrate synthase rates correlated with both insulin secretion and oxygen
      consumption. Pyruvate carboxylase rates were substantially lower than previously 
      reported but showed the highest fold change in response to glucose stimulation.
      In conclusion, MIMOSA measures key metabolic rates from the precursor/product
      position-specific transfer of (13)C-label between metabolites and has broad
      applicability to any glucose-oxidizing cell.

AB  - Fat and muscle lipolysis involves functional interactions of adipose triglyceride
      lipase (ATGL), alpha-beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5), and
      tissue-specific perilipins 1 and 5 (PLIN1 and PLIN5). ABHD5 potently activates
      ATGL, but this lipase-promoting activity is suppressed when ABHD5 is bound to
      PLIN proteins on lipid droplets. In adipocytes, protein kinase A (PKA)
      phosphorylation of PLIN1 rapidly releases ABHD5 to activate ATGL, but mechanisms 
      for rapid regulation of PLIN5-ABHD5 interaction in muscle are unknown. Here, we
      identify synthetic ligands that release ABHD5 from PLIN1 or PLIN5 without PKA
      activation and rapidly activate adipocyte and muscle lipolysis. Molecular imaging
      and affinity probe labeling demonstrated that ABHD5 is directly targeted by these
      synthetic ligands and additionally revealed that ABHD5-PLIN interactions are
      regulated by endogenous ligands, including long-chain acyl-CoA. Our results
      reveal a new locus of lipolysis control and suggest ABHD5 ligands might be
      developed into novel therapeutics that directly promote fat catabolism.

AB  - The effect of metabolic stress on the bone marrow microenvironment is poorly
      defined. We show that high-fat diet (HFD) decreased long-term
      Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) stem cells and shifted lymphoid to myeloid cell
      differentiation. Bone marrow niche function was impaired after HFD as shown by
      poor reconstitution of hematopoietic stem cells. HFD led to robust activation of 
      PPARgamma2, which impaired osteoblastogenesis while enhancing bone marrow
      adipogenesis. At the same time, expression of genes such as Jag-1, SDF-1, and
      IL-7 forming the bone marrow niche was highly suppressed after HFD. Moreover,
      structural changes of microbiota were associated to HFD-induced bone marrow
      changes. Antibiotic treatment partially rescued HFD-mediated effects on the bone 
      marrow niche, while transplantation of stools from HFD mice could transfer the
      effect to normal mice. These findings show that metabolic stress affects the bone
      marrow niche by alterations of gut microbiota and osteoblast-adipocyte
      homeostasis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a complex
      neurodegenerative disease beginning decades prior to the cognitive decline. While
      cognitive deficits remain the cardinal manifestation of AD, metabolic and
      non-cognitive abnormalities, such as alterations in body weight and
      neuroendocrine functions, are also present, often preceding the cognitive
      decline. Furthermore, hypothalamic dysfunction can also be a driver of AD
      pathology. Here we offer a brief appraisal of hypothalamic dysfunction in AD and 
      provide insight into an underappreciated dual role of the hypothalamus as both a 
      culprit and target of AD pathology, as well as into new opportunities for
      therapeutic interventions and biomarker development.

AB  - Since brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy through UCP1, BAT has garnered
      attention as a therapeutic intervention for obesity and metabolic diseases
      including type 2 diabetes. As we better understand the physiological roles of
      classical brown and beige adipocytes, it is becoming clear that BAT is not simply
      a heat-generating organ. Increased beige fat mass in response to a variety of
      external/internal cues is associated with significant improvements in glucose and
      lipid homeostasis that may not be entirely mediated by UCP1. We aim to discuss
      recent insights regarding the developmental lineages, molecular regulation, and
      new functions for brown and beige adipocytes.

AB  - While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly cleared from the body following
      systemic transplantation, their therapeutic benefits typically persist. In this
      issue, Liu et al. (2015) reveal that the ability of transplanted MSCs to
      alleviate osteoporosis in systemic lupus erythematosus is maintained through
      epigenetic changes conferred by secretory action of the MSCs.

AB  - Hunger increases physical activity and stamina to support food-directed foraging 
      behaviors, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this issue, Fernandes et al.
      (2015) show that disruption of leptin-regulated STAT3 signaling in midbrain
      dopamine neurons increases the rewarding effects of running in mice, which could 
      explain the "high" experienced by endurance runners.

AB  - GWAS have yielded many candidate loci for complex diseases like obesity, but
      interpreting the biological context of these findings has been difficult.
      Claussnitzer et al. (2015) use a sophisticated combination of bioinformatic and
      experimental approaches to address this bottleneck for variants in the FTO locus 
      that associate with obesity.

AB  - Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation and
      growth of primary tumor cells, little is known about how metabolic alterations
      impact metastasis. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Dupuy et al. (2015) show
      that primary breast cancer cells display metabolic heterogeneity, and that their 
      distinct metabolic programs define their sites of metastasis.

      Regulates Mitochondrial Ca(2+) Uptake.

AB  - The essential oxidoreductase Mia40/CHCHD4 mediates disulfide bond formation and
      protein folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Here, we investigated
      the interactome of Mia40 thereby revealing links between thiol-oxidation and
      apoptosis, energy metabolism, and Ca(2+) signaling. Among the interaction
      partners of Mia40 is MICU1-the regulator of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter
      (MCU), which transfers Ca(2+) across the inner membrane. We examined the
      biogenesis of MICU1 and find that Mia40 introduces an intermolecular disulfide
      bond that links MICU1 and its inhibitory paralog MICU2 in a heterodimer. Absence 
      of this disulfide bond results in increased receptor-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+)
      uptake. In the presence of the disulfide bond, MICU1-MICU2 heterodimer binding to
      MCU is controlled by Ca(2+) levels: the dimer associates with MCU at low levels
      of Ca(2+) and dissociates upon high Ca(2+) concentrations. Our findings support a
      model in which mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is regulated by a Ca(2+)-dependent
      remodeling of the uniporter complex.

AB  - Mitochondria undergo architectural/functional changes in response to metabolic
      inputs. How this process is regulated in physiological feeding/fasting states
      remains unclear. Here we show that mitochondrial dynamics (notably fission and
      mitophagy) and biogenesis are transcriptional targets of the circadian regulator 
      Bmal1 in mouse liver and exhibit a metabolic rhythm in sync with diurnal
      bioenergetic demands. Bmal1 loss-of-function causes swollen mitochondria
      incapable of adapting to different nutrient conditions accompanied by diminished 
      respiration and elevated oxidative stress. Consequently, liver-specific Bmal1
      knockout (LBmal1KO) mice accumulate oxidative damage and develop hepatic insulin 
      resistance. Restoration of hepatic Bmal1 activities in high-fat-fed mice improves
      metabolic outcomes, whereas expression of Fis1, a fission protein that promotes
      quality control, rescues morphological/metabolic defects of LBmal1KO
      mitochondria. Interestingly, Bmal1 homolog AHA-1 in C. elegans retains the
      ability to modulate oxidative metabolism and lifespan despite lacking circadian
      regulation. These results suggest clock genes are evolutionarily conserved
      energetics regulators.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cellular transformation, yet little is
      known about metabolic changes that accompany tumor metastasis. Here we show that 
      primary breast cancer cells display extensive metabolic heterogeneity and engage 
      distinct metabolic programs depending on their site of metastasis.
      Liver-metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit a unique metabolic program compared 
      to bone- or lung-metastatic cells, characterized by increased conversion of
      glucose-derived pyruvate into lactate and a concomitant reduction in
      mitochondrial metabolism. Liver-metastatic cells displayed increased HIF-1alpha
      activity and expression of the HIF-1alpha target Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 
      (PDK1). Silencing HIF-1alpha reversed the glycolytic phenotype of
      liver-metastatic cells, while PDK1 was specifically required for metabolic
      adaptation to nutrient limitation and hypoxia. Finally, we demonstrate that PDK1 
      is required for efficient liver metastasis, and its expression is elevated in
      liver metastases from breast cancer patients. Our data implicate PDK1 as a key
      regulator of metabolism and metastatic potential in breast cancer.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT) has been used to treat human
      diseases, but the detailed mechanisms underlying its success are not fully
      understood. Here we show that MSCT rescues bone marrow MSC (BMMSC) function and
      ameliorates osteopenia in Fas-deficient-MRL/lpr mice. Mechanistically, we show
      that Fas deficiency causes failure of miR-29b release, thereby elevating
      intracellular miR-29b levels, and downregulates DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1)
      expression in MRL/lpr BMMSCs. This results in hypomethylation of the Notch1
      promoter and activation of Notch signaling, in turn leading to impaired
      osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we show that exosomes, secreted due to
      MSCT, transfer Fas to recipient MRL/lpr BMMSCs to reduce intracellular levels of 
      miR-29b, which results in recovery of Dnmt1-mediated Notch1 promoter
      hypomethylation and thereby improves MRL/lpr BMMSC function. Collectively our
      findings unravel the means by which MSCT rescues MRL/lpr BMMSC function through
      reuse of donor exosome-provided Fas to regulate the miR-29b/Dnmt1/Notch
      epigenetic cascade.

AB  - The anti-diabetic drug metformin targets pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs), but
      not their differentiated progenies (non-CSCs), which may be related to distinct
      metabolic phenotypes. Here we conclusively demonstrate that while non-CSCs were
      highly glycolytic, CSCs were dependent on oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) with very
      limited metabolic plasticity. Thus, mitochondrial inhibition, e.g., by metformin,
      translated into energy crisis and apoptosis. However, resistant CSC clones
      eventually emerged during treatment with metformin due to their intermediate
      glycolytic/respiratory phenotype. Mechanistically, suppression of MYC and
      subsequent increase of PGC-1alpha were identified as key determinants for the
      OXPHOS dependency of CSCs, which was abolished in resistant CSC clones.
      Intriguingly, no resistance was observed for the mitochondrial ROS inducer
      menadione and resistance could also be prevented/reversed for metformin by
      genetic/pharmacological inhibition of MYC. Thus, the specific metabolic features 
      of pancreatic CSCs are amendable to therapeutic intervention and could provide
      the basis for developing more effective therapies to combat this lethal cancer.

AB  - Gluconeogenesis is critical for maintenance of euglycemia during fasting.
      Elevated gluconeogenesis during type 2 diabetes (T2D) contributes to chronic
      hyperglycemia. Pyruvate is a major gluconeogenic substrate and requires import
      into the mitochondrial matrix for channeling into gluconeogenesis. Here, we
      demonstrate that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) comprising the Mpc1 and
      Mpc2 proteins is required for efficient regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
      Liver-specific deletion of Mpc1 abolished hepatic MPC activity and markedly
      decreased pyruvate-driven gluconeogenesis and TCA cycle flux. Loss of MPC
      activity induced adaptive utilization of glutamine and increased urea cycle
      activity. Diet-induced obesity increased hepatic MPC expression and activity.
      Constitutive Mpc1 deletion attenuated the development of hyperglycemia induced by
      a high-fat diet. Acute, virally mediated Mpc1 deletion after diet-induced obesity
      decreased hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance. We conclude that the MPC 
      is required for efficient regulation of gluconeogenesis and that the MPC
      contributes to the elevated gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia in T2D.

AB  - Altering the balance between energy intake and expenditure is a potential
      strategy for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, despite years 
      of progress in identifying diverse molecular targets, biological-based therapies 
      are limited. Here we demonstrate that heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) regulates energy
      expenditure through activation of a PGC1alpha-dependent metabolic program in
      adipose tissues and muscle. Genetic modulation of HSF1 levels altered white fat
      remodeling and thermogenesis, and pharmacological activation of HSF1 via
      celastrol was associated with enhanced energy expenditure, increased
      mitochondrial function in fat and muscle and protection against obesity, insulin 
      resistance, and hepatic steatosis during high-fat diet regimens. The beneficial
      metabolic changes elicited by celastrol were abrogated in HSF1 knockout mice.
      Overall, our findings identify the temperature sensor HSF1 as a regulator of
      energy metabolism and demonstrate that augmenting HSF1 via celastrol represents a
      possible therapeutic strategy to treat obesity and its myriad metabolic
      consequences.

TI  - Loss of Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier 2 in the Liver Leads to Defects in
      Gluconeogenesis and Compensation via Pyruvate-Alanine Cycling.
PG  - 682-94

AB  - Pyruvate transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane is believed to be a
      prerequisite for gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes, which is important for the
      maintenance of normoglycemia during prolonged food deprivation but also
      contributes to hyperglycemia in diabetes. To determine the requirement for
      mitochondrial pyruvate import in gluconeogenesis, mice with liver-specific
      deletion of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (LS-Mpc2(-/-)) were generated. Loss 
      of MPC2 impaired, but did not completely abolish, hepatocyte conversion of
      labeled pyruvate to TCA cycle intermediates and glucose. Unbiased metabolomic
      analyses of livers from fasted LS-Mpc2(-/-) mice suggested that alterations in
      amino acid metabolism, including pyruvate-alanine cycling, might compensate for
      the loss of MPC2. Indeed, inhibition of pyruvate-alanine transamination further
      reduced mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and glucose production by LS-Mpc2(-/-) 
      hepatocytes. These data demonstrate an important role for MPC2 in controlling
      hepatic gluconeogenesis and illuminate a compensatory mechanism for circumventing
      a block in mitochondrial pyruvate import.

TI  - Leptin Suppresses the Rewarding Effects of Running via STAT3 Signaling in
      Dopamine Neurons.

AB  - The adipose hormone leptin potently influences physical activity. Leptin can
      decrease locomotion and running, yet the mechanisms involved and the influence of
      leptin on the rewarding effects of running ("runner's high") are unknown. Leptin 
      receptor (LepR) signaling involves activation of signal transducer and activator 
      of transcription-3 (STAT3), including in dopamine neurons of the ventral
      tegmental area (VTA) that are essential for reward-relevant behavior. We found
      that mice lacking STAT3 in dopamine neurons exhibit greater voluntary running, an
      effect reversed by viral-mediated STAT3 restoration. STAT3 deletion increased the
      rewarding effects of running whereas intra-VTA leptin blocked it in a
      STAT3-dependent manner. Finally, STAT3 loss-of-function reduced mesolimbic
      dopamine overflow and function. Findings suggest that leptin influences the
      motivational effects of running via LepR-STAT3 modulation of dopamine tone.
      Falling leptin is hypothesized to increase stamina and the rewarding effects of
      running as an adaptive means to enhance the pursuit and procurement of food.

AB  - s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the sole methyl donor modifying histones, nucleic
      acids, and phospholipids. Its fluctuation affects hepatic phosphatidylcholine
      (PC) synthesis or may be linked to variations in DNA or histone methylation.
      Physiologically, low SAM is associated with lipid accumulation, tissue injury,
      and immune responses in fatty liver disease. However, molecular connections among
      SAM limitation, methyltransferases, and disease-associated phenotypes are
      unclear. We find that low SAM can activate or attenuate Caenorhabditis elegans
      immune responses. Immune pathways are stimulated downstream of PC production on a
      non-pathogenic diet. In contrast, distinct SAM-dependent mechanisms limit
      survival on pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. C. elegans undertakes a broad
      transcriptional response to pathogens and we find that low SAM restricts H3K4me3 
      at Pseudomonas-responsive promoters, limiting their expression. Furthermore, this
      response depends on the H3K4 methyltransferase set-16/MLL. Thus, our studies
      provide molecular links between SAM and innate immune functions and suggest that 
      SAM depletion may limit stress-induced gene expression.

AB  - Aging is driven by changes of the epigenetic state that are only partially
      understood. We performed a comprehensive epigenomic analysis of the pancreatic
      beta cell, key player in glucose homeostasis, in adolescent and very old mice. We
      observe a global methylation drift resulting in an overall more leveled methylome
      in old beta cells. Importantly, we discover targeted changes in the methylation
      status of beta cell proliferation and function genes that go against the global
      methylation drift, are specific to beta cells, and correlate with repression of
      the proliferation program and activation of metabolic regulators. These targeted 
      alterations are associated with specific chromatin marks and transcription factor
      occupancy in young beta cells. Strikingly, we find beta cell function improved in
      aged mice, as predicted by the changes in methylome and transcriptome. Thus,
      aging of terminally differentiated cells in mammals is not always coupled to
      functional decline.

AB  - Dietary lipids may influence the abundance of circulating inflammatory microbial 
      factors. Hence, inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT) induced by dietary
      lipids may be partly dependent on their interaction with the gut microbiota.
      Here, we show that mice fed lard for 11 weeks have increased Toll-like receptor
      (TLR) activation and WAT inflammation and reduced insulin sensitivity compared
      with mice fed fish oil and that phenotypic differences between the dietary groups
      can be partly attributed to differences in microbiota composition. Trif(-/-) and 
      Myd88(-/-) mice are protected against lard-induced WAT inflammation and impaired 
      insulin sensitivity. Experiments in germ-free mice show that an interaction
      between gut microbiota and saturated lipids promotes WAT inflammation independent
      of adiposity. Finally, we demonstrate that the chemokine CCL2 contributes to
      microbiota-induced WAT inflammation in lard-fed mice. These results indicate that
      gut microbiota exacerbates metabolic inflammation through TLR signaling upon
      challenge with a diet rich in saturated lipids.

AB  - Exercise provides many health benefits, including improved metabolism,
      cardiovascular health, and cognition. We have shown previously that FNDC5, a type
      I transmembrane protein, and its circulating form, irisin, convey some of these
      benefits in mice. However, recent reports questioned the existence of circulating
      human irisin both because human FNDC5 has a non-canonical ATA translation start
      and because of claims that many human irisin antibodies used in commercial ELISA 
      kits lack required specificity. In this paper we have identified and quantitated 
      human irisin in plasma using mass spectrometry with control peptides enriched
      with heavy stable isotopes as internal standards. This precise state-of-the-art
      method shows that human irisin is mainly translated from its non-canonical start 
      codon and circulates at approximately 3.6 ng/ml in sedentary individuals; this
      level is increased to approximately 4.3 ng/ml in individuals undergoing aerobic
      interval training. These data unequivocally demonstrate that human irisin exists,
      circulates, and is regulated by exercise.

AB  - Feeding behavior is exquisitely regulated by homeostatic and hedonic neural
      substrates that integrate energy demand as well as the reinforcing and rewarding 
      aspects of food. Understanding the net contribution of homeostatic and
      reward-driven feeding has become critical because of the ubiquitous source of
      energy-dense foods and the consequent obesity epidemic. Hypothalamic
      agouti-related peptide-secreting neurons (AgRP neurons) provide the primary
      orexigenic drive of homeostatic feeding. Using models of neuronal inhibition or
      ablation, we demonstrate that the feeding response to a fast ghrelin or serotonin
      receptor agonist relies on AgRP neurons. However, when palatable food is
      provided, AgRP neurons are dispensable for an appropriate feeding response. In
      addition, AgRP-ablated mice present exacerbated stress-induced anorexia and
      palatable food intake--a hallmark of comfort feeding. These results suggest that,
      when AgRP neuron activity is impaired, neural circuits sensitive to emotion and
      stress are engaged and modulated by food palatability and dopamine signaling.

AB  - Proper tissue vascularization is vital for cellular function as it delivers
      oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and immune cells and helps to clear cellular debris 
      and metabolic waste products. Tissue angiogenesis occurs to satisfy energy
      requirements and cellular sensors of metabolic imbalance coordinate vessel
      growth. In this regard, the classical pathways of the unfolded protein response
      activated under conditions of ER stress have recently been described to generate 
      angiomodulatory or angiostatic signals. This review elaborates on the link
      between angiogenesis and ER stress and discusses the implications for diseases
      characterized by altered vascular homeostasis, such as cancer, retinopathies, and
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Syntaxin 4 Overexpression Ameliorates Effects of Aging and High-Fat Diet on
      Glucose Control and Extends Lifespan.
PG  - 499-507

LID - S1550-4131(15)00386-1 [pii]
AB  - Indirect evidence suggests that improved insulin sensitivity may contribute to
      improved lifespan of mice in which aging has been slowed by mutations, drugs, or 
      dietary means, even in stocks of mice that do not show signs of late-life
      diabetes. Peripheral responses to insulin can be augmented by overexpression of
      Syntaxin 4 (Syn4), a plasma-membrane-localized SNARE protein. We show here that
      Syn4 transgenic (Tg) mice with high level expression of Syn4 had a significant
      extension of lifespan (33% increase in median) and showed increased peripheral
      insulin sensitivity, even at ages where controls exhibited age-related insulin
      resistance. Moreover, skeletal muscle GLUT4 and islet insulin granule exocytosis 
      processes were fully protected in Syn4 Tg mice challenged with a high-fat diet.
      Hence, high-level expressing Syn4 Tg mice may exert better glycemic control,
      which slows multiple aspects of aging and extends lifespan, even in non-diabetic 
      mice.

TI  - Statin-Induced Myopathy Is Associated with Mitochondrial Complex III Inhibition.
PG  - 399-407

AB  - Cholesterol-lowering statins effectively reduce the risk of major cardiovascular 
      events. Myopathy is the most important adverse effect, but its underlying
      mechanism remains enigmatic. In C2C12 myoblasts, several statin lactones reduced 
      respiratory capacity and appeared to be strong inhibitors of mitochondrial
      complex III (CIII) activity, up to 84% inhibition. The lactones were in general
      three times more potent inducers of cytotoxicity than their corresponding acid
      forms. The Qo binding site of CIII was identified as off-target of the statin
      lactones. These findings could be confirmed in muscle tissue of patients
      suffering from statin-induced myopathies, in which CIII enzyme activity was
      reduced by 18%. Respiratory inhibition in C2C12 myoblasts could be attenuated by 
      convergent electron flow into CIII, restoring respiration up to 89% of control.
      In conclusion, CIII inhibition was identified as a potential off-target mechanism
      associated with statin-induced myopathies.

AB  - A low level of cardiomyocyte turnover occurs in the adult mammalian heart, but
      the source of these new cells remains unknown. Kimura et al., 2015 utilized a
      novel hypoxia-induced fate mapping system to identify a rare population of adult 
      cardiomyocytes undergoing cell-cycle entry and expansion in healthy adult hearts 
      and following ischemic injury.

AB  - The mitochondrial nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) uses the
      protonmotive force to transfer electrons from NADH to NADP, thereby maintaining
      the NADP/NADPH pool reduced to protect mitochondria from oxidative damage. In
      this issue, Nickel et al. (2015) show that NNT also operates in reverse,
      oxidizing the NADP/NADPH pool, thereby disrupting antioxidant defense.

AB  - The discovery in mammals that axons are metabolically supported by myelinating
      glial cells explains why neurons can extend meters in length. In this issue,
      Volkenhoff et al. (2015) show that, in Drosophila, the transfer of lactate from
      the glial to the neuronal compartment is conserved in evolution, independent of
      body size.

AB  - While accumulating evidence suggests that circadian desynchrony is linked to
      obesity and metabolic syndrome, the underlining mechanism is still poorly
      understood. In this issue, Kettner et al. (2015) demonstrate that leptin
      resistance, induced by circadian clock deficiency or chronic jet lag, may
      represent this missing link.

AB  - The ability of hormones such as insulin, leptin, and cholecystokinin to alter
      food intake is influenced by intricate interactions between homeostatic and
      non-homeostatic factors. Consequently, when administered exogenously, the
      likelihood of these hormones influencing food intake is probabilistic, leading to
      difficulties replicating previously reported outcomes both within and between
      labs.

AB  - Obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome result from complex interactions
      between genetic and environmental factors, including the gut microbiota. To
      dissect these interactions, we utilized three commonly used inbred strains of
      mice-obesity/diabetes-prone C57Bl/6J mice, obesity/diabetes-resistant 129S1/SvImJ
      from Jackson Laboratory, and obesity-prone but diabetes-resistant 129S6/SvEvTac
      from Taconic-plus three derivative lines generated by breeding these strains in a
      new, common environment. Analysis of metabolic parameters and gut microbiota in
      all strains and their environmentally normalized derivatives revealed strong
      interactions between microbiota, diet, breeding site, and metabolic phenotype.
      Strain-dependent and strain-independent correlations were found between specific 
      microbiota and phenotypes, some of which could be transferred to germ-free
      recipient animals by fecal transplantation. Environmental reprogramming of
      microbiota resulted in 129S6/SvEvTac becoming obesity resistant. Thus,
      development of obesity/metabolic syndrome is the result of interactions between
      gut microbiota, host genetics, and diet. In permissive genetic backgrounds,
      environmental reprograming of microbiota can ameliorate development of metabolic 
      syndrome.

AB  - The endolysosomal system is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
      However, how endolysosomal compartment is regulated by mitochondrial function is 
      largely unknown. We have generated a mouse model with defective mitochondrial
      function in CD4(+) T lymphocytes by genetic deletion of the mitochondrial
      transcription factor A (Tfam). Mitochondrial respiration deficiency impairs
      lysosome function, promotes p62 and sphingomyelin accumulation, and disrupts
      endolysosomal trafficking pathways and autophagy, thus linking a primary
      mitochondrial dysfunction to a lysosomal storage disorder. The impaired lysosome 
      function in Tfam-deficient cells subverts T cell differentiation toward
      proinflammatory subsets and exacerbates the in vivo inflammatory response.
      Restoration of NAD(+) levels improves lysosome function and corrects the
      inflammatory defects in Tfam-deficient T cells. Our results uncover a mechanism
      by which mitochondria regulate lysosome function to preserve T cell
      differentiation and effector functions, and identify strategies for intervention 
      in mitochondrial-related diseases.

AB  - There is intense controversy over whether low-carbohydrate or low-fat diets are
      more efficacious for weight management. Using precise methodology, Hall et al.
      (2015) demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate diet promoted greater fat oxidation
      than an isocaloric low-fat diet but, in contrast to popular speculation, did not 
      cause greater body fat loss.

TI  - Calorie for Calorie, Dietary Fat Restriction Results in More Body Fat Loss than
      Carbohydrate Restriction in People with Obesity.

AB  - Dietary carbohydrate restriction has been purported to cause endocrine
      adaptations that promote body fat loss more than dietary fat restriction. We
      selectively restricted dietary carbohydrate versus fat for 6 days following a
      5-day baseline diet in 19 adults with obesity confined to a metabolic ward where 
      they exercised daily. Subjects received both isocaloric diets in random order
      during each of two inpatient stays. Body fat loss was calculated as the
      difference between daily fat intake and net fat oxidation measured while residing
      in a metabolic chamber. Whereas carbohydrate restriction led to sustained
      increases in fat oxidation and loss of 53 +/- 6 g/day of body fat, fat oxidation 
      was unchanged by fat restriction, leading to 89 +/- 6 g/day of fat loss, and was 
      significantly greater than carbohydrate restriction (p = 0.002). Mathematical
      model simulations agreed with these data, but predicted that the body acts to
      minimize body fat differences with prolonged isocaloric diets varying in
      carbohydrate and fat.

      aging-related diseases. ROS are produced at the respiratory chain that demands
      NADH for electron transport and are eliminated by enzymes that require NADPH. The
      nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) is considered a key antioxidative 
      enzyme based on its ability to regenerate NADPH from NADH. Here, we show that
      pathological metabolic demand reverses the direction of the Nnt, consuming NADPH 
      to support NADH and ATP production, but at the cost of NADPH-linked antioxidative
      capacity. In heart, reverse-mode Nnt is the dominant source for ROS during
      pressure overload. Due to a mutation of the Nnt gene, the inbred mouse strain
      C57BL/6J is protected from oxidative stress, heart failure, and death, making its
      use in cardiovascular research problematic. Targeting Nnt-mediated ROS with the
      tetrapeptide SS-31 rescued mortality in pressure overload-induced heart failure
      and could therefore have therapeutic potential in patients with this syndrome.

AB  - Neuronal information processing requires a large amount of energy, indicating
      that sugars and other metabolites must be efficiently delivered. However,
      reliable neuronal function also depends on the maintenance of a constant
      microenvironment in the brain. Therefore, neurons are efficiently separated from 
      circulation by the blood-brain barrier, and their long axons are insulated by
      glial processes. At the example of the Drosophila brain, we addressed how sugar
      is shuttled across the barrier to nurture neurons. We show that glial cells of
      the blood-brain barrier specifically take up sugars and that their metabolism
      relies on glycolysis, which, surprisingly, is dispensable in neurons. Glial cells
      secrete alanine and lactate to fuel neuronal mitochondria, and lack of glial
      glycolysis specifically in the adult brain causes neurodegeneration. Our work
      implies that a global metabolic compartmentalization and coupling of neurons and 
      glial cells is a conserved, fundamental feature of bilaterian nervous systems
      independent of their size.

      Colitis through Repression of Interleukin-10 Production.

AB  - Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (Ido1) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalizes the
      degradation of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. Here, we show that Ido1
      activity sustains an immunostimulatory potential through inhibition of
      interleukin (Il)10. In atherosclerosis, Ido1-dependent inhibition of Il10
      translates into disease exacerbation. The resistance of Ido1-deficient mice to
      enhanced immune activation is broken in Ido1/Il10 double-deficient mice, which
      show exaggerated immune responses and develop severe spontaneous colitis. We
      demonstrate that Ido1 activity is required for the regulation of Il10 and that
      kynurenic acid (Kna), an Ido1-derived metabolite, is responsible for reduced Il10
      production through activation of a cAMP-dependent pathway and inhibition of
      Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Resupplementation of Ido1-deficient mice with Kna limits 
      Il10 expression and promotes atherosclerosis. In human atherosclerotic lesions,
      increased levels of Kna are associated with an unstable plaque phenotype, and its
      blood levels predict death and recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with
      coronary artery disease.

AB  - The interest in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a target to combat metabolic
      disease has recently been renewed with the discovery of functional BAT in humans.
      In rodents, BAT can be activated by bile acids, which activate type 2
      iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) in BAT via the G-coupled protein receptor TGR5,
      resulting in increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Here we
      examined the effects of oral supplementation of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic
      acid (CDCA) on human BAT activity. Treatment of 12 healthy female subjects with
      CDCA for 2 days resulted in increased BAT activity. Whole-body energy expenditure
      was also increased upon CDCA treatment. In vitro treatment of primary human brown
      adipocytes derived with CDCA or specific TGR5 agonists increased mitochondrial
      uncoupling and D2 expression, an effect that was absent in human primary white
      adipocytes. These findings identify bile acids as a target to activate BAT in
      humans.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests the gastrointestinal tract plays an important
      glucoregulatory role. In this perspective, we first review how the intestine
      senses ingested nutrients, initiating crucial negative feedback mechanisms
      through a gut-brain neuronal axis to regulate glycemia, mainly via reduction in
      hepatic glucose production. We then highlight how intestinal energy sensory
      mechanisms are responsible for the glucose-lowering effects of bariatric surgery,
      specifically duodenal-jejunal bypass, and the antidiabetic agents metformin and
      resveratrol. A better understanding of these pathways lays the groundwork for
      intestinally targeted drug therapy for the treatment of diabetes.

AB  - A number of chronic metabolic pathologies, including obesity, diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, asthma, and cancer, cluster together to present the
      greatest threat to human health. As research in this field has advanced, it has
      become clear that unresolved metabolic inflammation, organelle dysfunction, and
      other cellular and metabolic stresses underlie the development of these chronic
      metabolic diseases. However, the relationship between these systems and
      pathological mechanisms is poorly understood. Here we discuss the role of
      cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis as a critical mechanism integrating the myriad of
      cellular and subcellular dysfunctional networks found in metabolic tissues such
      as liver and adipose tissue in the context of metabolic disease, particularly in 
      obesity and diabetes.

AB  - We discovered recently that the central metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG)
      extends the lifespan of C. elegans through inhibition of ATP synthase and TOR
      signaling. Here we find, unexpectedly, that (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate ((R)-2HG), an 
      oncometabolite that interferes with various alpha-KG-mediated processes,
      similarly extends worm lifespan. (R)-2HG accumulates in human cancers carrying
      neomorphic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes. We show
      that, like alpha-KG, both (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG bind and inhibit ATP synthase and
      inhibit mTOR signaling. These effects are mirrored in IDH1 mutant cells,
      suggesting a growth-suppressive function of (R)-2HG. Consistently, inhibition of 
      ATP synthase by 2-HG or alpha-KG in glioblastoma cells is sufficient for growth
      arrest and tumor cell killing under conditions of glucose limitation, e.g., when 
      ketone bodies (instead of glucose) are supplied for energy. These findings inform
      therapeutic strategies and open avenues for investigating the roles of 2-HG and
      metabolites in biology and disease.

AB  - Because human white adipocytes display a high turnover throughout adulthood, a
      continuous supply of precursor cells is required to maintain adipogenesis. Bone
      marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells may contribute to mammalian adipogenesis;
      however, results in animal models are conflicting. Here we demonstrate in 65
      subjects who underwent allogeneic BM or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplantation that, over the entire lifespan, BM/PBSC-derived progenitor cells 
      contribute approximately 10% to the subcutaneous adipocyte population. While this
      is independent of gender, age, and different transplantation-related parameters, 
      body fat mass exerts a strong influence, with up to 2.5-fold increased donor cell
      contribution in obese individuals. Exome and whole-genome sequencing of single
      adipocytes suggests that BM/PBSC-derived progenitors contribute to adipose tissue
      via both differentiation and cell fusion. Thus, at least in the setting of
      transplantation, BM serves as a reservoir for adipocyte progenitors, particularly
      in obese subjects.

AB  - Circadian disruption is associated with obesity, implicating the central clock in
      body weight control. Our comprehensive screen of wild-type and three circadian
      mutant mouse models, with or without chronic jet lag, shows that distinct genetic
      and physiologic interventions differentially disrupt overall energy homeostasis
      and Leptin signaling. We found that BMAL1/CLOCK generates circadian rhythm of
      C/EBPalpha-mediated leptin transcription in adipose. Per and Cry mutant mice show
      similar disruption of peripheral clock and deregulation of leptin in fat, but
      opposite body weight and composition phenotypes that correlate with their
      distinct patterns of POMC neuron deregulation in the arcuate nucleus. Chronic jet
      lag is sufficient to disrupt the endogenous adipose clock and also induce central
      Leptin resistance in wild-type mice. Thus, coupling of the central and peripheral
      clocks controls Leptin endocrine feedback homeostasis. We propose that Leptin
      resistance, a hallmark of obesity in humans, plays a key role in circadian
      dysfunction-induced obesity and metabolic syndromes.

AB  - Biological diversity among mammals is remarkable. Mammalian body weights range
      seven orders of magnitude and lifespans differ more than 100-fold among species. 
      While genetic, dietary, and pharmacological interventions can be used to modulate
      these traits in model organisms, it is unknown how they are determined by natural
      selection. By profiling metabolites in brain, heart, kidney, and liver tissues of
      26 mammalian species representing ten taxonomical orders, we report metabolite
      patterns characteristic of organs, lineages, and species longevity. Our data
      suggest different rates of metabolite divergence across organs and reveal
      patterns representing organ-specific functions and lineage-specific physiologies.
      We identified metabolites that correlated with species lifespan, some of which
      were previously implicated in longevity control. We also compared the results
      with metabolite changes in five long-lived mouse models and observed some similar
      patterns. Overall, this study describes adjustments of the mammalian metabolome
      according to lifespan, phylogeny, and organ and lineage specialization.

AB  - The human gut microbiome is known to be associated with various human disorders, 
      but a major challenge is to go beyond association studies and elucidate
      causalities. Mathematical modeling of the human gut microbiome at a genome scale 
      is a useful tool to decipher microbe-microbe, diet-microbe and microbe-host
      interactions. Here, we describe the CASINO (Community And Systems-level
      INteractive Optimization) toolbox, a comprehensive computational platform for
      analysis of microbial communities through metabolic modeling. We first validated 
      the toolbox by simulating and testing the performance of single bacteria and
      whole communities in vitro. Focusing on metabolic interactions between the diet, 
      gut microbiota, and host metabolism, we demonstrated the predictive power of the 
      toolbox in a diet-intervention study of 45 obese and overweight individuals and
      validated our predictions by fecal and blood metabolomics data. Thus, modeling
      could quantitatively describe altered fecal and serum amino acid levels in
      response to diet intervention.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the development of complications in type 1 diabetes
      (T1D) are poorly understood. Disease modeling of induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) from patients with longstanding T1D (disease duration >/= 50 years) with 
      severe (Medalist +C) or absent to mild complications (Medalist -C) revealed
      impaired growth, reprogramming, and differentiation in Medalist +C. Genomics and 
      proteomics analyses suggested differential regulation of DNA damage checkpoint
      proteins favoring protection from cellular apoptosis in Medalist -C. In silico
      analyses showed altered expression patterns of DNA damage checkpoint factors
      among the Medalist groups to be targets of miR200, whose expression was
      significantly elevated in Medalist +C serum. Notably, neurons differentiated from
      Medalist +C iPSCs exhibited enhanced susceptibility to genotoxic stress that
      worsened upon miR200 overexpression. Furthermore, knockdown of miR200 in Medalist
      +C fibroblasts and iPSCs rescued checkpoint protein expression and reduced DNA
      damage. We propose miR200-regulated DNA damage checkpoint pathway as a potential 
      therapeutic target for treating complications of diabetes.

      Changes on the Human Gut Microbiome Contributing to Fat Mass Regulation.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective procedure for the treatment of 
      obesity. Given the role of the gut microbiota in regulating host metabolism and
      adiposity, we investigated the long-term effects of bariatric surgery on the
      microbiome of patients randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical banded 
      gastroplasty and matched for weight and fat mass loss. The two surgical
      procedures induced similar and durable changes on the gut microbiome that were
      not dependent on body mass index and resulted in altered levels of fecal and
      circulating metabolites compared with obese controls. By colonizing germ-free
      mice with stools from the patients, we demonstrated that the surgically altered
      microbiota promoted reduced fat deposition in recipient mice. These mice also had
      a lower respiratory quotient, indicating decreased utilization of carbohydrates
      as fuel. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota may play a direct role in
      the reduction of adiposity observed after bariatric surgery.

AB  - Since the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) was confirmed in adult humans,
      BAT has become a therapeutic target for obesity and insulin resistance. We
      examined whether human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) can adopt a
      BAT-like phenotype using a clinical model of prolonged and severe adrenergic
      stress. sWAT samples were collected from severely burned and healthy individuals.
      A subset of burn victims were prospectively followed during their acute
      hospitalization. Browning of sWAT was determined by the presence of multilocular 
      adipocytes, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and increased mitochondrial density and 
      respiratory capacity. Multilocular UCP1-positive adipocytes were found in sWAT
      samples from burn patients. UCP1 mRNA, mitochondrial density, and leak
      respiratory capacity in sWAT increased after burn trauma. Our data demonstrate
      that human sWAT can transform from an energy-storing to an energy-dissipating
      tissue, which opens new research avenues in our quest to prevent and treat
      obesity and its metabolic complications.

AB  - High adipose expression of NNMT, an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to
      1-methyl-nicotinamide, correlates with adiposity. Though murine NNMT knockdown in
      fat and liver prevents weight gain on high-fat diet, Hong et al. (2015) now show 
      that high hepatic expression of NNMT improves lipid parameters via SIRT1
      stabilization.

AB  - Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) contribute to the
      pathogenesis of cancer via production of the "oncometabolite"
      D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Elevated D-2HG can block differentiation of
      malignant cells by functioning as a competitive inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate 
      (alpha-KG)-dependent enzymes, including Jumonji family histone lysine
      demethylases. 2HG is a chiral molecule that can exist in either the D-enantiomer 
      or the L-enantiomer. Although cancer-associated IDH1/2 mutants produce D-2HG,
      biochemical studies have demonstrated that L-2HG also functions as a potent
      inhibitor of alpha-KG-dependent enzymes. Here we report that under conditions of 
      oxygen limitation, mammalian cells selectively produce L-2HG via enzymatic
      reduction of alpha-KG. Hypoxia-induced L-2HG is not mediated by IDH1 or IDH2, but
      instead results from promiscuous substrate usage primarily by lactate
      dehydrogenase A (LDHA). During hypoxia, the resulting increase in L-2HG is
      necessary and sufficient for the induction of increased methylation of histone
      repressive marks, including histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3).

AB  - Metabolic adaptation to hypoxia is critical for survival in metazoan species for 
      which reason they have developed cellular mechanisms for mitigating its adverse
      consequences. Here, we have identified L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) as a universal
      adaptive determinant of the hypoxia response. L2HG is a metabolite of unknown
      function produced by the reduction of mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate by malate
      dehydrogenase. L2HG accumulates in response to increases in 2-oxoglutarate, which
      occur as a result of tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction and increased
      mitochondrial reducing potential. These changes are closely coupled to cellular
      redox homeostasis, as increased cellular L2HG inhibits electron transport and
      glycolysis to offset the adverse consequences of mitochondrial reductive stress
      induced by hypoxia. Thus, L2HG couples mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy
      metabolism in a model of cellular redox regulation.

AB  - Sphingolipids have garnered attention for their role in insulin resistance and
      lipotoxic cell death. We have developed transgenic mice inducibly expressing acid
      ceramidase that display a reduction in ceramides in adult mouse tissues. Hepatic 
      overexpression of acid ceramidase prevents hepatic steatosis and prompts
      improvements in insulin action in liver and adipose tissue upon exposure to
      high-fat diet. Conversely, overexpression of acid ceramidase within adipose
      tissue also prevents hepatic steatosis and systemic insulin resistance. Induction
      of ceramidase activity in either tissue promotes a lowering of hepatic ceramides 
      and reduced activation of the ceramide-activated protein kinase C isoform
      PKCzeta, though the induction of ceramidase activity in the adipocyte prompts
      more rapid resolution of hepatic steatosis than overexpression of the enzyme
      directly in the liver. Collectively, our observations suggest the existence of a 
      rapidly acting "cross-talk" between liver and adipose tissue sphingolipids,
      critically regulating glucose metabolism and hepatic lipid uptake.

AB  - Adiponectin is an abundant adipokine with pleiotropic protective effects against 
      a cluster of obesity-related cardiometabolic disorders. However, its role in
      adaptive thermogenesis has scarcely been explored. Here we showed that chronic
      cold exposure led to a markedly elevated production of adiponectin in adipocytes 
      of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), which in turn bound to M2
      macrophages in the stromal vascular fraction. Chronic cold exposure-induced
      accumulation of M2 macrophages, activation of beige cells, and thermogenic
      program were markedly impaired in scWAT of adiponectin knockout (ADN KO) mice,
      whereas these impairments were reversed by replenishment with adiponectin.
      Mechanistically, adiponectin was recruited to the cell surface of M2 macrophages 
      via its binding partner T-cadherin and promoted the cell proliferation by
      activation of Akt, consequently leading to beige cell activation. These findings 
      uncover adiponectin as a key efferent signal for cold-induced adaptive
      thermogenesis by mediating the crosstalk between adipocytes and M2 macrophages in
      scWAT.

AB  - People in developing countries have faced multigenerational undernutrition and
      are currently undergoing major lifestyle changes, contributing to an epidemic of 
      metabolic diseases, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a
      Wistar rat model of undernutrition over 50 generations, we show that
      Undernourished rats exhibit low birth-weight, high visceral adiposity (DXA/MRI), 
      and insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), compared to
      age-/gender-matched control rats. Undernourished rats also have higher
      circulating insulin, homocysteine, endotoxin and leptin levels, lower
      adiponectin, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and an 8-fold increased
      susceptibility to Streptozotocin-induced diabetes compared to control rats.
      Importantly, these metabolic abnormalities are not reversed after two generations
      of unrestricted access to commercial chow (nutrient recuperation). Altered
      epigenetic signatures in insulin-2 gene promoter region of Undernourished rats
      are not reversed by nutrient recuperation, and may contribute to the persistent
      detrimental metabolic profiles in similar multigenerational undernourished human 
      populations.

AB  - Within living cells, mitochondria are considered relevant sources of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and are exposed to reactive nitrogen species (RNS). During
      the last decade, accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial (dys)function,
      ROS/RNS levels, and aberrations in mitochondrial morphology are interconnected,
      albeit in a cell- and context-dependent manner. Here it is hypothesized that ROS 
      and RNS are involved in the short-term regulation of mitochondrial morphology and
      function via non-transcriptional pathways. We review the evidence for such a
      mechanism and propose that it allows homeostatic control of mitochondrial
      function and morphology by redox signaling.

AB  - Neurotrophins are important for neuronal health and function. Here, statins,
      inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol lowering drugs, were found to
      stimulate expression of neurotrophins in brain cells independent of the
      mevalonate pathway. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
      analyses, computer-derived simulation, site-directed mutagenesis, thermal shift
      assay, and de novo binding followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass
      spectrometry (ESI-MS) demonstrates that statins serve as ligands of PPARalpha and
      that Leu331 and Tyr 334 residues of PPARalpha are important for statin binding.
      Upon binding, statins upregulate neurotrophins via PPARalpha-mediated
      transcriptional activation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB).
      Accordingly, simvastatin increases CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) in the hippocampus of Ppara null mice receiving full-length lentiviral
      PPARalpha, but not L331M/Y334D statin-binding domain-mutated lentiviral
      PPARalpha. This study identifies statins as ligands of PPARalpha, describes
      neurotrophic function of statins via the PPARalpha-CREB pathway, and analyzes the
      importance of PPARalpha in the therapeutic success of simvastatin in an animal
      model of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Mitochondria have primarily been viewed as bioenergetic and biosynthetic
      organelles that autonomously co-exist within the cell. However, the past two
      decades have provided evidence that mitochondria function as signaling
      organelles, constantly communicating with the cytosol to initiate biological
      events under homeostatic and stress conditions. Thus, the signaling function of
      the mitochondria may have been selected by nature from the inception of the early
      eukaryote, as discussed in this essay.

AB  - FOXO family transcription factors are downstream effectors of Insulin/IGF-1
      signaling (IIS) and major determinants of aging in organisms ranging from worms
      to man. The molecular mechanisms that actively promote DAF16/FOXO stability and
      function are unknown. Here we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme MATH-33 as an 
      essential DAF-16 regulator in IIS, which stabilizes active DAF-16 protein levels 
      and, as a consequence, influences DAF-16 functions, such as metabolism, stress
      response, and longevity in C. elegans. MATH-33 associates with DAF-16 in cellulo 
      and in vitro. MATH-33 functions as a deubiquitylase by actively removing
      ubiquitin moieties from DAF-16, thus counteracting the action of the RLE-1
      E3-ubiquitin ligase. Our findings support a model in which MATH-33 promotes
      DAF-16 stability in response to decreased IIS by directly modulating its
      ubiquitylation state, suggesting that regulated oscillations in the stability of 
      DAF-16 protein play an integral role in controlling processes such as metabolism 
      and longevity.

AB  - A high-fat diet (HFD) induces metabolic disease and low-grade metabolic
      inflammation in response to changes in the intestinal microbiota through
      as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that a HFD-derived ileum microbiota is
      responsible for a decrease in Th17 cells of the lamina propria in axenic
      colonized mice. The HFD also changed the expression profiles of intestinal
      antigen-presenting cells and their ability to generate Th17 cells in vitro.
      Consistent with these data, the metabolic phenotype was mimicked in
      RORgammat-deficient mice, which lack IL17 and IL22 function, and in the adoptive 
      transfer experiment of T cells from RORgammat-deficient mice into Rag1-deficient 
      mice. We conclude that the microbiota of the ileum regulates Th17 cell
      homeostasis in the small intestine and determines the outcome of metabolic
      disease.

AB  - Acylcarnitine metabolites have gained attention as biomarkers of nutrient stress,
      but their physiological relevance and metabolic purpose remain poorly understood.
      Short-chain carnitine conjugates, including acetylcarnitine, derive from their
      corresponding acyl-CoA precursors via the action of carnitine acetyltransferase
      (CrAT), a bidirectional mitochondrial matrix enzyme. We show here that
      contractile activity reverses acetylcarnitine flux in muscle, from net production
      and efflux at rest to net uptake and consumption during exercise. Disruption of
      this switch in mice with muscle-specific CrAT deficiency resulted in acetyl-CoA
      deficit, perturbed energy charge, and diminished exercise tolerance, whereas
      acetylcarnitine supplementation produced opposite outcomes in a CrAT-dependent
      manner. Likewise, in exercise-trained compared to untrained humans, post-exercise
      phosphocreatine recovery rates were positively associated with CrAT activity and 
      coincided with dramatic shifts in muscle acetylcarnitine dynamics. These findings
      show acetylcarnitine serves as a critical acetyl buffer for working muscles and
      provide insight into potential therapeutic strategies for combatting exercise
      intolerance.

      this activity is involved in motivations of feeding behavior is unclear. A recent
      study in Nature (Betley et al., 2015) reports that AgRP neuron activity
      conditions learned behavior by transmitting a negative-valence signal: linking
      AgRP neurons to the preference of environmental cues associated with homeostatic 
      need.

AB  - Triglyceride hydrolysis by cytosolic and lysosomal lipases mobilizes fatty acids 
      from lipid droplet stores. Kaushik and Cuervo (2015) found that
      chaperone-mediated autophagy removes the protective barrier from the lipid
      droplet surface, facilitating lipolysis by cytosolic lipases and assembly of
      autolipophagosomes for subsequent lysosomal lipid degradation.

AB  - The health-promoting benefits of exercise have been recognized for centuries, yet
      the molecular and cellular mechanisms for the acute and chronic adaptive response
      to a variety of physical activities remain incompletely described. This
      Perspective will take a forward view to highlight emerging questions and
      frontiers in the ever-changing landscape of exercise biology. The biology of
      exercise is complex, highly variable, and involves a myriad of adaptive responses
      in multiple organ systems. Given the multitude of changes that occur in each
      organ during exercise, future researchers will need to integrate tissue-specific 
      responses with large-scale omics to resolve the integrated biology of exercise.
      The ultimate goal will be to understand how these system-wide, tissue-specific
      exercise-induced changes lead to measurable physiological outcomes at the
      whole-body level to improve health and well-being.

AB  - The past 25 years have witnessed major advances in our knowledge of how exercise 
      activates cellular, molecular, and biochemical pathways with regulatory roles in 
      training response adaptation, and how muscle "cross-talk" with other organs is a 
      mechanism by which physical activity exerts its beneficial effects on
      "whole-body" health. However, during the late 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries, 
      scientific debate in the field of exercise metabolism centered on questions
      related to the sources of energy for muscular activity, diet-exercise
      manipulations to alter patterns of fuel utilization, as well as the factors
      limiting physical work capacity. Posing novel scientific questions and utilizing 
      cutting-edge techniques, the contributions made by the great pioneers of the
      19(th) and early 20(th) centuries laid the foundation on which much of our
      present knowledge of exercise metabolism is based and paved the way for future
      discoveries in the field.

AB  - NAD(+) has emerged as a vital cofactor that can rewire metabolism, activate
      sirtuins, and maintain mitochondrial fitness through mechanisms such as the
      mitochondrial unfolded protein response. This improved understanding of NAD(+)
      metabolism revived interest in NAD(+)-boosting strategies to manage a wide
      spectrum of diseases, ranging from diabetes to cancer. In this review, we
      summarize how NAD(+) metabolism links energy status with adaptive cellular and
      organismal responses and how this knowledge can be therapeutically exploited.

AB  - Diabetes results from a reduction of pancreatic beta-cells. Stimulating
      replication could normalize beta-cell mass. However, adult human beta-cells are
      recalcitrant to proliferation. We identified osteoprotegerin, a bone-related
      decoy receptor, as a beta-cell mitogen. Osteoprotegerin was induced by and
      required for lactogen-mediated rodent beta-cell replication. Osteoprotegerin
      enhanced beta-cell proliferation in young, aged, and diabetic mice. This resulted
      in increased beta-cell mass in young mice and significantly delayed hyperglycemia
      in diabetic mice. Osteoprotegerin stimulated replication of adult human
      beta-cells, without causing dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, osteoprotegerin
      induced human and rodent beta-cell replication by modulating CREB and GSK3
      pathways, through binding Receptor Activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) Ligand (RANKL), 
      a brake in beta-cell proliferation. Denosumab, an FDA-approved osteoporosis drug,
      and RANKL-specific antibody induced human beta-cell proliferation in vitro, and
      in vivo, in humanized mice. Thus, osteoprotegerin and Denosumab prevent
      RANKL/RANK interaction to stimulate beta-cell replication, highlighting the
      potential for repurposing an osteoporosis drug to treat diabetes.

TI  - Jejunal T Cell Inflammation in Human Obesity Correlates with Decreased Enterocyte

AB  - In obesity, insulin resistance is linked to inflammation in several tissues.
      Although the gut is a very large lymphoid tissue, inflammation in the absorptive 
      small intestine, the jejunum, where insulin regulates lipid and sugar absorption 
      is unknown. We analyzed jejunal samples of 185 obese subjects stratified in three
      metabolic groups: without comorbidity, suffering from obesity-related
      comorbidity, and diabetic, versus 33 lean controls. Obesity increased both mucosa
      surface due to lower cell apoptosis and innate and adaptive immune cell
      populations. The preferential CD8alphabeta T cell location in epithelium over
      lamina propria appears a hallmark of obesity. Cytokine secretion by T cells from 
      obese, but not lean, subjects blunted insulin signaling in enterocytes relevant
      to apical GLUT2 mislocation. Statistical links between T cell densities and BMI, 
      NAFLD, or lipid metabolism suggest tissue crosstalk. Obesity triggers
      T-cell-mediated inflammation and enterocyte insulin resistance in the jejunum
      with potential broader systemic implications.

AB  - Prolonged fasting (PF) promotes stress resistance, but its effects on longevity
      are poorly understood. We show that alternating PF and nutrient-rich medium
      extended yeast lifespan independently of established pro-longevity genes. In
      mice, 4 days of a diet that mimics fasting (FMD), developed to minimize the
      burden of PF, decreased the size of multiple organs/systems, an effect followed
      upon re-feeding by an elevated number of progenitor and stem cells and
      regeneration. Bi-monthly FMD cycles started at middle age extended longevity,
      lowered visceral fat, reduced cancer incidence and skin lesions, rejuvenated the 
      immune system, and retarded bone mineral density loss. In old mice, FMD cycles
      promoted hippocampal neurogenesis, lowered IGF-1 levels and PKA activity,
      elevated NeuroD1, and improved cognitive performance. In a pilot clinical trial, 
      three FMD cycles decreased risk factors/biomarkers for aging, diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, and cancer without major adverse effects, providing
      support for the use of FMDs to promote healthspan.

AB  - The beneficial effects of physical activity (PA) are well documented, yet the
      mechanisms by which PA prevents disease and improves health outcomes are poorly
      understood. To identify major gaps in knowledge and potential strategies for
      catalyzing progress in the field, the NIH convened a workshop in late October
      2014 entitled "Understanding the Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Physical
      Activity-Induced Health Benefits." Presentations and discussions emphasized the
      challenges imposed by the integrative and intermittent nature of PA, the
      tremendous discovery potential of applying "-omics" technologies to understand
      interorgan crosstalk and biological networking systems during PA, and the need to
      establish an infrastructure of clinical trial sites with sufficient expertise to 
      incorporate mechanistic outcome measures into adequately sized human PA trials.
      Identification of the mechanisms that underlie the link between PA and improved
      health holds extraordinary promise for discovery of novel therapeutic targets and
      development of personalized exercise medicine.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key regulator of energy balance;
      however, its underlying mechanism remains unknown. By analyzing BDNF-expressing
      neurons in paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), we have uncovered neural circuits 
      that control energy balance. The Bdnf gene in the PVH was mostly expressed in
      previously undefined neurons, and its deletion caused hyperphagia, reduced
      locomotor activity, impaired thermogenesis, and severe obesity. Hyperphagia and
      reduced locomotor activity were associated with Bdnf deletion in anterior PVH,
      whereas BDNF neurons in medial and posterior PVH drive thermogenesis by
      projecting to spinal cord and forming polysynaptic connections to brown adipose
      tissues. Furthermore, BDNF expression in the PVH was increased in response to
      cold exposure, and its ablation caused atrophy of sympathetic preganglionic
      neurons. Thus, BDNF neurons in anterior PVH control energy intake and locomotor
      activity, whereas those in medial and posterior PVH promote thermogenesis by
      releasing BDNF into spinal cord to boost sympathetic outflow.

AB  - The role of inflammation in obesity-related pathologies is well established. We
      investigated the therapeutic potential of LipoxinA4
      (LXA4:5(S),6(R),15(S)-trihydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,13E,-eicosatetraenoic acid) and a
      synthetic 15(R)-Benzo-LXA4-analog as interventions in a 3-month high-fat diet
      (HFD; 60% fat)-induced obesity model. Obesity caused distinct pathologies,
      including impaired glucose tolerance, adipose inflammation, fatty liver, and
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Lipoxins (LXs) attenuated obesity-induced CKD,
      reducing glomerular expansion, mesangial matrix, and urinary H2O2. Furthermore,
      LXA4 reduced liver weight, serum alanine-aminotransferase, and hepatic
      triglycerides. LXA4 decreased obesity-induced adipose inflammation, attenuating
      TNF-alpha and CD11c(+) M1-macrophages (MPhis), while restoring CD206(+) M2-MPhis 
      and increasing Annexin-A1. LXs did not affect renal or hepatic MPhis, suggesting 
      protection occurred via attenuation of adipose inflammation. LXs restored adipose
      expression of autophagy markers LC3-II and p62. LX-mediated protection was
      demonstrable in adiponectin(-/-) mice, suggesting that the mechanism was
      adiponectin independent. In conclusion, LXs protect against obesity-induced
      systemic disease, and these data support a novel therapeutic paradigm for
      treating obesity and associated pathologies.

TI  - SLC39A14 Is Required for the Development of Hepatocellular Iron Overload in
      Murine Models of Hereditary Hemochromatosis.
PG  - 138-50
LID - 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.05.002 [doi]
LID - S1550-4131(15)00214-4 [pii]
AB  - Nearly all forms of hereditary hemochromatosis are characterized by pathological 
      iron accumulation in the liver, pancreas, and heart. These tissues preferentially
      load iron because they take up non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which appears
      in the plasma during iron overload. Yet, how tissues take up NTBI is largely
      unknown. We report that ablation of Slc39a14, the gene coding for solute carrier 
      SLC39A14 (also called ZIP14), in mice markedly reduced the uptake of plasma NTBI 
      by the liver and pancreas. To test the role of SLC39A14 in tissue iron loading,
      we crossed Slc39a14(-/-) mice with Hfe(-/-) and Hfe2(-/-) mice, animal models of 
      type 1 and type 2 (juvenile) hemochromatosis, respectively. Slc39a14 deficiency
      in hemochromatotic mice greatly diminished iron loading of the liver and
      prevented iron deposition in hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells. The data
      suggest that inhibition of SLC39A14 may mitigate hepatic and pancreatic iron
      loading and associated pathologies in iron overload disorders.

AB  - Age-related frailty may be due to decreased skeletal muscle regeneration. The
      role of TGF-beta molecules myostatin and GDF11 in regeneration is unclear. Recent
      studies showed an age-related decrease in GDF11 and that GDF11 treatment improves
      muscle regeneration, which were contrary to prior studies. We now show that these
      recent claims are not reproducible and the reagents previously used to detect
      GDF11 are not GDF11 specific. We develop a GDF11-specific immunoassay and show a 
      trend toward increased GDF11 levels in sera of aged rats and humans. GDF11 mRNA
      increases in rat muscle with age. Mechanistically, GDF11 and myostatin both
      induce SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, inhibit myoblast differentiation, and regulate
      identical downstream signaling. GDF11 significantly inhibited muscle regeneration
      and decreased satellite cell expansion in mice. Given early data in humans
      showing a trend for an age-related increase, GDF11 could be a target for
      pharmacologic blockade to treat age-related sarcopenia.

AB  - Heritable epigenetic factors can contribute to complex disease etiology. Here we 
      examine the contribution of DNA methylation to complex traits that are precursors
      to heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. We profiled DNA methylation in the 
      liver using bisulfite sequencing in 90 mouse inbred strains, genome-wide
      expression levels, proteomics, metabolomics, and 68 clinical traits and performed
      epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We found associations with numerous
      clinical traits including bone density, insulin resistance, expression, and
      protein and metabolite levels. A large proportion of associations were unique to 
      EWAS and were not identified using GWAS. Methylation levels were regulated by
      genetics largely in cis, but we also found evidence of trans regulation, and we
      demonstrate that genetic variation in the methionine synthase reductase gene Mtrr
      affects methylation of hundreds of CpGs throughout the genome. Our results
      indicate that natural variation in methylation levels contributes to the etiology
      of complex clinical traits.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) has been proposed as a postprandial hormone
      that signals from intestine to liver to regulate bile acid and carbohydrate
      homeostasis. However, detecting FGF15 in blood using conventional techniques has 
      proven difficult. Here, we describe a stable isotope standards and capture by
      anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA) assay that combines immuno-enrichment with
      selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry to overcome this issue.
      Using this assay, we show that FGF15 circulates in plasma in an FXR and circadian
      rhythm-dependent manner at concentrations that activate its receptor. Consistent 
      with the proposed endocrine role for FGF15 in liver, mice lacking hepatocyte
      expression of the obligate FGF15 co-receptor, beta-Klotho, have increased bile
      acid synthesis and reduced glycogen storage despite having supraphysiological
      plasma FGF15 concentrations. Collectively, these data demonstrate that FGF15
      functions as a hormone and highlight the utility of SISCAPA-SRM as a sensitive
      assay for detecting low-abundance proteins in plasma.

AB  - The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activates autophagy, but its role in
      aging and fasting-induced muscle function has not been defined. Here we report
      that fasting mice lacking skeletal muscle AMPK (AMPK-MKO) results in hypoglycemia
      and hyperketosis. This is not due to defective fatty acid oxidation, but instead 
      is related to a block in muscle proteolysis that leads to reduced circulating
      levels of alanine, an essential amino acid required for gluconeogenesis. Markers 
      of muscle autophagy including phosphorylation of Ulk1 Ser555 and Ser757 and
      aggregation of RFP-LC3 puncta are impaired. Consistent with impaired autophagy,
      aged AMPK-MKO mice possess a significant myopathy characterized by reduced muscle
      function, mitochondrial disease, and accumulation of the autophagy/mitophagy
      proteins p62 and Parkin. These findings establish an essential requirement for
      skeletal muscle AMPK-mediated autophagy in preserving blood glucose levels during
      prolonged fasting as well as maintaining muscle integrity and mitochondrial
      function during aging.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with skeletal muscle pathology, including
      cachexia, sarcopenia, and the muscular dystrophies. ATP citrate lyase (ACL) is a 
      cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes mitochondria-derived citrate into oxaloacetate
      and acetyl-CoA. Here we report that activation of ACL in skeletal muscle results 
      in improved mitochondrial function. IGF1 induces activation of ACL in an
      AKT-dependent fashion. This results in an increase in cardiolipin, thus
      increasing critical mitochondrial complexes and supercomplex activity, and a
      resultant increase in oxygen consumption and cellular ATP levels. Conversely,
      knockdown of ACL in myotubes not only reduces mitochondrial complex I, IV, and V 
      activity but also blocks IGF1-induced increases in oxygen consumption. In vivo,
      ACL activity is associated with increased ATP. Activation of this
      IGF1/ACL/cardiolipin pathway combines anabolic signaling with induction of
      mechanisms needed to provide required ATP.

AB  - Increased levels of the mitochondria-shaping protein Opa1 improve respiratory
      chain efficiency and protect from tissue damage, suggesting that it could be an
      attractive target to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we show that Opa1
      overexpression ameliorates two mouse models of defective mitochondrial
      bioenergetics. The offspring from crosses of a constitutive knockout for the
      structural complex I component Ndufs4 (Ndufs4(-/-)), and of a muscle-specific
      conditional knockout for the complex IV assembly factor Cox15 (Cox15(sm/sm)),
      with Opa1 transgenic (Opa1(tg)) mice showed improved motor skills and respiratory
      chain activities compared to the naive, non-Opa1-overexpressing, models. While
      the amelioration was modest in Ndufs4(-/-)::Opa1(tg) mice, correction of cristae 
      ultrastructure and mitochondrial respiration, improvement of motor performance
      and prolongation of lifespan were remarkable in Cox15(sm/sm)::Opa1(tg) mice.
      Mechanistically, respiratory chain supercomplexes were increased in
      Cox15(sm/sm)::Opa1(tg) mice, and residual monomeric complex IV was stabilized. In
      conclusion, cristae shape amelioration by controlled Opa1 overexpression improves
      two mouse models of mitochondrial disease.

AB  - Mitochondrial morphological and ultrastructural changes occur during apoptosis
      and autophagy, but whether they are relevant in vivo for tissue response to
      damage is unclear. Here we investigate the role of the optic atrophy 1
      (OPA1)-dependent cristae remodeling pathway in vivo and provide evidence that it 
      regulates the response of multiple tissues to apoptotic, necrotic, and atrophic
      stimuli. Genetic inhibition of the cristae remodeling pathway in vivo does not
      affect development, but protects mice from denervation-induced muscular atrophy, 
      ischemic heart and brain damage, as well as hepatocellular apoptosis.
      Mechanistically, OPA1-dependent mitochondrial cristae stabilization increases
      mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and blunts mitochondrial dysfunction,
      cytochrome c release, and reactive oxygen species production. Our results
      indicate that the OPA1-dependent cristae remodeling pathway is a fundamental,
      targetable determinant of tissue damage in vivo.

AB  - Acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a central metabolic intermediate. The abundance
      of acetyl-CoA in distinct subcellular compartments reflects the general energetic
      state of the cell. Moreover, acetyl-CoA concentrations influence the activity or 
      specificity of multiple enzymes, either in an allosteric manner or by altering
      substrate availability. Finally, by influencing the acetylation profile of
      several proteins, including histones, acetyl-CoA controls key cellular processes,
      including energy metabolism, mitosis, and autophagy, both directly and via the
      epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Thus, acetyl-CoA determines the balance
      between cellular catabolism and anabolism by simultaneously operating as a
      metabolic intermediate and as a second messenger.

AB  - Effective repair of the infarcted heart requires spatial containment of the
      inflammatory reaction within the infarcted area. A recently published study
      demonstrates that in the pro-inflammatory environment of the infarct border zone,
      surviving cardiomyocytes restrain inflammation by activating a Reg3beta-dependent
      cascade that recruits reparative macrophages and promotes neutrophil clearance.

AB  - The concept of leptin resistance posits that elevated endogenous leptin fails to 
      decrease food intake in obese animals due to diminished leptin signaling. In this
      issue, Ottaway et al. (2015) use leptin antagonists to reveal persistence (or
      even elevation) of endogenous leptin signaling and physiologic action in
      diet-induced obesity.

AB  - Cholesterol is required for the growth and viability of mammalian cells and is an
      obligate precursor for steroid hormone synthesis. Using a loss-of-function screen
      for mutants with defects in intracellular cholesterol trafficking, a Chinese
      hamster ovary cell mutant with haploinsufficiency of the U17 snoRNA was isolated.
      U17 is an H/ACA orphan snoRNA, for which a function other than ribosomal
      processing has not previously been identified. Through expression profiling, we
      identified hypoxia-upregulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR) mRNA as a
      target that is negatively regulated by U17 snoRNA. Upregulation of HUMMR in U17
      snoRNA-deficient cells promoted the formation of ER-mitochondrial contacts,
      decreasing esterification of cholesterol and facilitating cholesterol trafficking
      to mitochondria. U17 snoRNA and HUMMR regulate mitochondrial synthesis of
      steroids in vivo and are developmentally regulated in steroidogenic tissues,
      suggesting that the U17 snoRNA-HUMMR pathway may serve a previously unrecognized,
      physiological role in gonadal tissue maturation.

AB  - Obesity is characterized by hyperleptinemia and decreased response to exogenous
      leptin. This has been widely attributed to the development of leptin resistance, 
      a state of impaired leptin signaling proposed to contribute to the development
      and persistence of obesity. To directly determine endogenous leptin activity in
      obesity, we treated lean and obese mice with a leptin receptor antagonist. The
      antagonist increased feeding and body weight (BW) in lean mice, but not in obese 
      models of leptin, leptin receptor, or melanocortin-4 receptor deficiency. In
      contrast, the antagonist increased feeding and BW comparably in lean and
      diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, an increase associated with decreased hypothalamic
      expression of Socs3, a primary target of leptin. These findings demonstrate that 
      hyperleptinemic DIO mice retain leptin suppression of feeding comparable to lean 
      mice and counter the view that resistance to endogenous leptin contributes to the
      persistence of DIO in mice.

AB  - Bacterial biofilms in the colon alter the host tissue microenvironment. A role
      for biofilms in colon cancer metabolism has been suggested but to date has not
      been evaluated. Using metabolomics, we investigated the metabolic influence that 
      microbial biofilms have on colon tissues and the related occurrence of cancer.
      Patient-matched colon cancers and histologically normal tissues, with or without 
      biofilms, were examined. We show the upregulation of polyamine metabolites in
      tissues from cancer hosts with significant enhancement of N(1),
      N(12)-diacetylspermine in both biofilm-positive cancer and normal tissues.
      Antibiotic treatment, which cleared biofilms, decreased N(1),
      N(12)-diacetylspermine levels to those seen in biofilm-negative tissues,
      indicating that host cancer and bacterial biofilm structures contribute to the
      polyamine metabolite pool. These results show that colonic mucosal biofilms alter
      the cancer metabolome to produce a regulator of cellular proliferation and colon 
      cancer growth potentially affecting cancer development and progression.

AB  - Three mitochondria-encoded subunits form the catalytic core of cytochrome c
      oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. COX1 and COX2 contain heme
      and copper redox centers, which are integrated during assembly of the enzyme.
      Defects in this process lead to an enzyme deficiency and manifest as
      mitochondrial disorders in humans. Here we demonstrate that COA6 is specifically 
      required for COX2 biogenesis. Absence of COA6 leads to fast turnover of newly
      synthesized COX2 and a concomitant reduction in cytochrome c oxidase levels. COA6
      interacts transiently with the copper-containing catalytic domain of newly
      synthesized COX2. Interestingly, similar to the copper metallochaperone SCO2,
      loss of COA6 causes cardiomyopathy in humans. We show that COA6 and SCO2 interact
      and that corresponding pathogenic mutations in each protein affect complex
      formation. Our analyses define COA6 as a constituent of the mitochondrial copper 
      relay system, linking defects in COX2 metallation to cardiac cytochrome c oxidase
      deficiency.

AB  - The altered metabolism of tumor cells confers a selective advantage for survival 
      and proliferation, and studies have shown that targeting such metabolic shifts
      may be a useful therapeutic strategy. We developed an intensely fluorescent,
      rapidly responsive, pH-resistant, genetically encoded sensor of wide dynamic
      range, denoted SoNar, for tracking cytosolic NAD(+) and NADH redox states in
      living cells and in vivo. SoNar responds to subtle perturbations of various
      pathways of energy metabolism in real time, and allowed high-throughput screening
      for new agents targeting tumor metabolism. Among > 5,500 unique compounds, we
      identified KP372-1 as a potent NQO1-mediated redox cycling agent that produced
      extreme oxidative stress, selectively induced cancer cell apoptosis, and
      effectively decreased tumor growth in vivo. This study demonstrates that
      genetically encoded sensor-based metabolic screening could serve as a valuable
      approach for drug discovery.

AB  - The mitochondrial inner membrane is highly folded and displays a complex
      molecular architecture. Cristae junctions are highly curved tubular openings that
      separate cristae membrane invaginations from the surrounding boundary membrane.
      Despite their central role in many vital cellular processes like apoptosis, the
      details of cristae junction formation remain elusive. Here we identify Mic10, a
      core subunit of the recently discovered MICOS complex, as an inner mitochondrial 
      membrane protein with the ability to change membrane morphology in vitro and in
      vivo. We show that Mic10 spans the inner membrane in a hairpin topology and that 
      its ability to sculpt membranes depends on oligomerization through a glycine-rich
      motif. Oligomerization mutants fail to induce curvature in model membranes, and
      when expressed in yeast, mitochondria display an altered inner membrane
      architecture characterized by drastically decreased numbers of cristae junctions.
      Thus, we demonstrate that membrane sculpting by Mic10 is essential for cristae
      junction formation.

AB  - The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) is a
      conserved multi-subunit complex crucial for maintaining the characteristic
      architecture of mitochondria. Studies with deletion mutants identified Mic10 and 
      Mic60 as core subunits of MICOS. Mic60 has been studied in detail; however,
      topogenesis and function of Mic10 are unknown. We report that targeting of Mic10 
      to the mitochondrial inner membrane requires a positively charged internal loop, 
      but no cleavable presequence. Both transmembrane segments of Mic10 carry a
      characteristic four-glycine motif, which has been found in the ring-forming rotor
      subunit of F1Fo-ATP synthases. Overexpression of Mic10 profoundly alters the
      architecture of the inner membrane independently of other MICOS components. The
      four-glycine motifs are dispensable for interaction of Mic10 with other MICOS
      subunits but are crucial for the formation of large Mic10 oligomers. Our studies 
      identify a unique role of Mic10 oligomers in promoting the formation of inner
      membrane crista junctions.

AB  - The association of hepatic mitochondrial function with insulin resistance and
      non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or steatohepatitis (NASH) remains unclear. This 
      study applied high-resolution respirometry to directly quantify mitochondrial
      respiration in liver biopsies of obese insulin-resistant humans without (n = 18) 
      or with (n = 16) histologically proven NAFL or with NASH (n = 7) compared to lean
      individuals (n = 12). Despite similar mitochondrial content, obese humans with or
      without NAFL had 4.3- to 5.0-fold higher maximal respiration rates in isolated
      mitochondria than lean persons. NASH patients featured higher mitochondrial mass,
      but 31%-40% lower maximal respiration, which associated with greater hepatic
      insulin resistance, mitochondrial uncoupling, and leaking activity. In NASH,
      augmented hepatic oxidative stress (H2O2, lipid peroxides) and oxidative DNA
      damage (8-OH-deoxyguanosine) was paralleled by reduced anti-oxidant defense
      capacity and increased inflammatory response. These data suggest adaptation of
      the liver ("hepatic mitochondrial flexibility") at early stages of
      obesity-related insulin resistance, which is subsequently lost in NASH.

AB  - "Browning," the appearance and activation of brown-in-white (brite) adipose cells
      within inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and induction of uncoupling protein 
      1 (UCP1) correlate with fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21)-induced weight loss
      and glucose homeostasis improvements. Therefore, antiobesity therapies targeting 
      browning and brite adipocyte activation are currently being sought. To test the
      dependence of weight loss on browning, we examined whether this event was
      responsible for FGF21-Fc's beneficial effects. Lean and diet-induced obese mice
      housed at 21 degrees C or 30 degrees C that received FGF21-Fc exhibited similar
      degrees of body weight reduction and glucose homeostasis improvement. Substantial
      browning of iWAT occurred only in FGF21-Fc-treated lean mice housed at 21 degrees
      C. Further, FGF21-Fc-treated Ucp1(-/-) mice showed robust improvements in body
      weight, glucose homeostasis, and plasma lipids, associated with increased energy 
      expenditure and FGF21-Fc-induced Ppargc1 expression in iWAT. We conclude that
      FGF21 requires neither UCP1 nor brite adipocytes to elicit weight loss and
      improve glucose homeostasis.

AB  - Accumulation of diacylglycerol (DG) in muscle is thought to cause insulin
      resistance. DG is a precursor for phospholipids, thus phospholipid synthesis
      could be involved in regulating muscle DG. Little is known about the interaction 
      between phospholipid and DG in muscle; therefore, we examined whether disrupting 
      muscle phospholipid synthesis, specifically phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn),
      would influence muscle DG content and insulin sensitivity. Muscle PtdEtn
      synthesis was disrupted by deleting CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase 
      (ECT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, a major route
      for PtdEtn production. While PtdEtn was reduced in muscle-specific ECT knockout
      mice, intramyocellular and membrane-associated DG was markedly increased.
      Importantly, however, this was not associated with insulin resistance.
      Unexpectedly, mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle oxidative capacity were
      increased in muscle-specific ECT knockout mice and were accompanied by enhanced
      exercise performance. These findings highlight the importance of the
      CDP-ethanolamine pathway in regulating muscle DG content and challenge the
      DG-induced insulin resistance hypothesis.

AB  - Thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes convert chemical energy to heat by
      metabolizing glucose and lipids. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the CNS are
      essential for thermoregulation and accordingly may control metabolic activity of 
      thermogenic fat. To test this, we generated mice in which the human diphtheria
      toxin receptor (DTR) was selectively expressed in central 5-HT neurons. Treatment
      with diphtheria toxin (DT) eliminated 5-HT neurons and caused loss of
      thermoregulation, brown adipose tissue (BAT) steatosis, and a >50% decrease in
      uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) expression in BAT and inguinal white adipose tissue
      (WAT). In parallel, blood glucose increased 3.5-fold, free fatty acids 13.4-fold,
      and triglycerides 6.5-fold. Similar BAT and beige fat defects occurred in
      Lmx1b(f/f)ePet1(Cre) mice in which 5-HT neurons fail to develop in utero. We
      conclude 5-HT neurons play a major role in regulating glucose and lipid
      homeostasis, in part through recruitment and metabolic activation of brown and
      beige adipocytes.

AB  - Obesity, insulin resistance, and related pathologies are associated with
      immune-mediated chronic inflammation. Kit mutant mice are protected from
      diet-induced obesity and associated co-morbidities, and this phenotype has
      previously been attributed to their lack of mast cells. We performed a
      comprehensive metabolic analysis of Kit-dependent Kit(W/Wv) and Kit-independent
      Cpa3(Cre/+) mast-cell-deficient mouse strains, employing diet-induced or genetic 
      (Lep(Ob/Ob) background) models of obesity. Our results show that mast cell
      deficiency, in the absence of Kit mutations, plays no role in the regulation of
      weight gain or insulin resistance. Moreover, we provide evidence that the
      metabolic phenotype observed in Kit mutant mice, while independent of mast cells,
      is immune regulated. Our data underscore the value of definitive mast cell
      deficiency models to conclusively test the involvement of this enigmatic cell in 
      immune-mediated pathologies and identify Kit as a key hematopoietic factor in the
      pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Aging is a progressive decline of body function, during which many tissues
      accumulate few cells with high levels of deleted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
      leading to a defect of mitochondrial functions. Whether this mosaic mitochondrial
      deficiency contributes to organ dysfunction is unknown. To investigate this, we
      generated mice with an accelerated accumulation of mtDNA deletions in the
      myocardium, by expressing a dominant-negative mutant mitochondrial helicase.
      These animals accumulated few randomly distributed cardiomyocytes with
      compromised mitochondrial function, which led to spontaneous ventricular
      premature contractions and AV blocks at 18 months. These symptoms were not caused
      by a general mitochondrial dysfunction in the entire myocardium, and were not
      observed in mice at 12 months with significantly lower numbers of dysfunctional
      cells. Therefore, our results suggest that the disposition to arrhythmia
      typically found in the aged human heart might be due to the random accumulation
      of mtDNA deletions and the subsequent mosaic respiratory chain deficiency.

AB  - The link between smoking and insulin resistance, despite weight loss, is well
      established; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. A recent article 
      published in Nature Medicine by Wu et al. (2015) reports that nicotine, the main 
      bioactive component of tobacco smoke, activates AMPKalpha2 in adipocytes, leading
      to impaired insulin sensitivity.

AB  - In this issue, Baris et al. (2015) describe cardiac rhythm abnormalities in a
      mouse model of mitochondrial dysfunction in widely distributed cells of the aging
      human heart. How do a few metabolically challenged cells disrupt cardiac rhythm? 
      We suggest that these cells provide "crystallization centers" for latent
      dysfunctional zones to allow arrhythmia emergence.

AB  - The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex is
      essential for normal mitochondria biogenesis and morphology. In this issue,
      Bohnert et al. (2015) and Barbot et al. (2015) demonstrate that a MICOS core
      subunit, Mic10, is crucial for mitochondrial cristae formation by forming
      oligomers at the cristae junctions.

      biosynthesis alone is not sufficient to induce neutropenia or leukopenia, as has 
      been suggested by a previous report using an inducible knockout mouse model of
      ether lipid deficiency.

TI  - De Novo Reconstruction of Adipose Tissue Transcriptomes Reveals Long Non-coding
      RNA Regulators of Brown Adipocyte Development.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) protects against obesity by promoting energy
      expenditure via uncoupled respiration. To uncover BAT-specific long non-coding
      RNAs (lncRNAs), we used RNA-seq to reconstruct de novo transcriptomes of mouse
      brown, inguinal white, and epididymal white fat and identified approximately
      1,500 lncRNAs, including 127 BAT-restricted loci induced during differentiation
      and often targeted by key regulators PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and C/EBPbeta. One of
      them, lnc-BATE1, is required for establishment and maintenance of BAT identity
      and thermogenic capacity. lnc-BATE1 inhibition impairs concurrent activation of
      brown fat and repression of white fat genes and is partially rescued by exogenous
      lnc-BATE1 with mutated siRNA-targeting sites, demonstrating a function in trans. 
      We show that lnc-BATE1 binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U and that
      both are required for brown adipogenesis. Our work provides an annotated catalog 
      for the study of fat depot-selective lncRNAs and establishes lnc-BATE1 as a
      regulator of BAT development and physiology.

TI  - SIRT1-Mediated eNAMPT Secretion from Adipose Tissue Regulates Hypothalamic NAD+
      and Function in Mice.

AB  - Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the key NAD(+) biosynthetic
      enzyme, has two different forms, intra- and extracellular (iNAMPT and eNAMPT), in
      mammals. However, the significance of eNAMPT secretion remains unclear. Here we
      demonstrate that deacetylation of iNAMPT by the mammalian NAD(+)-dependent
      deacetylase SIRT1 predisposes the protein to secretion in adipocytes. NAMPT
      mutants reveal that SIRT1 deacetylates lysine 53 (K53) and enhances eNAMPT
      activity and secretion. Adipose tissue-specific Nampt knockout and knockin (ANKO 
      and ANKI) mice show reciprocal changes in circulating eNAMPT, affecting
      hypothalamic NAD(+)/SIRT1 signaling and physical activity accordingly. The defect
      in physical activity observed in ANKO mice is ameliorated by nicotinamide
      mononucleotide (NMN). Furthermore, administration of a NAMPT-neutralizing
      antibody decreases hypothalamic NAD(+) production, and treating ex vivo
      hypothalamic explants with purified eNAMPT enhances NAD(+), SIRT1 activity, and
      neural activation. Thus, our findings indicate a critical role of adipose tissue 
      as a modulator for the regulation of NAD(+) biosynthesis at a systemic level.

AB  - SIRT3 is a member of the Sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacylases and plays 
      a critical role in metabolic regulation. Organism-wide SIRT3 loss manifests in
      metabolic alterations; however, the coordinating role of SIRT3 among
      metabolically distinct tissues is unknown. Using multi-tissue quantitative
      proteomics comparing fasted wild-type mice to mice lacking SIRT3, innovative
      bioinformatic analysis, and biochemical validation, we provide a comprehensive
      view of mitochondrial acetylation and SIRT3 function. We find SIRT3 regulates the
      acetyl-proteome in core mitochondrial processes common to brain, heart, kidney,
      liver, and skeletal muscle, but differentially regulates metabolic pathways in
      fuel-producing and fuel-utilizing tissues. We propose an additional maintenance
      function for SIRT3 in liver and kidney where SIRT3 expression is elevated to
      reduce the acetate load on mitochondrial proteins. We provide evidence that SIRT3
      impacts ketone body utilization in the brain and reveal a pivotal role for SIRT3 
      in the coordination between tissues required for metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Neurons utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to generate
      energy essential for survival, function, and behavioral output. Unlike most cells
      that burn both fat and sugar, neurons only burn sugar. Despite its importance,
      how neurons meet the increased energy demands of complex behaviors such as
      learning and memory is poorly understood. Here we show that the estrogen-related 
      receptor gamma (ERRgamma) orchestrates the expression of a distinct neural gene
      network promoting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism that reflects the
      extraordinary neuronal dependence on glucose. ERRgamma(-/-) neurons exhibit
      decreased metabolic capacity. Impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in
      ERRgamma(-/-) hippocampal slices can be fully rescued by the mitochondrial OxPhos
      substrate pyruvate, functionally linking the ERRgamma knockout metabolic
      phenotype and memory formation. Consistent with this notion, mice lacking
      neuronal ERRgamma in cerebral cortex and hippocampus exhibit defects in spatial
      learning and memory. These findings implicate neuronal ERRgamma in the metabolic 
      adaptations required for memory formation.

AB  - Statin-induced myopathy (SIM) is the most common reason for discontinuation of
      statin therapy. A polymorphism affecting the gene encoding glycine
      amidinotransferase (GATM rs9806699 G > A) was previously associated with reduced 
      risk for SIM. Our objective was to replicate the GATM association in a large,
      multicenter SIM case-control study. Mild and severe SIM cases and age- and
      gender-matched controls were enrolled. Participants were genotyped, and
      associations were tested (n = 715) using chi-square and logistic regression with 
      consideration for SIM severity and exclusion of subjects with potentially
      confounding comedications. The minor allele (A) frequencies of GATM rs9806699 in 
      the controls (n = 106), mild SIM (n = 324), and severe SIM (n = 285) cases were
      0.26, 0.28, and 0.29, respectively (p = 0.447). The unadjusted odds ratio for the
      A allele for any SIM (mild or severe) was 1.14 (0.82-1.61; p = 0.437), which
      remained nonsignificant in all models. Our results do not replicate the
      association between GATM rs9806699 and SIM.

      mRNA and Other mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins.

AB  - Although variants in the IGF2BP2/IMP2 gene confer risk for type 2 diabetes, IMP2,
      an RNA binding protein, is not known to regulate metabolism. Imp2(-/-) mice gain 
      less lean mass after weaning and have increased lifespan. Imp2(-/-) mice are
      highly resistant to diet-induced obesity and fatty liver and display superior
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, increased energy expenditure, and
      better defense of core temperature on cold exposure. Imp2(-/-) brown fat and
      Imp2(-/-) brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro contain more UCP1 polypeptide 
      than Imp2(+/+) despite similar levels of Ucp1 mRNA; the Imp2(-/-)adipocytes also 
      exhibit greater uncoupled oxygen consumption. IMP2 binds the mRNAs encoding Ucp1 
      and other mitochondrial components, and most exhibit increased translational
      efficiency in the absence of IMP2. In vitro IMP2 inhibits translation of mRNAs
      bearing the Ucp1 untranslated segments. Thus IMP2 limits longevity and regulates 
      nutrient and energy metabolism in the mouse by controlling the translation of its
      client mRNAs.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and mutant bone morphogenetic protein
      receptor 2 (BMPR2) are associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), an 
      incurable disease characterized by pulmonary arterial (PA) endothelial cell (EC) 
      apoptosis, decreased microvessels, and occlusive vascular remodeling. We
      hypothesized that reduced BMPR2 induces PAEC mitochondrial dysfunction, promoting
      a pro-inflammatory or pro-apoptotic state. Mice with EC deletion of BMPR2 develop
      hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension that, in contrast to non-transgenic
      littermates, does not reverse upon reoxygenation and is associated with reduced
      PA microvessels and lung EC p53, PGC1alpha and TFAM, regulators of mitochondrial 
      biogenesis, and mitochondrial DNA. Decreasing PAEC BMPR2 by siRNA during
      reoxygenation represses p53, PGC1alpha, NRF2, TFAM, mitochondrial membrane
      potential, and ATP and induces mitochondrial DNA deletion and apoptosis. Reducing
      PAEC BMPR2 in normoxia increases p53, PGC1alpha, TFAM, mitochondrial membrane
      potential, ATP production, and glycolysis, and induces mitochondrial fission and 
      a pro-inflammatory state. These features are recapitulated in PAECs from PAH
      patients with mutant BMPR2.

AB  - Exercise induces physiological cardiac growth and protects the heart against
      pathological remodeling. Recent work suggests exercise also enhances the heart's 
      capacity for repair, which could be important for regenerative therapies. While
      microRNAs are important in certain cardiac pathologies, less is known about their
      functional roles in exercise-induced cardiac phenotypes. We profiled cardiac
      microRNA expression in two distinct models of exercise and found microRNA-222
      (miR-222) was upregulated in both. Downstream miR-222 targets modulating
      cardiomyocyte phenotypes were identified, including HIPK1 and HMBOX1. Inhibition 
      of miR-222 in vivo completely blocked cardiac and cardiomyocyte growth in
      response to exercise while reducing markers of cardiomyocyte proliferation.
      Importantly, mice with inducible cardiomyocyte miR-222 expression were resistant 
      to adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after ischemic injury. These
      studies implicate miR-222 as necessary for exercise-induced cardiomyocyte growth 
      and proliferation in the adult mammalian heart and show that it is sufficient to 
      protect the heart against adverse remodeling.

AB  - A unique population of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, with a distinct 
      transcriptome and antigen-receptor repertoire, resides in visceral adipose tissue
      (VAT) of lean individuals. These cells regulate local inflammation and both local
      and systemic metabolic indices. Here we focus on expansion of the VAT Treg
      compartment in aging lean mice-assessing these cells' phenotypic conversion from 
      conventional CD4(+) T cells, influx from lymphoid organs, and local population
      dynamics. Our findings establish that the VAT Treg compartment is seeded from
      thymocytes generated during the first weeks of life and expands beyond 10 weeks
      of age due to indolent proliferation, of certain clones in particular, coupled
      with enhanced survival. Accumulation of VAT Tregs depends on the antigen(s)
      presented by MHC class-II molecules and soluble mediators, notably
      interleukin(IL)-33. Addressing such factors therapeutically promises novel
      approaches for harnessing Tregs to stem the growing epidemic of obesity and
      consequent metabolic abnormalities.

      agents.

AB  - Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but little is known about its influence
      on the intestinal immune system. Here we show that the gut immune system is
      altered during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and is a functional regulator of
      obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) that can be exploited therapeutically.
      Obesity induces a chronic phenotypic pro-inflammatory shift in bowel lamina
      propria immune cell populations. Reduction of the gut immune system, using beta7 
      integrin-deficient mice (Beta7(null)), decreases HFD-induced IR. Treatment of
      wild-type HFD C57BL/6 mice with the local gut anti-inflammatory,
      5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA), reverses bowel inflammation and improves
      metabolic parameters. These beneficial effects are dependent on adaptive and gut 
      immunity and are associated with reduced gut permeability and endotoxemia,
      decreased visceral adipose tissue inflammation, and improved antigen-specific
      tolerance to luminal antigens. Thus, the mucosal immune system affects multiple
      pathways associated with systemic IR and represents a novel therapeutic target in
      this disease.

AB  - Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of
      DNA-binding transcription factors and act as sensors of cholesterol homeostasis. 
      Under normal conditions, when intracellular cholesterol concentration increases, 
      cells synthesize oxysterols and activate the LXR transcriptional network to drive
      cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol influx and synthesis. During normal and
      cancer cell proliferation, there is a net uncoupling between intracellular
      cholesterol increase and LXR activation resulting from the reduced intracellular 
      oxysterol concentration. This review dissects the novel mechanisms of a
      previously unrecognized metabolic uncoupling, supporting the activation of the
      LXR axis as a bona fide therapeutic approach in cancer.

AB  - Micropeptides represent an emerging class of eukaryotic regulators that are
      easily missed in conventional genome annotation. Anderson et al. (2015) describe 
      how a new tissue-specific micropeptide, myoregulin (MLN), interacts with the
      skeletal muscle calcium handling machinery to moderate contractile activity,
      representing a promising drug target for improving muscle performance.

AB  - NLRP3-inflammasome activates caspase-1 and processes pro-IL-1beta and pro-IL-18
      into the active cytokines. Two recent studies describe specific inhibitors of
      NLRP3 inflammasome that inhibit IL-1beta release and inflammation. The
      specificity and potency of these compounds gives hope that a targeted approach to
      inhibit NLRP3-driven inflammation may be just around the corner.

AB  - In a recent publication in Neuron, Choe et al. (2015) demonstrate that
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling mediates salt-induced blood
      pressure elevation by increasing the excitability of hypothalamic
      vasopressin-secreting neurons. These findings suggest complex roles for BDNF in
      adaptive cardiovascular responses to physiological challenges and in the
      pathogenesis of hypertension.

AB  - Biomedical research is not immune to economic imperatives. But as the realities
      of profit encroach ever closer on what was once regarded as an idealistic and
      selfless endeavor, the author reflects on four trends that are hollowing out the 
      research enterprise.

TI  - Lack of sterol regulatory element binding factor-1c imposes glial Fatty Acid
      utilization leading to peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Myelin is a membrane characterized by high lipid content to facilitate impulse
      propagation. Changes in myelin fatty acid (FA) composition have been associated
      with peripheral neuropathy, but the specific role of peripheral nerve FA
      synthesis in myelin formation and function is poorly understood. We have found
      that mice lacking sterol regulatory element-binding factor-1c (Srebf1c) have
      blunted peripheral nerve FA synthesis that results in development of peripheral
      neuropathy. Srebf1c-null mice develop Remak bundle alterations and
      hypermyelination of small-caliber fibers that impair nerve function. Peripheral
      nerves lacking Srebf1c show decreased FA synthesis and glycolytic flux, but
      increased FA catabolism and mitochondrial function. These metabolic alterations
      are the result of local accumulation of two endogenous peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (Pparalpha) ligands,
      1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine and
      1-stearoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine. Treatment with a Pparalpha 
      antagonist rescues the neuropathy of Srebf1c-null mice. These findings reveal the
      importance of peripheral nerve FA synthesis to sustain myelin structure and
      function.

AB  - Genetic inhibition of PI3K signaling increases energy expenditure, protects from 
      obesity and metabolic syndrome, and extends longevity. Here, we show that two
      pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, CNIO-PI3Ki and GDC-0941, decrease the
      adiposity of obese mice without affecting their lean mass. Long-term treatment of
      obese mice with low doses of CNIO-PI3Ki reduces body weight until reaching a
      balance that is stable for months as long as the treatment continues. CNIO-PI3Ki 
      treatment also ameliorates liver steatosis and decreases glucose serum levels.
      The above observations have been recapitulated in independent laboratories and
      using different oral formulations of CNIO-PI3Ki. Finally, daily oral treatment of
      obese rhesus monkeys for 3 months with low doses of CNIO-PI3Ki decreased their
      adiposity and lowered their serum glucose levels, in the absence of detectable
      toxicities. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K is an effective and
      safe anti-obesity intervention that could reverse the negative effects of
      metabolic syndrome in humans.

AB  - Immune cells regulate a hypertonic microenvironment in the skin; however, the
      biological advantage of increased skin Na(+) concentrations is unknown. We found 
      that Na(+) accumulated at the site of bacterial skin infections in humans and in 
      mice. We used the protozoan parasite Leishmania major as a model of skin-prone
      macrophage infection to test the hypothesis that skin-Na(+) storage facilitates
      antimicrobial host defense. Activation of macrophages in the presence of high
      NaCl concentrations modified epigenetic markers and enhanced p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK)-dependent nuclear factor of activated
      T cells 5 (NFAT5) activation. This high-salt response resulted in elevated type-2
      nitric oxide synthase (Nos2)-dependent NO production and improved Leishmania
      major control. Finally, we found that increasing Na(+) content in the skin by a
      high-salt diet boosted activation of macrophages in a Nfat5-dependent manner and 
      promoted cutaneous antimicrobial defense. We suggest that the hypertonic
      microenvironment could serve as a barrier to infection.

TI  - Translational tolerance of mitochondrial genes to metabolic energy stress
      involves TISU and eIF1-eIF4GI cooperation in start codon selection.

AB  - Protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process, which is rapidly repressed
      upon energy stress by AMPK. How energy deficiency affects translation of mRNAs
      that cope with the stress response is poorly understood. We found that
      mitochondrial genes remain translationally active upon energy deprivation.
      Surprisingly, inhibition of translation is partially retained in
      AMPKalpha1/AMPKalpha2 knockout cells. Mitochondrial mRNAs are enriched with TISU,
      a translation initiator of short 5' UTR, which confers resistance specifically to
      energy stress. Purified 48S preinitiation complex is sufficient for initiation
      via TISU AUG, when preceded by a short 5' UTR. eIF1 stimulates TISU but inhibits 
      non-TISU-directed initiation. Remarkably, eIF4GI shares this activity and also
      interacts with eIF1. Furthermore, eIF4F is released upon 48S formation on TISU.
      These findings describe a specialized translation tolerance mechanism enabling
      continuous translation of TISU genes under energy stress and reveal that a key
      step in start codon selection of short 5' UTR is eIF4F release.

AB  - Maximal exercise-associated oxidative capacity is strongly correlated with health
      and longevity in humans. Rats selectively bred for high running capacity (HCR)
      have improved metabolic health and are longer-lived than their low-capacity
      counterparts (LCR). Using metabolomic and proteomic profiling, we show that HCR
      efficiently oxidize fatty acids (FAs) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs),
      sparing glycogen and reducing accumulation of short- and medium-chain
      acylcarnitines. HCR mitochondria have reduced acetylation of mitochondrial
      proteins within oxidative pathways at rest, and there is rapid protein
      deacetylation with exercise, which is greater in HCR than LCR. Fluxomic analysis 
      of valine degradation with exercise demonstrates a functional role of
      differential protein acetylation in HCR and LCR. Our data suggest that efficient 
      FA and BCAA utilization contribute to high intrinsic exercise capacity and the
      health and longevity benefits associated with enhanced fitness.

      metabolism in mice.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a significant portion of mammalian
      genome, yet the physiological importance of lncRNAs is largely unknown. Here, we 
      identify a liver-enriched lncRNA in mouse that we term liver-specific
      triglyceride regulator (lncLSTR). Mice with a liver-specific depletion of lncLSTR
      exhibit a marked reduction in plasma triglyceride levels. We show that lncLSTR
      depletion enhances apoC2 expression, leading to robust lipoprotein lipase
      activation and increased plasma triglyceride clearance. We further demonstrate
      that the regulation of apoC2 expression occurs through an FXR-mediated pathway.
      LncLSTR forms a molecular complex with TDP-43 to regulate expression of Cyp8b1, a
      key enzyme in the bile acid synthesis pathway, and engenders an in vivo bile pool
      that induces apoC2 expression through FXR. Finally, we demonstrate that lncLSTR
      depletion can reduce triglyceride levels in a hyperlipidemia mouse model. Taken
      together, these data support a model in which lncLSTR regulates a
      TDP-43/FXR/apoC2-dependent pathway to maintain systemic lipid homeostasis.

AB  - Mitochondria are known to be functional organelles, but their role as a signaling
      unit is increasingly being appreciated. The identification of a short open
      reading frame (sORF) in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encodes a signaling
      peptide, humanin, suggests the possible existence of additional sORFs in the
      mtDNA. Here we report a sORF within the mitochondrial 12S rRNA encoding a
      16-amino-acid peptide named MOTS-c (mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S
      rRNA-c) that regulates insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis. Its primary
      target organ appears to be the skeletal muscle, and its cellular actions inhibit 
      the folate cycle and its tethered de novo purine biosynthesis, leading to AMPK
      activation. MOTS-c treatment in mice prevented age-dependent and
      high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance, as well as diet-induced obesity. These 
      results suggest that mitochondria may actively regulate metabolic homeostasis at 
      the cellular and organismal level via peptides encoded within their genome.

AB  - Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain a wide variety of posttranscriptional modifications
      that are important for accurate decoding. Mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs
      (mt-tRNAs) are modified by nuclear-encoded tRNA-modifying enzymes; however, the
      physiological roles of these modifications remain largely unknown. In this study,
      we report that Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (Cdk5rap1) is
      responsible for 2-methylthio (ms(2)) modifications of mammalian mt-tRNAs for
      Ser(UCN), Phe, Tyr, and Trp codons. Deficiency in ms(2) modification markedly
      impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, which resulted in respiratory defects
      in Cdk5rap1 knockout (KO) mice. The KO mice were highly susceptive to
      stress-induced mitochondrial remodeling and exhibited accelerated myopathy and
      cardiac dysfunction under stressed conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
      the ms(2) modifications of mt-tRNAs were sensitive to oxidative stress and were
      reduced in patients with mitochondrial disease. These findings highlight the
      fundamental role of ms(2) modifications of mt-tRNAs in mitochondrial protein
      synthesis and their pathological consequences in mitochondrial disease.

AB  - ABAT is a key enzyme responsible for catabolism of principal inhibitory
      neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). We report an essential role for 
      ABAT in a seemingly unrelated pathway, mitochondrial nucleoside salvage, and
      demonstrate that mutations in this enzyme cause an autosomal recessive
      neurometabolic disorder and mtDNA depletion syndrome (MDS). We describe a family 
      with encephalomyopathic MDS caused by a homozygous missense mutation in ABAT that
      results in elevated GABA in subjects' brains as well as decreased mtDNA levels in
      subjects' fibroblasts. Nucleoside rescue and co-IP experiments pinpoint that ABAT
      functions in the mitochondrial nucleoside salvage pathway to facilitate
      conversion of dNDPs to dNTPs. Pharmacological inhibition of ABAT through the
      irreversible inhibitor Vigabatrin caused depletion of mtDNA in photoreceptor
      cells that was prevented through addition of dNTPs in cell culture media. This
      work reveals ABAT as a connection between GABA metabolism and nucleoside
      metabolism and defines a neurometabolic disorder that includes MDS.

      macrophage recruitment but does not improve insulin resistance.

AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a paradoxical role in inflammation and metabolism. The
      pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6 are mediated via IL-6 "trans-signaling," a
      process where the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) binds IL-6 and
      activates signaling in inflammatory cells that express the gp130 but not the IL-6
      receptor. Here we show that trans-signaling recruits macrophages into adipose
      tissue (ATM). Moreover, blocking trans-signaling with soluble gp130Fc protein
      prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced ATM accumulation, but does not improve
      insulin action. Importantly, however, blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling, unlike
      complete ablation of IL-6 signaling, does not exacerbate obesity-induced weight
      gain, liver steatosis, or insulin resistance. Our data identify the sIL-6R as a
      critical chemotactic signal for ATM recruitment and suggest that selectively
      blocking IL-6 trans-signaling may be a more favorable treatment option for
      inflammatory diseases, compared with current treatments that completely block the
      action of IL-6 and negatively impact upon metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Loss of pluripotency is a gradual event whose initiating factors are largely
      unknown. Here we report the earliest metabolic changes induced during the first
      hours of differentiation. High-resolution NMR identified 44 metabolites and a
      distinct metabolic transition occurring during early differentiation. Metabolic
      and transcriptional analyses showed that pluripotent cells produced acetyl-CoA
      through glycolysis and rapidly lost this function during differentiation.
      Importantly, modulation of glycolysis blocked histone deacetylation and
      differentiation in human and mouse embryonic stem cells. Acetate, a precursor of 
      acetyl-CoA, delayed differentiation and blocked early histone deacetylation in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors upstream of acetyl-CoA caused differentiation
      of pluripotent cells, while those downstream delayed differentiation. Our results
      show a metabolic switch causing a loss of histone acetylation and pluripotent
      state during the first hours of differentiation. Our data highlight the important
      role metabolism plays in pluripotency and suggest that a glycolytic switch
      controlling histone acetylation can release stem cells from pluripotency.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreted from enteroendocrine L cells promotes
      nutrient disposal via the incretin effect. However, the majority of L cells are
      localized to the distal gut, suggesting additional biological roles for GLP-1.
      Here, we demonstrate that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling controls mucosal
      expansion of the small bowel (SB) and colon. These actions did not require the
      epidermal growth factor (EGF) or intestinal epithelial insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF1) receptors but were absent in Glp1r(-/-) mice. Polyp number and size were
      increased in SB of exendin-4-treated Apc(Min/+) mice, whereas polyp number was
      reduced in SB and colon of Glp1r(-/-):Apc(Min/+) mice. Exendin-4 increased
      fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) expression in colonic polyps of Apc(Min/+) mice
      and failed to increase intestinal growth in mice lacking Fgf7. Exogenous
      exendin-4 and Fgf7 regulated an overlapping set of genes important for intestinal
      growth. Thus, gain and loss of GLP-1R signaling regulates gut growth and
      intestinal tumorigenesis.

AB  - Protein synthesis is critically dependent on transfer (t)-RNAs, but the factors
      regulating tRNA function are poorly understood. In this issue of Cell Metabolism,
      Wei et al. (2015) show that Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein-like-1
      synchronizes mitochondrial and cytosolic translation in response to external
      stress, providing key insight into the pathogenesis of a common inherited
      mitochondrial disease.

AB  - Bariatric surgical procedures such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most potent treatments available to
      produce sustained reductions in body weight and improvements in glucose
      regulation. While traditionally these effects are attributed to mechanical
      aspects of these procedures, such as restriction and malabsorption, a growing
      body of evidence from mouse models of these procedures points to physiological
      changes that mediate the potent effects of these surgeries. In particular, there 
      are similar changes in gut hormone secretion, bile acid levels, and composition
      after both of these procedures. Moreover, loss of function of the nuclear bile
      acid receptor (FXR) greatly diminishes the effects of VSG. Both VSG and RYGB are 
      linked to profound changes in the gut microbiome that also mediate at least some 
      of these surgical effects. We hypothesize that surgical rearrangement of the
      gastrointestinal tract results in enteroplasticity caused by the high rate of
      nutrient presentation and altered pH in the small intestine that contribute to
      these physiological effects. Identifying the molecular underpinnings of these
      procedures provides new opportunities to understand the relationship of the
      gastrointestinal tract to obesity and diabetes as well as new therapeutic
      strategies to harness the effectiveness of surgery with less-invasive approaches.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) had long been referred to as the "geneticist's nightmare." 
      Genome-wide association studies have fully confirmed the polygenic nature of T2D,
      demonstrating the role of many genes in T2D risk. The increasingly busier picture
      of T2D genetics is quite difficult to understand for the diabetes research
      community, which can create misunderstandings with geneticists, and can
      eventually limit both basic research and translational outcomes of these genetic 
      discoveries. The present review wishes to lift the fog around genetics of T2D
      with the hope that it will foster integrated diabetes modeling approaches from
      genetic defects to personalized medicine.

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is a complex trait with multiple genetic and
      environmental components. Confounded by large differences between the sexes,
      environment, and disease pathology, the genetic basis of IR has been difficult to
      dissect. Here we examine IR and related traits in a diverse population of more
      than 100 unique male and female inbred mouse strains after feeding a diet rich in
      fat and refined carbohydrates. Our results show dramatic variation in IR among
      strains of mice and widespread differences between sexes that are dependent on
      genotype. We uncover more than 15 genome-wide significant loci and validate a
      gene, Agpat5, associated with IR. We also integrate plasma metabolite levels and 
      global gene expression from liver and adipose tissue to identify metabolite
      quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and expression QTL (eQTL), respectively. Our
      results provide a resource for analysis of interactions between diet, sex, and
      genetic background in IR.

AB  - Decretins, hormones induced by fasting that suppress insulin production and
      secretion, have been postulated from classical human metabolic studies. From
      genetic screens, we identified Drosophila Limostatin (Lst), a peptide hormone
      that suppresses insulin secretion. Lst is induced by nutrient restriction in
      gut-associated endocrine cells. limostatin deficiency led to hyperinsulinemia,
      hypoglycemia, and excess adiposity. A conserved 15-residue polypeptide encoded by
      limostatin suppressed secretion by insulin-producing cells. Targeted knockdown of
      CG9918, a Drosophila ortholog of Neuromedin U receptors (NMURs), in
      insulin-producing cells phenocopied limostatin deficiency and attenuated insulin 
      suppression by purified Lst, suggesting CG9918 encodes an Lst receptor. NMUR1 is 
      expressed in islet beta cells, and purified NMU suppresses insulin secretion from
      human islets. A human mutant NMU variant that co-segregates with familial
      early-onset obesity and hyperinsulinemia fails to suppress insulin secretion. We 
      propose Lst as an index member of an ancient hormone class called decretins,
      which suppress insulin output.

AB  - Mitochondrial iron accumulation is a hallmark of diseases associated with
      impaired iron-sulfur cluster (Fe-S) biogenesis, such as Friedreich ataxia linked 
      to frataxin (FXN) deficiency. The pathophysiological relevance of the
      mitochondrial iron loading and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using a
      mouse model of hepatic FXN deficiency in combination with mice deficient for iron
      regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), a key regulator of cellular iron metabolism, we show
      that IRP1 activation in conditions of Fe-S deficiency increases the available
      cytosolic labile iron pool. Surprisingly, our data indicate that IRP1 activation 
      sustains mitochondrial iron supply and function rather than driving detrimental
      iron overload. Mitochondrial iron accumulation is shown to depend on
      mitochondrial dysfunction and heme-dependent upregulation of the mitochondrial
      iron importer mitoferrin-2. Our results uncover an unexpected protective role of 
      IRP1 in pathological conditions associated with altered Fe-S metabolism.

AB  - Specific bile acids are potent signaling molecules that modulate metabolic
      pathways affecting lipid, glucose and bile acid homeostasis, and the microbiota. 
      Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, and the key enzymes
      involved in bile acid synthesis (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1) are regulated transcriptionally 
      by the nuclear receptor FXR. We have identified an FXR-regulated pathway upstream
      of a transcriptional repressor that controls multiple bile acid metabolism genes.
      We identify MafG as an FXR target gene and show that hepatic MAFG overexpression 
      represses genes of the bile acid synthetic pathway and modifies the biliary bile 
      acid composition. In contrast, loss-of-function studies using MafG(+/-) mice
      causes de-repression of the same genes with concordant changes in biliary bile
      acid levels. Finally, we identify functional MafG response elements in bile acid 
      metabolism genes using ChIP-seq analysis. Our studies identify a molecular
      mechanism for the complex feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis controlled
      by FXR.

AB  - Mice deficient in the nuclear hormone receptor RORgammat have defective
      development of thymocytes, lymphoid organs, Th17 cells, and type 3 innate
      lymphoid cells. RORgammat binds to oxysterols derived from cholesterol
      catabolism, but it is not clear whether these are its natural ligands. Here, we
      show that sterol lipids are necessary and sufficient to drive RORgammat-dependent
      transcription. We combined overexpression, RNAi, and genetic deletion of
      metabolic enzymes to study RORgamma-dependent transcription. Our results are
      consistent with the RORgammat ligand(s) being a cholesterol biosynthetic
      intermediate (CBI) downstream of lanosterol and upstream of zymosterol. Analysis 
      of lipids bound to RORgamma identified molecules with molecular weights
      consistent with CBIs. Furthermore, CBIs stabilized the RORgamma ligand-binding
      domain and induced coactivator recruitment. Genetic deletion of metabolic enzymes
      upstream of the RORgammat-ligand(s) affected the development of lymph nodes and
      Th17 cells. Our data suggest that CBIs play a role in lymphocyte development
      potentially through regulation of RORgammat.

      Rare mutations in the WNT co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are similarly associated
      with bone and cardiometabolic disorders. We investigated the role of LRP5 in
      human adipose tissue. Subjects with gain-of-function LRP5 mutations and high bone
      mass had enhanced lower-body fat accumulation. Reciprocally, a low bone mineral
      density-associated common LRP5 allele correlated with increased abdominal
      adiposity. Ex vivo LRP5 expression was higher in abdominal versus gluteal
      adipocyte progenitors. Equivalent knockdown of LRP5 in both progenitor types
      dose-dependently impaired beta-catenin signaling and led to distinct biological
      outcomes: diminished gluteal and enhanced abdominal adipogenesis. These data
      highlight how depot differences in WNT/beta-catenin pathway activity modulate
      human fat distribution via effects on adipocyte progenitor biology. They also
      identify LRP5 as a potential pharmacologic target for the treatment of
      cardiometabolic disorders.

AB  - Multidrug-resistant bacteria are an increasingly serious threat to human and
      animal health. However, novel drugs that can manage infections by
      multidrug-resistant bacteria have proved elusive. Here we show that glucose and
      alanine abundances are greatly suppressed in kanamycin-resistant Edwardsiella
      tarda by GC-MS-based metabolomics. Exogenous alanine or glucose restores
      susceptibility of multidrug-resistant E. tarda to killing by kanamycin,
      demonstrating an approach to killing multidrug-resistant bacteria. The mechanism 
      underlying this approach is that exogenous glucose or alanine promotes the TCA
      cycle by substrate activation, which in turn increases production of NADH and
      proton motive force and stimulates uptake of antibiotic. Similar results are
      obtained with other Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus
      aureus), and the results are also reproduced in a mouse model for urinary tract
      infection. This study establishes a functional metabolomics-based strategy to
      manage infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Skeletal and cardiac muscles play key roles in the regulation of systemic energy 
      homeostasis and display remarkable plasticity in their metabolic responses to
      caloric availability and physical activity. In this Perspective we discuss recent
      studies highlighting transcriptional mechanisms that govern systemic metabolism
      by striated muscles. We focus on the participation of the Mediator complex in
      this process, and suggest that tissue-specific regulation of Mediator subunits
      impacts metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Exercise is the archetype of physiologic demands placed on the cardiovascular
      system. Acute responses provide an informative assessment of cardiovascular
      function and fitness, while repeated exercise promotes cardiovascular health and 
      evokes important molecular, structural, and functional changes contributing to
      its effects in primary and secondary prevention. Here we examine the use of
      exercise in murine models, both as a phenotypic assay and as a provocative
      intervention. We first review the advantages and limitations of exercise testing 
      for assessing cardiac function, then highlight the cardiac structural and
      cellular changes elicited by chronic exercise and key molecular pathways that
      mediate these effects.

AB  - The prevalence of heart disease, especially heart failure, continues to increase,
      and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. As
      cardiomyocytes are essentially irreplaceable, protein quality control is pivotal 
      to cellular homeostasis and, ultimately, cardiac performance. Three
      evolutionarily conserved mechanisms-autophagy, the unfolded protein response, and
      the ubiquitin-proteasome system-act in concert to degrade misfolded proteins and 
      eliminate defective organelles. Recent advances have revealed that these
      mechanisms are intimately associated with cellular metabolism. Going forward,
      comprehensive understanding of the role of protein quality control mechanisms in 
      cardiac pathology will require integration of metabolic pathways and metabolic
      control.

AB  - Prolonged mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening results in
      mitochondrial energetic dysfunction, organelle swelling, rupture, and typically a
      type of necrotic cell death. However, acute opening of the MPTP has a critical
      physiologic role in regulating mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling and metabolism.
      Despite the physiological and pathological roles that the MPTP orchestrates, the 
      proteins that comprise the pore itself remain an area of ongoing investigation.
      Here, we will discuss the molecular composition of the MPTP and its role in
      regulating cardiac physiology and disease. A better understanding of MPTP
      structure and function will likely suggest novel cardioprotective therapeutic
      approaches.

AB  - Mitochondrial fitness is central to heart health. In many cell types,
      mitochondria are dynamic, interconnected filamentous networks. By comparison,
      mitochondria of healthy postmitotic adult cardiomyocytes are shortened, round,
      hypodynamic organelles. Mitochondrial networks are absent in cardiomyocytes;
      fission, fusion, and organelle mobility are not normally observed. Nevertheless, 
      mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 and fusion factors Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 are
      abundant and indispensable in adult hearts. Here, we review recent insights into 
      roles for mitochondrial dynamics factors not strictly related to morphometric
      remodeling, advancing the argument that fission and fusion of cardiomyocyte
      mitochondria support surveillance, sequestration, and mitophagic removal of
      damaged organelles.

AB  - Cardiomyocyte function depends on coordinated movements of calcium into and out
      of the cell and the proper delivery of ATP to energy-utilizing enzymes. Defects
      in calcium-handling proteins and abnormal energy metabolism are features of heart
      failure. Recent discoveries have led to gene-based therapies targeting
      calcium-transporting or -binding proteins, such as the cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic
      reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), leading to improvements in calcium
      homeostasis and excitation-contraction coupling. Here we review impaired calcium 
      cycling and energetics in heart failure, assessing their roles from both a
      mutually exclusive and interdependent viewpoint, and discuss therapies that may
      improve the failing myocardium.

AB  - Heart failure is highly influenced by heritability, and nearly 100 genes link to 
      familial cardiomyopathy. Despite the marked genetic diversity that underlies
      these complex cardiovascular phenotypes, several key genes and pathways have
      emerged. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by increased contractility 
      and a greater energetic cost of cardiac output. Dilated cardiomyopathy is often
      triggered by mutations that disrupt the giant protein titin. The energetic
      consequences of these mutations offer molecular targets and opportunities for new
      drug development and gene correction therapies.

AB  - Semaphorins were originally identified as neuronal guidance molecules mediating
      their attractive or repulsive signals by forming complexes with plexin and
      neuropilin receptors. Subsequent research has identified functions for semaphorin
      signaling in many organs and tissues outside of the nervous system. Vital roles
      for semaphorin signaling in vascular patterning and cardiac morphogenesis have
      been demonstrated, and impaired semaphorin signaling has been associated with
      various human cardiovascular disorders, including persistent truncus arteriosus, 
      sinus bradycardia and anomalous pulmonary venous connections. Here, we review the
      functions of semaphorins and their receptors in cardiovascular development and
      disease and highlight important recent discoveries in the field.

AB  - Metformin has been used for nearly a century and is now the most widely
      prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent worldwide. Yet how metformin acts remains
      only partially understood and controversial. One key reason may be that almost
      all previous studies were conducted with supra-pharmacological concentrations
      (doses) of metformin, 10-100 times higher than maximally achievable therapeutic
      concentrations found in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - White-to-beige conversion of adipocytes is one of the most promising approaches
      to therapeutically target obesity; however, the signals driving this process had 
      largely remained unclear. Recently, two publications, Brestoff et al. (2014) in
      Nature and Lee et al. (2015) in Cell, showed that group 2 innate lymphoid cells
      directly regulate adipocyte differentiation and drive the growth of beige fat.

AB  - How mitochondrial dynamism (fission and fusion) affects mitochondrial quality
      control is unclear. We uncovered distinct effects on mitophagy of inhibiting
      Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission versus mitofusin-mediated mitochondrial
      fusion. Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific Drp1 ablation evoked mitochondrial
      enlargement, lethal dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyocyte necrosis.
      Conditionally ablating cardiomyocyte mitofusins (Mfn) caused mitochondrial
      fragmentation with eccentric remodeling and no cardiomyocyte dropout. Parallel
      studies in cultured murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in vivo mouse hearts 
      revealed that Mfn1/Mfn2 deletion provoked accumulation of defective mitochondria 
      exhibiting an unfolded protein response, without appropriately increasing
      mitophagy. Conversely, interrupting mitochondrial fission by Drp1 ablation
      increased mitophagy and caused a generalized loss of mitochondria. Mitochondrial 
      permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening in Drp1 null mitochondria was
      associated with mitophagy in MEFs and contributed to cardiomyocyte necrosis and
      dilated cardiomyopathy in mice. Drp1, MPTP, and cardiomyocyte mitophagy are
      functionally integrated. Mitochondrial fission and fusion have opposing roles
      during in vivo cardiac mitochondrial quality control.

AB  - Using a functional approach to investigate the epigenetics of type 2 diabetes
      (T2D), we combine three lines of evidence-diet-induced epigenetic dysregulation
      in mouse, epigenetic conservation in humans, and T2D clinical risk evidence-to
      identify genes implicated in T2D pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms
      related to obesity. Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically
      homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. We
      then replicate these results in adipose samples from lean and obese patients pre-
      and post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, identifying regions where both the location
      and direction of methylation change are conserved. These regions overlap with 27 
      genetic T2D risk loci, only one of which was deemed significant by GWAS alone.
      Functional analysis of genes associated with these regions revealed four genes
      with roles in insulin resistance, demonstrating the potential general utility of 
      this approach for complementing conventional human genetic studies by integrating
      cross-species epigenomics and clinical genetic risk.

AB  - Defects in insulin secretion play a central role in the pathogenesis of type 2
      diabetes, yet the mechanisms driving beta-cell dysfunction remain poorly
      understood, and therapies to preserve glucose-dependent insulin release are
      inadequate. We report a luminescent insulin secretion assay that enables
      large-scale investigations of beta-cell function, created by inserting Gaussia
      luciferase into the C-peptide portion of proinsulin. Beta-cell lines expressing
      this construct cosecrete luciferase and insulin in close correlation, under both 
      standard conditions or when stressed by cytokines, fatty acids, or ER toxins. We 
      adapted the reporter for high-throughput assays and performed a 1,600-compound
      pilot screen, which identified several classes of drugs inhibiting secretion, as 
      well as glucose-potentiated secretagogues that were confirmed to have activity in
      primary human islets. Requiring 40-fold less time and expense than the
      traditional ELISA, this assay may accelerate the identification of pathways
      governing insulin secretion and compounds that safely augment beta-cell function 
      in diabetes.

AB  - Mitochondrial calcium is an important modulator of cellular metabolism. CCDC90A
      was reported to be a regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)
      complex, a selective channel that controls mitochondrial calcium uptake, and
      hence was renamed MCUR1. Here we show that suppression of CCDC90A in human
      fibroblasts produces a specific cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly defect,
      resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitochondrial
      calcium uptake capacity. Fibroblasts from patients with COX assembly defects due 
      to mutations in TACO1 or COX10 also showed reduced mitochondrial membrane
      potential and impaired calcium uptake capacity, both of which were rescued by
      expression of the respective wild-type cDNAs. Deletion of fmp32, a homolog of
      CCDC90A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism that lacks an MCU, also produces
      a COX deficiency, demonstrating that the function of CCDC90A is evolutionarily
      conserved. We conclude that CCDC90A plays a role in COX assembly and does not
      directly regulate MCU.

AB  - Mitochondria play essential roles in many aspects of biology, and their
      dysfunction has been linked to diverse diseases. Central to mitochondrial
      function is oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), accomplished by respiratory chain
      complexes (RCCs) encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. How RCC biogenesis
      is regulated in metazoans is poorly understood. Here we show that Parkinson's
      disease (PD)-associated genes PINK1 and Parkin direct localized translation of
      certain nuclear-encoded RCC (nRCC) mRNAs. Translationally repressed nRCC mRNAs
      are localized in a PINK1/Tom20-dependent manner to mitochondrial outer membrane, 
      where they are derepressed and activated by PINK1/Parkin through displacement of 
      translation repressors, including Pumilio and Glorund/hnRNP-F, a Parkin
      substrate, and enhanced binding of activators such as eIF4G. Inhibiting the
      translation repressors rescued nRCC mRNA translation and
      neuromuscular-degeneration phenotypes of PINK1 mutant, whereas inhibiting eIF4G
      had opposite effects. Our results reveal previously unknown functions of
      PINK1/Parkin in RNA metabolism and suggest new approaches to mitochondrial
      restoration and disease intervention.

AB  - We report that tumor cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show delayed tumor
      growth, and that tumor formation is associated with acquisition of mtDNA from
      host cells. This leads to partial recovery of mitochondrial function in cells
      derived from primary tumors grown from cells without mtDNA and a shorter lag in
      tumor growth. Cell lines from circulating tumor cells showed further recovery of 
      mitochondrial respiration and an intermediate lag to tumor growth, while cells
      from lung metastases exhibited full restoration of respiratory function and no
      lag in tumor growth. Stepwise assembly of mitochondrial respiratory
      (super)complexes was correlated with acquisition of respiratory function. Our
      findings indicate horizontal transfer of mtDNA from host cells in the tumor
      microenvironment to tumor cells with compromised respiratory function to
      re-establish respiration and tumor-initiating efficacy. These results suggest
      pathophysiological processes for overcoming mtDNA damage and support the notion
      of high plasticity of malignant cells.

AB  - Macrophages activated by the TLR4 agonist LPS undergo dramatic changes in their
      metabolic activity. We here show that LPS induces expression of the key metabolic
      regulator Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). Activation of PKM2 using two
      well-characterized small molecules, DASA-58 and TEPP-46, inhibited LPS-induced
      Hif-1alpha and IL-1beta, as well as the expression of a range of other
      Hif-1alpha-dependent genes. Activation of PKM2 attenuated an LPS-induced
      proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype while promoting traits typical of an M2
      macrophage. We show that LPS-induced PKM2 enters into a complex with Hif-1alpha, 
      which can directly bind to the IL-1beta promoter, an event that is inhibited by
      activation of PKM2. Both compounds inhibited LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming
      and succinate production. Finally, activation of PKM2 by TEPP-46 in vivo
      inhibited LPS and Salmonella typhimurium-induced IL-1beta production, while
      boosting production of IL-10. PKM2 is therefore a critical determinant of

AB  - Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is altered in metabolic disorders and cancer.
      Conventional FAS null mice die in utero, so effects of whole-body inhibition of
      lipogenesis following development are unknown. Inducible global knockout of FAS
      (iFASKO) in mice was lethal due to a disrupted intestinal barrier and leukopenia.
      Conditional loss of FAS was associated with the selective suppression of
      granulopoiesis without disrupting granulocytic differentiation. Transplantation
      of iFASKO bone marrow into wild-type mice followed by Cre induction resulted in
      selective neutrophil depletion, but not death. Impaired lipogenesis increased ER 
      stress and apoptosis in neutrophils by preferentially decreasing
      peroxisome-derived membrane phospholipids containing ether bonds. Inducible
      global knockout of PexRAP, a peroxisomal enzyme required for ether lipid
      synthesis, also produced neutropenia. FAS knockdown in neutrophil-like HL-60
      cells caused cell loss that was partially rescued by ether lipids. Inhibiting
      ether lipid synthesis selectively constrains neutrophil development, revealing an
      unrecognized pathway in immunometabolism.

AB  - Dietary potassium deficiency, common in modern diets, raises blood pressure and
      enhances salt sensitivity. Potassium homeostasis requires a molecular switch in
      the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), which fails in familial hyperkalemic
      hypertension (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2), activating the thiazide-sensitive 
      NaCl cotransporter, NCC. Here, we show that dietary potassium deficiency
      activates NCC, even in the setting of high salt intake, thereby causing sodium
      retention and a rise in blood pressure. The effect is dependent on plasma
      potassium, which modulates DCT cell membrane voltage and, in turn, intracellular 
      chloride. Low intracellular chloride stimulates WNK kinases to activate NCC,
      limiting potassium losses, even at the expense of increased blood pressure. These
      data show that DCT cells, like adrenal cells, sense potassium via membrane
      voltage. In the DCT, hyperpolarization activates NCC via WNK kinases, whereas in 
      the adrenal gland, it inhibits aldosterone secretion. These effects work in
      concert to maintain potassium homeostasis.

AB  - Increasing energy expenditure through activation of endogenous brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) is a potential approach to treat obesity and diabetes. The class of 
      beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists stimulates rodent BAT, but this activity 
      has never been demonstrated in humans. Here we determined the ability of 200 mg
      oral mirabegron (Myrbetriq, Astellas Pharma, Inc.), a beta3-AR agonist currently 
      approved to treat overactive bladder, to stimulate BAT as compared to placebo.
      Mirabegron led to higher BAT metabolic activity as measured via
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) using positron emission tomography (PET)
      combined with computed tomography (CT) in all twelve healthy male subjects (p =
      0.001), and it increased resting metabolic rate (RMR) by 203 +/- 40 kcal/day
      (+13%; p = 0.001). BAT metabolic activity was also a significant predictor of the
      changes in RMR (p = 0.006). Therefore, a beta3-AR agonist can stimulate human BAT
      thermogenesis and may be a promising treatment for metabolic disease.

AB  - Obesity and diabetes represent a significant healthcare concern. In contrast to
      genome-wide association studies that, some exceptions notwithstanding, have
      offered modest clues about pathomechanism, the dissection of rare disorders in
      which obesity represents a core feature have highlighted key molecules and
      structures critical to energy regulation. Here we focus on the primary cilium, an
      organelle whose roles in energy homeostasis have been underscored by the high
      incidence of obesity and type II diabetes in patients and mouse mutants with
      compromised ciliary function. We discuss recent evidence linking ciliary
      dysfunction to metabolic defects and we explore the contribution of neuronal and 
      nonneuronal cilia to these phenotypes.

AB  - Dietary effects on tumor biology can be exploited to unravel cancer
      vulnerabilities. Here, we present surprising evidence for anti-proliferative
      action of high-calorie-diet (HCD) feeding on KRAS-driven lung tumors. Tumors of
      mice that commenced HCD feeding before tumor onset displayed defective unfolded
      protein response (UPR) and unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
      Unresolved ER stress and reduced proliferation are reversed by chemical chaperone
      treatment. Whole-genome transcriptional analyses revealed FKBP10 as one of the
      most downregulated chaperones in tumors of the HCD-pre-tumor-onset group. FKBP10 
      downregulation dampens tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Providing translational
      value to these results, we report that FKBP10 is expressed in human KRAS-positive
      and -negative lung cancers, but not in healthy parenchyma. Collectively, our data
      shed light on an unexpected anti-tumor action of HCD imposed before tumor onset
      and identify FKBP10 as a putative therapeutic target to selectively hinder lung
      cancer.

AB  - A variety of leptin actions require a re-examination of classic concepts of
      metabolic diseases. Here we present evidence for two physiologic pathways: a
      pathway that protects nonadipose tissues from overaccumulation of potentially
      toxic lipids and unrecognized paracrine interactions between alpha and beta cells
      revealed by leptin's ability to suppress diabetic hyperglucagonemia. These
      observations strongly point to new therapeutic possibilities for both type 1 and 
      type 2 diabetes.
