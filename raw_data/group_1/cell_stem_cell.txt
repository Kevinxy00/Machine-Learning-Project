AB  - Aging is linked to functional deterioration and hematological diseases. The
      hematopoietic system is maintained by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and
      dysfunction within the HSC compartment is thought to be a key mechanism
      underlying age-related hematopoietic perturbations. Using single-cell
      transplantation assays with five blood-lineage analysis, we previously identified
      myeloid-restricted repopulating progenitors (MyRPs) within the phenotypic HSC
      compartment in young mice. Here, we determined the age-related functional changes
      to the HSC compartment using over 400 single-cell transplantation assays.
      Notably, MyRP frequency increased dramatically with age, while multipotent HSCs
      expanded modestly within the bone marrow. We also identified a subset of
      functional cells that were myeloid restricted in primary recipients but displayed
      multipotent (five blood-lineage) output in secondary recipients. We have termed
      this cell type latent-HSCs, which appear exclusive to the aged HSC compartment.
      These results question the traditional dogma of HSC aging and our current
      approaches to assay and define HSCs.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. Aging
      humans are thought to exhibit waning neurogenesis and exercise-induced
      angiogenesis, with a resulting volumetric decrease in the neurogenic hippocampal 
      dentate gyrus (DG) region, although concurrent changes in these parameters are
      not well studied. Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human
      individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of
      intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG,
      comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume
      across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and
      neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with 
      no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive
      impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved
      neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains
      human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked
      to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.

AB  - While gene expression dynamics have been extensively cataloged during
      hematopoietic differentiation in the adult, less is known about transcriptome
      diversity of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during development. To
      characterize transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in HSCs during
      development, we leveraged high-throughput genomic approaches to profile miRNAs,
      lincRNAs, and mRNAs. Our findings indicate that HSCs manifest distinct
      alternative splicing patterns in key hematopoietic regulators. Detailed analysis 
      of the splicing dynamics and function of one such regulator, HMGA2, identified an
      alternative isoform that escapes miRNA-mediated targeting. We further identified 
      the splicing kinase CLK3 that, by regulating HMGA2 splicing, preserves HMGA2
      function in the setting of an increase in let-7 miRNA levels, delineating how
      CLK3 and HMGA2 form a functional axis that influences HSC properties during
      development. Collectively, our study highlights molecular mechanisms by which
      alternative splicing and miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation impact
      the molecular identity and stage-specific developmental features of human HSCs.

AB  - Stem cell-specific transcriptional networks are well known to control
      pluripotency, but constitutive cellular processes such as mRNA splicing and
      protein synthesis can add complex layers of regulation with poorly understood
      effects on cell-fate decisions. Here, we show that the RNA binding protein
      HTATSF1 controls embryonic stem cell differentiation by regulating multiple
      aspects of RNA processing during ribosome biogenesis. HTATSF1, in a complex with 
      splicing factor SF3B1, controls intron removal from ribosomal protein transcripts
      and regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and processing, thereby controlling 60S
      ribosomal abundance and protein synthesis. HTATSF1-dependent protein synthesis is
      essential for naive pre-implantation epiblast to transition into
      post-implantation epiblast, a stage with transiently low protein synthesis, and
      further differentiation toward neuroectoderm. Together, these results identify
      coordinated regulation of ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis by HTATSF1 and show
      that this essential mechanism controls protein synthesis during early mammalian
      embryogenesis.

AB  - Despite its exciting potential, chemical induction of pluripotency (CIP)
      efficiency remains low and the mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the
      development of an efficient two-step serum- and replating-free CIP protocol and
      the associated chromatin accessibility dynamics (CAD) by assay for
      transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq. CIP reorganizes the somatic genome
      to an intermediate state that is resolved under 2iL condition by re-closing
      previously opened loci prior to pluripotency acquisition with gradual opening of 
      loci enriched with motifs for the OCT/SOX/KLF families. Bromodeoxyuridine, a
      critical ingredient of CIP, is responsible for both closing and opening critical 
      loci, at least in part by preventing the opening of loci enriched with motifs for
      the AP1 family and facilitating the opening of loci enriched with SOX/KLF/GATA
      motifs. These changes differ markedly from CAD observed during
      Yamanaka-factor-driven reprogramming. Our study provides insights into
      small-molecule-based reprogramming mechanisms and reorganization of nuclear
      architecture associated with cell-fate decisions.

AB  - Glioblastoma is the most lethal primary brain tumor; however, the crosstalk
      between glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and their supportive niche is not well
      understood. Here, we interrogated reciprocal signaling between GSCs and their
      differentiated glioblastoma cell (DGC) progeny. We found that DGCs accelerated
      GSC tumor growth. DGCs preferentially expressed brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF), whereas GSCs expressed the BDNF receptor NTRK2. Forced BDNF expression in
      DGCs augmented GSC tumor growth. To determine molecular mediators of BDNF-NTRK2
      paracrine signaling, we leveraged transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of
      matched GSCs and DGCs, revealing preferential VGF expression by GSCs, which
      patient-derived tumor models confirmed. VGF serves a dual role in the
      glioblastoma hierarchy by promoting GSC survival and stemness in vitro and in
      vivo while also supporting DGC survival and inducing DGC secretion of BDNF.
      Collectively, these data demonstrate that differentiated glioblastoma cells
      cooperate with stem-like tumor cells through BDNF-NTRK2-VGF paracrine signaling
      to promote tumor growth.

AB  - The liver, lung, pancreas, and digestive tract all originate from the endoderm
      germ layer, and these vital organs are subject to many life-threatening diseases 
      affecting millions of patients. However, primary cells from endodermal organs are
      often difficult to grow in vitro. Human pluripotent stem cells thus hold great
      promise for generating endoderm cells and their derivatives as tools for the
      development of new therapeutics against a variety of global healthcare
      challenges. Here we describe recent advances in methods for generating endodermal
      cell types from human pluripotent stem cells and their use for disease modeling
      and cell-based therapy.

      proteins associated with embryonic development. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, 
      Kooreman et al. (2018) demonstrate that vaccination of mice with syngeneic

      provides resistance to several different types of cancers.

AB  - The somatic DNA methylation (DNAme) landscape is established early in development
      but remains highly dynamic within focal regions that overlap with gene regulatory
      elements. The significance of these dynamic changes, particularly in the central 
      nervous system, remains unresolved. Here, we utilize a powerful human embryonic
      stem cell differentiation model for the generation of motor neurons (MNs) in
      combination with genetic mutations in the de novo DNAme machinery. We
      quantitatively dissect the role of DNAme in directing somatic cell fate with
      high-resolution genome-wide bisulfite-, bulk-, and single-cell-RNA sequencing. We
      find defects in neuralization and MN differentiation in DNMT3A knockouts (KO)
      that can be rescued by the targeting of DNAme to key developmental loci using
      catalytically inactive dCas9. We also find decreased dendritic arborization and
      altered electrophysiological properties in DNMT3A KO MNs. Our work provides a
      list of DNMT3A-regulated targets and a mechanistic link between de novo DNAme,
      cellular differentiation, and human MN function.

AB  - Cancer cells and embryonic tissues share a number of cellular and molecular
      properties, suggesting that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be
      harnessed to elicit anti-tumor responses in cancer vaccines. RNA sequencing
      revealed that human and murine iPSCs express tumor-associated antigens, and we
      show here a proof of principle for using irradiated iPSCs in autologous
      anti-tumor vaccines. In a prophylactic setting, iPSC vaccines prevent tumor
      growth in syngeneic murine breast cancer, mesothelioma, and melanoma models. As
      an adjuvant, the iPSC vaccine inhibited melanoma recurrence at the resection site
      and reduced metastatic tumor load, which was associated with fewer Th17 cells and
      increased CD11b(+)GR1(hi) myeloid cells. Adoptive transfer of T cells isolated
      from vaccine-treated tumor-bearing mice inhibited tumor growth in unvaccinated
      recipients, indicating that the iPSC vaccine promotes an antigen-specific
      anti-tumor T cell response. Our data suggest an easy, generalizable strategy for 
      multiple types of cancer that could prove highly valuable in clinical
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Cardiac development requires coordinated and large-scale rearrangements of the
      epigenome. The roles and precise mechanisms through which specific epigenetic
      modifying enzymes control cardiac lineage specification, however, remain unclear.
      Here we show that the H3K4 methyltransferase SETD7 controls cardiac
      differentiation by reading H3K36 marks independently of its enzymatic activity.
      Through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that SETD7 
      targets distinct sets of genes to drive their stage-specific expression during
      cardiomyocyte differentiation. SETD7 associates with different co-factors at
      these stages, including SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling factors during mesodermal
      formation and the transcription factor NKX2.5 in cardiac progenitors to drive
      their differentiation. Further analyses revealed that SETD7 binds methylated
      H3K36 in the bodies of its target genes to facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol
      II)-dependent transcription. Moreover, abnormal SETD7 expression impairs
      functional attributes of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. Together,
      these results reveal how SETD7 acts at sequential steps in cardiac lineage
      commitment, and they provide insights into crosstalk between dynamic epigenetic
      marks and chromatin-modifying enzymes.

TI  - Vangl2/RhoA Signaling Pathway Regulates Stem Cell Self-Renewal Programs and

AB  - Tumor growth and relapse are driven by tumor propagating cells (TPCs). However,
      mechanisms regulating TPC fate choices, maintenance, and self-renewal are not
      fully understood. Here, we show that Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core regulator
      of the non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway, affects TPC
      self-renewal in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)-a pediatric cancer of muscle. VANGL2 is
      expressed in a majority of human RMS and within early mononuclear progenitor
      cells. VANGL2 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, reduced TPC numbers, and
      induced differentiation of human RMS in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Using a
      zebrafish model of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), we determined that Vangl2
      expression enriches for TPCs and promotes their self-renewal. Expression of
      constitutively active and dominant-negative isoforms of RHOA revealed that it
      acts downstream of VANGL2 to regulate proliferation and maintenance of TPCs in
      human RMS. Our studies offer insights into pathways that control TPCs and
      identify new potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - A permissive chromatin environment coupled to hypertranscription drives the rapid
      proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and peri-implantation embryos. We
      carried out a genome-wide screen to systematically dissect the regulation of the 
      euchromatic state of ESCs. The results revealed that cellular growth pathways,
      most prominently translation, perpetuate the euchromatic state and
      hypertranscription of ESCs. Acute inhibition of translation rapidly depletes
      euchromatic marks in mouse ESCs and blastocysts, concurrent with delocalization
      of RNA polymerase II and reduction in nascent transcription. Translation
      inhibition promotes rewiring of chromatin accessibility, which decreases at a
      subset of active developmental enhancers and increases at histone genes and
      transposable elements. Proteome-scale analyses revealed that several euchromatin 
      regulators are unstable proteins and continuously depend on a high translational 
      output. We propose that this mechanistic interdependence of euchromatin,
      transcription, and translation sets the pace of proliferation at
      peri-implantation and may be employed by other stem/progenitor cells.

AB  - Although the clinical demand for bioengineered blood vessels continues to rise,
      current options for vascular conduits remain limited. The synergistic combination
      of emerging advances in tissue fabrication and stem cell engineering promises new
      strategies for engineering autologous blood vessels that recapitulate not only
      the mechanical properties of native vessels but also their biological function.
      Here we explore recent bioengineering advances in creating functional blood macro
      and microvessels, particularly featuring stem cells as a seed source. We also
      highlight progress in integrating engineered vascular tissues with the host after
      implantation as well as the exciting pre-clinical and clinical applications of
      this technology.

AB  - Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) are miniature tissues and organs grown in vitro that
      enable modeling of human physiology and disease. The technology has emerged from 
      converging advances in tissue engineering, semiconductor fabrication, and human
      cell sourcing. Encompassing innovations in human stem cell technology, OOCs offer
      a promising approach to emulate human patho/physiology in vitro, and address
      limitations of current cell and animal models. Here, we review the design
      considerations for single and multi-organ OOCs, discuss remaining challenges, and
      highlight the potential impact of OOCs as a fast-track opportunity for tissue
      engineering to advance drug development and precision medicine.

AB  - Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation can influence immune responses and
      suppress inflammation in the CNS. Metabolites, such as succinate, modulate the
      phenotype and function of immune cells, but whether and how NSCs are also
      activated by such immunometabolites to control immunoreactivity and inflammatory 
      responses is unclear. Here, we show that transplanted somatic and directly
      induced NSCs ameliorate chronic CNS inflammation by reducing succinate levels in 
      the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby decreasing mononuclear phagocyte (MP)
      infiltration and secondary CNS damage. Inflammatory MPs release succinate, which 
      activates succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1)/GPR91 on NSCs, leading them to secrete
      prostaglandin E2 and scavenge extracellular succinate with consequential
      anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, our work reveals an unexpected role for the
      succinate-SUCNR1 axis in somatic and directly induced NSCs, which controls the
      response of stem cells to inflammatory metabolic signals released by type 1 MPs
      in the chronically inflamed brain.

AB  - A crucial player in immune regulation, FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are
      drawing attention for their heterogeneity and noncanonical functions. Here, we
      describe a Treg subpopulation that controls hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      quiescence and engraftment. These Tregs highly expressed an HSC marker, CD150,
      and localized within the HSC niche in the bone marrow (BM). Specific reduction of
      BM Tregs achieved by conditional deletion of CXCR4 in Tregs increased HSC numbers
      in the BM. Adenosine generated via the CD39 cell surface ectoenzyme on niche
      Tregs protected HSCs from oxidative stress and maintained HSC quiescence. In
      transplantation settings, niche Tregs prevented allogeneic (allo-) HSC rejection 
      through adenosine and facilitated allo-HSC engraftment. Furthermore, transfer of 
      niche Tregs promoted allo-HSC engraftment to a much greater extent than transfer 
      of other Tregs. These results identify a unique niche-associated Treg subset and 
      adenosine as regulators of HSC quiescence, abundance, and engraftment, further
      highlighting their therapeutic utility.

AB  - Stem cells and tissue-derived stromal cells stimulate the repair of degenerated
      and injured tissues, motivating a growing number of cell-based interventions in
      the musculoskeletal field. Recent investigations have indicated that these cells 
      are critical for their trophic and immunomodulatory role in controlling
      endogenous cells. This Review presents recent clinical advances where stem cells 
      and stromal cells have been used to stimulate musculoskeletal tissue repair,
      including delivery strategies to improve cell viability and retention. Emerging
      bioengineering strategies are highlighted, particularly toward the development of
      biomaterials for capturing aspects of the native tissue environment, altering the
      healing niche, and recruiting endogenous cells.

AB  - The generation of new blood vessels via angiogenesis is critical for meeting
      tissue oxygen demands. A role for adult stem cells in this process remains
      unclear. Here, we identified CD157 (bst1, bone marrow stromal antigen 1) as a
      marker of tissue-resident vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) in large
      arteries and veins of numerous mouse organs. Single CD157(+) VESCs form colonies 
      in vitro and generate donor-derived portal vein, sinusoids, and central vein
      endothelial cells upon transplantation in the liver. In response to injury, VESCs
      expand and regenerate entire vasculature structures, supporting the existence of 
      an endothelial hierarchy within blood vessels. Genetic lineage tracing revealed
      that VESCs maintain large vessels and sinusoids in the normal liver for more than
      a year, and transplantation of VESCs rescued bleeding phenotypes in a mouse model
      of hemophilia. Our findings show that tissue-resident VESCs display self-renewal 
      capacity and that vascular regeneration potential exists in peripheral blood
      vessels.

AB  - Tissue regeneration relies on resident stem cells (SCs), whose activity and
      lineage choices are influenced by the microenvironment. Exploiting the
      synchronized, cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration in hair follicles (HFs), we
      investigate how microenvironment dynamics shape the emergence of stem cell
      lineages. Employing epigenetic and ChIP-seq profiling, we uncover how
      signal-dependent transcription factors couple spatiotemporal cues to chromatin
      dynamics, thereby choreographing stem cell lineages. Using enhancer-driven
      reporters, mutagenesis, and genetics, we show that simultaneous BMP-inhibitory
      and WNT signals set the stage for lineage choices by establishing chromatin
      platforms permissive for diversification. Mechanistically, when binding of BMP
      effector pSMAD1 is relieved, enhancers driving HF-stem cell master regulators are
      silenced. Concomitantly, multipotent, lineage-fated enhancers silent in HF-stem
      cells become activated by exchanging WNT effectors TCF3/4 for LEF1. Throughout
      regeneration, lineage enhancers continue reliance upon LEF1 but then achieve
      specificity by accommodating additional incoming signaling effectors. Barriers to
      progenitor plasticity increase when diverse, signal-sensitive transcription
      factors shape LEF1-regulated enhancer dynamics.

AB  - Despite recent efforts to dissect the inter-tumor heterogeneity of pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by determining prognosis-predictive gene expression 
      signatures for specific subtypes, their functional differences remain elusive.
      Here, we established a pancreatic tumor organoid library encompassing 39
      patient-derived PDACs and identified 3 functional subtypes based on their stem
      cell niche factor dependencies on Wnt and R-spondin. A Wnt-non-producing subtype 
      required Wnt from cancer-associated fibroblasts, whereas a Wnt-producing subtype 
      autonomously secreted Wnt ligands and an R-spondin-independent subtype grew in
      the absence of Wnt and R-spondin. Transcriptome analysis of PDAC organoids
      revealed gene-expression signatures that associated Wnt niche subtypes with
      GATA6-dependent gene expression subtypes, which were functionally supported by
      genetic perturbation of GATA6. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing of
      PDAC driver genes (KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and TP53) demonstrated non-genetic
      acquisition of Wnt niche independence during pancreas tumorigenesis.
      Collectively, our results reveal functional heterogeneity of Wnt niche
      independency in PDAC that is non-genetically formed through tumor progression.

AB  - Despite much work studying ex vivo multipotent stromal cells (MSCs), the identity
      and characteristics of MSCs in vivo are not well defined. Here, we generated a
      CD73-EGFP reporter mouse to address these questions and found EGFP(+) MSCs in
      various organs. In vivo, EGFP(+) mesenchymal cells were observed in fetal and
      adult bones at proliferative ossification sites, while in solid organs EGFP(+)
      cells exhibited a perivascular distribution pattern. EGFP(+) cells from the bone 
      compartment could be clonally expanded ex vivo from single cells and displayed
      trilineage differentiation potential. Moreover, in the central bone marrow
      CD73-EGFP(+) specifically labeled sinusoidal endothelial cells, thought to be a
      critical component of the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Purification and
      molecular characterization of this CD73-EGFP(+) population revealed an
      endothelial subtype that also displays a mesenchymal signature, highlighting
      endothelial cell heterogeneity in the marrow. Thus, the CD73-EGFP mouse is a
      powerful tool for studying MSCs and sinusoidal endothelium.

AB  - Neural stem cells in the ventricular-subventricular zone of the adult brain
      continuously generate differentiated neurons without depleting the stem cell
      pool. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Obernier et al. (2018) present the
      surprising finding that this occurs through mostly symmetric divisions that
      either generate two differentiating or two self-renewing daughter cells.

AB  - Somatic stem cells have been identified in multiple adult tissues. Whether
      self-renewal occurs symmetrically or asymmetrically is key to understanding
      long-term stem cell maintenance and generation of progeny for cell replacement.
      In the adult mouse brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) (B1 cells) are retained in the
      walls of the lateral ventricles (ventricular-subventricular zone [V-SVZ]). The
      mechanism of B1 cell retention into adulthood for lifelong neurogenesis is
      unknown. Using multiple clonal labeling techniques, we show that the vast
      majority of B1 cells divide symmetrically. Whereas 20%-30% symmetrically
      self-renew and can remain in the niche for several months before generating
      neurons, 70%-80% undergo consuming divisions generating progeny, resulting in the
      depletion of B1 cells over time. This cellular mechanism decouples self-renewal
      from the generation of progeny. Limited rounds of symmetric self-renewal and
      consuming symmetric differentiation divisions can explain the levels of
      neurogenesis observed throughout life.

      and Tumorigenesis.

AB  - Adequate availability of cellular building blocks, including lipids, is a
      prerequisite for cellular proliferation, but excess dietary lipids are linked to 
      increased cancer risk. Despite these connections, specific regulatory
      relationships between membrane composition, intestinal stem cell (ISC)
      proliferation, and tumorigenesis are unclear. We reveal an unexpected link
      between membrane phospholipid remodeling and cholesterol biosynthesis and
      demonstrate that cholesterol itself acts as a mitogen for ISCs. Inhibition of the
      phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 increases membrane saturation and
      stimulates cholesterol biosynthesis, thereby driving ISC proliferation.
      Pharmacologic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis normalizes crypt
      hyperproliferation in Lpcat3-deficient organoids and mice. Conversely, increasing
      cellular cholesterol content stimulates crypt organoid growth, and providing
      excess dietary cholesterol or driving endogenous cholesterol synthesis through
      SREBP-2 expression promotes ISC proliferation in vivo. Finally, disruption of
      Lpcat3-dependent phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis dramatically enhances
      tumor formation in Apc(min) mice. These findings identify a critical
      dietary-responsive phospholipid-cholesterol axis regulating ISC proliferation and
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - Inhibition of Methyltransferase Setd7 Allows the In Vitro Expansion of Myogenic
      Stem Cells with Improved Therapeutic Potential.

AB  - The development of cell therapy for repairing damaged or diseased skeletal muscle
      has been hindered by the inability to significantly expand immature,
      transplantable myogenic stem cells (MuSCs) in culture. To overcome this
      limitation, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating the transition
      between activated, proliferating MuSCs and differentiation-primed, poorly
      engrafting progenitors is needed. Here, we show that methyltransferase Setd7
      facilitates such transition by regulating the nuclear accumulation of
      beta-catenin in proliferating MuSCs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of
      Setd7 promotes in vitro expansion of MuSCs and increases the yield of primary
      myogenic cell cultures. Upon transplantation, both mouse and human MuSCs expanded
      with a Setd7 small-molecule inhibitor are better able to repopulate the satellite
      cell niche, and treated mouse MuSCs show enhanced therapeutic potential in
      preclinical models of muscular dystrophy. Thus, Setd7 inhibition may help bypass 
      a key obstacle in the translation of cell therapy for muscle disease.

AB  - Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) broadly describes the expansion of a clonal population 
      of blood cells with one or more somatic mutations. Individuals with CH are at
      greater risk for hematological malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and
      increased mortality from non-hematological cancers. Understanding the causes of
      CH and how these mutant cells interact with cells of other tissues will provide
      critical insights into preleukemic development, stem cell biology, host-immune
      interactions, and cancer evolution. Here we discuss the clinical manifestations
      of CH, mechanisms contributing to its development, the role of CH in clonal
      evolution toward leukemia, and the contribution of CH to non-hematological
      disease states.

AB  - In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Wang et al. (2018) identify a novel link between
      Lpcat3-mediated phospholipid remodeling (the Lands cycle) and cholesterol
      biosynthesis that modulates intestinal stem cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
      Notably, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis dampens many of the
      Lpcat3-deficiency-mediated effects in the intestine.

TI  - CRISPR-Based Chromatin Remodeling of the Endogenous Oct4 or Sox2 Locus Enables
      Reprogramming to Pluripotency.

AB  - Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells typically requires the ectopic
      expression of transcription factors to reactivate the pluripotency network.
      However, it remains largely unclear what remodeling events on endogenous
      chromatin trigger reprogramming toward induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
      Toward this end, we employed CRISPR activation to precisely target and remodel
      endogenous gene loci of Oct4 and Sox2. Interestingly, we found that single-locus 
      targeting of Sox2 was sufficient to remodel and activate Sox2, which was followed
      by the induction of other pluripotent genes and establishment of the pluripotency
      network. Simultaneous remodeling of the Oct4 promoter and enhancer also triggered
      reprogramming. Authentic pluripotent cell lines were established in both cases.
      Finally, we showed that targeted manipulation of histone acetylation at the Oct4 
      gene locus could also initiate reprogramming. Our study generated authentic iPSCs
      with CRISPR activation through precise epigenetic remodeling of endogenous loci
      and shed light on how targeted chromatin remodeling triggers pluripotency
      induction.

AB  - Polycomb group proteins regulate self-renewal and differentiation in many stem
      cell systems. When assembled into two canonical complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, they
      sequentially deposit H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub histone marks and establish
      repressive chromatin, referred to as Polycomb domains. Non-canonical PRC1
      complexes retain RING1/RNF2 E3-ubiquitin ligases but have unique sets of
      accessory subunits. How these non-canonical complexes recognize and regulate
      their gene targets remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the BCL6
      co-repressor (BCOR), a member of the PRC1.1 complex, is critical for maintaining 
      primed pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). BCOR depletion leads to
      the erosion of Polycomb domains at key developmental loci and the initiation of
      differentiation along endoderm and mesoderm lineages. The C terminus of BCOR
      regulates the assembly and targeting of the PRC1.1 complex, while the N terminus 
      contributes to BCOR-PRC1.1 repressor function. Our findings advance understanding
      of Polycomb targeting and repression in ESCs and could apply broadly across
      developmental systems.

AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent internal modification in
      eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), plays critical roles in many bioprocesses.
      However, its functions in normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain elusive.
      Here, we report that METTL14, a key component of the m(6)A methyltransferase
      complex, is highly expressed in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
      (HSPCs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells carrying t(11q23), t(15;17), or
      t(8;21) and is downregulated during myeloid differentiation. Silencing of METTL14
      promotes terminal myeloid differentiation of normal HSPCs and AML cells and
      inhibits AML cell survival/proliferation. METTL14 is required for development and
      maintenance of AML and self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiation cells
      (LSCs/LICs). Mechanistically, METTL14 exerts its oncogenic role by regulating its
      mRNA targets (e.g., MYB and MYC) through m(6)A modification, while the protein
      itself is negatively regulated by SPI1. Collectively, our results reveal the
      SPI1-METTL14-MYB/MYC signaling axis in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis and
      highlight the critical roles of METTL14 and m(6)A modification in normal and
      malignant hematopoiesis.

AB  - Genetic lineage tracing has revealed that Lgr5(+) murine colon stem cells (CoSCs)
      rapidly proliferate at the crypt bottom. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
      human CoSCs in vivo have remained experimentally intractable. Here we established
      an orthotopic xenograft system for normal human colon organoids, enabling stable 
      reconstruction of the human colon epithelium in vivo. Xenografted organoids were 
      prone to displacement by the remaining murine crypts, and this could be overcome 
      by complete removal of the mouse epithelium. Xenografted organoids formed crypt
      structures distinctively different from surrounding mouse crypts, reflecting
      their human origin. Lineage tracing using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer an LGR5-CreER
      knockin allele demonstrated self-renewal and multipotency of LGR5(+) CoSCs. In
      contrast to the rapidly cycling properties of mouse Lgr5(+) CoSCs, human LGR5(+) 
      CoSCs were slow-cycling in vivo. This organoid-based orthotopic xenograft model
      enables investigation of the functional behaviors of human CoSCs in vivo, with
      potential therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Successful strategies for treating type 1 diabetes need to restore the function
      of pancreatic beta cells that are destroyed by the immune system and overcome
      further destruction of insulin-producing cells. Here, we infused adeno-associated
      virus carrying Pdx1 and MafA expression cassettes through the pancreatic duct to 
      reprogram alpha cells into functional beta cells and normalized blood glucose in 
      both beta cell-toxin-induced diabetic mice and in autoimmune non-obese diabetic
      (NOD) mice. The euglycemia in toxin-induced diabetic mice and new insulin(+)
      cells persisted in the autoimmune NOD mice for 4 months prior to reestablishment 
      of autoimmune diabetes. This gene therapy strategy also induced alpha to beta
      cell conversion in toxin-treated human islets, which restored blood glucose
      levels in NOD/SCID mice upon transplantation. Hence, this strategy could
      represent a new therapeutic approach, perhaps complemented by immunosuppression, 
      to bolster endogenous insulin production. Our study thus provides a potential
      basis for further investigation in human type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Minority subpopulations within embryonic stem cell cultures display an expanded
      developmental potential similar to that of early embryo blastomeres or the early 
      inner cell mass. The ability to isolate and culture totipotent cells capable of
      giving rise to the entire conceptus would enhance our capacity to study early
      embryo development, and might enable more efficient generation of chimeric
      animals for research and organ production for transplantation. Here we review the
      biological and molecular characterization of cultured cells with developmental
      potential similar to totipotent blastomeres, and assess recent progress toward
      the capture and stabilization of the totipotent state in vitro.

      Loss in AML.

AB  - Bone marrow vascular niches sustain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and are
      drastically remodeled in leukemia to support pathological functions. Acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) cells produce angiogenic factors, which likely contribute 
      to this remodeling, but anti-angiogenic therapies do not improve AML patient
      outcomes. Using intravital microscopy, we found that AML progression leads to
      differential remodeling of vasculature in central and endosteal bone marrow
      regions. Endosteal AML cells produce pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic
      cytokines and gradually degrade endosteal endothelium, stromal cells, and
      osteoblastic cells, whereas central marrow remains vascularized and splenic
      vascular niches expand. Remodeled endosteal regions have reduced capacity to
      support non-leukemic HSCs, correlating with loss of normal hematopoiesis.
      Preserving endosteal endothelium with the small molecule deferoxamine or a
      genetic approach rescues HSCs loss, promotes chemotherapeutic efficacy, and
      enhances survival. These findings suggest that preventing degradation of the
      endosteal vasculature may improve current paradigms for treating AML.

AB  - Radial glia (RG) are embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce neuroblasts 
      and provide fibers that act as a scaffold for neuroblast migration during
      embryonic development. Although they normally disappear soon after birth, here we
      found that RG fibers can persist in injured neonatal mouse brains and act as a
      scaffold for postnatal ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)-derived
      neuroblasts that migrate to the lesion site. This injury-induced maintenance of
      RG fibers has a limited time window during post-natal development and promotes
      directional saltatory movement of neuroblasts via N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell
      contacts that promote RhoA activation. Transplanting an N-cadherin-containing
      scaffold into injured neonatal brains likewise promotes migration and maturation 
      of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts, leading to functional improvements in impaired gait
      behaviors. Together these results suggest that RG fibers enable postnatal
      V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts to migrate toward sites of injury, thereby enhancing
      neuronal regeneration and functional recovery from neonatal brain injuries.

AB  - Direct cardiac reprogramming holds great promise for regenerative medicine. We
      previously generated directly reprogrammed induced cardiomyocyte-like cells
      (iCMs) by overexpression of Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) using retrovirus
      vectors. However, integrating vectors pose risks associated with insertional
      mutagenesis and disruption of gene expression and are inefficient. Here, we show 
      that Sendai virus (SeV) vectors expressing cardiac reprogramming factors
      efficiently and rapidly reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts into
      integration-free iCMs via robust transgene expression. SeV-GMT generated 100-fold
      more beating iCMs than retroviral-GMT and shortened the duration to induce
      beating cells from 30 to 10 days in mouse fibroblasts. In vivo lineage tracing
      revealed that the gene transfer of SeV-GMT was more efficient than retroviral-GMT
      in reprogramming resident cardiac fibroblasts into iCMs in mouse infarct hearts. 
      Moreover, SeV-GMT improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis after myocardial

AB  - Tissue regeneration requires dynamic cellular adaptation to the wound
      environment. It is currently unclear how this is orchestrated at the cellular
      level and how cell fate is affected by severe tissue damage. Here we dissect cell
      fate transitions during colonic regeneration in a mouse dextran sulfate sodium
      (DSS) colitis model, and we demonstrate that the epithelium is transiently
      reprogrammed into a primitive state. This is characterized by de novo expression 
      of fetal markers as well as suppression of markers for adult stem and
      differentiated cells. The fate change is orchestrated by remodeling the
      extracellular matrix (ECM), increased FAK/Src signaling, and ultimately YAP/TAZ
      activation. In a defined cell culture system recapitulating the extracellular
      matrix remodeling observed in vivo, we show that a collagen 3D matrix
      supplemented with Wnt ligands is sufficient to sustain endogenous YAP/TAZ and
      induce conversion of cell fate. This provides a simple model for tissue
      regeneration, implicating cellular reprogramming as an essential element.

AB  - Trophoblast cells play an essential role in the interactions between the fetus
      and mother. Mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cells have been derived and used as the
      best in vitro model for molecular and functional analysis of mouse trophoblast
      lineages, but attempts to derive human TS cells have so far been unsuccessful.
      Here we show that activation of Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and EGF and inhibition 
      of TGF-beta, histone deacetylase (HDAC), and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)
      enable long-term culture of human villous cytotrophoblast (CT) cells. The
      resulting cell lines have the capacity to give rise to the three major
      trophoblast lineages, which show transcriptomes similar to those of the
      corresponding primary trophoblast cells. Importantly, equivalent cell lines can
      be derived from human blastocysts. Our data strongly suggest that the CT- and
      blastocyst-derived cell lines are human TS cells, which will provide a powerful
      tool to study human trophoblast development and function.

      and Homeostatic Aging.

AB  - The clonal complexity of adult stem cell pools is progressively lost during
      homeostatic turnover in several tissues, suggesting a decrease in the number of
      stem cells with distinct clonal origins. The functional impact of reduced
      complexity on stem cell pools, and how different tissue microenvironments may
      contribute to such a reduction, are poorly understood. Here, we performed clonal 
      multicolor lineage tracing of skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to address these
      questions. We found that MuSC clonal complexity is maintained during aging
      despite heterogenous reductions in proliferative capacity, allowing aged muscle
      to mount a clonally diverse, albeit diminished, response to injury. In contrast, 
      repeated bouts of tissue repair cause a progressive reduction in MuSC clonal
      complexity indicative of neutral drift. Consistently, biostatistical modeling
      suggests that MuSCs undergo symmetric expansions with stochastic fate acquisition
      during tissue repair. These findings establish distinct principles that underlie 
      stem cell dynamics during homeostatic aging and muscle regeneration.

AB  - Tumor hypoxia is associated with poor patient survival and is a characteristic of
      glioblastoma. Notch signaling is implicated in maintaining glioma stem-like cells
      (GSCs) within the hypoxic niche, although the molecular mechanisms linking
      hypoxia to Notch activation have not been clearly delineated. Here we show that
      Vasorin is a critical link between hypoxia and Notch signaling in GSCs. Vasorin
      is preferentially induced in GSCs by a HIF1alpha/STAT3 co-activator complex and
      stabilizes Notch1 protein at the cell membrane. This interaction prevents Numb
      from binding Notch1, rescuing it from Numb-mediated lysosomal degradation. Thus, 
      Vasorin acts as a switch to augment Notch signaling under hypoxic conditions.
      Vasorin promotes tumor growth and reduces survival in mouse models of
      glioblastoma, and its expression correlates with increased aggression of human
      gliomas. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how hypoxia promotes
      Notch signaling in glioma and identify Vasorin as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - Somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induces
      changes in genome architecture reflective of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state.
      However, only a small minority of cells typically transition to pluripotency,
      which has limited our understanding of the process. Here, we characterize the DNA
      regulatory landscape during reprogramming by time-course profiling of isolated
      sub-populations of intermediates poised to become iPSCs. Widespread
      reconfiguration of chromatin states and transcription factor (TF) occupancy
      occurs early during reprogramming, and cells that fail to reprogram partially
      retain their original chromatin states. A second wave of reconfiguration occurs
      just prior to pluripotency acquisition, where a majority of early changes revert 
      to the somatic cell state and many of the changes that define the pluripotent
      state become established. Our comprehensive characterization of
      reprogramming-associated molecular changes broadens our understanding of this
      process and sheds light on how TFs access and change the chromatin during
      cell-fate transitions.

AB  - Cell-fate decisions remain poorly understood at the chromatin level. Here, we map
      chromatin remodeling dynamics during induction of pluripotent stem cells.
      ATAC-seq profiling of MEFs expressing Oct4-Sox2-Klf4 (OSK) reveals dynamic
      changes in chromatin states shifting from open to closed (OC) and closed to open 
      (CO), with an initial burst of OC and an ending surge of CO. The OC loci are
      largely composed of genes associated with a somatic fate, while the CO loci are
      associated with pluripotency. Factors/conditions known to impede reprogramming
      prevent OSK-driven OC and skew OC-CO dynamics. While the CO loci are enriched for
      OSK motifs, the OC loci are not, suggesting alternative mechanisms for chromatin 
      closing. Sap30, a Sin3A corepressor complex component, is required for the OC
      shift and facilitates reduced H3K27ac deposition at OC loci. These results reveal
      a chromatin accessibility logic during reprogramming that may apply to other
      cell-fate decisions.

      Maintenance.

AB  - The balance between self-renewal and differentiation ensures long-term
      maintenance of stem cell (SC) pools in regenerating epithelial tissues. This
      balance is challenged during periods of high regenerative pressure and is often
      compromised in aged animals. Here, we show that target of rapamycin (TOR)
      signaling is a key regulator of SC loss during repeated regenerative episodes. In
      response to regenerative stimuli, SCs in the intestinal epithelium of the fly and
      in the tracheal epithelium of mice exhibit transient activation of TOR signaling.
      Although this activation is required for SCs to rapidly proliferate in response
      to damage, repeated rounds of damage lead to SC loss. Consistently, age-related
      SC loss in the mouse trachea and in muscle can be prevented by pharmacologic or
      genetic inhibition, respectively, of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
      (mTORC1) signaling. These findings highlight an evolutionarily conserved role of 
      TOR signaling in SC function and identify repeated rounds of mTORC1 activation as
      a driver of age-related SC decline.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce most cellular energy through glycolysis
      rather than through mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this notion,
      mitochondrial mass has been reported to be low in HSCs. However, we found that
      staining with MitoTracker Green, a commonly used dye to measure mitochondrial
      content, leads to artefactually low fluorescence specifically in HSCs because of 
      dye efflux. Using mtDNA quantification, enumeration of mitochondrial nucleoids,
      and fluorescence intensity of a genetically encoded mitochondrial reporter, we
      unequivocally show here that HSCs and multipotential progenitors (MPPs) have
      higher mitochondrial mass than lineage-committed progenitors and mature cells.
      Despite similar mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity of MPPs exceeds that of 
      HSCs. Furthermore, although elevated mitophagy has been invoked to explain low
      mitochondrial mass in HSCs, we observed that mitochondrial turnover capacity is
      comparatively low in HSCs. We propose that the role of mitochondria in HSC
      biology may have to be revisited in light of these findings.

AB  - Myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells (MB-HSCs) play critical roles in recovery
      from injury, but little is known about how they are regulated within the bone
      marrow niche. Here we describe an auto-/paracrine physiologic circuit that
      controls quiescence of MB-HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors marked by histidine 
      decarboxylase (Hdc). Committed Hdc(+) myeloid cells lie in close anatomical
      proximity to MB-HSCs and produce histamine, which activates the H2 receptor on
      MB-HSCs to promote their quiescence and self-renewal. Depleting
      histamine-producing cells enforces cell cycle entry, induces loss of serial
      transplant capacity, and sensitizes animals to chemotherapeutic injury.
      Increasing demand for myeloid cells via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment
      specifically recruits MB-HSCs and progenitors into the cell cycle; cycling
      MB-HSCs fail to revert into quiescence in the absence of histamine feedback,
      leading to their depletion, while an H2 agonist protects MB-HSCs from depletion
      after sepsis. Thus, histamine couples lineage-specific physiological demands to
      intrinsically primed MB-HSCs to enforce homeostasis.

AB  - Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are mediated by programs of adult stem cell
      renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanisms that regulate stem cell
      fates under such widely varying conditions are not fully understood. Using
      single-cell techniques, we assessed the transcriptional changes associated with
      stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and followed the maturation of stem
      cell-derived clones using sparse lineage tracing in the regenerating mouse
      olfactory epithelium. Following injury, quiescent olfactory stem cells rapidly
      shift to activated, transient states unique to regeneration and tailored to meet 
      the demands of injury-induced repair, including barrier formation and
      proliferation. Multiple cell fates, including renewed stem cells and committed
      differentiating progenitors, are specified during this early window of
      activation. We further show that Sox2 is essential for cells to transition from
      the activated to neuronal progenitor states. Our study highlights strategies for 
      stem cell-mediated regeneration that may be conserved in other adult stem cell
      niches.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium is often depicted as a
      unidirectional pathway during homeostasis and repair. We challenge the
      unidirectionality of this model by showing that epithelial injury unlocks the
      potential for Ascl1+ progenitors and Neurog1+ specified neuronal precursors to
      dedifferentiate into multipotent stem/progenitor cells that contribute
      significantly to tissue regeneration in the murine olfactory epithelium (OE). We 
      characterize these dedifferentiating cells using several lineage-tracing strains 
      and single-cell mRNA-seq, and we show that Sox2 is required for initiating
      dedifferentiation and that inhibition of Ezh2 promotes multipotent progenitor
      expansion. These results suggest that the apparent hierarchy of neuronal
      differentiation is not irreversible and that lineage commitment can be overridden
      following severe tissue injury. We elucidate a previously unappreciated pathway
      for endogenous tissue repair by a highly regenerative neuroepithelium and
      introduce a system to study the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the OE that
      can be adapted for other tissues.

AB  - Reprogramming of cellular identity using exogenous expression of transcription
      factors (TFs) is a powerful and exciting tool for tissue engineering, disease
      modeling, and regenerative medicine. However, generation of desired cell types
      using this approach is often plagued by inefficiency, slow conversion, and an
      inability to produce mature functional cells. Here, we show that expression of
      constitutively active SMAD2/3 significantly improves the efficiency of induced
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation by the Yamanaka factors. Mechanistically,
      SMAD3 interacts with reprogramming factors and co-activators and co-occupies OCT4
      target loci during reprogramming. Unexpectedly, active SMAD2/3 also markedly
      enhances three other TF-mediated direct reprogramming conversions, from B cells
      to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons,
      highlighting broad and general roles for SMAD2/3 as cell-reprogramming
      potentiators. Our results suggest that co-expression of active SMAD2/3 could
      enhance multiple types of TF-based cell identity conversion and therefore be a
      powerful tool for cellular engineering.

AB  - Organogenesis generates higher-order structures containing functional subunits,
      connective components, and progenitor niches. Despite recent advances in
      organoid-based modeling of tissue development, recapitulating these complex
      configurations from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has remained challenging. In
      this study, we report assembly of kidney organoids that recapitulate embryonic
      branching morphogenesis. By studying the distinct origins and developmental
      processes of the ureteric bud, which contains epithelial kidney progenitors that 
      undergo branching morphogenesis and thereby plays a central role in orchestrating
      organ geometry, and neighboring mesenchymal nephron progenitors, we established a
      protocol for differential induction of each lineage from mouse and human PSCs.
      Importantly, reassembled organoids developed the inherent architectures of the
      embryonic kidney, including the peripheral progenitor niche and internally
      differentiated nephrons that were interconnected by a ramified ureteric
      epithelium. This selective induction and reassembly strategy will be a powerful
      approach to recapitulate organotypic architecture in PSC-derived organoids.

AB  - Erasure of DNA methylation and repressive chromatin marks in the mammalian
      germline leads to risk of transcriptional activation of transposable elements
      (TEs). Here, we used mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to identify an
      endosiRNA-based mechanism involved in suppression of TE transcription. In ESCs
      with DNA demethylation induced by acute deletion of Dnmt1, we saw an increase in 
      sense transcription at TEs, resulting in an abundance of sense/antisense
      transcripts leading to high levels of ARGONAUTE2 (AGO2)-bound small RNAs.
      Inhibition of Dicer or Ago2 expression revealed that small RNAs are involved in
      an immediate response to demethylation-induced transposon activation, while the
      deposition of repressive histone marks follows as a chronic response. In vivo, we
      also found TE-specific endosiRNAs present during primordial germ cell
      development. Our results suggest that antisense TE transcription is a "trap" that
      elicits an endosiRNA response to restrain acute transposon activity during
      epigenetic reprogramming in the mammalian germline.

TI  - TGF-beta-Induced Quiescence Mediates Chemoresistance of Tumor-Propagating Cells
      in Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are heterogeneous tumors sustained by
      tumor-propagating cancer cells (TPCs). SCCs frequently resist chemotherapy
      through still unknown mechanisms. Here, we combine H2B-GFP-based pulse-chasing
      with cell-surface markers to distinguish quiescent from proliferative TPCs within
      SCCs. We find that quiescent TPCs resist DNA damage and exhibit increased
      tumorigenic potential in response to chemotherapy, whereas proliferative TPCs
      undergo apoptosis. Quiescence is regulated by TGF-beta/SMAD signaling, which
      directly regulates cell-cycle gene transcription to control a reversible G1
      cell-cycle arrest, independent of p21(CIP) function. Indeed, genetic or
      pharmacological TGF-beta inhibition increases the susceptibility of TPCs to
      chemotherapy because it prevents entry into a quiescent state. These findings
      provide direct evidence that TPCs can reversibly enter a quiescent,
      chemoresistant state and thereby underscore the need for combinatorial approaches
      to improve treatment of chemotherapy-resistant SCCs.

TI  - Long-Range GABAergic Inputs Regulate Neural Stem Cell Quiescence and Control
      Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.

AB  - The quiescence of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) is regulated by local
      parvalbumin (PV) interneurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Little is known
      about how local PV interneurons communicate with distal brain regions to regulate
      NSCs and hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we identify GABAergic projection neurons
      from the medial septum (MS) as the major afferents to dentate PV interneurons.
      Surprisingly, dentate PV interneurons are depolarized by GABA signaling, which is
      in sharp contrast to most mature neurons hyperpolarized by GABA. Functionally,
      these long-range GABAergic inputs are necessary and sufficient to maintain adult 
      NSC quiescence and ablating them leads to NSC activation and subsequent depletion
      of the NSC pool. Taken together, these findings delineate a GABAergic network
      involving long-range GABAergic projection neurons and local PV interneurons that 
      couples dynamic brain activity to the neurogenic niche in controlling NSC
      quiescence and hippocampal neurogenesis.

TI  - Targeting Glioma Stem Cell-Derived Pericytes Disrupts the Blood-Tumor Barrier and
      Improves Chemotherapeutic Efficacy.

AB  - The blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is a major obstacle for drug delivery to malignant 
      brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM). Disrupting the BTB is therefore highly
      desirable but complicated by the need to maintain the normal blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB). Here we show that targeting glioma stem cell (GSC)-derived pericytes
      specifically disrupts the BTB and enhances drug effusion into brain tumors. We
      found that pericyte coverage of tumor vasculature is inversely correlated with
      GBM patient survival after chemotherapy. Eliminating GSC-derived pericytes in
      xenograft models disrupted BTB tight junctions and increased vascular
      permeability. We identified BMX as an essential factor for maintaining
      GSC-derived pericytes. Inhibiting BMX with ibrutinib selectively targeted
      neoplastic pericytes and disrupted the BTB, but not the BBB, thereby increasing
      drug effusion into established tumors and enhancing the chemotherapeutic efficacy
      of drugs with poor BTB penetration. These findings highlight the clinical
      potential of targeting neoplastic pericytes to significantly improve treatment of
      brain tumors.

AB  - The use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to treat genetic blood cell
      diseases has become a clinical standard but is limited by the availability of
      suitable matched donors and potential immunologic complications. Gene therapy
      using autologous HSCs should avoid these limitations and thus may be safer.
      Progressive improvements in techniques for genetic correction of HSCs, by either 
      vector gene addition or gene editing, are facilitating successful treatments for 
      an increasing number of diseases. We highlight the progress, successes, and
      remaining challenges toward the development of HSC gene therapies and discuss
      lessons they provide for the development of future clinical stem cell therapies.

AB  - Reactive microglia are often implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative
      disease. In a recent study in Nature, Mass et al. (2017) demonstrate that
      targeted mutation of Braf in early erythro-myeloid precursors (EMPs) causes
      histiocytosis-associated late onset neurodegeneration driven by activated
      microglia.

AB  - Our understanding of early human development is typically based on inference from
      animal models, which may not fully recapitulate human embryonic features. As
      proof of concept, Fogarty et al. (2017) used CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically ablate
      the OCT4 gene in human preimplantation embryos and found key differences from its
      function in model systems.

AB  - Melanoma is one of the deadliest cancers, yet the cells of origin and mechanisms 
      of tumor initiation remain unclear. The majority of melanomas emerge from clear
      skin without a precursor lesion, but it is unknown whether these melanomas can
      arise from melanocyte stem cells (MCSCs). Here we employ mouse models to define
      the role of MCSCs as melanoma cells of origin, demonstrate that MCSC quiescence
      acts as a tumor suppressor, and identify the extrinsic environmental and
      molecular factors required for the critical early steps of melanoma initiation.
      Specifically, melanomas originate from melanoma-competent MCSCs upon stimulation 
      by UVB, which induces MCSC activation and translocation via an
      inflammation-dependent process. Moreover, the chromatin-remodeling factor Hmga2
      in the skin plays a critical role in UVB-mediated melanomagenesis. These findings
      delineate melanoma formation from melanoma-competent MCSCs following extrinsic
      stimuli, and they suggest that abrogation of Hmga2 function in the
      microenvironment can suppress MCSC-originating cutaneous melanomas.

AB  - Human brain evolution is associated with expansion and folding of the neocortex. 
      Increased diversity in neural progenitor (NP) populations (such as basally
      located radial glia [RG], which reside in an enlarged outer subventricular zone
      [OSVZ]) likely contributes to this evolutionary expansion, although their
      characteristics and relative contributions are only partially understood. Through
      single-cell transcriptional profiling of sorted human NP subpopulations, we
      identified the primate-specific TMEM14B gene as a marker of basal RG. Expression 
      of TMEM14B in embryonic NPs induces cortical thickening and gyrification in
      postnatal mice. This is accompanied by SVZ expansion, the appearance of outer
      RG-like cells, and the proliferation of multiple NP subsets, with proportional
      increases in all cortical layers and normal lamination. TMEM14B drives NP
      proliferation by increasing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
      IQGAP1, which in turn promotes G1/S cell cycle transitions. These data show that 
      a single primate-specific gene can drive neurodevelopmental changes that
      contribute to brain evolution.

AB  - To identify the cells at the origin of melanoma, we combined single-cell
      lineage-tracing and transcriptomics approaches with time-lapse imaging. A mouse
      model that recapitulates key histopathological features of human melanomagenesis 
      was created by inducing a BRafV600E-driven melanomagenic program in tail
      interfollicular melanocytes. Most targeted mature, melanin-producing melanocytes 
      expanded clonally within the epidermis before losing their differentiated
      features through transcriptional reprogramming and eventually invading the
      dermis. Tumors did not form within interscales, which contain both mature and
      dormant amelanotic melanocytes. The hair follicle bulge, which contains
      melanocyte stem cells, was also refractory to melanomagenesis. These studies
      identify varying tumor susceptibilities within the melanocytic lineage,
      highlighting pigment-producing cells as the melanoma cell of origin, and indicate
      that regional variation in tumor predisposition is dictated by microenvironmental
      cues rather than intrinsic differences in cellular origin. Critically, this work 
      provides in vivo evidence that differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed
      into cancer initiating cells.

AB  - Neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) possess a unique nuclear architecture that
      changes during differentiation. Nucleoporins are linked with cell-type-specific
      gene regulation, coupling physical changes in nuclear structure to
      transcriptional output; but, whether and how they coordinate with key
      fate-determining transcription factors is unclear. Here we show that the
      nucleoporin Nup153 interacts with Sox2 in adult NeuPCs, where it is indispensable
      for their maintenance and controls neuronal differentiation. Genome-wide analyses
      show that Nup153 and Sox2 bind and co-regulate hundreds of genes. Binding of
      Nup153 to gene promoters or transcriptional end sites correlates with increased
      or decreased gene expression, respectively, and inhibiting Nup153 expression
      alters open chromatin configurations at its target genes, disrupts genomic
      localization of Sox2, and promotes differentiation in vitro and a gliogenic fate 
      switch in vivo. Together, these findings reveal that nuclear structural proteins 
      may exert bimodal transcriptional effects to control cell fate.

AB  - Hematologic malignancies are driven by combinations of genetic lesions that have 
      been difficult to model in human cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of
      primary adult and umbilical cord blood CD34(+) human hematopoietic stem and
      progenitor cells (HSPCs), the cells of origin for myeloid pre-malignant and
      malignant diseases, followed by transplantation into immunodeficient mice to
      generate genetic models of clonal hematopoiesis and neoplasia. Human
      hematopoietic cells bearing mutations in combinations of genes, including cohesin
      complex genes, observed in myeloid malignancies generated immunophenotypically
      defined neoplastic clones capable of long-term, multi-lineage reconstitution and 
      serial transplantation. Employing these models to investigate therapeutic
      efficacy, we found that TET2 and cohesin-mutated hematopoietic cells were
      sensitive to azacitidine treatment. These findings demonstrate the potential for 
      generating genetically defined models of human myeloid diseases, and they are
      suitable for examining the biological consequences of somatic mutations and the
      testing of therapeutic agents.

AB  - Human adult spermatogonial stem cells (hSSCs) must balance self-renewal and
      differentiation. To understand how this is achieved, we profiled DNA methylation 
      and open chromatin (ATAC-seq) in SSEA4(+) hSSCs, analyzed bulk and single-cell
      RNA transcriptomes (RNA-seq) in SSEA4(+) hSSCs and differentiating c-KIT(+)
      spermatogonia, and performed validation studies via immunofluorescence. First,
      DNA hypomethylation at embryonic developmental genes supports their epigenetic
      "poising" in hSSCs for future/embryonic expression, while core pluripotency genes
      (OCT4 and NANOG) were transcriptionally and epigenetically repressed.
      Interestingly, open chromatin in hSSCs was strikingly enriched in binding sites
      for pioneer factors (NFYA/B, DMRT1, and hormone receptors). Remarkably,
      single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis identified four cellular/developmental
      states during hSSC differentiation, involving major transitions in cell-cycle and
      transcriptional regulators, splicing and signaling factors, and
      glucose/mitochondria regulators. Overall, our results outline the dynamic
      chromatin/transcription landscape operating in hSSCs and identify crucial
      molecular pathways that accompany the transition from quiescence to proliferation
      and differentiation.

AB  - Germline specification underlies human reproduction and evolution, but it has
      proven difficult to study in humans since it occurs shortly after blastocyst
      implantation. This process can be modeled with human induced pluripotent stem
      cells (hiPSCs) by differentiating them into primordial germ cell-like cells
      (hPGCLCs) through an incipient mesoderm-like cell (iMeLC) state. Here, we
      elucidate the key transcription factors and their interactions with important
      signaling pathways in driving hPGCLC differentiation from iPSCs. Germline
      competence of iMeLCs is dictated by the duration and dosage of WNT signaling,
      which induces expression of EOMES to activate SOX17, a key driver of hPGCLC
      specification. Upon hPGCLC induction, BMP signaling activates TFAP2C in a
      SOX17-independent manner. SOX17 and TFAP2C then cooperatively instate an hPGCLC
      transcriptional program, including BLIMP1 expression. This specification program 
      diverges from its mouse counterpart regarding key transcription factors and their
      hierarchies, and it provides a foundation for further study of human germ cell
      development.

AB  - Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in serum are characterized by
      hyper-phosphorylated RB protein, lack of G1 control, and rapid progression
      through the cell cycle. Here, we show that ESCs grown in the presence of two
      small-molecule inhibitors (2i ESCs) have a longer G1-phase with
      hypo-phosphorylated RB, implying that they have a functional G1 checkpoint.
      Deletion of RB, P107, and P130 in 2i ESCs results in a G1-phase similar to that
      of serum ESCs. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway in serum ESCs results in
      the appearance of hypo-phosphorylated RB and the reinstatement of a G1
      checkpoint. In addition, induction of a dormant state by the inhibition of MYC,
      resembling diapause, requires the presence of the RB family proteins.
      Collectively, our data show that RB-dependent G1 restriction point signaling is
      active in mouse ESCs grown in 2i but abrogated in serum by ERK-dependent
      phosphorylation.

AB  - Determining causal relationships between distinct chromatin features and gene
      expression, and ultimately cell behavior, remains a major challenge. Recent
      developments in targetable epigenome-editing tools enable us to assign direct
      transcriptional and functional consequences to locus-specific chromatin
      modifications. This Protocol Review discusses the unprecedented opportunity that 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers for investigating and manipulating the epigenome to
      facilitate further understanding of stem cell biology and engineering of stem
      cells for therapeutic applications. We also provide technical considerations for 
      standardization and further improvement of the CRISPR/Cas9-based tools to
      engineer the epigenome.

AB  - As genome editing rapidly progresses toward the realization of its clinical
      promise, assessing the suitability of current tools and processes used for its
      benefit-risk assessment is critical. Although current regulations may initially
      provide an adequate regulatory framework, improvements are recommended to
      overcome several existing technology-based safety and efficacy issues.

AB  - Reporting in Nature Genetics, Patterson et al. (2017) show that adult mammalian
      hearts possess an innate capacity to regenerate, which depends on a small
      population of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes. These cells undergo
      karyokinesis and cytokinesis, raising the possibility that endogenous cardiac
      muscle cells can be stimulated to proliferate for myocardial repair.

AB  - Intestinal organoids offer great promise for modeling intestinal diseases;
      however, harvesting intestinal tissue is invasive and directed hPSC
      differentiation protocols are laborious and costly. In this issue of Cell Stem
      Cell, Miura and Suzuki (2017) describe the direct conversion of somatic cells
      from both mice and humans into robust intestinal epithelial tissue.

AB  - JAK1 is a critical effector of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and plays
      important roles in immune function, while abnormal JAK1 activity has been linked 
      to immunological and neoplastic diseases. Specific functions of JAK1 in the
      context of hematopoiesis, and specifically within hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSCs), have not clearly been delineated. Here, we show that conditional Jak1
      loss in HSCs reduces their self-renewal and markedly alters lymphoid/myeloid
      differentiation in vivo. Jak1-deficient HSCs exhibit decreased competitiveness in
      vivo and are unable to rescue hematopoiesis in the setting of myelosuppression.
      They exhibit increased quiescence, an inability to enter the cell cycle in
      response to hematopoietic stress, and a marked reduction in cytokine sensing,
      including in response to type I interferons and IL-3. Moreover, Jak1 loss is not 
      fully rescued by expression of a constitutively active Jak2 allele. Together,
      these data highlight an essential role for Jak1 in HSC homeostasis and stress
      responses.

AB  - Lung alveoli, which are unique to air-breathing organisms, have been challenging 
      to generate from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in part because there are limited 
      model systems available to provide the necessary developmental roadmaps for in
      vitro differentiation. Here we report the generation of alveolar epithelial type 
      2 cells (AEC2s), the facultative progenitors of lung alveoli, from human PSCs.
      Using multicolored fluorescent reporter lines, we track and purify human SFTPC+
      alveolar progenitors as they emerge from endodermal precursors in response to
      stimulation of Wnt and FGF signaling. Purified PSC-derived SFTPC+ cells form
      monolayered epithelial "alveolospheres" in 3D cultures without the need for
      mesenchymal support, exhibit self-renewal capacity, and display additional AEC2
      functional capacities. Footprint-free CRISPR-based gene correction of PSCs
      derived from patients carrying a homozygous surfactant mutation (SFTPB(121ins2)) 
      restores surfactant processing in AEC2s. Thus, PSC-derived AEC2s provide a
      platform for disease modeling and future functional regeneration of the distal
      lung.

AB  - As human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) exit pluripotency, they are thought to
      switch from a glycolytic mode of energy generation to one more dependent on
      oxidative phosphorylation. Here we show that, although metabolic switching occurs
      during early mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, high glycolytic flux is
      maintained and, in fact, essential during early ectoderm specification. The
      elevated glycolysis observed in hPSCs requires elevated MYC/MYCN activity.
      Metabolic switching during endodermal and mesodermal differentiation coincides
      with a reduction in MYC/MYCN and can be reversed by ectopically restoring MYC
      activity. During early ectodermal differentiation, sustained MYCN activity
      maintains the transcription of "switch" genes that are rate-limiting for
      metabolic activity and lineage commitment. Our work, therefore, shows that
      metabolic switching is lineage-specific and not a required step for exit of
      pluripotency in hPSCs and identifies MYC and MYCN as developmental regulators
      that couple metabolism to pluripotency and cell fate determination.

AB  - Intestinal organoids hold great promise as a valuable tool for studying and
      treating intestinal diseases. The currently available sources of human intestinal
      organoids, tissue fragments or pluripotent stem cells, involve invasive
      procedures or complex differentiation protocols, respectively. Here, we show that
      a set of four transcription factors, Hnf4alpha, Foxa3, Gata6, and Cdx2, can
      directly reprogram mouse fibroblasts to acquire the identity of fetal
      intestine-derived progenitor cells (FIPCs). These induced FIPCs (iFIPCs) form
      spherical organoids that develop into adult-type budding organoids containing
      cells with intestinal stem cell properties. The resulting stem cells produce all 
      intestinal epithelial cell lineages and undergo self-renewing cell divisions.
      After transplantation, the induced spherical and budding organoids can
      reconstitute colonic and intestinal epithelia, respectively. The same combination
      of four defined transcription factors can also induce human iFIPCs. This
      alternative approach for producing intestinal organoids may well facilitate
      application for disease analysis and therapy development.

AB  - Directing the fate of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into different
      lineages requires variable starting conditions and components with undefined
      activities, introducing inconsistencies that confound reproducibility and
      assessment of specific perturbations. Here we introduce a simple, modular
      protocol for deriving the four main ectodermal lineages from hPSCs. By precisely 
      varying FGF, BMP, WNT, and TGFbeta pathway activity in a minimal, chemically
      defined medium, we show parallel, robust, and reproducible derivation of
      neuroectoderm, neural crest (NC), cranial placode (CP), and non-neural ectoderm
      in multiple hPSC lines, on different substrates independently of cell density. We
      highlight the utility of this system by interrogating the role of TFAP2
      transcription factors in ectodermal differentiation, revealing the importance of 
      TFAP2A in NC and CP specification, and performing a small-molecule screen that
      identified compounds that further enhance CP differentiation. This platform
      provides a simple stage for systematic derivation of the entire range of
      ectodermal cell types.

AB  - Directed reprogramming of human fibroblasts into fully differentiated neurons
      requires massive changes in epigenetic and transcriptional states. Induction of a
      chromatin environment permissive for acquiring neuronal subtype identity is
      therefore a major barrier to fate conversion. Here we show that the
      brain-enriched miRNAs miR-9/9( *) and miR-124 (miR-9/9( *)-124) trigger
      reconfiguration of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression 
      to induce a default neuronal state. miR-9/9( *)-124-induced neurons (miNs) are
      functionally excitable and uncommitted toward specific subtypes but possess open 
      chromatin at neuronal subtype-specific loci, suggesting that such identity can be
      imparted by additional lineage-specific transcription factors. Consistently, we
      show that ISL1 and LHX3 selectively drive conversion to a highly homogeneous
      population of human spinal cord motor neurons. This study shows that modular
      synergism between miRNAs and neuronal subtype-specific transcription factors can 
      drive lineage-specific neuronal reprogramming, providing a general platform for
      high-efficiency generation of distinct subtypes of human neurons.

AB  - Recent developments in the field of mitochondrial replacement technique (MRT)
      research and clinical practice have raised ethical concerns worldwide. We argue
      that the future use of MRTs requires a concerted effort among the global research
      and clinical community to implement and enforce responsible innovation and
      governance.

AB  - Effective treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) largely depends on the 
      eradication of CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We recently showed that CML LSCs
      depend on Tcf1 and Lef1 factors for self-renewal. Using a connectivity map, we
      identified prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) as a small molecule that partly elicited the
      gene expression changes in LSCs caused by Tcf1/Lef1 deficiency. Although it has
      little impact on normal hematopoiesis, we found that PGE1 treatment impaired the 
      persistence and activity of LSCs in a pre-clinical murine CML model and a
      xenograft model of transplanted CML patient CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells.
      Mechanistically, PGE1 acted on the EP4 receptor and repressed Fosb and Fos AP-1
      factors in a beta-catenin-independent manner. Misoprostol, an FDA-approved EP4
      agonist, conferred similar protection against CML. These findings suggest that
      activation of this PGE1-EP4 pathway specifically targets CML LSCs and that the
      combination of PGE1/misoprostol with conventional tyrosine-kinase inhibitors
      could provide effective therapy for CML.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) directly infects neural progenitors and impairs their
      proliferation. How ZIKV interacts with the host molecular machinery to impact
      neurogenesis in vivo is not well understood. Here, by systematically introducing 
      individual proteins encoded by ZIKV into the embryonic mouse cortex, we show that
      expression of ZIKV-NS2A, but not Dengue virus (DENV)-NS2A, leads to reduced
      proliferation and premature differentiation of radial glial cells and aberrant
      positioning of newborn neurons. Mechanistically, in vitro mapping of
      protein-interactomes and biochemical analysis suggest interactions between
      ZIKA-NS2A and multiple adherens junction complex (AJ) components. Functionally,
      ZIKV-NS2A, but not DENV-NS2A, destabilizes the AJ complex, resulting in impaired 
      AJ formation and aberrant radial glial fiber scaffolding in the embryonic mouse
      cortex. Similarly, ZIKA-NS2A, but not DENV-NS2A, reduces radial glial cell
      proliferation and causes AJ deficits in human forebrain organoids. Together, our 
      results reveal pathogenic mechanisms underlying ZIKV infection in the developing 
      mammalian brain.

TI  - Open Chromatin Profiling in hiPSC-Derived Neurons Prioritizes Functional
      Noncoding Psychiatric Risk Variants and Highlights Neurodevelopmental Loci.

AB  - Most disease variants lie within noncoding genomic regions, making their
      functional interpretation challenging. Because chromatin openness strongly
      influences transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that cell-type-specific open
      chromatin regions (OCRs) might highlight disease-relevant noncoding sequences. To
      investigate, we mapped global OCRs in neurons differentiating from hiPSCs, a
      cellular model for studying neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia
      (SZ). We found that the OCRs are highly dynamic and can stratify GWAS-implicated 
      SZ risk variants. Of the more than 3,500 SZ-associated variants analyzed, we
      prioritized approximately 100 putatively functional ones located in neuronal
      OCRs, including rs1198588, at a leading risk locus flanking MIR137. Excitatory
      neurons derived from hiPSCs with CRISPR/Cas9-edited rs1198588 or a rare
      proximally located SZ risk variant showed altered MIR137 expression, dendrite
      arborization, and synapse maturation. Our study shows that noncoding disease
      variants in OCRs can affect neurodevelopment, and that analysis of open chromatin
      regions can help prioritize functionally relevant noncoding variants identified
      by GWAS.

AB  - Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), as evidenced by recurrent somatic mutations in
      leukemia-associated genes, commonly occurs among aging human hematopoietic stem
      cells. We analyzed deep-coverage, targeted, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data
      of paired tumor and blood samples from 8,810 individuals to assess the frequency 
      and clinical relevance of CH in patients with non-hematologic malignancies. We
      identified CH in 25% of cancer patients, with 4.5% harboring presumptive leukemia
      driver mutations (CH-PD). CH was associated with increased age, prior radiation
      therapy, and tobacco use. PPM1D and TP53 mutations were associated with prior
      exposure to chemotherapy. CH and CH-PD led to an increased incidence of
      subsequent hematologic cancers, and CH-PD was associated with shorter patient
      survival. These data suggest that CH occurs in an age-dependent manner and that
      specific perturbations can enhance fitness of clonal hematopoietic stem cells,
      which can impact outcome through progression to hematologic malignancies and
      through cell-non-autonomous effects on solid tumor biology.

TI  - Modeling of TREX1-Dependent Autoimmune Disease using Human Stem Cells Highlights 
      L1 Accumulation as a Source of Neuroinflammation.

AB  - Three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an anti-viral enzyme that cleaves
      nucleic acids in the cytosol, preventing accumulation and a subsequent type I
      interferon-associated inflammatory response. Autoimmune diseases, including
      Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus, can arise when
      TREX1 function is compromised. AGS is a neuroinflammatory disorder with severe
      and persistent intellectual and physical problems. Here we generated a human AGS 
      model that recapitulates disease-relevant phenotypes using pluripotent stem cells
      lacking TREX1. We observed abundant extrachromosomal DNA in TREX1-deficient
      neural cells, of which endogenous Long Interspersed Element-1 retrotransposons
      were a major source. TREX1-deficient neurons also exhibited increased apoptosis
      and formed three-dimensional cortical organoids of reduced size. TREX1-deficient 
      astrocytes further contributed to the observed neurotoxicity through increased
      type I interferon secretion. In this model, reverse-transcriptase inhibitors
      rescued the neurotoxicity of AGS neurons and organoids, highlighting their
      potential utility in therapeutic regimens for AGS and related disorders.

AB  - Organoid techniques provide unique platforms to model brain development and
      neurological disorders. Whereas several methods for recapitulating corticogenesis
      have been described, a system modeling human medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)
      development, a critical ventral brain domain producing cortical interneurons and 
      related lineages, has been lacking until recently. Here, we describe the
      generation of MGE and cortex-specific organoids from human pluripotent stem cells
      that recapitulate the development of MGE and cortex domains, respectively.
      Population and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling combined with bulk 
      assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing
      (ATAC-seq) analyses revealed transcriptional and chromatin accessibility dynamics
      and lineage relationships during MGE and cortical organoid development.
      Furthermore, MGE and cortical organoids generated physiologically functional
      neurons and neuronal networks. Finally, fusing region-specific organoids followed
      by live imaging enabled analysis of human interneuron migration and integration. 
      Together, our study provides a platform for generating domain-specific brain
      organoids and modeling human interneuron migration and offers deeper insight into
      molecular dynamics during human brain development.

AB  - Somatic gene therapy is a promising approach for treating otherwise terminal or
      debilitating diseases. The human skin is a promising conduit for genetic
      engineering, as it is the largest and most accessible organ, epidermal autografts
      and tissue-engineered skin equivalents have been successfully deployed in
      clinical applications, and skin epidermal stem/progenitor cells for generating
      such grafts are easy to obtain and expand in vitro. Here, we develop skin grafts 
      from mouse and human epidermal progenitors that were engineered by
      CRISPR-mediated genome editing to controllably release GLP-1 (glucagon-like
      peptide 1), a critical incretin that regulates blood glucose homeostasis. GLP-1
      induction from engineered mouse cells grafted onto immunocompetent hosts
      increased insulin secretion and reversed high-fat-diet-induced weight gain and
      insulin resistance. Taken together, these results highlight the clinical
      potential of developing long-lasting, safe, and versatile gene therapy approaches
      based on engineering epidermal progenitor cells.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation represents a curative treatment for
      various hematological disorders. However, delayed reconstitution of innate and
      adaptive immunity often causes fatal complications. HSC maintenance and lineage
      differentiation are supported by stromal niches, and we now find that bone marrow
      stroma cells (BMSCs) are severely and permanently damaged by the pre-conditioning
      irradiation required for efficient HSC transplantation. Using mouse models, we
      show that stromal insufficiency limits the number of donor-derived HSCs and B
      lymphopoiesis. Intra-bone transplantation of primary, but not cultured, BMSCs
      quantitatively reconstitutes stroma function in vivo, which is mediated by a
      multipotent NT5E(+) (CD73)(+) ENG(-) (CD105)(-) LY6A(+) (SCA1)(+) BMSC
      subpopulation. BMSC co-transplantation doubles the number of functional,
      donor-derived HSCs and significantly reduces clinically relevant side effects
      associated with HSC transplantation including neutropenia and humoral
      immunodeficiency. These data demonstrate the potential of stroma recovery to
      improve HSC transplantation.

AB  - The ability to direct the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)
      to the different cardiomyocyte subtypes is a prerequisite for modeling specific
      forms of cardiovascular disease in vitro and for developing novel therapies to
      treat them. Here we have investigated the development of the human atrial and
      ventricular lineages from hPSCs, and we show that retinoic acid signaling at the 
      mesoderm stage of development is required for atrial specification. Analyses of
      early developmental stages revealed that ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes
      derive from different mesoderm populations that can be distinguished based on
      CD235a and RALDH2 expression, respectively. Molecular and electrophysiological
      characterization of the derivative cardiomyocytes revealed that optimal
      specification of ventricular and atrial cells is dependent on induction of the
      appropriate mesoderm. Together these findings provide new insights into the
      development of the human atrial and ventricular lineages that enable the
      generation of highly enriched, functional cardiomyocyte populations for
      therapeutic applications.

AB  - Fibrosis is associated with organ failure and high mortality and is commonly
      characterized by aberrant myofibroblast accumulation. Investigating the cellular 
      origin of myofibroblasts in various diseases is thus a promising strategy for
      developing targeted anti-fibrotic treatments. Recent studies using genetic
      lineage tracing technology have implicated diverse organ-resident perivascular
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells and bone marrow-MSCs in myofibroblast
      generation during fibrosis development. In this Review, we give an overview of
      the emerging role of MSCs and MSC-like cells in myofibroblast-mediated fibrotic
      disease in the kidney, lung, heart, liver, skin, and bone marrow.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infects fetal and adult human brain and is associated with
      serious neurological complications. To date, no therapeutic treatment is
      available to treat ZIKV-infected patients. We performed a high-content chemical
      screen using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neural progenitor cells
      (hNPCs) and found that hippeastrine hydrobromide (HH) and amodiaquine
      dihydrochloride dihydrate (AQ) can inhibit ZIKV infection in hNPCs. Further
      validation showed that HH also rescues ZIKV-induced growth and differentiation
      defects in hNPCs and human fetal-like forebrain organoids. Finally, HH and AQ
      inhibit ZIKV infection in adult mouse brain in vivo. Strikingly, HH suppresses
      viral propagation when administered to adult mice with active ZIKV infection,
      highlighting its therapeutic potential. Our approach highlights the power of stem
      cell-based screens and validation in human forebrain organoids and mouse models
      in identifying drug candidates for treating ZIKV infection and related
      neurological complications in fetal and adult patients.

      Promotes Proliferation but Reduces Competitive Fitness.

AB  - Bacterial infection leads to consumption of short-lived innate immune effector
      cells, which then need to be replenished from hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cells (HSPCs). HSPCs express pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like
      receptors (TLRs), and ligation of these receptors induces HSPC mobilization,
      cytokine production, and myeloid differentiation. The underlying mechanisms
      involved in pathogen signal transduction in HSCs and the resulting biological
      consequences remain poorly defined. Here, we show that in vivo lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) application induces proliferation of dormant HSCs directly via TLR4 and
      that sustained LPS exposure impairs HSC self-renewal and competitive repopulation
      activity. This process is mediated via TLR4-TRIF-ROS-p38, but not MyD88
      signaling, and can be inhibited pharmacologically without preventing emergency
      granulopoiesis. Live Salmonella Typhimurium infection similarly induces
      proliferative stress in HSCs, in part via TLR4-TRIF signals. Thus, while direct
      TLR4 activation in HSCs might be beneficial for controlling systemic infection,
      prolonged TLR4 signaling has detrimental effects and may contribute to
      inflammation-associated HSPC dysfunction.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether intrinsic glial dysfunction contributes to
      the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ). Our approach was to establish humanized 
      glial chimeric mice using glial progenitor cells (GPCs) produced from induced
      pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with childhood-onset SCZ. After
      neonatal implantation into myelin-deficient shiverer mice, SCZ GPCs showed
      premature migration into the cortex, leading to reduced white matter expansion
      and hypomyelination relative to controls. The SCZ glial chimeras also showed
      delayed astrocytic differentiation and abnormal astrocytic morphologies. When
      established in myelin wild-type hosts, SCZ glial mice showed reduced prepulse
      inhibition and abnormal behavior, including excessive anxiety, antisocial traits,
      and disturbed sleep. RNA-seq of cultured SCZ human glial progenitor cells (hGPCs)
      revealed disrupted glial differentiation-associated and synaptic gene expression,
      indicating that glial pathology was cell autonomous. Our data therefore suggest a
      causal role for impaired glial maturation in the development of schizophrenia and
      provide a humanized model for its in vivo assessment.

AB  - Glioblastomas exhibit a hierarchical cellular organization, suggesting that they 
      are driven by neoplastic stem cells that retain partial yet abnormal
      differentiation potential. Here, we show that a large subset of patient-derived
      glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) express high levels of Achaete-scute homolog 1
      (ASCL1), a proneural transcription factor involved in normal neurogenesis.
      ASCL1(hi) GSCs exhibit a latent capacity for terminal neuronal differentiation in
      response to inhibition of Notch signaling, whereas ASCL1(lo) GSCs do not.
      Increasing ASCL1 levels in ASCL1(lo) GSCs restores neuronal lineage potential,
      promotes terminal differentiation, and attenuates tumorigenicity. ASCL1 mediates 
      these effects by functioning as a pioneer factor at closed chromatin, opening new
      sites to activate a neurogenic gene expression program. Directing GSCs toward
      terminal differentiation may provide therapeutic applications for a subset of GBM
      patients and strongly supports efforts to restore differentiation potential in
      GBM and other cancers.

AB  - Direct lineage reprogramming, including with small molecules, has emerged as a
      promising approach for generating desired cell types. We recently found that
      during chemical induction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse
      fibroblasts, cells pass through an extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN)-like state.
      Here, we show that these chemically induced XEN-like cells can also be induced to
      directly reprogram into functional neurons, bypassing the pluripotent state. The 
      induced neurons possess neuron-specific expression profiles, form functional
      synapses in culture, and further mature after transplantation into the adult
      mouse brain. Using similar principles, we were also able to induce
      hepatocyte-like cells from the XEN-like cells. Cells in the induced XEN-like
      state were readily expandable over at least 20 passages and retained genome
      stability and lineage specification potential. Our study therefore establishes a 
      multifunctional route for chemical lineage reprogramming and may provide a
      platform for generating a diverse range of cell types via application of this
      expandable XEN-like state.

AB  - Several cell populations have been reported to possess intestinal stem cell (ISC)
      activity during homeostasis and injury-induced regeneration. Here, we explored
      inter-relationships between putative mouse ISC populations by comparative
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptomes of multiple cycling ISC populations 
      closely resembled Lgr5(+) ISCs, the most well-defined ISC pool, but Bmi1-GFP(+)
      cells were distinct and enriched for enteroendocrine (EE) markers, including
      Prox1. Prox1-GFP(+) cells exhibited sustained clonogenic growth in vitro, and
      lineage-tracing of Prox1(+) cells revealed long-lived clones during homeostasis
      and after radiation-induced injury in vivo. Single-cell mRNA-seq revealed two
      subsets of Prox1-GFP(+) cells, one of which resembled mature EE cells while the
      other displayed low-level EE gene expression but co-expressed tuft cell markers, 
      Lgr5 and Ascl2, reminiscent of label-retaining secretory progenitors. Our data
      suggest that the EE lineage, including mature EE cells, comprises a reservoir of 
      homeostatic and injury-inducible ISCs, extending our understanding of cellular
      plasticity and stemness.

AB  - Podocyte depletion drives kidney disease and kidney failure progression, but
      podocyte complexity at the glomerular filtration barrier is difficult to model in
      vitro. In Nature Biomedical Engineering, Musah et al. (2017) developed a
      multifluidic device with iPS-derived podocytes mimicking a functional glomerular 
      filtration barrier that elevates standards for modeling glomerular diseases.

AB  - The intestinal epithelium displays great resilience, as several cell populations 
      can replenish the stem cell pool upon damage. Two studies in Cell Stem Cell
      extend this capacity to enteroendocrine cells, addressing the molecular basis
      underlying cellular plasticity observed in the intestine and the identities of
      putative reserve stem cells.

AB  - The ability to directly reprogram mature cells to alternative fates challenges
      concepts of how cell identities are maintained, erased, and acquired. Recent
      advances in understanding and overcoming hurdles to direct neuronal conversion
      have provided new insights into mechanisms that maintain cell identity programs
      and have enabled high efficiency reprogramming in vivo. We discuss key
      cell-intrinsic molecular and metabolic constraints that influence the
      establishment of a new identity as well as environmental inputs from injured
      brains that favor or harm the conversion process. Finally, we outline the
      challenges ahead with a particular focus on direct neuronal reprogramming in
      vivo.

TI  - Muscle Stem Cells Undergo Extensive Clonal Drift during Tissue Growth via
      Meox1-Mediated Induction of G2 Cell-Cycle Arrest.

AB  - Organ growth requires a careful balance between stem cell self-renewal and
      lineage commitment to ensure proper tissue expansion. The cellular and molecular 
      mechanisms that mediate this balance are unresolved in most organs, including
      skeletal muscle. Here we identify a long-lived stem cell pool that mediates
      growth of the zebrafish myotome. This population exhibits extensive clonal drift,
      shifting from random deployment of stem cells during development to reliance on a
      small number of dominant clones to fuel the vast majority of muscle growth. This 
      clonal drift requires Meox1, a homeobox protein that directly inhibits the
      cell-cycle checkpoint gene ccnb1. Meox1 initiates G2 cell-cycle arrest within
      muscle stem cells, and disrupting this G2 arrest causes premature lineage
      commitment and the resulting defects in muscle growth. These findings reveal that
      distinct regulatory mechanisms orchestrate stem cell dynamics during organ
      growth, beyond the G0/G1 cell-cycle inhibition traditionally associated with
      maintaining tissue-resident stem cells.

AB  - Lung tissue can robustly regenerate functional alveolar units after injury, but
      the mechanisms are unknown. Lechner et al. (2017) in this issue of Cell Stem Cell
      demonstrate that lung regeneration is facilitated by bone-marrow-derived myeloid 
      cells that are recruited to the lung through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis and by
      IL-13 expressing innate lymphoid cells.

AB  - Gastric and small intestinal organoids differentiated from human pluripotent stem
      cells (hPSCs) have revolutionized the study of gastrointestinal development and
      disease. Distal gut tissues such as cecum and colon, however, have proved
      considerably more challenging to derive in vitro. Here we report the
      differentiation of human colonic organoids (HCOs) from hPSCs. We found that BMP
      signaling is required to establish a posterior SATB2+ domain in developing and
      postnatal intestinal epithelium. Brief activation of BMP signaling is sufficient 
      to activate a posterior HOX code and direct hPSC-derived gut tube cultures into
      HCOs. In vitro, HCOs express colonic markers and contained colon-specific cell
      populations. Following transplantation into mice, HCOs undergo morphogenesis and 
      maturation to form tissue that exhibits molecular, cellular, and morphologic
      properties of human colon. Together these data show BMP-dependent patterning of
      human hindgut into HCOs, which will be valuable for studying diseases including
      colitis and colon cancer.

AB  - Replicating Lgr5(+) stem cells and quiescent Bmi1(+) cells behave as intestinal
      stem cells (ISCs) in vivo. Disrupting Lgr5(+) ISCs triggers epithelial renewal
      from Bmi1(+) cells, from secretory or absorptive progenitors, and from Paneth
      cell precursors, revealing a high degree of plasticity within intestinal crypts. 
      Here, we show that GFP(+) cells from Bmi1(GFP) mice are preterminal
      enteroendocrine cells and we identify CD69(+)CD274(+) cells as related goblet
      cell precursors. Upon loss of native Lgr5(+) ISCs, both populations revert toward
      an Lgr5(+) cell identity. While active histone marks are distributed similarly
      between Lgr5(+) ISCs and progenitors of both major lineages, thousands of cis
      elements that control expression of lineage-restricted genes are selectively open
      in secretory cells. This accessibility signature dynamically converts to that of 
      Lgr5(+) ISCs during crypt regeneration. Beyond establishing the nature of
      Bmi1(GFP+) cells, these findings reveal how chromatin status underlies intestinal
      cell diversity and dedifferentiation to restore ISC function and intestinal
      homeostasis.

AB  - Functionally relevant markers of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) have
      potential for therapeutic targeting to treat this aggressive disease. Here we
      used generation and screening of thousands of monoclonal antibodies to search for
      receptors and signaling pathways preferentially enriched in GSCs. We identified
      integrin alpha7 (ITGA7) as a major laminin receptor in GSCs and in primary
      high-grade glioma specimens. Analyses of mRNA profiles in comprehensive datasets 
      revealed that high ITGA7 expression negatively correlated with survival of
      patients with both low- and high-grade glioma. In vitro and in vivo analyses
      showed that ITGA7 plays a key functional role in growth and invasiveness of GSCs.
      We also found that targeting of ITGA7 by RNAi or blocking mAbs impaired
      laminin-induced signaling, and it led to a significant delay in tumor engraftment
      plus a strong reduction in tumor size and invasion. Our data, therefore,
      highlight ITGA7 as a glioblastoma biomarker and candidate therapeutic target.

AB  - To investigate the role of immune cells in lung regeneration, we used a
      unilateral pneumonectomy model that promotes the formation of new alveoli in the 
      remaining lobes. Immunofluorescence and single-cell RNA sequencing found CD115+
      and CCR2+ monocytes and M2-like macrophages accumulating in the lung during the
      peak of type 2 alveolar epithelial stem cell (AEC2) proliferation. Genetic loss
      of function in mice and adoptive transfer studies revealed that bone
      marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) traffic to the lung through a CCL2-CCR2
      chemokine axis and are required for optimal lung regeneration, along with
      Il4ra-expressing leukocytes. Our data suggest that these cells modulate AEC2
      proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we provide evidence that group 2
      innate lymphoid cells are a source of IL-13, which promotes lung regeneration.
      Together, our data highlight the potential for immunomodulatory therapies to
      stimulate alveologenesis in adults.

      stem cells are triggered to enter this proliferative TA state remains an
      important open question. Using the continuously growing mouse incisor as a model 
      of stem cell-based tissue renewal, we found that the transcriptional cofactors
      YAP and TAZ are required both to maintain TA cell proliferation and to inhibit
      differentiation. Specifically, we identified a pathway involving activation of
      integrin alpha3 in TA cells that signals through an LATS-independent
      FAK/CDC42/PP1A cascade to control YAP-S397 phosphorylation and nuclear
      localization. This leads to Rheb expression and potentiates mTOR signaling to
      drive the proliferation of TA cells. These findings thus reveal a YAP/TAZ
      signaling mechanism that coordinates stem cell expansion and differentiation
      during organ renewal.

AB  - Vertebrate eggs can induce the nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells to enable
      production of cloned animals. Nuclear reprogramming is relatively inefficient,
      and the development of the resultant embryos is frequently compromised, in part
      due to the inappropriate expression of genes previously active in the donor
      nucleus. Here, we identify H3K4 methylation as a major epigenetic roadblock that 
      limits transcriptional reprogramming and efficient nuclear transfer (NT).
      Widespread expression of donor-cell-specific genes was observed in inappropriate 
      cell types in NT embryos, limiting their developmental capacity. The expression
      of these genes in reprogrammed embryos arises from epigenetic memories of a
      previously active transcriptional state in donor cells that is characterized by
      high H3K4 methylation. Reducing H3K4 methylation had little effect on gene
      expression in donor cells, but it substantially improved transcriptional
      reprogramming and development of NT embryos. These results show that H3K4
      methylation imposes a barrier to efficient nuclear reprogramming and suggest
      approaches for improving reprogramming strategies.

AB  - Elimination of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) is necessary to permanently
      eradicate malignant tissues. In a recent article in Nature, de Sousa e Melo et
      al. (2017) reveal that intestinal tumors can contain dynamic pools of
      functionally distinct CSC populations, which seem to interconvert depending on
      the host tissue microenvironment.

AB  - In Cell Reports, Liu et al. (2017) investigate mechanisms for how pluripotent
      stem cells maintain their identity during cell division. They show that the
      histone mark H3K27ac and pluripotency transcription factors remain associated
      with mitotic chromatin in ESCs and during iPSC reprogramming, demonstrating the
      importance of mitotic bookmarking in pluripotency.

AB  - Inactivating mutations in the thyroid hormone (TH) transporter Monocarboxylate
      transporter 8 (MCT8) cause severe psychomotor retardation in children. Animal
      models do not reflect the biology of the human disease. Using patient-specific
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we generated MCT8-deficient neural cells 
      that showed normal TH-dependent neuronal properties and maturation. However, the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls TH entry into the brain, and reduced TH
      availability to neural cells could instead underlie the diseased phenotype. To
      test potential BBB involvement, we generated an iPSC-based BBB model of MCT8
      deficiency, and we found that MCT8 was necessary for polarized influx of the
      active form of TH across the BBB. We also found that a candidate drug did not
      appreciably cross the mutant BBB. Our results therefore clarify the underlying
      physiological basis of this disorder, and they suggest that circumventing the
      diseased BBB to deliver active TH to the brain could be a viable therapeutic
      strategy.

AB  - A detailed understanding of the paths that stem cells traverse to generate mature
      progeny is vital for elucidating the mechanisms governing cell fate decisions and
      tissue homeostasis. Adult stem cells maintain and regenerate multiple mature cell
      lineages in the olfactory epithelium. Here we integrate single-cell RNA
      sequencing and robust statistical analyses with in vivo lineage tracing to define
      a detailed map of the postnatal olfactory epithelium, revealing cell fate
      potentials and branchpoints in olfactory stem cell lineage trajectories.
      Olfactory stem cells produce support cells via direct fate conversion in the
      absence of cell division, and their multipotency at the population level reflects
      collective unipotent cell fate decisions by single stem cells. We further
      demonstrate that Wnt signaling regulates stem cell fate by promoting neuronal
      fate choices. This integrated approach reveals the mechanisms guiding olfactory
      lineage trajectories and provides a model for deconstructing similar hierarchies 
      in other stem cell niches.

AB  - Human fetal germ cells (FGCs) are precursors to sperm and eggs and are crucial
      for maintenance of the species. However, the developmental trajectories and
      heterogeneity of human FGCs remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-cell
      RNA-seq analysis of over 2,000 FGCs and their gonadal niche cells in female and
      male human embryos spanning several developmental stages. We found that female
      FGCs undergo four distinct sequential phases characterized by mitosis, retinoic
      acid signaling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis. Male FGCs develop through stages
      of migration, mitosis, and cell-cycle arrest. Individual embryos of both sexes
      simultaneously contain several subpopulations, highlighting the asynchronous and 
      heterogeneous nature of FGC development. Moreover, we observed reciprocal
      signaling interactions between FGCs and their gonadal niche cells, including
      activation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Notch signaling pathways.
      Our work provides key insights into the crucial features of human FGCs during
      their highly ordered mitotic, meiotic, and gametogenetic processes in vivo.

      Important Cellular Therapeutic Target.

AB  - Bone marrow fibrosis (BMF) develops in various hematological and
      non-hematological conditions and is a central pathological feature of
      myelofibrosis. Effective cell-targeted therapeutics are needed, but the cellular 
      origin of BMF remains elusive. Here, we show using genetic fate tracing in two
      murine models of BMF that Gli1(+) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are recruited 
      from the endosteal and perivascular niche to become fibrosis-driving
      myofibroblasts in the bone marrow. Genetic ablation of Gli1(+) cells abolished
      BMF and rescued bone marrow failure. Pharmacological targeting of Gli proteins
      with GANT61 inhibited Gli1(+) cell expansion and myofibroblast differentiation
      and attenuated fibrosis severity. The same pathway is also active in human BMF,
      and Gli1 expression in BMF significantly correlates with the severity of the
      disease. In addition, GANT61 treatment reduced the myofibroblastic phenotype of
      human MSCs isolated from patients with BMF, suggesting that targeting of Gli
      proteins could be a relevant therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Effective derivation of functional airway organoids from induced pluripotent stem
      cells (iPSCs) would provide valuable models of lung disease and facilitate
      precision therapies for airway disorders such as cystic fibrosis. However,
      limited understanding of human airway patterning has made this goal challenging. 
      Here, we show that cyclical modulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway
      enables rapid directed differentiation of human iPSCs via an NKX2-1(+) progenitor
      intermediate into functional proximal airway organoids. We find that human
      NKX2-1(+) progenitors have high levels of Wnt activation but respond
      intrinsically to decreases in Wnt signaling by rapidly patterning into proximal
      airway lineages at the expense of distal fates. Using this directed approach, we 
      were able to generate cystic fibrosis patient-specific iPSC-derived airway
      organoids with a defect in forskolin-induced swelling that is rescued by gene
      editing to correct the disease mutation. Our approach has many potential
      applications in modeling and drug screening for airway diseases.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) exist in naive and primed states and provide 
      important models to investigate the earliest stages of human development. Naive
      cells can be obtained through primed-to-naive resetting, but there are no
      reliable methods to prospectively isolate unmodified naive cells during this
      process. Here we report comprehensive profiling of cell surface proteins by flow 
      cytometry in naive and primed human PSCs. Several naive-specific, but not
      primed-specific, proteins were also expressed by pluripotent cells in the human
      preimplantation embryo. The upregulation of naive-specific cell surface proteins 
      during primed-to-naive resetting enabled the isolation and characterization of
      live naive cells and intermediate cell populations. This analysis revealed
      distinct transcriptional and X chromosome inactivation changes associated with
      the early and late stages of naive cell formation. Thus, identification of
      state-specific proteins provides a robust set of molecular markers to define the 
      human PSC state and allows new insights into the molecular events leading to
      naive cell resetting.

AB  - Aging and obesity induce ectopic adipocyte accumulation in bone marrow cavities. 
      This process is thought to impair osteogenic and hematopoietic regeneration. Here
      we specify the cellular identities of the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages of
      the bone. While aging impairs the osteogenic lineage, high-fat diet feeding
      activates expansion of the adipogenic lineage, an effect that is significantly
      enhanced in aged animals. We further describe a mesenchymal sub-population with
      stem cell-like characteristics that gives rise to both lineages and, at the same 
      time, acts as a principal component of the hematopoietic niche by promoting
      competitive repopulation following lethal irradiation. Conversely, bone-resident 
      cells committed to the adipocytic lineage inhibit hematopoiesis and bone healing,
      potentially by producing excessive amounts of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a protease 
      that is a target of diabetes therapies. These studies delineate the molecular
      identity of the bone-resident adipocytic lineage, and they establish its
      involvement in age-dependent dysfunction of bone and hematopoietic regeneration.

AB  - Highly proliferative Lgr5+ stem cells maintain the intestinal epithelium and are 
      thought to be largely homogeneous. Although quiescent intestinal stem cell (ISC) 
      populations have been described, the identity and features of such a population
      remain controversial. Here we report unanticipated heterogeneity within the Lgr5+
      ISC pool. We found that expression of the RNA-binding protein Mex3a labels a
      slowly cycling subpopulation of Lgr5+ ISCs that contribute to all intestinal
      lineages with distinct kinetics. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed
      that Lgr5+ cells adopt two discrete states, one of which is defined by a Mex3a
      expression program and relatively low levels of proliferation genes. During
      homeostasis, Mex3a+ cells continually shift into the rapidly dividing,
      self-renewing ISC pool. Chemotherapy and radiation preferentially target rapidly 
      dividing Lgr5+ cells but spare the Mex3a-high/Lgr5+ population, helping to
      promote regeneration of the intestinal epithelium following toxic insults. Thus, 
      Mex3a defines a reserve-like ISC population within the Lgr5+ compartment.

AB  - Adult stem cells, particularly those resident in tissues with little turnover,
      are largely quiescent and only activate in response to regenerative demands,
      while embryonic stem cells continuously replicate, suggesting profoundly
      different regulatory mechanisms within distinct stem cell types. In recent years,
      evidence linking metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics, and protein homeostasis
      (proteostasis) as fundamental regulators of stem cell function has emerged. Here,
      we discuss new insights into how these networks control potency, self-renewal,
      differentiation, and aging of highly proliferative embryonic stem cells and
      quiescent adult stem cells, with a focus on hematopoietic and muscle stem cells
      and implications for anti-aging research.

AB  - The niche, as first conceptualized, was in conflict with the prevailing wisdom
      that stem cells have internal logic. The niche hypothesis has been indisputably
      confirmed. Yet, recent findings indicate little plasticity of epigenetically
      scripted hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Reconciling this conflict requires
      re-envisioning the niche as an enabler, not designer, of cell fate.

AB  - Mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can self-organize in vitro, but whether
      they can recreate early embryonic morphogenesis is unclear. Harrison et al.
      recently demonstrate in Science that 3D co-cultures of mouse ESCs and trophoblast
      stem cells self-organize into embryo-like structures that recreate many features 
      of early mouse development.

AB  - Haploinsufficient GATA6 mutations are associated with human pancreatic agenesis. 
      Shi et al. (2017) in this issue of Cell Stem Cell and Tiyaboonchai et al. (2017) 
      in a recent issue of Cell Reports utilize hPSCs to characterize GATA6 function
      during human pancreas development. One functional copy of GATA6 is sufficient for
      definitive endoderm development and pancreas formation, but it is inadequate for 
      functional beta cell differentiation.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are refractory to therapeutic
      interventions. Chen et al. (2017) show that mouse and human HNSCCs and their
      metastases depend on Bmi1-expressing cancer stem cells and AP1 signaling and that
      simultaneously inhibiting Bmi1 or AP1, combined with Cisplatin, reduces tumor
      growth effectively in preclinical models.

AB  - Blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and gonad-derived embryonic germ
      cells (EGCs) represent two classic types of pluripotent cell lines, yet their
      molecular equivalence remains incompletely understood. Here, we compare
      genome-wide methylation patterns between isogenic ESC and EGC lines to define
      epigenetic similarities and differences. Surprisingly, we find that sex rather
      than cell type drives methylation patterns in ESCs and EGCs. Cell fusion
      experiments further reveal that the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes dictates 
      methylation levels, with female hybrids being hypomethylated and male hybrids
      being hypermethylated. We show that the X-linked MAPK phosphatase DUSP9 is
      upregulated in female compared to male ESCs, and its heterozygous loss in female 
      ESCs leads to male-like methylation levels. However, male and female blastocysts 
      are similarly hypomethylated, indicating that sex-specific methylation
      differences arise in culture. Collectively, our data demonstrate the epigenetic
      similarity of sex-matched ESCs and EGCs and identify DUSP9 as a regulator of
      female-specific hypomethylation.

AB  - Organ fitness depends on appropriate maintenance of stem cell populations, and
      aberrations in functional stem cell numbers are associated with malignancies and 
      aging. Symmetrical division is the best characterized mechanism of stem cell
      replacement, but other mechanisms could also be deployed, particularly in
      situations of high stress. Here, we show that after severe depletion, intestinal 
      stem cells (ISCs) in the Drosophila midgut are replaced by spindle-independent
      ploidy reduction of cells in the enterocyte lineage through a process known as
      amitosis. Amitosis is also induced by the functional loss of ISCs coupled with
      tissue demand and in aging flies, underscoring the generality of this mechanism. 
      However, we also found that random homologous chromosome segregation during
      ploidy reduction can expose deleterious mutations through loss of heterozygosity.
      Together, our results highlight amitosis as an unappreciated mechanism for
      restoring stem cell homeostasis, but one with some associated risk in animals
      carrying mutations.

      base-resolution landscapes of 5-formylcytosine (5fC) (an oxidized derivative of
      5mC) at the single-cell level remain unexplored. Here, we present "CLEVER-seq"
      (chemical-labeling-enabled C-to-T conversion sequencing), which is a single-cell,
      single-base resolution 5fC-sequencing technology, based on biocompatible,
      selective chemical labeling of 5fC and subsequent C-to-T conversion during
      amplification and sequencing. CLEVER-seq shows intrinsic 5fC heterogeneity in
      mouse early embryos, Epi stem cells (EpiSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
      CLEVER-seq of mouse early embryos also reveals the highly patterned genomic
      distribution and parental-specific dynamics of 5fC during mouse early
      pre-implantation development. Integrated analysis demonstrates that promoter 5fC 
      production precedes the expression upregulation of a clear set of developmentally
      and metabolically critical genes. Collectively, our work reveals the dynamics of 
      active DNA demethylation during mouse pre-implantation development and provides
      an important resource for further functional studies of epigenetic reprogramming 
      in single cells.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck (HNSCC) is a common yet poorly
      understood cancer, with adverse clinical outcomes due to treatment resistance,
      recurrence, and metastasis. Putative cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been
      identified in HNSCC, and BMI1 expression has been linked to these phenotypes, but
      optimal treatment strategies to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance and
      eliminate metastases have not yet been identified. Here we show through lineage
      tracing and genetic ablation that BMI1(+) CSCs mediate invasive growth and
      cervical lymph node metastasis in a mouse model of HNSCC. This model and primary 
      human HNSCC samples contain highly tumorigenic, invasive, and cisplatin-resistant
      BMI1(+) CSCs, which exhibit increased AP-1 activity that drives invasive growth
      and metastasis of HNSCC. Inhibiting AP-1 or BMI1 sensitized tumors to
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and it eliminated lymph node metastases by
      targeting CSCs and the tumor bulk, suggesting potential regimens to overcome
      resistance to treatments and eradicate HNSCC metastasis.

AB  - Poised enhancers marked by H3K27me3 in pluripotent stem cells have been
      implicated in the establishment of somatic expression programs during embryonic
      stem cell (ESC) differentiation. However, the functional relevance and mechanism 
      of action of poised enhancers remain unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to
      engineer precise genetic deletions, we demonstrate that poised enhancers are
      necessary for the induction of major anterior neural regulators. Interestingly,
      circularized chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) shows that
      poised enhancers already establish physical interactions with their target genes 
      in ESCs in a polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Loss of PRC2 
      does not activate poised enhancers or induce their putative target genes in
      undifferentiated ESCs; however, loss of PRC2 in differentiating ESCs severely and
      specifically compromises the induction of major anterior neural genes
      representing poised enhancer targets. Overall, our work illuminates an unexpected
      function for polycomb proteins in facilitating neural induction by endowing major
      anterior neural loci with a permissive regulatory topology.

      Bone Marrow via a Glucocorticoid Signaling Relay.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are mobilized from niches in the bone marrow (BM)
      to the blood circulation by the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) through complex mechanisms. Among these, signals from the sympathetic
      nervous system regulate HSC egress via its niche, but how the brain communicates 
      with the BM remains largely unknown. Here we show that muscarinic receptor type-1
      (Chrm1) signaling in the hypothalamus promotes G-CSF-elicited HSC mobilization
      via hormonal priming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Blockade
      of Chrm1 in the CNS, but not the periphery, reduces HSC mobilization.
      Mobilization is impaired in Chrm1(--) mice and rescued by parabiosis with
      wild-type mice, suggesting a relay by a blood-borne factor. We have identified
      the glucocorticoid (GC) hormones as critical for optimal mobilization.
      Physiological levels of corticosterone promote HSC migration via the GC receptor 
      Nr3c1-dependent signaling and upregulation of actin-organizing molecules. These
      results uncover long-range regulation of HSC migration emerging from the brain.

TI  - Genome Editing in hPSCs Reveals GATA6 Haploinsufficiency and a Genetic

AB  - Human disease phenotypes associated with haploinsufficient gene requirements are 
      often not recapitulated well in animal models. Here, we have investigated the
      association between human GATA6 haploinsufficiency and a wide range of clinical
      phenotypes that include neonatal and adult-onset diabetes using CRISPR (clustered
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas9-mediated genome editing
      coupled with human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) directed differentiation. We
      found that loss of one GATA6 allele specifically affects the differentiation of
      human pancreatic progenitors from the early PDX1+ stage to the more mature
      PDX1+NKX6.1+ stage, leading to impaired formation of glucose-responsive beta-like
      cells. In addition to this GATA6 haploinsufficiency, we also identified
      dosage-sensitive requirements for GATA6 and GATA4 in the formation of both
      definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells. Our work expands the
      application of hPSCs from studying the impact of individual gene loci to
      investigation of multigenic human traits, and it establishes an approach for
      identifying genetic modifiers of human disease.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations frequently cause neurological diseases.
      Modeling of these defects has been difficult because of the challenges associated
      with engineering mtDNA. We show here that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived 
      from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain the parental mtDNA
      profile and exhibit a metabolic switch toward oxidative phosphorylation. NPCs
      derived in this way from patients carrying a deleterious homoplasmic mutation in 
      the mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6 (m.9185T>C) showed defective ATP production and
      abnormally high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), plus altered calcium
      homeostasis, which represents a potential cause of neural impairment.
      High-content screening of FDA-approved drugs using the MMP phenotype highlighted 
      avanafil, which we found was able to partially rescue the calcium defect in
      patient NPCs and differentiated neurons. Overall, our results show that
      iPSC-derived NPCs provide an effective model for drug screening to target mtDNA
      disorders that affect the nervous system.

AB  - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE), a cell monolayer essential for photoreceptor survival, and is the leading 
      cause of vision loss in the elderly. There are no disease-altering therapies for 
      dry AMD, which is characterized by accumulation of subretinal drusen deposits and
      complement-driven inflammation. We report the derivation of human-induced
      pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients with diagnosed AMD, including two
      donors with the rare ARMS2/HTRA1 homozygous genotype. The hiPSC-derived RPE cells
      produce several AMD/drusen-related proteins, and those from the AMD donors show
      significantly increased complement and inflammatory factors, which are most
      exaggerated in the ARMS2/HTRA1 lines. Using a panel of AMD biomarkers and
      candidate drug screening, combined with transcriptome analysis, we discover that 
      nicotinamide (NAM) ameliorated disease-related phenotypes by inhibiting drusen
      proteins and inflammatory and complement factors while upregulating nucleosome,
      ribosome, and chromatin-modifying genes. Thus, targeting NAM-regulated pathways
      is a promising avenue for developing therapeutics to combat AMD.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have struggled to identify functional genes and
      variants underlying complex phenotypes. We recruited a multi-ethnic cohort of
      healthy volunteers (n = 91) and used their tissue to generate induced pluripotent
      stem cells (iPSCs) and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) for genome-wide mapping of
      expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and allele-specific expression (ASE). 
      We identified many eQTL genes (eGenes) not observed in the comparably sized
      Genotype-Tissue Expression project's human liver cohort (n = 96). Focusing on
      blood lipid-associated loci, we performed massively parallel reporter assays to
      screen candidate functional variants and used genome-edited stem cells, CRISPR
      interference, and mouse modeling to establish rs2277862-CPNE1, rs10889356-DOCK7, 
      rs10889356-ANGPTL3, and rs10872142-FRK as functional SNP-gene sets. We
      demonstrated HLC eGenes CPNE1, VKORC1, UBE2L3, and ANGPTL3 and HLC ASE gene ACAA2
      to be lipid-functional genes in mouse models. These findings endorse an
      iPSC-based experimental framework to discover functional variants and genes
      contributing to complex human traits.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted a large number of genetic
      variants with potential disease association, but functional analysis remains a
      challenge. Here we describe an approach to functionally validate identified
      variants through differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to
      study cellular pathophysiology. We collected peripheral blood cells from
      Framingham Heart Study participants and reprogrammed them to iPSCs. We then
      differentiated 68 iPSC lines into hepatocytes and adipocytes to investigate the
      effect of the 1p13 rs12740374 variant on cardiometabolic disease phenotypes via
      transcriptomics and metabolomic signatures. We observed a clear association
      between rs12740374 and lipid accumulation and gene expression in differentiated
      hepatocytes, in particular, expression of SORT1, CELSR2, and PSRC1, consistent
      with previous analyses of this variant using other approaches. Initial
      investigation of additional SNPs also highlighted correlations with gene
      expression. These findings suggest that iPSC-based population studies hold
      promise as tools for the functional validation of GWAS variants.

AB  - In this study, we used whole-genome sequencing and gene expression profiling of
      215 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from different donors to
      identify genetic variants associated with RNA expression for 5,746 genes. We were
      able to predict causal variants for these expression quantitative trait loci
      (eQTLs) that disrupt transcription factor binding and validated a subset of them 
      experimentally. We also identified copy-number variant (CNV) eQTLs, including
      some that appear to affect gene expression by altering the copy number of
      intergenic regulatory regions. In addition, we were able to identify effects on
      gene expression of rare genic CNVs and regulatory single-nucleotide variants and 
      found that reactivation of gene expression on the X chromosome depends on gene
      chromosomal position. Our work highlights the value of iPSCs for genetic
      association analyses and provides a unique resource for investigating the genetic
      regulation of gene expression in pluripotent cells.

TI  - Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human iPSCs Associates with MYC-Binding Motifs in a
      Clone-Specific Manner Independent of Genetics.

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show variable methylation patterns between
      lines, some of which reflect aberrant differences relative to embryonic stem
      cells (ESCs). To examine whether this aberrant methylation results from genetic
      variation or non-genetic mechanisms, we generated human iPSCs from monozygotic
      twins to investigate how genetic background, clone, and passage number
      contribute. We found that aberrantly methylated CpGs are enriched in regulatory
      regions associated with MYC protein motifs and affect gene expression. We
      classified differentially methylated CpGs as being associated with genetic and/or
      non-genetic factors (clone and passage), and we found that aberrant methylation
      preferentially occurs at CpGs associated with clone-specific effects. We further 
      found that clone-specific effects play a strong role in recurrent aberrant
      methylation at specific CpG sites across different studies. Our results argue
      that a non-genetic biological mechanism underlies aberrant methylation in iPSCs
      and that it is likely based on a probabilistic process involving MYC that takes
      place during or shortly after reprogramming.

AB  - Efforts to identify pharmaceuticals to treat heritable metabolic liver diseases
      have been hampered by the lack of models. However, cells with hepatocyte
      characteristics can be produced from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
      Here, we have used hepatocyte-like cells generated from homozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) iPSCs to identify drugs that can potentially be
      repurposed to lower serum LDL-C. We found that cardiac glycosides reduce the
      production of apolipoprotein B (apoB) from human hepatocytes in culture and the
      serum of avatar mice harboring humanized livers. The drugs act by increasing the 
      turnover of apoB protein. Analyses of patient medical records revealed that the
      treatment of patients with cardiac glycosides reduced serum LDL-C levels. These
      studies highlight the effectiveness of using iPSCs to screen for potential
      treatments for inborn errors of hepatic metabolism and suggest that cardiac
      glycosides could provide an approach for reducing hepatocyte production of apoB
      and treating hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Although prematurely baptized as non-coding, some lncRNAs encode polypeptides
      with regulatory functions that are implicated in various biological processes.
      Matsumoto et al. (2017) recently report in Nature that LINC00961 generates SPAR
      polypeptide that acts via the lysosome to suppress amino-acid-mediated mTORC1
      activity, thereby modulating skeletal muscle regenerative response following
      injury.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable brain cancer that presents a strongly
      immunosuppressive microenvironment. Alvarado et al. (2016) now report that GBM
      cancer stem cells (CSCs) downregulate Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 to evade immune 
      suppression, and that activating downstream TLR signaling pathways can reduce
      tumor growth and disrupt CSC self-renewal.

TI  - Human iPSC-Derived Cerebral Organoids Model Cellular Features of Lissencephaly
      and Reveal Prolonged Mitosis of Outer Radial Glia.

AB  - Classical lissencephaly is a genetic neurological disorder associated with mental
      retardation and intractable epilepsy, and Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is the
      most severe form of the disease. In this study, to investigate the effects of MDS
      on human progenitor subtypes that control neuronal output and influence brain
      topology, we analyzed cerebral organoids derived from control and MDS-induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using time-lapse imaging, immunostaining, and
      single-cell RNA sequencing. We saw a cell migration defect that was rescued when 
      we corrected the MDS causative chromosomal deletion and severe apoptosis of the
      founder neuroepithelial stem cells, accompanied by increased horizontal cell
      divisions. We also identified a mitotic defect in outer radial glia, a progenitor
      subtype that is largely absent from lissencephalic rodents but critical for human
      neocortical expansion. Our study, therefore, deepens our understanding of MDS
      cellular pathogenesis and highlights the broad utility of cerebral organoids for 
      modeling human neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - RNA Helicase DDX5 Inhibits Reprogramming to Pluripotency by miRNA-Based
      Repression of RYBP and its PRC1-Dependent and -Independent Functions.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), in addition to their functions in cellular
      homeostasis, play important roles in lineage specification and maintaining
      cellular identity. Despite their diverse and essential functions, which touch on 
      nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism, the roles of RBPs in somatic cell
      reprogramming are poorly understood. Here we show that the DEAD-box RBP DDX5
      inhibits reprogramming by repressing the expression and function of the
      non-canonical polycomb complex 1 (PRC1) subunit RYBP. Disrupting Ddx5 expression 
      improves the efficiency of iPSC generation and impedes processing of miR-125b,
      leading to Rybp upregulation and suppression of lineage-specific genes via
      RYBP-dependent ubiquitination of H2AK119. Furthermore, RYBP is required for
      PRC1-independent recruitment of OCT4 to the promoter of Kdm2b, a histone
      demethylase gene that promotes reprogramming by reactivating endogenous
      pluripotency genes. Together, these results reveal important functions of DDX5 in
      regulating reprogramming and highlight the importance of a Ddx5-miR125b-Rybp axis
      in controlling cell fate.

AB  - Tumors contain hostile inflammatory signals generated by aberrant proliferation, 
      necrosis, and hypoxia. These signals are sensed and acted upon acutely by the
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to halt proliferation and activate an immune response.
      Despite the presence of TLR ligands within the microenvironment, tumors progress,
      and the mechanisms that permit this growth remain largely unknown. We report that
      self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma have low TLR4 expression
      that allows them to survive by disregarding inflammatory signals. Non-CSCs
      express high levels of TLR4 and respond to ligands. TLR4 signaling suppresses CSC
      properties by reducing retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RBBP5), which is
      elevated in CSCs. RBBP5 activates core stem cell transcription factors, is
      necessary and sufficient for self-renewal, and is suppressed by TLR4
      overexpression in CSCs. Our findings provide a mechanism through which CSCs
      persist in hostile environments because of an inability to respond to
      inflammatory signals.

TI  - Analysis of Transcriptional Variability in a Large Human iPSC Library Reveals
      Genetic and Non-genetic Determinants of Heterogeneity.

AB  - Variability in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines remains a concern for
      disease modeling and regenerative medicine. We have used RNA-sequencing analysis 
      and linear mixed models to examine the sources of gene expression variability in 
      317 human iPSC lines from 101 individuals. We found that approximately 50% of
      genome-wide expression variability is explained by variation across individuals
      and identified a set of expression quantitative trait loci that contribute to
      this variation. These analyses coupled with allele-specific expression show that 
      iPSCs retain a donor-specific gene expression pattern. Network, pathway, and key 
      driver analyses showed that Polycomb targets contribute significantly to the
      non-genetic variability seen within and across individuals, highlighting this
      chromatin regulator as a likely source of reprogramming-based variability. Our
      findings therefore shed light on variation between iPSC lines and illustrate the 
      potential for our dataset and other similar large-scale analyses to identify
      underlying drivers relevant to iPSC applications.

TI  - Patient-Specific iPSC-Derived Endothelial Cells Uncover Pathways that Protect

AB  - In familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH), the autosomal dominant
      disease-causing BMPR2 mutation is only 20% penetrant, suggesting that genetic
      variation provides modifiers that alleviate the disease. Here, we used comparison
      of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) from three 
      families with unaffected mutation carriers (UMCs), FPAH patients, and
      gender-matched controls to investigate this variation. Our analysis identified
      features of UMC iPSC-ECs related to modifiers of BMPR2 signaling or to
      differentially expressed genes. FPAH-iPSC-ECs showed reduced adhesion, survival, 
      migration, and angiogenesis compared to UMC-iPSC-ECs and control cells. The
      "rescued" phenotype of UMC cells was related to an increase in specific BMPR2
      activators and/or a reduction in inhibitors, and the improved cell adhesion could
      be attributed to preservation of related signaling. The improved survival was
      related to increased BIRC3 and was independent of BMPR2. Our findings therefore
      highlight protective modifiers for FPAH that could help inform development of
      future treatment strategies.

AB  - Myeloid malignancies exist on a spectrum from asymptomatic clonal hematopoiesis
      to overt leukemia and exhibit substantial clonal heterogeneity. Both aspects are 
      challenging to capture in experimental models. In two landmark studies in this
      issue of Cell Stem Cell, Kotini et al. (2017) and Chao et al. (2017) establish
      iPSC-based experimental platforms that recapitulate disease stages and clonal
      architecture.

AB  - For almost a decade, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were believed to reside as
      perivascular cells in vivo. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Guimaraes-Camboa et 
      al. (2017) challenge this idea and use lineage tracing to demonstrate that
      perivascular cells do not behave as tissue-specific progenitors in various
      organs, despite showing MSC potential in vitro.

AB  - The mammalian cortex develops in an "inside-out" manner, as neural stem and
      progenitor cells lining the ventricles build the brain from within. Bifari et al.
      (2017), in this issue of Cell Stem Cell, find a small set of cortical neurons
      that appear to originate from radial glia-like progenitors in the meninges,
      suggesting an outside-in contribution to corticogenesis.

AB  - Myeloid malignancy is increasingly viewed as a disease spectrum, comprising
      hematopoietic disorders that extend across a phenotypic continuum ranging from
      clonal hematopoiesis to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML). In this study, we derived a collection of induced pluripotent stem cell
      (iPSC) lines capturing a range of disease stages encompassing preleukemia,
      low-risk MDS, high-risk MDS, and secondary AML. Upon their differentiation, we
      found hematopoietic phenotypes of graded severity and/or stage specificity that
      together delineate a phenotypic roadmap of disease progression culminating in
      serially transplantable leukemia. We also show that disease stage transitions,
      both reversal and progression, can be modeled in this system using genetic
      correction or introduction of mutations via CRISPR/Cas9 and that this iPSC-based 
      approach can be used to uncover disease-stage-specific responses to drugs. Our
      study therefore provides insight into the cellular events demarcating the
      initiation and progression of myeloid transformation and a new platform for
      testing genetic and pharmacological interventions.

TI  - Recent Zika Virus Isolates Induce Premature Differentiation of Neural Progenitors

AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with microcephaly in
      newborns. Although the connection between ZIKV and neurodevelopmental defects is 
      widely recognized, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show 
      that two recently isolated strains of ZIKV, an American strain from an infected
      fetal brain (FB-GWUH-2016) and a closely-related Asian strain (H/PF/2013),
      productively infect human iPSC-derived brain organoids. Both of these strains
      readily target to and replicate in proliferating ventricular zone (VZ) apical
      progenitors. The main phenotypic effect was premature differentiation of neural
      progenitors associated with centrosome perturbation, even during early stages of 
      infection, leading to progenitor depletion, disruption of the VZ, impaired
      neurogenesis, and cortical thinning. The infection pattern and cellular outcome
      differ from those seen with the extensively passaged ZIKV strain MR766. The
      structural changes we see after infection with these more recently isolated viral
      strains closely resemble those seen in ZIKV-associated microcephaly.

AB  - Pericytes are widely believed to function as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
      multipotent tissue-resident progenitors with great potential for regenerative
      medicine. Cultured pericytes isolated from distinct tissues can differentiate
      into multiple cell types in vitro or following transplantation in vivo. However, 
      the cell fate plasticity of endogenous pericytes in vivo remains unclear. Here,
      we show that the transcription factor Tbx18 selectively marks pericytes and
      vascular smooth muscle cells in multiple organs of adult mouse.
      Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified Tbx18-expressing cells
      behaved as MSCs in vitro. However, lineage-tracing experiments using an inducible
      Tbx18-CreERT2 line revealed that pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells
      maintained their identity in aging and diverse pathological settings and did not 
      significantly contribute to other cell lineages. These results challenge the
      current view of endogenous pericytes as multipotent tissue-resident progenitors
      and suggest that the plasticity observed in vitro or following transplantation in
      vivo arises from artificial cell manipulations ex vivo.

AB  - Loss of photoreceptors is a common endpoint in degenerative retinal diseases.
      Human pluripotent stem cells provide a potential source for photoreceptor
      replacement, but, even in mouse models, the efficiency and efficacy of
      transplantation-based repair remains poor. In this study, we examined the degree 
      to which immune rejection contributes to these disappointing outcomes using an
      immunodeficient IL2 receptor gamma (IL2rgamma)-null mouse model. Our results show
      that prevention of cell rejection in the normal and degenerating retinal
      environment significantly improves long-term survival and integration of
      hESC-derived donor retinal cells. Transplanted cells are able to differentiate
      into mature photoreceptors expressing various opsins and can functionally
      integrate into congenitally blind mice. Our work suggests that even though the
      retina is often considered immune-privileged, suppression of host immune-mediated
      cell rejection may well be a useful approach for improving long-term integration 
      of transplanted cells with a view to successful clinical outcomes.

AB  - Understanding the relative contributions of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities 
      to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) should assist integrated design of targeted
      therapies. In this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
      from AML patient samples harboring MLL rearrangements and found that they
      retained leukemic mutations but reset leukemic DNA methylation/gene expression
      patterns. AML-iPSCs lacked leukemic potential, but when differentiated into
      hematopoietic cells, they reacquired the ability to give rise to leukemia in vivo
      and reestablished leukemic DNA methylation/gene expression patterns, including an
      aberrant MLL signature. Epigenetic reprogramming was therefore not sufficient to 
      eliminate leukemic behavior. This approach also allowed us to study the
      properties of distinct AML subclones, including differential drug
      susceptibilities of KRAS mutant and wild-type cells, and predict relapse based on
      increased cytarabine resistance of a KRAS wild-type subclone. Overall, our
      findings illustrate the value of AML-iPSCs for investigating the mechanistic
      basis and clonal properties of human AML.

AB  - An expansion of the cerebral neocortex is thought to be the foundation for the
      unique intellectual abilities of humans. It has been suggested that an increase
      in the proliferative potential of neural progenitors (NPs) underlies the
      expansion of the cortex and its convoluted appearance. Here we show that
      increasing NP proliferation induces expansion and folding in an in vitro model of
      human corticogenesis. Deletion of PTEN stimulates proliferation and generates
      significantly larger and substantially folded cerebral organoids. This genetic
      modification allows sustained cell cycle re-entry, expansion of the progenitor
      population, and delayed neuronal differentiation, all key features of the
      developing human cortex. In contrast, Pten deletion in mouse organoids does not
      lead to folding. Finally, we utilized the expanded cerebral organoids to show
      that infection with Zika virus impairs cortical growth and folding. Our study
      provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating the structure and
      organization of the human cortex.

AB  - Lack of sensitive single-cell analysis tools has limited the characterization of 
      metabolic activity in cancer stem cells. By hyperspectral-stimulated Raman
      scattering imaging of single living cells and mass spectrometry analysis of
      extracted lipids, we report here significantly increased levels of unsaturated
      lipids in ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) as compared to non-CSCs. Higher lipid 
      unsaturation levels were also detected in CSC-enriched spheroids compared to
      monolayer cultures of ovarian cancer cell lines or primary cells. Inhibition of
      lipid desaturases effectively eliminated CSCs, suppressed sphere formation in
      vitro, and blocked tumor initiation capacity in vivo. Mechanistically, we
      demonstrate that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) directly regulates the
      expression levels of lipid desaturases, and inhibition of desaturases blocks
      NF-kappaB signaling. Collectively, our findings reveal that increased lipid
      unsaturation is a metabolic marker for ovarian CSCs and a target for CSC-specific
      therapy.

AB  - In vivo reprogramming is a promising approach for tissue regeneration in response
      to injury. Several examples of in vivo reprogramming have been reported in a
      variety of lineages, but some including skeletal muscle have so far proven
      refractory. Here, we show that acute and chronic injury enables
      transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming in skeletal muscle. Lineage tracing
      indicates that this response frequently originates from Pax7+ muscle stem cells. 
      Injury is associated with accumulation of senescent cells, and advanced aging or 
      local irradiation further enhanced in vivo reprogramming, while selective
      elimination of senescent cells reduced reprogramming efficiency. The effect of
      senescence appears to be, at least in part, due to the release of interleukin 6
      (IL-6), suggesting a potential link with the senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype. Collectively, our findings highlight a beneficial paracrine effect of 
      injury-induced senescence on cellular plasticity, which will be important for
      devising strategies for reprogramming-based tissue repair.

AB  - Whether new neurons are added in the postnatal cerebral cortex is still debated. 
      Here, we report that the meninges of perinatal mice contain a population of
      neurogenic progenitors formed during embryonic development that migrate to the
      caudal cortex and differentiate into Satb2(+) neurons in cortical layers II-IV.
      The resulting neurons are electrically functional and integrated into local
      microcircuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified meningeal cells with
      distinct transcriptome signatures characteristic of (1) neurogenic radial
      glia-like cells (resembling neural stem cells in the SVZ), (2) neuronal cells,
      and (3) a cell type with an intermediate phenotype, possibly representing radial 
      glia-like meningeal cells differentiating to neuronal cells. Thus, we have
      identified a pool of embryonically derived radial glia-like cells present in the 
      meninges that migrate and differentiate into functional neurons in the neonatal
      cerebral cortex.

AB  - Recent advances in our understanding of tissue regeneration and the development
      of efficient approaches to induce and differentiate pluripotent stem cells for
      cell replacement therapies promise exciting avenues for treating degenerative
      age-related diseases. However, clinical studies and insights from model organisms
      have identified major roadblocks that normal aging processes impose on tissue
      regeneration. These new insights suggest that specific targeting of environmental
      niche components, including growth factors, ECM, and immune cells, and intrinsic 
      stem cell properties that are affected by aging will be critical for the
      development of new strategies to improve stem cell function and optimize tissue
      repair processes.

AB  - A defining characteristic of diverse stem cell populations is their distinct
      metabolic state, although how these states change during adult hippocampal
      neurogenesis is unclear. Recently in Neuron, Beckervordersandforth et al. (2017) 
      report that adult neurogenesis requires mitochondrial electron transport and
      oxidative phosphorylation and that disrupting these pathways induces premature
      aging phenotypes.

      Stem Cell, using murine intestinal organoids, Basak et al. (2017) induce stem

AB  - Whether invasive tumor phenotypes like EMT arise from oncogenic drivers or from
      priming of the pre-tumor cell of origin remains unknown. In this issue of Cell
      Stem Cell, Latil et al. (2017) show that the pre-tumor niche establishes a
      chromatin state predisposing squamous cell carcinomas to undergo EMT and
      metastasis, suggesting that the pre-tumor epigenome has prognostic value.

TI  - A Quiescent Bcl11b High Stem Cell Population Is Required for Maintenance of the
      Mammary Gland.

AB  - Stem cells in many tissues sustain themselves by entering a quiescent state to
      avoid genomic insults and to prevent exhaustion caused by excessive
      proliferation. In the mammary gland, the identity and characteristics of
      quiescent epithelial stem cells are not clear. Here, we identify a quiescent
      mammary epithelial cell population expressing high levels of Bcl11b and located
      at the interface between luminal and basal cells. Bcl11b(high) cells are enriched
      for cells that can regenerate mammary glands in secondary transplants. Loss of
      Bcl11b leads to a Cdkn2a-dependent exhaustion of ductal epithelium and loss of
      epithelial cell regenerative capacity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show
      that Bcl11b induces cells to enter the G0 phase of the cell cycle and become
      quiescent. Taken together, these results suggest that Bcl11b acts as a central
      intrinsic regulator of mammary epithelial stem cell quiescence and exhaustion and
      is necessary for long-term maintenance of the mammary gland.

AB  - Glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor, is propagated
      by stem-like cancer cells refractory to existing therapies. Understanding the
      molecular mechanisms that control glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) proliferation and 
      drug resistance may reveal opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Here we
      show that GSCs can reversibly transition to a slow-cycling, persistent state in
      response to targeted kinase inhibitors. In this state, GSCs upregulate primitive 
      developmental programs and are dependent upon Notch signaling. This transition is
      accompanied by widespread redistribution of repressive histone methylation.
      Accordingly, persister GSCs upregulate, and are dependent on, the histone
      demethylases KDM6A/B. Slow-cycling cells with high Notch activity and histone
      demethylase expression are present in primary glioblastomas before treatment,
      potentially contributing to relapse. Our findings illustrate how cancer cells may
      hijack aspects of native developmental programs for deranged proliferation,
      adaptation, and tolerance. They also suggest strategies for eliminating
      refractory tumor cells by targeting epigenetic and developmental pathways.

AB  - Lgr5+ adult intestinal stem cells are highly proliferative throughout life.
      Single Lgr5+ stem cells can be cultured into three-dimensional organoids
      containing all intestinal epithelial cell types at near-normal ratios. Conditions
      to generate the main cell types (enterocyte, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M
      cells) are well established, but signals to induce the spectrum of
      hormone-producing enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have remained elusive. Here, we
      induce Lgr5+ stem cell quiescence in vitro by blocking epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) or mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in
      organoids and show that their quiescent state is readily reverted. Quiescent
      Lgr5+ stem cells acquire a distinct molecular signature biased toward EEC
      differentiation. Indeed, combined inhibition of Wnt, Notch, and MAPK pathways
      efficiently generates a diversity of EEC hormone-expressing subtypes in vitro.
      Our observations uncouple Wnt-dependent stem cell maintenance from EGF-dependent 
      proliferation and provide an approach for the study of the elusive EECs in a
      defined environment.

AB  - Direct cell programming via overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) aims to
      control cell fate with the degree of precision needed for clinical applications. 
      However, the regulatory steps involved in successful terminal cell fate
      programming remain obscure. We have investigated the underlying mechanisms by
      looking at gene expression, chromatin states, and TF binding during the uniquely 
      efficient Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 motor neuron programming pathway. Our analysis
      reveals a highly dynamic process in which Ngn2 and the Isl1/Lhx3 pair initially
      engage distinct regulatory regions. Subsequently, Isl1/Lhx3 binding shifts from
      one set of targets to another, controlling regulatory region activity and gene
      expression as cell differentiation progresses. Binding of Isl1/Lhx3 to later
      motor neuron enhancers depends on the Ebf and Onecut TFs, which are induced by
      Ngn2 during the programming process. Thus, motor neuron programming is the
      product of two initially independent transcriptional modules that converge with a
      feedforward transcriptional logic.

AB  - The chromatin landscape and cellular metabolism both contribute to cell fate
      determination, but their interplay remains poorly understood. Using genome-wide
      siRNA screening, we have identified prohibitin (PHB) as an essential factor in
      self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Mechanistically, PHB forms
      protein complexes with HIRA, a histone H3.3 chaperone, and stabilizes the protein
      levels of HIRA complex components. Like PHB, HIRA is required for hESC
      self-renewal. PHB and HIRA act together to control global deposition of histone
      H3.3 and gene expression in hESCs. Of particular note, PHB and HIRA regulate the 
      chromatin architecture at the promoters of isocitrate dehydrogenase genes to
      promote transcription and, thus, production of alpha-ketoglutarate, a key
      metabolite in the regulation of ESC fate. Our study shows that PHB has an
      unexpected nuclear role in hESCs that is required for self-renewal and that it
      acts with HIRA in chromatin organization to link epigenetic organization to a
      metabolic circuit.

AB  - Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells has been associated
      with metastasis, stemness, and resistance to therapy. Some tumors undergo EMT
      while others do not, which may reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of
      origin. However, this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same
      oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show that
      cell-type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime
      tumors to EMT. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from interfollicular
      epidermis (IFE) are generally well differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem 
      cell-derived SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors, and 
      possess increased metastatic potential. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling 
      revealed that IFE and HF tumor-initiating cells possess distinct chromatin
      landscapes and gene regulatory networks associated with tumorigenesis and EMT
      that correlate with accessibility of key epithelial and EMT transcription factor 
      binding sites. These findings highlight the importance of chromatin states and
      transcriptional priming in dictating tumor phenotypes and EMT.

AB  - Mammalian tissues calcify with age and injury. Analogous to bone formation,
      osteogenic cells are thought to be recruited to the affected tissue and induce
      mineralization. In the heart, calcification of cardiac muscle leads to conduction
      system disturbances and is one of the most common pathologies underlying heart
      blocks. However the cell identity and mechanisms contributing to pathological
      heart muscle calcification remain unknown. Using lineage tracing, murine models
      of heart calcification and in vivo transplantation assays, we show that cardiac
      fibroblasts (CFs) adopt an osteoblast cell-like fate and contribute directly to
      heart muscle calcification. Small-molecule inhibition of ENPP1, an enzyme that is
      induced upon injury and regulates bone mineralization, significantly attenuated
      cardiac calcification. Inhibitors of bone mineralization completely prevented
      ectopic cardiac calcification and improved post injury heart function. Taken
      together, these findings highlight the plasticity of fibroblasts in contributing 
      to ectopic calcification and identify pharmacological targets for therapeutic
      development.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of progressive interstitial lung
      disease with unknown etiology. Due to a lack of effective treatment, IPF is
      associated with a high mortality rate. The hallmark feature of this disease is
      the accumulation of activated myofibroblasts that excessively deposit
      extracellular matrix proteins, thus compromising lung architecture and function
      and hindering gas exchange. Here we investigated the origin of activated
      myofibroblasts and the molecular mechanisms governing fibrosis formation and
      resolution. Genetic engineering in mice enables the time-controlled labeling and 
      monitoring of lipogenic or myogenic populations of lung fibroblasts during
      fibrosis formation and resolution. Our data demonstrate a lipogenic-to-myogenic
      switch in fibroblastic phenotype during fibrosis formation. Conversely, we
      observed a myogenic-to-lipogenic switch during fibrosis resolution. Analysis of
      human lung tissues and primary human lung fibroblasts indicates that this fate
      switching is involved in IPF pathogenesis, opening potential therapeutic avenues 
      to treat patients.

AB  - Stem cell engineering and grafting of mesencephalic dopamine (mesDA) neurons is a
      promising strategy for brain repair in Parkinson's disease (PD). Refinement of
      differentiation protocols to optimize this approach will require deeper
      understanding of mesDA neuron development. Here, we studied this process using
      transcriptome-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse neural progenitors
      expressing the mesDA neuron determinant Lmx1a. This approach resolved the
      differentiation of mesDA and neighboring neuronal lineages and revealed a
      remarkably close relationship between developing mesDA and subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) neurons, while also highlighting a distinct transcription factor set that
      can distinguish between them. While previous hESC mesDA differentiation protocols
      have relied on markers that are shared between the two lineages, we found that
      application of these highlighted markers can help to refine current stem cell
      engineering protocols, increasing the proportion of appropriately patterned mesDA
      progenitors. Our results, therefore, have important implications for cell
      replacement therapy in PD.

AB  - Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are expected to reach
      clinical trials soon. Most of the approaches currently under development involve 
      transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and 
      functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long-term graft outcome already
      at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach
      to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that
      correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through
      gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted human embryonic stem cell
      (hESC)-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly used markers did
      not accurately predict in vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we
      identified a specific set of markers associated with the caudal midbrain that
      correlate with high dopaminergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these
      markers, we developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) differentiation
      protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable
      dopamine progenitors from hESCs.

AB  - During human brain development, multiple signaling pathways generate diverse cell
      types with varied regional identities. Here, we integrate single-cell RNA
      sequencing and clonal analyses to reveal lineage trees and molecular signals
      underlying early forebrain and mid/hindbrain cell differentiation from human
      embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Clustering single-cell transcriptomic data
      identified 41 distinct populations of progenitor, neuronal, and non-neural cells 
      across our differentiation time course. Comparisons with primary mouse and human 
      gene expression data demonstrated rostral and caudal progenitor and neuronal
      identities from early brain development. Bayesian analyses inferred a unified
      cell-type lineage tree that bifurcates between cortical and mid/hindbrain cell
      types. Two methods of clonal analyses confirmed these findings and further
      revealed the importance of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in controlling this lineage
      decision. Together, these findings provide a rich transcriptome-based lineage map
      for studying human brain development and modeling developmental disorders.

AB  - Recently in Nature, Gjorevski et al. (2016) describe a fully defined synthetic
      hydrogel that mimics the extracellular matrix to support in vitro growth of
      intestinal stem cells and organoids. The hydrogel allows exquisite control over

AB  - Pathways underlying mouse embryonic development have always informed efforts to
      derive, maintain, and drive differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.
      However, direct application of mouse embryology to the human system has not
      always been successful because of fundamental developmental differences between
      species. The naive pluripotent state of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in
      particular, has been difficult to capture in human ESCs, and appears to be
      transitory in the human embryo itself. Further studies of human and non-human
      primate embryo development are needed to untangle the complexities of
      pluripotency networks across mammalian species.

AB  - Naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be derived from primed hESCs or
      directly from blastocysts, but their X chromosome state has remained unresolved. 
      Here, we show that the inactive X chromosome (Xi) of primed hESCs was reactivated
      in naive culture conditions. Like cells of the blastocyst, the resulting naive
      cells contained two active X chromosomes with XIST expression and chromosome-wide
      transcriptional dampening and initiated XIST-mediated X inactivation upon
      differentiation. Both establishment of and exit from the naive state
      (differentiation) happened via an XIST-negative XaXa intermediate. Together,
      these findings identify a cell culture system for functionally exploring the two 
      X chromosome dosage compensation processes in early human development: X
      dampening and X inactivation. However, remaining differences between naive hESCs 
      and embryonic cells related to mono-allelic XIST expression and non-random X
      inactivation highlight the need for further culture improvement. As the naive
      state resets Xi abnormalities seen in primed hESCs, it may provide cells better
      suited for downstream applications.

AB  - Sex chromosome dosage compensation is essential in most metazoans, but the
      developmental timing and underlying mechanisms vary significantly, even among
      placental mammals. Here we identify human-specific mechanisms regulating X
      chromosome activity in early embryonic development. Single-cell RNA sequencing
      and imaging revealed co-activation and accumulation of the long noncoding RNAs
      (lncRNAs) XACT and XIST on active X chromosomes in both early human
      pre-implantation embryos and naive human embryonic stem cells. In these contexts,
      the XIST RNA adopts an unusual, highly dispersed organization, which may explain 
      why it does not trigger X chromosome inactivation at this stage. Functional
      studies in transgenic mouse cells show that XACT influences XIST accumulation in 
      cis. Our findings therefore suggest a mechanism involving antagonistic activity
      of XIST and XACT in controlling X chromosome activity in early human embryos, and
      they highlight the contribution of rapidly evolving lncRNAs to species-specific
      developmental mechanisms.

TI  - The p53 Family Coordinates Wnt and Nodal Inputs in Mesendodermal Differentiation 
      of Embryonic Stem Cells.

AB  - In this study, we outline a regulatory network that involves the p53 tumor
      suppressor family and the Wnt pathway acting together with the TGF-beta pathway
      in mesendodermal differentiation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells.
      Knockout of all three members, p53, p63, and p73, shows that the p53 family is
      essential for mesendoderm specification during exit from pluripotency in embryos 
      and in culture. Wnt3 and its receptor Fzd1 are direct p53 family target genes in 
      this context, and induction of Wnt signaling by p53 is critical for activation of
      mesendodermal differentiation genes. Globally, Wnt3-activated Tcf3 and
      nodal-activated Smad2/3 transcription factors depend on each other for
      co-occupancy of target enhancers associated with key differentiation loci. Our
      results therefore highlight an unanticipated role for p53 family proteins in a
      regulatory network that integrates essential Wnt-Tcf and nodal-Smad inputs in a
      selective and interdependent way to drive mesendodermal differentiation of
      pluripotent cells.

AB  - Satellite cells, the predominant stem cell population in adult skeletal muscle,
      are activated in response to hypertrophic stimuli and give rise to myogenic
      progenitor cells (MPCs) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds
      myofibers. This ECM is composed largely of collagens secreted by interstitial
      fibrogenic cells, which influence satellite cell activity and muscle repair
      during hypertrophy and aging. Here we show that MPCs interact with interstitial
      fibrogenic cells to ensure proper ECM deposition and optimal muscle remodeling in
      response to hypertrophic stimuli. MPC-dependent ECM remodeling during the first
      week of a growth stimulus is sufficient to ensure long-term myofiber hypertrophy.
      MPCs secrete exosomes containing miR-206, which represses Rrbp1, a master
      regulator of collagen biosynthesis, in fibrogenic cells to prevent excessive ECM 
      deposition. These findings provide insights into how skeletal stem and progenitor
      cells interact with other cell types to actively regulate their extracellular
      environments for tissue maintenance and adaptation.

AB  - A challenge for advancing approaches to liver regeneration is loss of functional 
      differentiation capacity when hepatocyte progenitors are maintained in culture.
      Recent lineage-tracing studies have shown that mature hepatocytes (MHs) convert
      to an immature state during chronic liver injury, and we investigated whether
      this conversion could be recapitulated in vitro and whether such converted cells 
      could represent a source of expandable hepatocytes. We report that a cocktail of 
      small molecules, Y-27632, A-83-01, and CHIR99021, can convert rat and mouse MHs
      in vitro into proliferative bipotent cells, which we term chemically induced
      liver progenitors (CLiPs). CLiPs can differentiate into both MHs and biliary
      epithelial cells that can form functional ductal structures. CLiPs in long-term
      culture did not lose their proliferative capacity or their hepatic
      differentiation ability, and rat CLiPs were shown to extensively repopulate
      chronically injured liver tissue. Thus, our study advances the goals of liver
      regenerative medicine.

AB  - Oocyte defects lie at the heart of some forms of infertility and could
      potentially be addressed therapeutically by alternative routes for oocyte
      formation. Here, we describe the generation of functional human oocytes following
      nuclear transfer of first polar body (PB1) genomes from metaphase II (MII)
      oocytes into enucleated donor MII cytoplasm (PBNT). The reconstructed oocytes
      supported the formation of de novo meiotic spindles and, after fertilization with
      sperm, meiosis completion and formation of normal diploid zygotes. While PBNT
      zygotes developed to blastocysts less frequently (42%) than controls (75%),
      genome-wide genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analyses of PBNT and control
      ESCs indicated comparable numbers of structural variations and markedly similar
      DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles. We conclude that rescue of PB1
      genetic material via introduction into donor cytoplasm may offer a source of
      oocytes for infertility treatment or mitochondrial replacement therapy for mtDNA 
      disease.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) can cross the placental barrier, resulting in infection of the 
      fetal brain and neurological defects including microcephaly. The cellular tropism
      of ZIKV and the identity of attachment factors used by the virus to gain access
      to key cell types involved in pathogenesis are under intense investigation.
      Initial studies suggested that ZIKV preferentially targets neural progenitor
      cells (NPCs), providing an explanation for the developmental phenotypes observed 
      in some pregnancies. The AXL protein has been nominated as a key attachment
      factor for ZIKV in several cell types including NPCs. However, here we show that 
      genetic ablation of AXL has no effect on ZIKV entry or ZIKV-mediated cell death
      in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs or cerebral organoids.
      These findings call into question the utility of AXL inhibitors for preventing
      birth defects after infection and suggest that further studies of viral
      attachment factors in NPCs are needed.

AB  - The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its suspected link with various
      disorders in newborns and adults led the World Health Organization to declare a
      global health emergency. In response, the stem cell field quickly established
      platforms for modeling ZIKV exposure using human pluripotent stem cell-derived
      neural progenitors and brain organoids, fetal tissues, and animal models. These
      efforts provided significant insight into cellular targets, pathogenesis, and
      underlying biological mechanisms of ZIKV infection as well as platforms for drug 
      testing. Here we review the remarkable progress in stem cell-based ZIKV research 
      and discuss current challenges and future opportunities.

AB  - Feedback signals from daughter cells to stem cells are well studied and known to 
      provide important feedback cues. Emerging evidence shows that stem cells also
      send feedforward signals to their progeny. Complex circuits involving both
      negative and positive feedback and feedforward signals likely contribute to
      robust tissue maintenance and regeneration.

AB  - It is necessary to employ myeloablative irradiation or chemotherapy to deplete
      the HSC niche to optimize hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In a recent
      issue of Science, Taya and colleagues provide evidence for an alternative to the 
      toxic chemoirradiative procedure by showing that a valine-restricted diet is
      sufficient to empty the bone marrow niche.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cells in a differentiation
      process that involves widespread epigenome remodeling. Here we present
      genome-wide reference maps of the associated DNA methylation dynamics. We used a 
      meta-epigenomic approach that combines DNA methylation profiles across many small
      pools of cells and performed single-cell methylome sequencing to assess
      cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The resulting dataset identified characteristic
      differences between HSCs derived from fetal liver, cord blood, bone marrow, and
      peripheral blood. We also observed lineage-specific DNA methylation between
      myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, characterized immature multi-lymphoid
      progenitors, and detected progressive DNA methylation differences in maturing
      megakaryocytes. We linked these patterns to gene expression, histone
      modifications, and chromatin accessibility, and we used machine learning to
      derive a model of human hematopoietic differentiation directly from DNA
      methylation data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human
      hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and provide a framework for studying
      blood-linked diseases.

AB  - Tissue growth and maintenance requires stem cell populations that self-renew,
      proliferate, and differentiate. Maintenance of white adipose tissue (WAT)
      requires the proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) to 
      form postmitotic, lipid-filled mature adipocytes. Here we use the dynamic
      adipogenic program that occurs during hair growth to uncover an unrecognized
      regulator of ASC self-renewal and proliferation, PDGFA, which activates AKT
      signaling to drive and maintain the adipogenic program in the skin. Pdgfa
      expression is reduced in aged ASCs and is required for ASC proliferation and
      maintenance in the dermis, but not in other WATs. Our molecular and genetic
      studies uncover PI3K/AKT2 as a direct PDGFA target that is activated in ASCs
      during WAT hyperplasia and is functionally required for dermal ASC proliferation.
      Our data therefore reveal active mechanisms that regulate ASC self-renewal in the
      skin and show that distinct regulatory mechanisms operate in different WAT
      depots.

AB  - The generation of distinct hematopoietic cell types, including tissue-resident
      immune cells, distinguishes fetal from adult hematopoiesis. However, the
      mechanisms underlying differential cell production to generate a layered immune
      system during hematopoietic development are unclear. Using an irreversible
      lineage-tracing model, we identify a definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      that supports long-term multilineage reconstitution upon transplantation into
      adult recipients but does not persist into adulthood in situ. These HSCs are
      fully multipotent, yet they display both higher lymphoid cell production and
      greater capacity to generate innate-like B and T lymphocytes as compared to
      coexisting fetal HSCs and adult HSCs. Thus, these developmentally restricted HSCs
      (drHSCs) define the origin and generation of early lymphoid cells that play
      essential roles in establishing self-recognition and tolerance, with important
      implications for understanding autoimmune disease, allergy, and rejection of
      transplanted organs.

AB  - Mouse mutants with an impaired DNA damage response frequently exhibit a set of
      remarkably similar defects in the HSPC compartment that are of largely unknown
      molecular basis. Using Mixed-Lineage-Leukemia-5 (Mll5)-deficient mice as
      prototypical examples, we have identified a mechanistic pathway linking DNA
      damage and HSPC malfunction. We show that Mll5 deficiency results in accumulation
      of DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HSPCs. Reduction of ROS
      efficiently reverses hematopoietic defects, establishing ROS as a major cause of 
      impaired HSPC function. The Ink4a/Arf locus also contributes to HSPC phenotypes, 
      at least in part via promotion of ROS. Strikingly, toxic ROS levels in Mll5(-/-) 
      mice are critically dependent on type 1 interferon (IFN-1) signaling, which
      triggers mitochondrial accumulation of full-length Bid. Genetic inactivation of
      Bid diminishes ROS levels and reverses HSPC defects in Mll5(-/-) mice. Overall,
      therefore, our findings highlight an unexpected IFN-1 > Bid > ROS pathway
      underlying DNA damage-associated HSPC malfunction.

TI  - Induction of Expandable Tissue-Specific Stem/Progenitor Cells through Transient
      Expression of YAP/TAZ.

AB  - The ability to induce autologous tissue-specific stem cells in culture could have
      a variety of applications in regenerative medicine and disease modeling. Here we 
      show that transient expression of exogenous YAP or its closely related paralogue 
      TAZ in primary differentiated mouse cells can induce conversion to a
      tissue-specific stem/progenitor cell state. Differentiated mammary gland,
      neuronal, and pancreatic exocrine cells, identified using a combination of cell
      sorting and lineage tracing approaches, efficiently convert to proliferating
      cells with properties of stem/progenitor cells of their respective tissues after 
      YAP induction. YAP-induced mammary stem/progenitor cells show molecular and
      functional properties similar to endogenous MaSCs, including organoid formation
      and mammary gland reconstitution after transplantation. Because YAP/TAZ function 
      is also important for self-renewal of endogenous stem cells in culture, our
      findings have implications for understanding the molecular determinants of the
      somatic stem cell state.

AB  - Cell-surface markers for prospective isolation of stem cells from human skeletal 
      muscle have been difficult to identify. Such markers would be powerful tools for 
      studying satellite cell function during homeostasis and in pathogenesis of
      diseases such as muscular dystrophies. In this study, we show that the
      tetraspanin KAI/CD82 is an excellent marker for prospectively isolating stem
      cells from human fetal and adult skeletal muscle. Human CD82(+) muscle cells
      robustly engraft into a mouse model of muscular dystrophy. shRNA knockdown of
      CD82 in myogenic cells reduces myoblast proliferation, suggesting it is
      functionally involved in muscle homeostasis. CD82 physically interacts with
      alpha7beta1 integrin (alpha7beta1-ITG) and with alpha-sarcoglycan, a member of
      the Dystrophin-Associated Glycoprotein Complex (DAPC), both of which have been
      linked to muscular dystrophies. Consistently, CD82 expression is decreased in
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Together, these findings suggest that CD82 
      function may be important for muscle stem cell function in muscular disorders.

TI  - Functional Impairment in Miro Degradation and Mitophagy Is a Shared Feature in
      Familial and Sporadic Parkinson's Disease.

AB  - Mitochondrial movements are tightly controlled to maintain energy homeostasis and
      prevent oxidative stress. Miro is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that
      anchors mitochondria to microtubule motors and is removed to stop mitochondrial
      motility as an early step in the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria. Here,
      using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and other
      complementary models, we build on a previous connection of Parkinson's disease
      (PD)-linked PINK1 and Parkin to Miro by showing that a third PD-related protein, 
      LRRK2, promotes Miro removal by forming a complex with Miro. Pathogenic
      LRRK2G2019S disrupts this function, delaying the arrest of damaged mitochondria
      and consequently slowing the initiation of mitophagy. Remarkably, partial
      reduction of Miro levels in LRRK2G2019S human neuron and Drosophila PD models
      rescues neurodegeneration. Miro degradation and mitochondrial motility are also
      impaired in sporadic PD patients. We reveal that prolonged retention of Miro, and
      the downstream consequences that ensue, may constitute a central component of PD 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Hematopoietic-specific transcription factors require coactivators to communicate 
      with the general transcription machinery and establish transcriptional programs
      that maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, promote
      differentiation, and prevent malignant transformation. Mediator is a large
      coactivator complex that bridges enhancer-localized transcription factors with
      promoters, but little is known about Mediator function in adult stem cell
      self-renewal and differentiation. We show that MED12, a member of the Mediator
      kinase module, is an essential regulator of HSC homeostasis, as in vivo deletion 
      of Med12 causes rapid bone marrow aplasia leading to acute lethality. Deleting
      other members of the Mediator kinase module does not affect HSC function,
      suggesting kinase-independent roles of MED12. MED12 deletion destabilizes P300
      binding at lineage-specific enhancers, resulting in H3K27Ac depletion, enhancer
      de-activation, and consequent loss of HSC stemness signatures. As MED12 mutations
      have been described recently in blood malignancies, alterations in
      MED12-dependent enhancer regulation may control both physiological and malignant 
      hematopoiesis.

      Formation in Mouse Embryos.

AB  - Cell types more advanced in development than embryonic stem cells, such as
      EpiSCs, fail to contribute to chimeras when injected into pre-implantation-stage 
      blastocysts, apparently because the injected cells undergo apoptosis. Here we
      show that transient promotion of cell survival through expression of the
      anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 enables EpiSCs and Sox17(+) endoderm progenitors to
      integrate into blastocysts and contribute to chimeric embryos. Upon injection
      into blastocyst, BCL2-expressing EpiSCs contributed to all bodily tissues in
      chimeric animals while Sox17(+) endoderm progenitors specifically contributed in 
      a region-specific fashion to endodermal tissues. In addition, BCL2 expression
      enabled rat EpiSCs to contribute to mouse embryonic chimeras, thereby forming
      interspecies chimeras that could survive to adulthood. Our system therefore
      provides a method to overcome cellular compatibility issues that typically
      restrict chimera formation. Application of this type of approach could broaden
      the use of embryonic chimeras, including region-specific chimeras, for basic
      developmental biology research and regenerative medicine.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide a model to study early neural
      development, model pathological processes, and develop therapeutics. The
      generation of functionally specialized neural subtypes from hPSCs relies on
      fundamental developmental principles learned from animal studies. Manipulation of
      these principles enables production of highly enriched neural types with
      functional attributes that resemble those in the brain. Further development to
      promote faster maturation or aging as well as circuit integration will help
      realize the potential of hPSC-derived neural cells in disease modeling and cell
      therapy.

AB  - The molecular features underlying tumor heterogeneity and the role of chromatin
      components in regulating cell fate within tumors are not well understood.
      Recently in Science, Torres et al. (2016) showed that the linker histone variant 
      H1.0 functions as a chromatin switch that determines self-renewal versus
      differentiation decisions in cancer stem cells.

AB  - Adult neural stem cells reside in specialized niches that maintain neurogenesis, 
      but the components of the niche and its secretome are only partially understood. 
      In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Silva-Vargas et al. (2016) show that choroid
      plexus, within the lateral ventricles of the adult brain, secretes signals that
      regulate adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent manner.

AB  - Blood vessels significantly remodel in response to injury and pathologic
      conditions, although the contribution of stem cells to this process is unclear.
      Now in Cell Stem Cell, Kramann et al. (2016) show that Gli1+ perivascular cells
      in the outermost vessel layer are progenitors that substantially contribute to
      pathologic vessel remodeling.

AB  - Myeloid malignancies often arise from an aging hematopoietic system and are
      currently incurable due to therapy-resistant, disease-reinitiating leukemic stem 
      cells. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Crews et al. (2016) report RNA splice
      isoform signatures unique to patient-derived leukemic stem cells that constitute

AB  - Mesenchymal niche cells may drive tissue failure and malignant transformation in 
      the hematopoietic system, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and relevance
      to human disease remain poorly defined. Here, we show that perturbation of
      mesenchymal cells in a mouse model of the pre-leukemic disorder Shwachman-Diamond
      syndrome (SDS) induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and
      activation of DNA damage responses in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
      Massive parallel RNA sequencing of highly purified mesenchymal cells in the SDS
      mouse model and a range of human pre-leukemic syndromes identified
      p53-S100A8/9-TLR inflammatory signaling as a common driving mechanism of
      genotoxic stress. Transcriptional activation of this signaling axis in the
      mesenchymal niche predicted leukemic evolution and progression-free survival in
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the principal leukemia predisposition syndrome.
      Collectively, our findings identify mesenchymal niche-induced genotoxic stress in
      heterotypic stem and progenitor cells through inflammatory signaling as a
      targetable determinant of disease outcome in human pre-leukemia.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells reside in the vascular wall, but their
      role in vascular regeneration and disease is poorly understood. Here, we show
      that Gli1(+) cells located in the arterial adventitia are progenitors of vascular
      smooth muscle cells and contribute to neointima formation and repair after acute 
      injury to the femoral artery. Genetic fate tracing indicates that adventitial
      Gli1(+) MSC-like cells migrate into the media and neointima during athero- and
      arteriosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with chronic kidney disease. Our data indicate
      that Gli1(+) cells are a major source of osteoblast-like cells during
      calcification in the media and intima. Genetic ablation of Gli1(+) cells before
      induction of kidney injury dramatically reduced the severity of vascular
      calcification. These findings implicate Gli1(+) cells as critical adventitial
      progenitors in vascular remodeling after acute and during chronic injury and
      suggest that they may be relevant therapeutic targets for mitigation of vascular 
      calcification.

AB  - Age-related human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) exhaustion and myeloid-lineage
      skewing promote oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into
      therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in secondary acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML). While acquisition of clonal DNA mutations has been linked to increased
      rates of secondary AML for individuals older than 60 years, the contribution of
      RNA processing alterations to human hematopoietic stem and progenitor aging and
      LSC generation remains unclear. Comprehensive RNA sequencing and
      splice-isoform-specific PCR uncovered characteristic RNA splice isoform
      expression patterns that distinguished normal young and aged human stem and
      progenitor cells (HSPCs) from malignant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML
      progenitors. In splicing reporter assays and pre-clinical patient-derived AML
      models, treatment with a pharmacologic splicing modulator, 17S-FD-895, reversed
      pro-survival splice isoform switching and significantly impaired LSC maintenance.
      Therapeutic splicing modulation, together with monitoring splice isoform
      biomarkers of healthy HSPC aging versus LSC generation, may be employed safely
      and effectively to prevent relapse, the leading cause of leukemia-related
      mortality.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV)-related neuropathology is an important global health concern.
      Several studies have shown that ZIKV can infect neural stem cells in the
      developing brain, but infection in the adult brain has not been examined. Two
      areas in the adult mouse brain contain neural stem cells: the subventricular zone
      of the anterior forebrain and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Here,
      using 6-week-old mice triply deficient in interferon regulatory factor (IRF) as a
      model, we show that blood-borne ZIKV administration can lead to pronounced
      evidence of ZIKV infection in these adult neural stem cells, leading to cell
      death and reduced proliferation. Our data therefore suggest that adult as well as
      fetal neural stem cells are vulnerable to ZIKV neuropathology. Thus, although
      ZIKV is considered a transient infection in adult humans without marked long-term
      effects, there may in fact be consequences of exposure in the adult brain.

TI  - Multipotency of Adult Hippocampal NSCs In Vivo Is Restricted by Drosha/NFIB.

AB  - Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are defined by their inherent capacity to
      self-renew and give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In vivo,
      however, hippocampal NSCs do not generate oligodendrocytes for reasons that have 
      remained enigmatic. Here, we report that deletion of Drosha in adult dentate
      gyrus NSCs activates oligodendrogenesis and reduces neurogenesis at the expense
      of gliogenesis. We further find that Drosha directly targets NFIB to repress its 
      expression independently of Dicer and microRNAs. Knockdown of NFIB in
      Drosha-deficient hippocampal NSCs restores neurogenesis, suggesting that the
      Drosha/NFIB mechanism robustly prevents oligodendrocyte fate acquisition in vivo.
      Taken together, our findings establish that adult hippocampal NSCs inherently
      possess multilineage potential but that Drosha functions as a molecular barrier
      preventing oligodendrogenesis.

      Neural Stem Cells to Inhibit Neurogenesis and Induce Autophagy.

AB  - The current widespread outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to
      severe clinical birth defects, particularly microcephaly, warranting urgent study
      of the molecular mechanisms underlying ZIKV pathogenesis. Akt-mTOR signaling is
      one of the key cellular pathways essential for brain development and autophagy
      regulation. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of human fetal neural stem cells
      (fNSCs) causes inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to defective
      neurogenesis and aberrant activation of autophagy. By screening the three
      structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins present in ZIKV, we found
      that two, NS4A and NS4B, cooperatively suppress the Akt-mTOR pathway and lead to 
      cellular dysregulation. Corresponding proteins from the closely related dengue
      virus do not have the same effect on neurogenesis. Thus, our study highlights
      ZIKV NS4A and NS4B as candidate determinants of viral pathogenesis and identifies
      a mechanism of action for their effects, suggesting potential targets for
      anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Specialized niches support the lifelong maintenance and function of
      tissue-specific stem cells. Adult neural stem cells in the
      ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) contact the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
      which flows through the lateral ventricles. A largely ignored component of the
      V-SVZ stem cell niche is the lateral ventricle choroid plexus (LVCP), a primary
      producer of CSF. Here we show that the LVCP, in addition to performing important 
      homeostatic support functions, secretes factors that promote colony formation and
      proliferation of purified quiescent and activated V-SVZ stem cells and
      transit-amplifying cells. The functional effect of the LVCP secretome changes
      throughout the lifespan, with activated neural stem cells being especially
      sensitive to age-related changes. Transcriptome analysis identified multiple
      factors that recruit colony formation and highlights novel facets of LVCP
      function. Thus, the LVCP is a key niche compartment that translates physiological
      changes into molecular signals directly affecting neural stem cell behavior.

AB  - In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Rinaldi et al. (2016) find an unexpected role
      for the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the regulation of
      enhancers. Their findings provide new insight into how regulation of enhancer
      activity through DNA methylation can have dramatic consequences on epidermal stem
      cell fate decisions.

      Bladder Dysfunction and Central Neuropathic Pain after Spinal Cord Injury.

AB  - Neuropathic pain and bladder dysfunction represent significant quality-of-life
      issues for many spinal cord injury patients. Loss of GABAergic tone in the
      injured spinal cord may contribute to the emergence of these symptoms. Previous
      studies have shown that transplantation of rodent inhibitory interneuron
      precursors from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) enhances GABAergic signaling
      in the brain and spinal cord. Here we look at whether transplanted MGE-like cells
      derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC-MGEs) can mitigate the pathological
      effects of spinal cord injury. We find that 6 months after transplantation into
      injured mouse spinal cords, hESC-MGEs differentiate into GABAergic neuron
      subtypes and receive synaptic inputs, suggesting functional integration into host
      spinal cord. Moreover, the transplanted animals show improved bladder function
      and mitigation of pain-related symptoms. Our results therefore suggest that this 
      approach may be a valuable strategy for ameliorating the adverse effects of
      spinal cord injury.

TI  - Glycolytic Metabolism Plays a Functional Role in Regulating Human Pluripotent
      Stem Cell State.

AB  - The rate of glycolytic metabolism changes during differentiation of human
      embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. 
      However, the functional contribution of glycolytic metabolism to the pluripotent 
      state is unclear. Here we show that naive hESCs exhibit increased glycolytic
      flux, MYC transcriptional activity, and nuclear N-MYC localization relative to
      primed hESCs. This status is consistent with the inner cell mass of human
      blastocysts, where MYC transcriptional activity is higher than in primed hESCs
      and nuclear N-MYC levels are elevated. Reduction of glycolysis decreases
      self-renewal of naive hESCs and feeder-free primed hESCs, but not primed hESCs
      grown in feeder-supported conditions. Reduction of glycolysis in feeder-free
      primed hESCs also enhances neural specification. These findings reveal
      associations between glycolytic metabolism and human naive pluripotency and
      differences in the metabolism of feeder-/feeder-free cultured hESCs. They may
      also suggest methods for regulating self-renewal and initial cell fate
      specification of hESCs.

AB  - Transit-amplifying nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) generate all of the nephrons
      of the mammalian kidney during development. Their limited numbers, poor in vitro 
      expansion, and difficult accessibility in humans have slowed basic and
      translational research into renal development and diseases. Here, we show that
      with appropriate 3D culture conditions, it is possible to support long-term
      expansion of primary mouse and human fetal NPCs as well as NPCs derived from
      human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Expanded NPCs maintain genomic
      stability, molecular homogeneity, and nephrogenic potential in vitro, ex vivo,
      and in vivo. Cultured NPCs are amenable to gene targeting and can form nephron
      organoids that engraft in vivo, functionally couple to the host's circulatory
      system, and produce urine-like metabolites via filtration. Together, these
      findings provide a technological platform for studying human nephrogenesis,
      modeling and diagnosing renal diseases, and drug discovery.

AB  - Physiological stem cell function is regulated by secreted factors produced by
      niche cells. In this study, we describe an unbiased approach based on the
      differential single-cell gene expression analysis of mesenchymal osteolineage
      cells close to, and further removed from, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
      (HSPCs) to identify candidate niche factors. Mesenchymal cells displayed distinct
      molecular profiles based on their relative location. We functionally examined,
      among the genes that were preferentially expressed in proximal cells, three
      secreted or cell-surface molecules not previously connected to HSPC biology-the
      secreted RNase angiogenin, the cytokine IL18, and the adhesion molecule
      Embigin-and discovered that all of these factors are HSPC quiescence regulators. 
      Therefore, our proximity-based differential single-cell approach reveals
      molecular heterogeneity within niche cells and can be used to identify novel
      extrinsic stem/progenitor cell regulators. Similar approaches could also be
      applied to other stem cell/niche pairs to advance the understanding of
      microenvironmental regulation of stem cell function.

AB  - The genome-wide localization and function of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in
      adult stem cells are unknown. Here, we show that in human epidermal stem cells,
      the two proteins bind in a histone H3K36me3-dependent manner to the most active
      enhancers and are required to produce their associated enhancer RNAs. Both
      proteins prefer super-enhancers associated to genes that either define the
      ectodermal lineage or establish the stem cell and differentiated states. However,
      Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ in their mechanisms of enhancer regulation: Dnmt3a
      associates with p63 to maintain high levels of DNA hydroxymethylation at the
      center of enhancers in a Tet2-dependent manner, whereas Dnmt3b promotes DNA
      methylation along the body of the enhancer. Depletion of either protein
      inactivates their target enhancers and profoundly affects epidermal stem cell
      function. Altogether, we reveal novel functions for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b at
      enhancers that could contribute to their roles in disease and tumorigenesis.

AB  - Endodermal stem/progenitor cells have diverse potential applications in research 
      and regenerative medicine, so a readily available source could have widespread
      uses. Here we describe derivation of human induced endodermal progenitor cells
      (hiEndoPCs) from gastrointestinal epithelial cells using a cocktail of defined
      small molecules along with support from tissue-specific mesenchymal feeders. The 
      hiEndoPCs show clonal expansion in culture and give rise to hepatocytes,
      pancreatic endocrine cells, and intestinal epithelial cells when treated with
      defined soluble molecules directing differentiation. The hiEndoPC-derived
      hepatocytes are able to rescue liver failure in Fah(-/-)Rag2(-/-) mice after
      transplantation, and, unlike hESCs, transplanted hiEndoPCs do not give rise to
      teratomas. Since human gastric epithelial cells are readily available from donors
      of many ages, this conversion strategy can generate clonally expandable cell
      populations with a variety of potential applications, including personalized drug
      screening and therapeutic strategies for liver failure and diabetes.

AB  - Regenerative medicine is predicated on understanding the mechanisms regulating
      development and applying these conditions to direct stem cell fate. Embryogenesis
      is guided by cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, but it is unclear how these 
      physical cues influence stem cells in culture. We used human embryonic stem cells
      (hESCs) to examine whether mechanical features of the extracellular
      microenvironment could differentially modulate mesoderm specification. We found
      that, on a hydrogel-based compliant matrix, hESCs accumulate beta-catenin at
      cell-cell adhesions and show enhanced Wnt-dependent mesoderm differentiation.
      Mechanistically, Src-driven ubiquitination of E-cadherin by Cbl-like ubiquitin
      ligase releases P120-catenin to facilitate transcriptional activity of
      beta-catenin, which initiates and reinforces mesoderm differentiation. By
      contrast, on a stiff hydrogel matrix, hESCs show elevated integrin-dependent GSK3
      and Src activity that promotes beta-catenin degradation and inhibits
      differentiation. Thus, we found that mechanical features of the
      microenvironmental matrix influence tissue-specific differentiation of hESCs by
      altering the cellular response to morphogens.

AB  - Recent studies have aimed to convert cultured human pluripotent cells to a naive 
      state, but it remains unclear to what extent the resulting cells recapitulate in 
      vivo naive pluripotency. Here we propose a set of molecular criteria for
      evaluating the naive human pluripotent state by comparing it to the human embryo.
      We show that transcription of transposable elements provides a sensitive measure 
      of the concordance between pluripotent stem cells and early human development. We
      also show that induction of the naive state is accompanied by genome-wide DNA
      hypomethylation, which is reversible except at imprinted genes, and that the X
      chromosome status resembles that of the human preimplantation embryo. However, we
      did not see efficient incorporation of naive human cells into mouse embryos.
      Overall, the different naive conditions we tested showed varied relationships to 
      human embryonic states based on molecular criteria, providing a backdrop for
      future analysis of naive human pluripotency.

AB  - Adult mammals have lost multi-tissue regenerative capacity, except for the distal
      digit, which is able to regenerate via mechanisms that remain largely unknown.
      Here, we show that, after adult mouse distal digit removal, nerve-associated
      Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) dedifferentiate and secrete growth factors that
      promote expansion of the blastema and digit regeneration. When SCPs were
      dysregulated or ablated, mesenchymal precursor proliferation in the blastema was 
      decreased and nail and bone regeneration were impaired. Transplantation of
      exogenous SCPs rescued these regeneration defects. We found that SCPs secrete
      factors that promote self-renewal of mesenchymal precursors, and we used
      transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to define candidate factors. Two of these, 
      oncostatin M (OSM) and platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA), are made by
      SCPs in the regenerating digit and rescued the deficits in regeneration caused by
      loss of SCPs. As all peripheral tissues contain nerves, these results could have 
      broad implications for mammalian tissue repair and regeneration.

AB  - Uncoupling synergistic interactions between physio-chemical cues that guide stem 
      cell fate may improve efforts to direct their differentiation in culture. Using
      supramolecular hydrogels, Alakpa et al. (2016) demonstrate that mesenchymal stem 
      cell differentiation is paired to depletion of bioactive metabolites, which can
      be utilized to chemically induce osteoblast and chondrocyte fate.

AB  - Successful hematopoietic regeneration demands preservation of stemness while
      enabling expansion and differentiation into blood lineages. Now, Silberstein et
      al. (2016) and Goncalves et al. (2016) identify a ribonuclease secreted by
      proximal niche cells that simultaneously drives quiescence of HSCs and
      proliferation of myeloid progenitors and dramatically enhances hematopoietic
      recovery after HSC transplantation.

TI  - Enhancing a Wnt-Telomere Feedback Loop Restores Intestinal Stem Cell Function in 
      a Human Organotypic Model of Dyskeratosis Congenita.

LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2016.05.024 [doi]
LID - S1934-5909(16)30108-4 [pii]
AB  - Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) suffer from stem cell failure in highly
      proliferative tissues, including the intestinal epithelium. Few therapeutic
      options exist for this disorder, and patients are treated primarily with bone
      marrow transplantation to restore hematopoietic function. Here, we generate
      isogenic DC patient and disease allele-corrected intestinal tissue using
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated 
      gene correction in induced pluripotent stem cells and directed differentiation.
      We show that DC tissue has suboptimal Wnt pathway activity causing intestinal
      stem cell failure and that enhanced expression of the telomere-capping protein
      TRF2, a Wnt target gene, can alleviate DC phenotypes. Treatment with the
      clinically relevant Wnt agonists LiCl or CHIR99021 restored TRF2 expression and
      reversed gastrointestinal DC phenotypes, including organoid formation in vitro,
      and maturation of intestinal tissue and xenografted organoids in vivo. Thus, the 
      isogenic DC cell model provides a platform for therapeutic discovery and
      identifies Wnt modulation as a potential strategy for treatment of DC patients.

      Individual Drug Safety and Efficacy Responses In Vitro.

AB  - Understanding individual susceptibility to drug-induced cardiotoxicity is key to 
      improving patient safety and preventing drug attrition. Human induced pluripotent
      stem cells (hiPSCs) enable the study of pharmacological and toxicological
      responses in patient-specific cardiomyocytes (CMs) and may serve as preclinical
      platforms for precision medicine. Transcriptome profiling in hiPSC-CMs from seven
      individuals lacking known cardiovascular disease-associated mutations and in
      three isogenic human heart tissue and hiPSC-CM pairs showed greater inter-patient
      variation than intra-patient variation, verifying that reprogramming and
      differentiation preserve patient-specific gene expression, particularly in
      metabolic and stress-response genes. Transcriptome-based toxicology analysis
      predicted and risk-stratified patient-specific susceptibility to cardiotoxicity, 
      and functional assays in hiPSC-CMs using tacrolimus and rosiglitazone, drugs
      targeting pathways predicted to produce cardiotoxicity, validated inter-patient
      differential responses. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated pathway correction prevented
      drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Our data suggest that hiPSC-CMs can be used in vitro
      to predict and validate patient-specific drug safety and efficacy, potentially
      enabling future clinical approaches to precision medicine.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have increased our knowledge of loci
      associated with a range of human diseases. However, applying such findings to
      elucidate pathophysiology and promote drug discovery remains challenging. Here,
      we created isogenic human ESCs (hESCs) with mutations in GWAS-identified
      susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes. In pancreatic beta-like cells
      differentiated from these lines, we found that mutations in CDKAL1, KCNQ1, and
      KCNJ11 led to impaired glucose secretion in vitro and in vivo, coinciding with
      defective glucose homeostasis. CDKAL1 mutant insulin+ cells were also
      hypersensitive to glucolipotoxicity. A high-content chemical screen identified a 
      candidate drug that rescued CDKAL1-specific defects in vitro and in vivo by
      inhibiting the FOS/JUN pathway. Our approach of a proof-of-principle platform,
      which uses isogenic hESCs for functional evaluation of GWAS-identified loci and
      identification of a drug candidate that rescues gene-specific defects, paves the 
      way for precision therapy of metabolic diseases.

AB  - Overexpression of exogenous fate-specifying transcription factors can directly
      reprogram differentiated somatic cells to target cell types. Here, we show that
      similar reprogramming can also be achieved through the direct activation of
      endogenous genes using engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators.
      We use this approach to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and
      Myt1l genes (BAM factors) to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced
      neuronal cells. This direct activation of endogenous genes rapidly remodeled the 
      epigenetic state of the target loci and induced sustained endogenous gene
      expression during reprogramming. Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic 
      remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for
      conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous
      genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate
      reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides 
      a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.

AB  - Variation in the differentiation capacity of induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) to specific lineages is a significant concern for their use in clinical
      applications and disease modeling. To identify factors that affect
      differentiation capacity, we performed integration analyses between hematopoietic
      differentiation performance and molecular signatures such as gene expression, DNA
      methylation, and chromatin status, using 35 human iPSC lines and four ESC lines. 
      Our analyses revealed that hematopoietic commitment of PSCs to hematopoietic
      precursors correlates with IGF2 expression level, which in turn depends on
      signaling-dependent chromatin accessibility at mesendodermal genes. Maturation
      capacity for conversion of PSC-derived hematopoietic precursors to mature blood
      associates with the amount and pattern of DNA methylation acquired during
      reprogramming. Our study therefore provides insight into the molecular features
      that determine the differential capacities seen among human iPSC lines and,
      through the predictive potential of this information, highlights a way to select 
      optimal iPSCs for clinical applications.

AB  - The ability to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) using defined factors provides new tools for biomedical research.
      However, some iPSC clones display tumorigenic and immunogenic potential, thus
      raising concerns about their utility and safety in the clinical setting.
      Furthermore, variability in iPSC differentiation potential has also been
      described. Here we discuss whether these therapeutic obstacles are specific to
      transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming or inherent to every cellular
      reprogramming method. Finally, we address whether a better understanding of the
      mechanism underlying the reprogramming process might improve the fidelity of
      reprogramming and, therefore, the iPSC quality.

      Mouse and Human Hematopoietic Progenitors.

AB  - Umbilical cord blood (CB) is a convenient and broadly used source of
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      However, limiting numbers of HSCs remain a major constraint for its clinical
      application. Although one feasible option would be to expand HSCs to improve
      therapeutic outcome, available protocols and the molecular mechanisms governing
      the self-renewal of HSCs are unclear. Here, we show that ectopic expression of a 
      single microRNA (miRNA), miR-125a, in purified murine and human multipotent
      progenitors (MPPs) resulted in increased self-renewal and robust long-term
      multi-lineage repopulation in transplanted recipient mice. Using quantitative
      proteomics and western blot analysis, we identified a restricted set of miR-125a 
      targets involved in conferring long-term repopulating capacity to MPPs in humans 
      and mice. Our findings offer the innovative potential to use MPPs with enhanced
      self-renewal activity to augment limited sources of HSCs to improve clinical
      protocols.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) specification is regulated by
      numerous defined factors acting locally within the hemogenic niche; however, it
      is unclear whether production can adapt to fluctuating systemic needs. Here we
      show that the CNS controls embryonic HSPC numbers via the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) stress response axis. Exposure 
      to serotonin or the reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine increased runx1 expression and 
      Flk1(+)/cMyb(+) HSPCs independent of peripheral innervation. Inhibition of
      neuronal, but not peripheral, tryptophan hydroxlyase (Tph) persistently reduced
      HSPC number. Consistent with central HPA/I axis induction and glucocorticoid
      receptor (GR) activation, GR agonists enhanced, whereas GR loss diminished, HSPC 
      formation. Significantly, developmental hypoxia, as indicated by Hif1alpha
      function, induced the HPA/I axis and cortisol production. Furthermore,
      Hif1alpha-stimulated HSPC enhancement was attenuated by neuronal tph or GR loss. 
      Our data establish that embryonic HSC production responds to physiologic stress
      via CNS-derived serotonin synthesis and central feedback regulation to control
      HSC numbers.

TI  - Zfp281 Coordinates Opposing Functions of Tet1 and Tet2 in Pluripotent States.

AB  - Pluripotency is increasingly recognized as a spectrum of cell states defined by
      their growth conditions. Although naive and primed pluripotency states have been 
      characterized molecularly, our understanding of events regulating state
      acquisition is wanting. Here, we performed comparative RNA sequencing of mouse
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and defined a pluripotent cell fate (PCF) gene
      signature associated with acquisition of naive and primed pluripotency. We
      identify Zfp281 as a key transcriptional regulator for primed pluripotency that
      also functions as a barrier toward achieving naive pluripotency in both mouse and
      human ESCs. Mechanistically, Zfp281 interacts with Tet1, but not Tet2, and its
      direct transcriptional target, miR-302/367, to negatively regulate Tet2
      expression to establish and maintain primed pluripotency. Conversely, ectopic
      Tet2 alone, but not Tet1, efficiently reprograms primed cells toward naive
      pluripotency. Our study reveals a molecular circuitry in which opposing functions
      of Tet1 and Tet2 control acquisition of alternative pluripotent states.

AB  - Chimeras are widely acknowledged as the gold standard for assessing stem cell
      pluripotency, based on their capacity to test donor cell lineage potential in the
      context of an organized, normally developing tissue. Experimental chimeras
      provide key insights into mammalian developmental mechanisms and offer a resource
      for interrogating the fate potential of various pluripotent stem cell states. We 
      highlight the applications and current limitations presented by intra- and
      inter-species chimeras and consider their future contribution to the stem cell
      field. Despite the technical and ethical demands of experimental chimeras,
      including human-interspecies chimeras, they are a provocative resource for
      achieving regenerative medicine goals.

AB  - A structured search reveals that online marketing of stem-cell-based
      interventions is skewed toward developed economies including the United States,
      Ireland, Australia, and Germany. Websites made broad, imprecise therapeutic
      claims and frequently failed to detail procedures. Widespread marketing poses
      challenges to regulators, bioethicists, and those seeking realistic hope from
      therapies.

AB  - Changes in cellular metabolism drive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior
      during homeostasis, although whether they control HSC behavior during stress
      conditions is unclear. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Karigane et al. (2016)
      identify a p38alpha-dependent pathway that alters purine metabolism in HSCs
      during stress hematopoiesis, promoting hematopoietic recovery.

AB  - Recent advances in 3D culture systems have led to the generation of brain
      organoids that resemble different human brain regions; however, a 3D organoid
      model of the midbrain containing functional midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons
      has not been reported. We developed a method to differentiate human pluripotent
      stem cells into a large multicellular organoid-like structure that contains
      distinct layers of neuronal cells expressing characteristic markers of human
      midbrain. Importantly, we detected electrically active and functionally mature
      mDA neurons and dopamine production in our 3D midbrain-like organoids (MLOs). In 
      contrast to human mDA neurons generated using 2D methods or MLOs generated from
      mouse embryonic stem cells, our human MLOs produced neuromelanin-like granules
      that were structurally similar to those isolated from human substantia nigra
      tissues. Thus our MLOs bearing features of the human midbrain may provide a
      tractable in vitro system to study the human midbrain and its related diseases.

AB  - Direct-to-consumer marketing of unapproved stem cell interventions is a
      well-known phenomenon in countries with lax medical regulations. However, an
      examination of Internet-based marketing claims revealed widespread promotion of

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain quiescence by activating specific
      metabolic pathways, including glycolysis. We do not yet have a clear
      understanding of how this metabolic activity changes during stress hematopoiesis,
      such as bone marrow transplantation. Here, we report a critical role for the
      p38MAPK family isoform p38alpha in initiating hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cell (HSPC) proliferation during stress hematopoiesis in mice. We found that
      p38MAPK is immediately phosphorylated in HSPCs after a hematological stress,
      preceding increased HSPC cycling. Conditional deletion of p38alpha led to
      defective recovery from hematological stress and a delay in initiation of HSPC
      proliferation. Mechanistically, p38alpha signaling increases expression of
      inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 in HSPCs, leading to altered levels of
      amino acids and purine-related metabolites and changes in cell-cycle progression 
      in vitro and in vivo. Our studies have therefore uncovered a p38alpha-mediated
      pathway that alters HSPC metabolism to respond to stress and promote recovery.

AB  - Adult mitotic tissues like the intestine, skin, and blood undergo constant
      turnover throughout the life of an organism. Knowing the identity of the stem
      cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon
      disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage
      tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the
      transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem
      cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that
      StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small
      intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply StemID to
      predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue
      with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that StemID will
      accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for
      biological follow-up and validation.

TI  - Dual SMAD Signaling Inhibition Enables Long-Term Expansion of Diverse Epithelial 
      Basal Cells.

AB  - Functional modeling of many adult epithelia is limited by the difficulty in
      maintaining relevant stem cell populations in culture. Here, we show that dual
      inhibition of SMAD signaling pathways enables robust expansion of primary
      epithelial basal cell populations. We find that TGFbeta/BMP/SMAD pathway
      signaling is strongly activated in luminal and suprabasal cells of several
      epithelia, but suppressed in p63+ basal cells. In airway epithelium, SMAD
      signaling promotes differentiation, and its inhibition leads to stem cell
      hyperplasia. Using dual SMAD signaling inhibition in a feeder-free culture
      system, we have been able to expand airway basal stem cells from multiple
      species. Expanded cells can produce functional airway epithelium physiologically 
      responsive to clinically relevant drugs, such as CFTR modulators. This approach
      is effective for the clonal expansion of single human cells and for basal cell
      populations from epithelial tissues from all three germ layers and therefore may 
      be broadly applicable for modeling of epithelia.

AB  - Post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing mediated by adenosine
      deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) promotes cancer progression and therapeutic
      resistance. However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing leukemia stem
      cell (LSC) generation have not been elucidated. In blast crisis chronic myeloid
      leukemia (BC CML), we show that increased JAK2 signaling and BCR-ABL1
      amplification activate ADAR1. In a humanized BC CML mouse model, combined JAK2
      and BCR-ABL1 inhibition prevents LSC self-renewal commensurate with ADAR1
      downregulation. Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-type, but not an editing-defective
      ADAR1(E912A) mutant, induces self-renewal gene expression and impairs biogenesis 
      of stem cell regulatory let-7 microRNAs. Combined RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR,
      CLIP-ADAR1, and pri-let-7 mutagenesis data suggest that ADAR1 promotes LSC
      generation via let-7 pri-microRNA editing and LIN28B upregulation. A
      small-molecule tool compound antagonizes ADAR1's effect on LSC self-renewal in
      stromal co-cultures and restores let-7 biogenesis. Thus, ADAR1 activation
      represents a unique therapeutic vulnerability in LSCs with active JAK2 signaling.

AB  - Regulated mechanisms of stem cell maintenance are key to preventing stem cell
      depletion and aging. While mitochondrial morphology plays a fundamental role in
      tissue development and homeostasis, its role in stem cells remains unknown. Here,
      we uncover that mitochondrial dynamics regulates stem cell identity,
      self-renewal, and fate decisions by orchestrating a transcriptional program.
      Manipulation of mitochondrial structure, through OPA1 or MFN1/2 deletion,
      impaired neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal, with consequent age-dependent
      depletion, neurogenesis defects, and cognitive impairments. Gene expression
      profiling revealed ectopic expression of the Notch self-renewal inhibitor Botch
      and premature induction of transcription factors that promote differentiation.
      Changes in mitochondrial dynamics regulate stem cell fate decisions by driving a 
      physiological reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated process, which triggers a
      dual program to suppress self-renewal and promote differentiation via
      NRF2-mediated retrograde signaling. These findings reveal mitochondrial dynamics 
      as an upstream regulator of essential mechanisms governing stem cell self-renewal
      and fate decisions through transcriptional programming.

AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule is often overexpressed in human colorectal cancers, 
      but its role in gut tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we show in vivo that Mule
      controls murine intestinal stem and progenitor cell proliferation by modulating
      Wnt signaling via c-Myc. Mule also regulates protein levels of the receptor
      tyrosine kinase EphB3 by targeting it for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. 
      In the intestine, EphB/ephrinB interactions position cells along the crypt-villus
      axis and compartmentalize incipient colorectal tumors. Our study thus unveils an 
      important new avenue by which Mule acts as an intestinal tumor suppressor by
      regulation of the intestinal stem cell niche.

AB  - Emerging evidence from the current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) indicates a
      strong causal link between Zika and microcephaly. To investigate how ZIKV
      infection leads to microcephaly, we used human embryonic stem cell-derived
      cerebral organoids to recapitulate early stage, first trimester fetal brain
      development. Here we show that a prototype strain of ZIKV, MR766, efficiently
      infects organoids and causes a decrease in overall organoid size that correlates 
      with the kinetics of viral copy number. The innate immune receptor
      Toll-like-Receptor 3 (TLR3) was upregulated after ZIKV infection of human
      organoids and mouse neurospheres and TLR3 inhibition reduced the phenotypic
      effects of ZIKV infection. Pathway analysis of gene expression changes during
      TLR3 activation highlighted 41 genes also related to neuronal development,
      suggesting a mechanistic connection to disrupted neurogenesis. Together,
      therefore, our findings identify a link between ZIKV-mediated TLR3 activation,
      perturbed cell fate, and a reduction in organoid volume reminiscent of
      microcephaly.

      pluripotent stem cells. Now in Cell Stem Cell, Zhang et al. (2016) show that
      Lin28 controls the metabolic transition from naive to primed pluripotency by

AB  - Adipose tissue (AT) has previously been identified as an extra-medullary
      reservoir for normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and may promote tumor
      development. Here, we show that a subpopulation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can
      utilize gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) as a niche to support their metabolism and
      evade chemotherapy. In a mouse model of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML), adipose-resident LSCs exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype and induce
      lipolysis in GAT. GAT lipolysis fuels fatty acid oxidation in LSCs, especially
      within a subpopulation expressing the fatty acid transporter CD36. CD36(+) LSCs
      have unique metabolic properties, are strikingly enriched in AT, and are
      protected from chemotherapy by the GAT microenvironment. CD36 also marks a
      fraction of human blast crisis CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with
      similar biological properties. These findings suggest striking interplay between 
      leukemic cells and AT to create a unique microenvironment that supports the
      metabolic demands and survival of a distinct LSC subpopulation.

AB  - Recent advances in genome editing have facilitated the generation of nonhuman
      primate (NHP) models, with potential to unmask the complex biology of human
      disease not revealed by rodent models. However, their broader use is hindered by 
      the challenges associated with generation of adult NHP models as well as the cost
      of their production. Here, we describe the generation of a marmoset model of
      severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This study optimized zinc-finger
      nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to 
      target interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) in pronuclear stage marmoset 
      embryos. Nine of 21 neonates exhibited mutations in the IL2RG gene, concomitant
      with immunodeficiency, and three neonates have currently survived from 240 days
      to 1.8 years. Our approach demonstrates highly efficient production of founder
      NHP with SCID phenotypes, with promises of multiple pre-clinical and
      translational applications.

LID - S1934-5909(16)30093-5 [pii]
AB  - The RNA-binding proteins LIN28A and LIN28B play critical roles in embryonic
      development, tumorigenesis, and pluripotency, but their exact functions are
      poorly understood. Here, we show that, like LIN28A, LIN28B can function
      effectively with NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 in reprogramming to pluripotency and that 
      reactivation of both endogenous LIN28A and LIN28B loci are required for maximal
      reprogramming efficiency. In human fibroblasts, LIN28B is activated early during 
      reprogramming, while LIN28A is activated later during the transition to bona fide
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In murine cells, LIN28A and LIN28B
      facilitate conversion from naive to primed pluripotency. Proteomic and
      metabolomic analysis highlighted roles for LIN28 in maintaining the low
      mitochondrial function associated with primed pluripotency and in regulating
      one-carbon metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and histone methylation. LIN28
      binds to mRNAs of proteins important for oxidative phosphorylation and modulates 
      protein abundance. Thus, LIN28A and LIN28B play cooperative roles in regulating
      reprogramming, naive/primed pluripotency, and stem cell metabolism.

AB  - Neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are powerful tools for 
      studying human neural development and diseases. Robust functional coupling of
      hPSC-derived neurons with target tissues in vitro is essential for modeling
      intercellular physiology in a dish and to further translational studies, but it
      has proven difficult to achieve. Here, we derive sympathetic neurons from hPSCs
      and show that they can form physical and functional connections with cardiac
      muscle cells. Using multiple hPSC reporter lines, we recapitulated human
      autonomic neuron development in vitro and successfully isolated PHOX2B::eGFP+
      neurons that exhibit sympathetic marker expression and electrophysiological
      properties and norepinephrine secretion. Upon pharmacologic and optogenetic
      manipulation, PHOX2B::eGFP+ neurons controlled beating rates of cardiomyocytes,
      and the physical interactions between these cells increased neuronal maturation. 
      This study provides a foundation for human sympathetic neuron specification and
      for hPSC-based neuronal control of organs in a dish.

TI  - Secreted Phospholipases A2 Are Intestinal Stem Cell Niche Factors with Distinct
      Roles in Homeostasis, Inflammation, and Cancer.

AB  - The intestinal stem cell niche provides cues that actively maintain gut
      homeostasis. Dysregulation of these cues may compromise intestinal regeneration
      upon tissue insult and/or promote tumor growth. Here, we identify secreted
      phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) as stem cell niche factors with context-dependent
      functions in the digestive tract. We show that group IIA sPLA2, a known genetic
      modifier of mouse intestinal tumorigenesis, is expressed by Paneth cells in the
      small intestine, while group X sPLA2 is expressed by Paneth/goblet-like cells in 
      the colon. During homeostasis, group IIA/X sPLA2s inhibit Wnt signaling through
      intracellular activation of Yap1. However, upon inflammation they are secreted
      into the intestinal lumen, where they promote prostaglandin synthesis and Wnt
      signaling. Genetic ablation of both sPLA2s improves recovery from inflammation
      but increases colon cancer susceptibility due to release of their homeostatic
      Wnt-inhibitory role. This "trade-off" effect suggests sPLA2s have important
      functions as genetic modifiers of inflammation and colon cancer.

      Aberrant Proliferation and Accumulation of DNA Damage.

AB  - Human BRCA1 mutation carriers and BRCA1-deficient mouse mammary glands contain an
      abnormal population of mammary luminal progenitors that can form 3D colonies in a
      hormone-independent manner. The intrinsic cellular regulatory defect in these
      presumptive breast cancer precursors is not known. We have discovered that
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (p52/RelB) is persistently activated in a
      subset of BRCA1-deficient mammary luminal progenitors. Hormone-independent
      luminal progenitor colony formation required NF-kappaB, ataxia
      telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), and the inhibitor of kappaB kinase, IKKalpha.
      Progesterone (P4)-stimulated proliferation resulted in a marked enhancement of
      DNA damage foci in Brca1(-/-) mouse mammary. In vivo, NF-kappaB inhibition
      prevented recovery of Brca1(-/-) hormone-independent colony-forming cells. The
      majority of human BRCA1(mut/+) mammary glands showed marked lobular expression of
      nuclear NF-kappaB. We conclude that the aberrant proliferative capacity of
      Brca1(-/-) luminal progenitor cells is linked to the replication-associated DNA
      damage response, where proliferation of mammary progenitors is perpetuated by
      damage-induced, autologous NF-kappaB signaling.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are capable of supporting the
      lifelong production of blood cells exerting a wide spectrum of functions.
      Lentiviral vector HSPC gene therapy generates a human hematopoietic system stably
      marked at the clonal level by vector integration sites (ISs). Using IS analysis, 
      we longitudinally tracked >89,000 clones from 15 distinct bone marrow and
      peripheral blood lineages purified up to 4 years after transplant in four
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients treated with HSPC gene therapy. We measured at 
      the clonal level repopulating waves, populations' sizes and dynamics, activity of
      distinct HSPC subtypes, contribution of various progenitor classes during the
      early and late post-transplant phases, and hierarchical relationships among
      lineages. We discovered that in-vitro-manipulated HSPCs retain the ability to
      return to latency after transplant and can be physiologically reactivated,
      sustaining a stable hematopoietic output. This study constitutes in vivo
      comprehensive tracking in humans of hematopoietic clonal dynamics during the
      early and late post-transplant phases.

AB  - The link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly has raised urgent
      global alarm. The historical African ZIKV MR766 was recently shown to infect
      cultured human neural precursor cells (NPCs), but unlike the contemporary ZIKV
      strains, it is not believed to cause microcephaly. Here we investigated whether
      the Asian ZIKV strain SZ01 could infect NPCs in vivo and affect brain
      development. We found that SZ01 replicates efficiently in embryonic mouse brain
      by directly targeting different neuronal linages. ZIKV infection leads to
      cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of NPC differentiation, resulting in
      cortical thinning and microcephaly. Global gene expression analysis of infected
      brains reveals upregulation of candidate flavirus entry receptors and
      dysregulation of genes associated with immune response, apoptosis, and
      microcephaly. Our model provides evidence for a direct link between Zika virus
      infection and microcephaly, with potential for further exploration of the
      underlying mechanisms and management of ZIKV-related pathological effects during 
      brain development.

TI  - Activation of Endogenous Retroviruses in Dnmt1(-/-) ESCs Involves Disruption of
      SETDB1-Mediated Repression by NP95 Binding to Hemimethylated DNA.
PG  - 81-94
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2016.03.013 [doi]
LID - S1934-5909(16)00119-3 [pii]
AB  - Repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in mammals involves several
      epigenetic mechanisms. Acute loss of the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1
      induces widespread DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation of ERVs,
      including CpG-rich IAP (intracisternal A particle) proviruses. Here, we show that
      this effect is not due simply to a loss of DNA methylation. Conditional deletions
      reveal that both Dnmt1 and Np95 are essential for maintenance DNA methylation.
      However, while IAPs are derepressed in Dnmt1-ablated embryos and embryonic stem
      cells (ESCs), these ERVs remain silenced when Np95 is deleted alone or in
      combination with Dnmt1. This paradoxical phenotype results from an ectopic
      interaction between NP95 and the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. Normally, SETDB1 
      maintains silencing of IAPs, but in the absence of DNMT1, prolonged binding of
      NP95 to hemimethylated DNA transiently disrupts SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3
      deposition. Thus, our observations reveal an unexpected antagonistic interplay
      between two repressive pathways involved in retroviral silencing in mammalian
      cells.

AB  - Liver fibrosis, a form of scarring, develops in chronic liver diseases when
      hepatocyte regeneration cannot compensate for hepatocyte death. Initially,
      collagen produced by myofibroblasts (MFs) functions to maintain the integrity of 
      the liver, but excessive collagen accumulation suppresses residual hepatocyte
      function, leading to liver failure. As a strategy to generate new hepatocytes and
      limit collagen deposition in the chronically injured liver, we developed in vivo 
      reprogramming of MFs into hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors 
      expressing hepatic transcription factors. We first identified the AAV6 capsid as 
      effective in transducing MFs in a mouse model of liver fibrosis. We then showed
      in lineage-tracing mice that AAV6 vector-mediated in vivo hepatic reprogramming
      of MFs generates hepatocytes that replicate function and proliferation of primary
      hepatocytes, and reduces liver fibrosis. Because AAV vectors are already used for
      liver-directed human gene therapy, our strategy has potential for clinical
      translation into a therapy for liver fibrosis.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in pluripotent stem cell technologies have enabled a new
      class of in vitro systems for functional modeling of human brain development.
      These advances, in combination with improvements in neural differentiation
      methods, allow the generation of in vitro systems that reproduce many in vivo
      features of the brain with remarkable similarity. Here, we describe advances in
      the development of these methods, focusing on neural rosette and organoid
      approaches, and compare their relative capabilities and limitations. We also
      discuss current technical hurdles for recreating the cell-type complexity and
      spatial architecture of the brain in culture and offer potential solutions.

AB  - The germ cell lineage originates early in development and undergoes a series of
      complex developmental processes that culminate in the generation of fully matured
      gametes, the spermatozoa and the oocytes. Remarkably, researchers have been
      recapitulating these developmental pathways using mouse and human pluripotent
      stem cells (PSCs). With further studies, including those involving non-human
      primate models, human gametogenesis may be fully reconstituted from PSCs, which
      would profoundly facilitate our understanding of human germ cell development and 
      infertility. Here we discuss groundbreaking studies that lay the foundation for
      this achievement, the current state of the field, and challenges for deriving
      gametes from hPSCs.

AB  - Cell engineering has brought us tantalizingly close to the goal of deriving
      patient-specific hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). While directed differentiation 
      and transcription factor-mediated conversion strategies have generated progenitor
      cells with multilineage potential, to date, therapy-grade engineered HSCs remain 
      elusive due to insufficient long-term self-renewal and inadequate differentiated 
      progeny functionality. A cross-species approach involving zebrafish and mammalian
      systems offers complementary methodologies to improve understanding of native
      HSCs. Here, we discuss the role of conserved developmental timing processes in
      vertebrate hematopoiesis, highlighting how identification and manipulation of
      stage-specific factors that specify HSC developmental state must be harnessed to 
      engineer HSCs for therapy.

AB  - Hippocampal neurogenesis is affected throughout life by factors external to the
      brain, including what we eat, our gut microbiota, and the immune system. However,
      the mechanisms that link microbiota to neurogenesis are still puzzling. Now in
      Cell Reports, Mohle et al. (2016) attribute a role to Ly6C(hi) monocytes in this 
      gut-immune-brain axis.

AB  - Human retinal degeneration can cause blindness, and the lack of relevant model
      systems has made identifying underlying mechanisms challenging. Parfitt et al.
      (2016) generate three-dimensional retinal tissue from patient-derived induced
      pluripotent stem cells to identify how CEP290 mutations cause retinal
      degeneration, and show an antisense approach can correct disease-associated
      phenotypes.

AB  - Replacement of mitochondria through nuclear transfer between oocytes of two
      different women has emerged recently as a strategy for preventing inheritance of 
      mtDNA diseases. Although experiments in human oocytes have shown effective
      replacement, the consequences of small amounts of mtDNA carryover have not been
      studied sufficiently. Using human mitochondrial replacement stem cell lines, we
      show that, even though the low levels of heteroplasmy introduced into human
      oocytes by mitochondrial carryover during nuclear transfer often vanish, they can
      sometimes instead result in mtDNA genotypic drift and reversion to the original
      genotype. Comparison of cells with identical oocyte-derived nuclear DNA but
      different mtDNA shows that either mtDNA genotype is compatible with the nucleus
      and that drift is independent of mitochondrial function. Thus, although
      functional replacement of the mitochondrial genome is possible, even low levels
      of heteroplasmy can affect the stability of the mtDNA genotype and compromise the
      efficacy of mitochondrial replacement.

AB  - Colorectal tumor is a heterogeneous disease, with varying clinical presentation
      and prognosis in patients. To establish a platform encompassing this diversity,
      we generated 55 colorectal tumor organoid lines from a range of histological
      subtypes and clinical stages, including rare subtypes. Each line was defined by
      gene expression signatures and optimized for organoid culture according to niche 
      factor requirements. In vitro and in xenografts, the organoids reproduced the
      histopathological grade and differentiation capacity of their parental tumors.
      Notably, we found that niche-independent growth is predominantly associated with 
      the adenoma-carcinoma transition reflecting accumulation of multiple mutations.
      For matched pairs of primary and metastatic organoids, which had similar genetic 
      profiles and niche factor requirements, the metastasis-derived organoids
      exhibited higher metastatic capacity. These observations underscore the
      importance of genotype-phenotype analyses at a single-patient level and the value
      of our resource to provide insights into colorectal tumorigenesis and
      patient-centered therapeutic development.

AB  - Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an inherited retinal dystrophy that causes
      childhood blindness. Photoreceptors are especially sensitive to an intronic
      mutation in the cilia-related gene CEP290, which causes missplicing and premature
      termination, but the basis of this sensitivity is unclear. Here, we generated
      differentiated photoreceptors in three-dimensional optic cups and retinal pigment
      epithelium (RPE) from iPSCs with this common CEP290 mutation to investigate
      disease mechanisms and evaluate candidate therapies. iPSCs differentiated
      normally into RPE and optic cups, despite abnormal CEP290 splicing and cilia
      defects. The highest levels of aberrant splicing and cilia defects were observed 
      in optic cups, explaining the retinal-specific manifestation of this CEP290
      mutation. Treating optic cups with an antisense morpholino effectively blocked
      aberrant splicing and restored expression of full-length CEP290, restoring normal
      cilia-based protein trafficking. These results provide a mechanistic
      understanding of the retina-specific phenotypes in CEP290 LCA patients and
      potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into somatic
      counterparts is a valuable tool for studying disease. However, examination of
      developmental mechanisms in hPSCs remains challenging given complex
      multi-factorial actions at different stages. Here, we used TALEN and
      CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing and hPSC-directed differentiation for a
      systematic analysis of the roles of eight pancreatic transcription factors (PDX1,
      RFX6, PTF1A, GLIS3, MNX1, NGN3, HES1, and ARX). Our analysis not only verified
      conserved gene requirements between mice and humans but also revealed a number of
      previously unsuspected developmental mechanisms with implications for type 2
      diabetes. These include a role of RFX6 in regulating the number of pancreatic
      progenitors, a haploinsufficient requirement for PDX1 in pancreatic beta cell
      differentiation, and a potentially divergent role of NGN3 in humans and mice. Our
      findings support use of systematic genome editing in hPSCs as a strategy for
      understanding mechanisms underlying congenital disorders.

AB  - Transplantation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons is a
      promising avenue for treating disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD).
      Precise control over engrafted cell activity is highly desired, as cells do not
      always integrate properly into host circuitry and can cause suboptimal graft
      function or undesired outcomes. Here, we show tunable rescue of motor function in
      a mouse model of PD, following transplantation of human midbrain dopaminergic
      (mDA) neurons differentiated from hPSCs engineered to express DREADDs (designer
      receptors exclusively activated by designer drug). Administering
      clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) enabled precise DREADD-dependent stimulation or
      inhibition of engrafted neurons, revealing D1 receptor-dependent regulation of
      host neuronal circuitry by engrafted cells. Transplanted cells rescued motor
      defects, which could be reversed or enhanced by CNO-based control of graft
      function, and activating engrafted cells drives behavioral changes in
      transplanted mice. These results highlight the ability to exogenously and
      noninvasively control and refine therapeutic outcomes following cell
      transplantation.

AB  - Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) that are the major source of osteoblasts and
      adipocytes in adult bone marrow express leptin receptor (LepR). To test whether
      LepR regulates SSC function, we conditionally deleted Lepr from limb bone marrow 
      stromal cells, but not from the axial skeleton or hypothalamic neurons, using
      Prx1-Cre. Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice exhibited normal body mass and normal
      hematopoiesis. However, limb bones from Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice exhibited
      increased osteogenesis, decreased adipogenesis, and accelerated fracture healing.
      Leptin increased adipogenesis and reduced osteogenesis by activating Jak2/Stat3
      signaling in bone marrow stromal cells. A high-fat diet increased adipogenesis
      and reduced osteogenesis in limb bones from wild-type mice, but not from
      Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice. This reflected local effects of LepR on osteogenesis
      and adipogenesis by bone marrow stromal cells and systemic effects on bone
      resorption. Leptin/LepR signaling regulates adipogenesis and osteogenesis by
      mesenchymal stromal cells in the bone marrow in response to diet and adiposity.

AB  - Direct induction of induced hepatocytes (iHeps) from fibroblasts holds potential 
      as a strategy for regenerative medicine but until now has only been shown in
      culture settings. Here, we describe in vivo iHep formation using transcription
      factor induction and genetic fate tracing in mouse models of chronic liver
      disease. We show that ectopic expression of the transcription factors FOXA3,
      GATA4, HNF1A, and HNF4A from a polycistronic lentiviral vector converts mouse
      myofibroblasts into cells with a hepatocyte phenotype. In vivo expression of the 
      same set of transcription factors from a p75 neurotrophin receptor peptide
      (p75NTRp)-tagged adenovirus enabled the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from 
      myofibroblasts in fibrotic mouse livers and reduced liver fibrosis. We have
      therefore been able to convert pro-fibrogenic myofibroblasts in the liver into
      hepatocyte-like cells with positive functional benefits. This direct in vivo
      reprogramming approach may open new avenues for the treatment of chronic liver
      disease.

AB  - Pluripotent genomes are folded in a topological hierarchy that reorganizes during
      differentiation. The extent to which chromatin architecture is reconfigured
      during somatic cell reprogramming is poorly understood. Here we integrate
      fine-resolution architecture maps with epigenetic marks and gene expression in
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and NPC-derived
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We find that most pluripotency genes
      reconnect to target enhancers during reprogramming. Unexpectedly, some NPC
      interactions around pluripotency genes persist in our iPSC clone. Pluripotency
      genes engaged in both "fully-reprogrammed" and "persistent-NPC" interactions
      exhibit over/undershooting of target expression levels in iPSCs. Additionally, we
      identify a subset of "poorly reprogrammed" interactions that do not reconnect in 
      iPSCs and display only partially recovered, ESC-specific CTCF occupancy. 2i/LIF
      can abrogate persistent-NPC interactions, recover poorly reprogrammed
      interactions, reinstate CTCF occupancy, and restore expression levels. Our
      results demonstrate that iPSC genomes can exhibit imperfectly rewired 3D-folding 
      linked to inaccurately reprogrammed gene expression.

AB  - It is extremely rare for a single experiment to be so impactful and timely that
      it shapes and forecasts the experiments of the next decade. Here, we review how
      two such experiments-the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) and the development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology-have fundamentally reshaped
      our approach to biomedical research, stem cell biology, and human genetics. We
      will also highlight the previous knowledge that iPSC and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies
      were built on as this groundwork demonstrated the need for solutions and the
      benefits that these technologies provided and set the stage for their success.

      anemia (FA) may improve current therapeutic strategies. Zhang et al. identify
      hyperactive TGF-beta signaling as an underlying cause of BMF in FA mice and
      patient cells, whose inhibition promotes DNA repair and hematopoietic stem and

AB  - The genetic integrity of iPSCs is an important consideration for therapeutic
      application. In this study, we examine the accumulation of somatic mitochondrial 
      genome (mtDNA) mutations in skin fibroblasts, blood, and iPSCs derived from young
      and elderly subjects (24-72 years). We found that pooled skin and blood mtDNA
      contained low heteroplasmic point mutations, but a panel of ten individual iPSC
      lines from each tissue or clonally expanded fibroblasts carried an elevated load 
      of heteroplasmic or homoplasmic mutations, suggesting that somatic mutations
      randomly arise within individual cells but are not detectable in whole tissues.
      The frequency of mtDNA defects in iPSCs increased with age, and many mutations
      were non-synonymous or resided in RNA coding genes and thus can lead to
      respiratory defects. Our results highlight a need to monitor mtDNA mutations in
      iPSCs, especially those generated from older patients, and to examine the
      metabolic status of iPSCs destined for clinical applications.

AB  - Cellular reprogramming using chemically defined conditions, without genetic
      manipulation, is a promising approach for generating clinically relevant cell
      types for regenerative medicine and drug discovery. However, small-molecule
      approaches for inducing lineage-specific stem cells from somatic cells across
      lineage boundaries have been challenging. Here, we report highly efficient
      reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced neural stem cell-like cells
      (ciNSLCs) using a cocktail of nine components (M9). The resulting ciNSLCs closely
      resemble primary neural stem cells molecularly and functionally. Transcriptome
      analysis revealed that M9 induces a gradual and specific conversion of
      fibroblasts toward a neural fate. During reprogramming specific transcription
      factors such as Elk1 and Gli2 that are downstream of M9-induced signaling
      pathways bind and activate endogenous master neural genes to specify neural
      identity. Our study provides an effective chemical approach for generating neural
      stem cells from mouse fibroblasts and reveals mechanistic insights into
      underlying reprogramming processes.

TI  - TGF-beta Inhibition Rescues Hematopoietic Stem Cell Defects and Bone Marrow
      Failure in Fanconi Anemia.

AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited DNA repair disorder characterized by
      progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
      (HSPC) attrition. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of BMF could
      improve the therapeutic options for FA patients. Using a genome-wide shRNA screen
      in human FA fibroblasts, we identify transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
      pathway-mediated growth suppression as a cause of BMF in FA. Blocking the
      TGF-beta pathway improves the survival of FA cells and rescues the proliferative 
      and functional defects of HSPCs derived from FA mice and FA patients. Inhibition 
      of TGF-beta signaling in FA HSPCs results in elevated homologous recombination
      (HR) repair with a concomitant decrease in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ),
      accounting for the improvement in cellular growth. Together, our results suggest 
      that elevated TGF-beta signaling contributes to BMF in FA by impairing HSPC
      function and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of FA.

AB  - The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil has been linked to substantial
      increases in fetal abnormalities and microcephaly. However, information about the
      underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms connecting viral infection to these 
      defects remains limited. In this study we have examined the expression of
      receptors implicated in cell entry of several enveloped viruses including ZIKV
      across diverse cell types in the developing brain. Using single-cell RNA-seq and 
      immunohistochemistry, we found that the candidate viral entry receptor AXL is
      highly expressed by human radial glial cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and 
      microglia in developing human cortex and by progenitor cells in developing
      retina. We also show that AXL expression in radial glia is conserved in
      developing mouse and ferret cortex and in human stem cell-derived cerebral
      organoids, highlighting multiple experimental systems that could be applied to
      study mechanisms of ZIKV infectivity and effects on brain development.

AB  - Divergent lncRNAs that are transcribed in the opposite direction to nearby
      protein-coding genes comprise a significant proportion ( approximately 20%) of
      total lncRNAs in mammalian genomes. Through genome-wide analysis, we found that
      the distribution of this lncRNA class strongly correlates with essential
      developmental regulatory genes. In pluripotent cells, divergent lncRNAs regulate 
      the transcription of nearby genes. As an example, the divergent lncRNA Evx1as
      promotes transcription of its neighbor gene, EVX1, and regulates mesendodermal
      differentiation. At a single-cell level, early broad expression of Evx1as is
      followed by a rapid, high-level transcription of EVX1, supporting the idea that
      Evx1as plays an upstream role to facilitate EVX1 transcription. Mechanistically, 
      Evx1as RNA binds to regulatory sites on chromatin, promotes an active chromatin
      state, and interacts with Mediator. Based on our analyses, we propose that the
      biological function of thousands of uncharacterized lncRNAs of this class may be 
      inferred from the role of their neighboring adjacent genes.

AB  - Forced expression of reprogramming factors can convert somatic cells into induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we studied genome topology dynamics during
      reprogramming of different somatic cell types with highly distinct genome
      conformations. We find large-scale topologically associated domain (TAD)
      repositioning and alterations of tissue-restricted genomic neighborhoods and
      chromatin loops, effectively erasing the somatic-cell-specific genome structures 
      while establishing an embryonic stem-cell-like 3D genome. Yet, early passage
      iPSCs carry topological hallmarks that enable recognition of their cell of
      origin. These hallmarks are not remnants of somatic chromosome topologies.
      Instead, the distinguishing topological features are acquired during
      reprogramming, as we also find for cell-of-origin-dependent gene expression
      patterns.

AB  - The suspected link between infection by Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging
      flavivirus, and microcephaly is an urgent global health concern. The direct
      target cells of ZIKV in the developing human fetus are not clear. Here we show
      that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells 
      efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced
      pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles.
      Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle
      progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis
      of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of
      cell-cycle-related pathways. Our results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. 
      In addition, we establish a tractable experimental model system to investigate
      the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a
      platform to screen therapeutic compounds.

TI  - SIRT6 Controls Hematopoietic Stem Cell Homeostasis through Epigenetic Regulation 
      of Wnt Signaling.

AB  - Proper regulation of Wnt signaling is critical for the maintenance of
      hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. The epigenetic regulation of Wnt
      signaling in HSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the histone
      deacetylase SIRT6 regulates HSC homeostasis through the transcriptional
      repression of Wnt target genes. Sirt6 deletion promoted HSC proliferation through
      aberrant activation of Wnt signaling. SIRT6-deficient HSCs exhibited impaired
      self-renewal ability in serial competitive transplantation assay.
      Mechanistically, SIRT6 inhibits the transcription of Wnt target genes by
      interacting with transcription factor LEF1 and deacetylating histone 3 at lysine 
      56. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt pathway rescued the aberrant
      proliferation and functional defect in SIRT6-deficient HSCs. Taken together,
      these findings disclose a new link between SIRT6 and Wnt signaling in the
      regulation of adult stem cell homeostasis and self-renewal capacity.

TI  - Dclk1 Defines Quiescent Pancreatic Progenitors that Promote Injury-Induced
      Regeneration and Tumorigenesis.

AB  - The existence of adult pancreatic progenitor cells has been debated. While some
      favor the concept of facultative progenitors involved in homeostasis and repair, 
      neither a location nor markers for such cells have been defined. Using genetic
      lineage tracing, we show that Doublecortin-like kinase-1 (Dclk1) labels a rare
      population of long-lived, quiescent pancreatic cells. In vitro, Dclk1+ cells
      proliferate readily and sustain pancreatic organoid growth. In vivo, Dclk1+ cells
      are necessary for pancreatic regeneration following injury and chronic
      inflammation. Accordingly, their loss has detrimental effects after
      cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Expression of mutant Kras in Dclk1+ cells does not
      affect their quiescence or longevity. However, experimental pancreatitis converts
      Kras mutant Dclk1+ cells into potent cancer-initiating cells. As a potential
      effector of Kras, Dclk1 contributes functionally to the pathogenesis of
      pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these observations indicate that Dclk1 marks
      quiescent pancreatic progenitors that are candidates for the origin of pancreatic
      cancer.

AB  - Widespread application of beta cell replacement to obtain insulin independence in
      people with type 1 diabetes requires an unlimited source of insulin-producing
      cells and the ability to block the pathological immune response. Recent reports
      in Nature Medicine and Nature Biotechnology present a creative bioengineering
      strategy for achieving these goals.

AB  - Variation in cerebral cortex size and complexity is thought to contribute to
      differences in cognitive ability between humans and other animals. Here we
      compare cortical progenitor cell output in humans and three nonhuman primates
      using directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in adherent
      two-dimensional (2D) and organoid three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. Clonal 
      lineage analysis showed that primate cortical progenitors proliferate for a
      protracted period of time, during which they generate early-born neurons, in
      contrast to rodents, where this expansion phase largely ceases before
      neurogenesis begins. The extent of this additional cortical progenitor expansion 
      differs among primates, leading to differences in the number of neurons generated
      by each progenitor cell. We found that this mechanism for controlling cortical
      size is regulated cell autonomously in culture, suggesting that primate cerebral 
      cortex size is regulated at least in part at the level of individual cortical
      progenitor cell clonal output.

AB  - Mammals have partially lost the extensive regenerative capabilities of some
      vertebrates, possibly as a result of chromatin-remodeling mechanisms that enforce
      terminal differentiation. Here, we show that deleting the SWI/SNF component
      Arid1a substantially improves mammalian regeneration. Arid1a expression is
      suppressed in regenerating tissues, and genetic deletion of Arid1a increases
      tissue repair following an array of injuries. Arid1a deficiency in the liver
      increases proliferation, reduces tissue damage and fibrosis, and improves organ
      function following surgical resection and chemical injuries. Hepatocyte-specific 
      deletion is also sufficient to increase proliferation and regeneration without
      excessive overgrowth, and global Arid1a disruption potentiates soft tissue
      healing in the ear. We show that Arid1a loss reprograms chromatin to restrict
      promoter access by transcription factors such as C/ebpalpha, which enforces
      differentiation, and E2F4, which suppresses cell-cycle re-entry. Thus, epigenetic
      reprogramming mediated by deletion of a single gene improves mammalian
      regeneration and suggests strategies to promote tissue repair after injury.

TI  - MLL1 Inhibition Reprograms Epiblast Stem Cells to Naive Pluripotency.

AB  - The interconversion between naive and primed pluripotent states is accompanied by
      drastic epigenetic rearrangements. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic
      epigenetic events can drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency or if distinct
      chromatin states are instead simply a reflection of discrete pluripotent states. 
      Here, we show that blocking histone H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 activity with the
      small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 reprograms mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to 
      naive pluripotency. This reversion is highly efficient and synchronized, with
      more than 50% of treated EpiSCs exhibiting features of naive embryonic stem cells
      (ESCs) within 3 days. Reverted ESCs reactivate the silenced X chromosome and
      contribute to embryos following blastocyst injection, generating
      germline-competent chimeras. Importantly, blocking MLL1 leads to global
      redistribution of H3K4me1 at enhancers and represses lineage determinant factors 
      and EpiSC markers, which indirectly regulate ESC transcription circuitry. These
      findings show that discrete perturbation of H3K4 methylation is sufficient to
      drive reprogramming to naive pluripotency.

TI  - CD82/KAI1 Maintains the Dormancy of Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cells through
      Interaction with DARC-Expressing Macrophages.

AB  - Hematopoiesis is regulated by crosstalk between long-term repopulating
      hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and supporting niche cells in the bone marrow 
      (BM). Here, we examine the role of CD82/KAI1 in niche-mediated LT-HSC
      maintenance. We found that CD82/KAI1 is expressed predominantly on LT-HSCs and
      rarely on other hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). In Cd82(-/-) mice,
      LT-HSCs were selectively lost as they exited from quiescence and differentiated. 
      Mechanistically, CD82-based TGF-beta1/Smad3 signaling leads to induction of CDK
      inhibitors and cell-cycle inhibition. The CD82 binding partner DARC/CD234 is
      expressed on macrophages and stabilizes CD82 on LT-HSCs, promoting their
      quiescence. When DARC(+) BM macrophages were ablated, the level of surface CD82
      on LT-HSCs decreased, leading to cell-cycle entry, proliferation, and
      differentiation. A similar interaction appears to be relevant for human HSPCs.
      Thus, CD82 is a functional surface marker of LT-HSCs that maintains quiescence
      through interaction with DARC-expressing macrophages in the BM stem cell niche.

AB  - Developing technologies for efficient and scalable disruption of gene expression 
      will provide powerful tools for studying gene function, developmental pathways,
      and disease mechanisms. Here, we develop clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) to repress gene expression in human
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CRISPRi, in which a doxycycline-inducible
      deactivated Cas9 is fused to a KRAB repression domain, can specifically and
      reversibly inhibit gene expression in iPSCs and iPSC-derived cardiac progenitors,
      cardiomyocytes, and T lymphocytes. This gene repression system is tunable and has
      the potential to silence single alleles. Compared with CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn),
      CRISPRi gene repression is more efficient and homogenous across cell populations.
      The CRISPRi system in iPSCs provides a powerful platform to perform genome-scale 
      screens in a wide range of iPSC-derived cell types, dissect developmental
      pathways, and model disease.

TI  - A Single CRISPR-Cas9 Deletion Strategy that Targets the Majority of DMD Patients

AB  - Mutations in DMD disrupt the reading frame, prevent dystrophin translation, and
      cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 platform 
      applicable to 60% of DMD patient mutations. We applied the platform to
      DMD-derived hiPSCs where successful deletion and non-homologous end joining of up
      to 725 kb reframed the DMD gene. This is the largest CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
      deletion shown to date in DMD. Use of hiPSCs allowed evaluation of dystrophin in 
      disease-relevant cell types. Cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle myotubes derived 
      from reframed hiPSC clonal lines had restored dystrophin protein. The internally 
      deleted dystrophin was functional as demonstrated by improved membrane integrity 
      and restoration of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex in vitro and in vivo.
      Furthermore, miR31 was reduced upon reframing, similar to observations in Becker 
      muscular dystrophy. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a single
      CRISPR pair to correct the reading frame for the majority of DMD patients.

      Stress in Fetal Liver.

AB  - During development, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo a rapid expansion in 
      the fetal liver (FL) before settling in the adult bone marrow. We recently
      reported that proliferating adult HSCs are vulnerable to ER stress caused by
      accumulation of mis-folded proteins. Here, we find that FL-HSCs, despite an
      increased protein synthesis rate and a requirement for protein folding, do not
      upregulate ER chaperones. Instead, bile acids (BAs), secreted from maternal and
      fetal liver, coordinate to serve as chemical chaperones. Taurocholic acid, the
      major BA in FL, supports growth of HSCs in vitro by inhibiting protein
      aggregation. In vivo, reducing BA levels leads to ER stress elevation and
      accumulation of aggregated proteins and significantly decreases the number of
      FL-HSCs. Taken together, these findings reveal that BA alleviation of ER stress
      is a mechanism required for HSC expansion during fetal hematopoiesis.

AB  - Direct reprogramming of induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) suffers from low efficiency
      and requires extensive epigenetic repatterning, although the underlying
      mechanisms are largely unknown. To address these issues, we screened for
      epigenetic regulators of iCM reprogramming and found that reducing levels of the 
      polycomb complex gene Bmi1 significantly enhanced induction of beating iCMs from 
      neonatal and adult mouse fibroblasts. The inhibitory role of Bmi1 in iCM
      reprogramming is mediated through direct interactions with regulatory regions of 
      cardiogenic genes, rather than regulation of cell proliferation. Reduced Bmi1
      expression corresponded with increased levels of the active histone mark H3K4me3 
      and reduced levels of repressive H2AK119ub at cardiogenic loci, and de-repression
      of cardiogenic gene expression during iCM conversion. Furthermore, Bmi1 deletion 
      could substitute for Gata4 during iCM reprogramming. Thus, Bmi1 acts as a
      critical epigenetic barrier to iCM production. Bypassing this barrier simplifies 
      iCM generation and increases yield, potentially streamlining iCM production for
      therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Stem cell-based approaches to cardiac regeneration are increasingly viable
      strategies for treating heart failure. Generating abundant and functional
      autologous cells for transplantation in such a setting, however, remains a
      significant challenge. Here, we isolated a cell population with extensive
      proliferation capacity and restricted cardiovascular differentiation potentials
      during cardiac transdifferentiation of mouse fibroblasts. These induced
      expandable cardiovascular progenitor cells (ieCPCs) proliferated extensively for 
      more than 18 passages in chemically defined conditions, with 10(5) starting
      fibroblasts robustly producing 10(16) ieCPCs. ieCPCs expressed cardiac signature 
      genes and readily differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes (CMs),
      endothelial cells (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro, even after
      long-term expansion. When transplanted into mouse hearts following myocardial
      infarction, ieCPCs spontaneously differentiated into CMs, ECs, and SMCs and
      improved cardiac function for up to 12 weeks after transplantation. Thus, ieCPCs 
      are a powerful system to study cardiovascular specification and provide
      strategies for regenerative medicine in the heart.

AB  - Defined genetic models based on human pluripotent stem cells have opened new
      avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and drug screening. Many of these
      models assume cell-autonomous mechanisms of disease but it is possible that
      disease phenotypes or drug responses will only be evident if all cellular and
      extracellular components of a tissue are present and functionally mature. To
      derive optimal benefit from such models, complex multicellular structures with
      vascular components that mimic tissue niches will thus likely be necessary. Here 
      we consider emerging research creating human tissue mimics and provide some
      recommendations for moving the field forward.

AB  - Mitochondria play important roles in homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells
      (HSCs), which exhibit clonal heterogeneity in their lymphoid and myeloid
      production. Recently in Nature, Luchsinger et al. (2016) showed that
      mitochondria-ER tethering maintains lymphoid-biased HSCs through
      calcium-dependent NFAT signaling, providing molecular insights into the basis of 
      HSC heterogeneity.

AB  - In vitro generation of functional gametes is a promising approach for treating
      infertility, although faithful replication of meiosis has proven to be a
      substantial obstacle to deriving haploid gamete cells in culture. Here we report 
      complete in vitro meiosis from embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived primordial germ 
      cells (PGCLCs). Co-culture of PGCLCs with neonatal testicular somatic cells and
      sequential exposure to morphogens and sex hormones reproduced key hallmarks of
      meiosis, including erasure of genetic imprinting, chromosomal synapsis and
      recombination, and correct nuclear DNA and chromosomal content in the resulting
      haploid cells. Intracytoplasmic injection of the resulting spermatid-like cells
      into oocytes produced viable and fertile offspring, showing that this robust
      stepwise approach can functionally recapitulate male gametogenesis in vitro.
      These findings provide a platform for investigating meiotic mechanisms and the
      potential generation of human haploid spermatids in vitro.

AB  - The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium is a highly regenerative tissue with the
      potential to provide a renewable source of insulin(+) cells after undergoing
      cellular reprogramming. Here, we show that cells of the antral stomach have a
      previously unappreciated propensity for conversion into functional
      insulin-secreting cells. Native antral endocrine cells share a surprising degree 
      of transcriptional similarity with pancreatic beta cells, and expression of beta 
      cell reprogramming factors in vivo converts antral cells efficiently into
      insulin(+) cells with close molecular and functional similarity to beta cells.
      Induced GI insulin(+) cells can suppress hyperglycemia in a diabetic mouse model 
      for at least 6 months and regenerate rapidly after ablation. Reprogramming of
      antral stomach cells assembled into bioengineered mini-organs in vitro yielded
      transplantable units that also suppressed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice,
      highlighting the potential for development of engineered stomach tissues as a
      renewable source of functional beta cells for glycemic control.

AB  - Several studies have reported reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced
      cardiomyocytes; however, reprogramming into proliferative induced cardiac
      progenitor cells (iCPCs) remains to be accomplished. Here we report that a
      combination of 11 or 5 cardiac factors along with canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT
      signaling reprogrammed adult mouse cardiac, lung, and tail tip fibroblasts into
      iCPCs. The iCPCs were cardiac mesoderm-restricted progenitors that could be
      expanded extensively while maintaining multipotency to differentiate into
      cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover,
      iCPCs injected into the cardiac crescent of mouse embryos differentiated into
      cardiomyocytes. iCPCs transplanted into the post-myocardial infarction mouse
      heart improved survival and differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle
      cells, and endothelial cells. Lineage reprogramming of adult somatic cells into
      iCPCs provides a scalable cell source for drug discovery, disease modeling, and
      cardiac regenerative therapy.

AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) typically exhibit "primed" pluripotency,
      analogous to stem cells derived from the mouse post-implantation epiblast. This
      has led to a search for growth conditions that support self-renewal of hESCs akin
      to hypomethylated naive epiblast cells in human pre-implantation embryos. We have
      discovered that reverting primed hESCs to a hypomethylated naive state or
      deriving a new hESC line under naive conditions results in the establishment of
      Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen 4 (SSEA4)-negative hESC lines with a
      transcriptional program resembling the human pre-implantation epiblast. In
      contrast, we discovered that the methylome of naive hESCs in vitro is distinct
      from that of the human epiblast in vivo with loss of DNA methylation at primary
      imprints and a lost "memory" of the methylation state of the human oocyte. This
      failure to recover the naive epiblast methylation landscape appears to be a
      consistent feature of self-renewing hypomethylated naive hESCs in vitro.

AB  - Cardiac induction requires stepwise integration of BMP and WNT pathway activity. 
      Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are developmentally and clinically relevant
      for studying the poorly understood molecular mechanisms downstream of these
      cascades. We show that BMP and WNT signaling drive cardiac specification by
      removing sequential roadblocks that otherwise redirect hESC differentiation
      toward competing fates, rather than activating a cardiac program per se. First,
      BMP and WNT signals pattern mesendoderm through cooperative repression of SOX2, a
      potent mesoderm antagonist. BMP signaling promotes miRNA-877 maturation to induce
      SOX2 mRNA degradation, while WNT-driven EOMES induction transcriptionally
      represses SOX2. Following mesoderm formation, cardiac differentiation requires
      inhibition of WNT activity. We found that WNT inhibition serves to restrict
      expression of anti-cardiac regulators MSX1 and CDX2/1. Conversely, their
      simultaneous disruption partially abrogates the requirement for WNT inactivation.
      These results suggest that human cardiac induction depends on multi-stage
      repression of alternate lineages, with implications for deriving expandable
      cardiac stem cells.

AB  - Despite the widespread interest in direct neuronal reprogramming, the mechanisms 
      underpinning fate conversion remain largely unknown. Our study revealed a
      critical time point after which cells either successfully convert into neurons or
      succumb to cell death. Co-transduction with Bcl-2 greatly improved negotiation of
      this critical point by faster neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, mutants
      with reduced or no affinity for Bax demonstrated that Bcl-2 exerts this effect by
      an apoptosis-independent mechanism. Consistent with a caspase-independent role,
      ferroptosis inhibitors potently increased neuronal reprogramming by inhibiting
      lipid peroxidation occurring during fate conversion. Genome-wide expression
      analysis confirmed that treatments promoting neuronal reprogramming elicit an
      anti-oxidative stress response. Importantly, co-expression of Bcl-2 and
      anti-oxidative treatments leads to an unprecedented improvement in
      glial-to-neuron conversion after traumatic brain injury in vivo, underscoring the
      relevance of these pathways in cellular reprograming irrespective of cell type in
      vitro and in vivo.

TI  - A miR-34a-Numb Feedforward Loop Triggered by Inflammation Regulates Asymmetric
      Stem Cell Division in Intestine and Colon Cancer.
PG  - 189-202
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2016.01.006 [doi]
LID - S1934-5909(16)00007-2 [pii]
AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs can initiate asymmetric division, but
      whether microRNA and protein cell fate determinants coordinate with each other
      remains unclear. Here, we show that miR-34a directly suppresses Numb in
      early-stage colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs), forming an incoherent feedforward
      loop (IFFL) targeting Notch to separate stem and non-stem cell fates robustly.
      Perturbation of the IFFL leads to a new intermediate cell population with plastic
      and ambiguous identity. Lgr5+ mouse intestinal/colon stem cells (ISCs)
      predominantly undergo symmetric division but turn on asymmetric division to curb 
      the number of ISCs when proinflammatory response causes excessive proliferation. 
      Deletion of miR-34a inhibits asymmetric division and exacerbates Lgr5+ ISC
      proliferation under such stress. Collectively, our data indicate that microRNA
      and protein cell fate determinants coordinate to enhance robustness of cell fate 
      decision, and they provide a safeguard mechanism against stem cell proliferation 
      induced by inflammation or oncogenic mutation.

AB  - A variety of neurological disorders are attractive targets for stem and
      progenitor cell-based therapy. Yet many conditions are not, whether by virtue of 
      an inhospitable disease environment, poorly understood pathophysiology, or poor
      alignment of donor cell capabilities with patient needs. Moreover, some disorders
      may be medically feasible targets but are not practicable, in light of already
      available treatments, poor risk-benefit and cost-benefit profiles, or resource
      limitations. This Perspective seeks to define those neurological conditions most 
      appropriate for cell replacement therapy by considering its potential efficacy
      and clinical feasibility in those disorders, as well as potential impediments to 
      its application.

AB  - Administering adjuvant chemotherapy to stage II colon cancer patients is
      controversial due to limited benefit observed for this subpopulation. Recently,
      Dalerba et al. (2016) identified a subgroup of stage II patients that might
      benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based on lack of CDX2 expression in their
      cancer stem cells.

AB  - Stem cells integrate spatiotemporal cues, including the mechanical properties of 
      their microenvironment, into their fate decisions. Chaudhuri et al. (2015) show
      that the ability of the extracellular matrix to dissipate cell-induced forces,
      referred to as stress-relaxation, is a key mechanical signal influencing stem
      cell fate and function.

AB  - We are only beginning to understand the higher-order chromatin structure of
      pluripotent stem cells and its relevance to cell fate. Three recent studies used 
      different approaches to reconstruct the 3D chromatin landscape of naive and
      primed pluripotent cells, unveiling common features as well as differences
      between these two states.

AB  - Satellite cells comprise a pool of quiescent stem cells that repair muscle
      damage, but the mechanisms enforcing their quiescence are poorly defined. In this
      issue of Cell Stem Cell, Boonsanay et al. (2016) show that the histone
      methyltransferase Suv4-20H1 maintains satellite cell quiescence by promoting a
      heterochromatic state through transcriptional repression of the myogenic master
      regulator MyoD.

AB  - The in vivo behaviors of skeletal muscle stem cells, i.e., satellite cells,
      during homeostasis and after injury are poorly understood. In this issue of Cell 
      Stem Cell, Webster et al. (2016) now perform a tour de force intravital
      microscopic analysis of this population, showing that "ghost fiber" remnants act 
      as scaffolds to guide satellite cell divisions after injury.

AB  - The mechanisms by which imprinted loci control activity of hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSCs) are not known. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Qian et al. (2016)
      demonstrate that non-coding RNAs expressed by the maternal-imprinted locus
      Dlk1-Gtl2 maintain HSC self-renewal through the inhibition of PI3K-mTOR
      signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and metabolic activity.

AB  - Intestinal crypts display robust regeneration upon injury. The relatively rare
      secretory precursors can replace lost stem cells, but it is unknown if the
      abundant enterocyte progenitors that express the Alkaline phosphate intestinal
      (Alpi) gene also have this capacity. We created an Alpi-IRES-CreERT2
      (Alpi(CreER)) knockin allele for lineage tracing. Marked clones consist entirely 
      of enterocytes and are all lost from villus tips within days. Genetic
      fate-mapping of Alpi(+) cells before or during targeted ablation of
      Lgr5-expressing stem cells generated numerous long-lived crypt-villus "ribbons," 
      indicative of dedifferentiation of enterocyte precursors into Lgr5(+) stems. By
      single-cell analysis of dedifferentiating enterocytes, we observed the generation
      of Paneth-like cells and proliferative stem cells. We conclude that the highly
      proliferative, short-lived enterocyte precursors serve as a large reservoir of
      potential stem cells during crypt regeneration.

AB  - How resident stem cells and their immediate progenitors rebuild tissues of
      pre-injury organization and size for proportional regeneration is not well
      understood. Using 3D, time-lapse intravital imaging for direct visualization of
      the muscle regeneration process in live mice, we report that extracellular matrix
      remnants from injured skeletal muscle fibers, "ghost fibers," govern muscle
      stem/progenitor cell behaviors during proportional regeneration. Stem cells were 
      immobile and quiescent without injury whereas their activated progenitors
      migrated and divided after injury. Unexpectedly, divisions and migration were
      primarily bi-directionally oriented along the ghost fiber longitudinal axis,
      allowing for spreading of progenitors throughout ghost fibers. Re-orienting ghost
      fibers impacted myogenic progenitors' migratory paths and division planes,
      causing disorganization of regenerated muscle fibers. We conclude that ghost
      fibers are autonomous, architectural units necessary for proportional
      regeneration after tissue injury. This finding reinforces the need to fabricate
      bioengineered matrices that mimic living tissue matrices for tissue regeneration 
      therapy.

AB  - In this study, we describe the 3D chromosome regulatory landscape of human naive 
      and primed embryonic stem cells. To devise this map, we identified
      transcriptional enhancers and insulators in these cells and placed them within
      the context of cohesin-associated CTCF-CTCF loops using cohesin ChIA-PET data.
      The CTCF-CTCF loops we identified form a chromosomal framework of insulated
      neighborhoods, which in turn form topologically associating domains (TADs) that
      are largely preserved during the transition between the naive and primed states. 
      Regulatory changes in enhancer-promoter interactions occur within insulated
      neighborhoods during cell state transition. The CTCF anchor regions we identified
      are conserved across species, influence gene expression, and are a frequent site 
      of mutations in cancer cells, underscoring their functional importance in
      cellular regulation. These 3D regulatory maps of human pluripotent cells
      therefore provide a foundation for future interrogation of the relationships
      between chromosome structure and gene control in development and disease.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) frequently acquire chromosomal aberrations
      such as aneuploidy in culture. These aberrations progressively increase over time
      and may compromise the properties and clinical utility of the cells. The
      underlying mechanisms that drive initial genomic instability and its continued
      progression are largely unknown. Here, we show that aneuploid hPSCs undergo DNA
      replication stress, resulting in defective chromosome condensation and
      segregation. Aneuploid hPSCs show altered levels of actin cytoskeletal genes
      controlled by the transcription factor SRF, and overexpression of SRF rescues
      impaired chromosome condensation and segregation defects in aneuploid hPSCs.
      Furthermore, SRF downregulation in diploid hPSCs induces replication stress and
      perturbed condensation similar to that seen in aneuploid cells. Together, these
      results suggest that decreased SRF expression induces replicative stress and
      chromosomal condensation defects that underlie the ongoing chromosomal
      instability seen in aneuploid hPSCs. A similar mechanism may also operate during 
      initiation of instability in diploid cells.

      Facultative Heterochromatin Formation.

AB  - Skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are required for regeneration of adult muscle 
      following injury, a response that demands activation of mainly quiescent MuSCs.
      Despite the need for dynamic regulation of MuSC quiescence, relatively little is 
      known about the determinants of this property. Here, we show that Suv4-20h1, an
      H4K20 dimethyltransferase, controls MuSC quiescence by promoting formation of
      facultative heterochromatin (fHC). Deletion of Suv4-20h1 reduces fHC and induces 
      transcriptional activation and repositioning of the MyoD locus away from the
      heterochromatic nuclear periphery. These effects promote MuSC activation,
      resulting in stem cell depletion and impaired long-term muscle regeneration.
      Genetic reduction of MyoD expression rescues fHC formation and lost MuSC
      quiescence, restoring muscle regeneration capacity in Suv4-20h1 mutants.
      Together, these findings reveal that Suv4-20h1 actively regulates MuSC quiescence
      via fHC formation and control of the MyoD locus, thereby guarding and preserving 
      the stem cell pool over a lifetime.

AB  - Complex regulatory networks regulate stem cell behavior and contributions to
      tissue growth, repair, and homeostasis. A full understanding of the networks
      controlling stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, however, has not yet been
      realized. To systematically dissect these networks and identify their components,
      we performed an unbiased, transcriptome-wide in vivo RNAi screen in female
      Drosophila germline stem cells (GSCs). Based on characterized cellular defects,
      we classified 646 identified genes into phenotypic and functional groups and
      unveiled a comprehensive set of networks regulating GSC maintenance, survival,
      and differentiation. This analysis revealed an unexpected role for ribosomal
      assembly factors in controlling stem cell cytokinesis. Moreover, our data show
      that the transition from self-renewal to differentiation relies on enhanced
      ribosome biogenesis accompanied by increased protein synthesis. Collectively,
      these results detail the extensive genetic networks that control stem cell
      homeostasis and highlight the intricate regulation of protein synthesis during
      differentiation.

TI  - The Dlk1-Gtl2 Locus Preserves LT-HSC Function by Inhibiting the PI3K-mTOR Pathway
      to Restrict Mitochondrial Metabolism.

AB  - The mammalian imprinted Dlk1-Gtl2 locus produces multiple non-coding RNAs
      (ncRNAs) from the maternally inherited allele, including the largest miRNA
      cluster in the mammalian genome. This locus has characterized functions in some
      types of stem cell, but its role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is unknown.
      Here, we show that the Dlk1-Gtl2 locus plays a critical role in preserving
      long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs). Through transcriptome profiling in 17
      hematopoietic cell types, we found that ncRNAs expressed from the Dlk1-Gtl2 locus
      are predominantly enriched in fetal liver HSCs and the adult LT-HSC population
      and sustain long-term HSC functionality. Mechanistically, the miRNA mega-cluster 
      within the Dlk1-Gtl2 locus suppresses the entire PI3K-mTOR pathway. This
      regulation in turn inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic activity and
      protects LT-HSCs from excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our
      data therefore show that the imprinted Dlk1-Gtl2 locus preserves LT-HSC function 
      by restricting mitochondrial metabolism.

TI  - Foxd3 Promotes Exit from Naive Pluripotency through Enhancer Decommissioning and 
      Inhibits Germline Specification.

AB  - Following implantation, mouse epiblast cells transit from a naive to a primed
      state in which they are competent for both somatic and primordial germ cell (PGC)
      specification. Using mouse embryonic stem cells as an in vitro model to study the
      transcriptional regulatory principles orchestrating peri-implantation
      development, here we show that the transcription factor Foxd3 is necessary for
      exit from naive pluripotency and progression to a primed pluripotent state.
      During this transition, Foxd3 acts as a repressor that dismantles a significant
      fraction of the naive pluripotency expression program through decommissioning of 
      active enhancers associated with key naive pluripotency and early germline genes.
      Subsequently, Foxd3 needs to be silenced in primed pluripotent cells to allow
      re-activation of relevant genes required for proper PGC specification. Our
      findings therefore uncover a cycle of activation and deactivation of Foxd3
      required for exit from naive pluripotency and subsequent PGC specification.

AB  - Early development is governed by the ability of pluripotent cells to retain the
      full range of developmental potential and respond accurately to developmental
      cues. This property is achieved in large part by the temporal and contextual
      regulation of gene expression by enhancers. Here, we evaluated regulation of
      enhancer activity during differentiation of embryonic stem to epiblast cells and 
      uncovered the forkhead transcription factor FOXD3 as a major regulator of the
      developmental potential of both pluripotent states. FOXD3 bound to distinct sites
      in the two cell types priming enhancers through a dual-functional mechanism. It
      recruited the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex ATPase BRG1 to promote
      nucleosome removal while concurrently inhibiting maximal activation of the same
      enhancers by recruiting histone deacetylases1/2. Thus, FOXD3 prepares cognate
      genes for future maximal expression by establishing and simultaneously repressing
      enhancer activity. Through switching of target sites, FOXD3 modulates the
      developmental potential of pluripotent cells as they differentiate.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with knockout or mutant alleles can be
      generated using custom-engineered nucleases. Transcription activator-like
      effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 nucleases are the most commonly employed technologies for
      editing hPSC genomes. In this Protocol Review, we provide a brief overview of
      custom-engineered nucleases in the context of gene editing in hPSCs with a focus 
      on the application of TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9. We will highlight the advantages
      and disadvantages of each method and discuss theoretical and technical
      considerations for experimental design.

AB  - Biophysical signals act as potent regulators of stem cell function, lineage
      commitment, and epigenetic status. In recent years, synthetic biomaterials have
      been used to study a wide range of outside-in signaling events, and it is now
      well appreciated that material cues modulate the epigenome. Here, we review the
      role of extracellular signals in guiding stem cell behavior via epigenetic
      regulation, and we stress the role of physicochemical material properties as an
      often-overlooked modulator of intracellular signaling. We also highlight
      promising new research tools for ongoing interrogation of the stem cell-material 
      interface.

AB  - Organoid systems leverage the self-organizing properties of stem cells to create 
      diverse multi-cellular tissue proxies. Most organoid models only represent single
      or partial components of a tissue, and it is often difficult to control the cell 
      type, organization, and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions within these systems. 
      Herein, we discuss basic approaches to generate stem cell-based organoids, their 
      advantages and limitations, and how bioengineering strategies can be used to
      steer the cell composition and their 3D organization within organoids to further 
      enhance their utility in research and therapies.

      manipulate and integrate spatiotemporal cues across these discrete length scales 
      can improve traditional methods for controlling cell fate.

      development of innovative approaches to expand hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo. 
      One approach reported by Wagner et al. (2016) in this issue of Cell Stem Cell has
      demonstrated dramatic expansion of umbilical cord blood stem cells that promote
      rapid engraftment while maintaining capacity for long-term hematopoiesis.

      Mist1(+) gastric stem cells are supported by a specialized niche composed of
      Cxcl12(+) endothelium and Wnt5a-producing Cxcr4(+) innate lymphoid cells. In
      diffuse-type gastric cancer this perivascular stem cell niche is expanded and can
      be exploited for cancer therapy.

AB  - The potency of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to differentiate into germ
      layer derivatives is conventionally assessed by teratoma induction and in vitro
      differentiation. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Mascetti and Pedersen (2016)
      demonstrate that the human-mouse post-implantation chimera offers an efficient
      avenue to test the germ layer differentiation potential of hPSCs in mouse embryos
      ex vivo.

AB  - Pluripotent stem cells are defined by their capacity to differentiate into all
      three tissue layers that comprise the body. Chimera formation, generated by stem 
      cell transplantation to the embryo, is a stringent assessment of stem cell
      pluripotency. However, the ability of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to
      form embryonic chimeras remains in question. Here we show using a stage-matching 
      approach that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic
      stem cells (hESCs) have the capacity to participate in normal mouse development
      when transplanted into gastrula-stage embryos, providing in vivo functional
      validation of hPSC pluripotency. hiPSCs and hESCs form interspecies chimeras with
      high efficiency, colonize the embryo in a manner predicted from classical
      developmental fate mapping, and differentiate into each of the three primary
      tissue layers. This faithful recapitulation of tissue-specific fate
      post-transplantation underscores the functional potential of hPSCs and provides
      evidence that human-mouse interspecies developmental competency can occur.

TI  - Phase I/II Trial of StemRegenin-1 Expanded Umbilical Cord Blood Hematopoietic
      Stem Cells Supports Testing as a Stand-Alone Graft.

AB  - Clinical application of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a source of hematopoietic
      stem cells for transplantation is limited by low CD34+ cell dose, increased risk 
      of graft failure, and slow hematopoietic recovery. While the cell dose limitation
      is partially mitigated by using two UCB units, larger-dosed single units would be
      preferable. We have evaluated the feasibility and safety of StemRegenin-1 (SR-1),
      an aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist that expands CD34+ cells, by placing one 
      of the two units in expansion culture. SR-1 produced a 330-fold increase in CD34+
      cells and led to engraftment in 17/17 patients at a median of 15 days for
      neutrophils and 49 days for platelets, significantly faster than in patients
      treated with unmanipulated UCB. Taken together, the marked expansion, absence of 
      graft failure, and enhanced hematopoietic recovery support testing of SR-1
      expansion as a stand-alone graft and suggest it may ameliorate a limitation of
      UCB transplant.

      Production from Stem Cells.

AB  - Multipotent and pluripotent stem cells are potential sources for cell and tissue 
      replacement therapies. For example, stem cell-derived red blood cells (RBCs) are 
      a potential alternative to donated blood, but yield and quality remain a
      challenge. Here, we show that application of insight from human population
      genetic studies can enhance RBC production from stem cells. The SH2B3 gene
      encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling and naturally occurring
      loss-of-function variants in this gene increase RBC counts in vivo. Targeted
      suppression of SH2B3 in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
      enhanced the maturation and overall yield of in-vitro-derived RBCs. Moreover,
      inactivation of SH2B3 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem
      cells allowed enhanced erythroid cell expansion with preserved differentiation.
      Our findings therefore highlight the potential for combining human genome
      variation studies with genome editing approaches to improve cell and tissue
      production for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Capturing the full potential of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neurons
      in disease modeling and regenerative medicine requires analysis in complex
      functional systems. Here we establish optogenetic control in human PSC-derived
      spinal motorneurons and show that co-culture of these cells with human
      myoblast-derived skeletal muscle builds a functional all-human neuromuscular
      junction that can be triggered to twitch upon light stimulation. To model
      neuromuscular disease we incubated these co-cultures with IgG from myasthenia
      gravis patients and active complement. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune
      disorder that selectively targets neuromuscular junctions. We saw a reversible
      reduction in the amplitude of muscle contractions, representing a surrogate
      marker for the characteristic loss of muscle strength seen in this disease. The
      ability to recapitulate key aspects of disease pathology and its symptomatic
      treatment suggests that this neuromuscular junction assay has significant
      potential for modeling of neuromuscular disease and regeneration.

AB  - Regeneration of adult tissues depends on somatic stem cells that remain quiescent
      yet are primed to enter a differentiation program. The molecular pathways that
      prevent activation of these cells are not well understood. Using mouse skeletal
      muscle stem cells as a model, we show that a general repression of translation,
      mediated by the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha at
      serine 51 (P-eIF2alpha), is required to maintain the quiescent state. Skeletal
      muscle stem cells unable to phosphorylate eIF2alpha exit quiescence, activate the
      myogenic program, and differentiate, but do not self-renew. P-eIF2alpha ensures
      in part the robust translational silencing of accumulating mRNAs that is needed
      to prevent the activation of muscle stem cells. Additionally,
      P-eIF2alpha-dependent translation of mRNAs regulated by upstream open reading
      frames (uORFs) contributes to the molecular signature of stemness.
      Pharmacological inhibition of eIF2alpha dephosphorylation enhances skeletal
      muscle stem cell self-renewal and regenerative capacity.

TI  - Polycomb Complex PRC1 Preserves Intestinal Stem Cell Identity by Sustaining
      Wnt/beta-Catenin Transcriptional Activity.

AB  - Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are among the most important gatekeepers of 
      establishing and maintaining cell identity in metazoans. PRC1, which plays a
      dominant role in this context, executes its functions via multiple subcomplexes, 
      which all contribute to H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2Aubq). Despite our
      comprehensive knowledge of PRC1-dependent H2Aubq in embryonic stem cells and
      during early development, its role in adult stem cells still remains poorly
      characterized. Here we show that PRC1 activity is required for the integrity of
      the intestinal epithelium, regulating stem cell self-renewal via a
      cell-autonomous mechanism that is independent from Cdkn2a expression. By
      dissecting the PRC1-dependent transcription program in intestinal stem cells, we 
      demonstrate that PRC1 represses a large number of non-lineage-specific
      transcription factors that directly affect beta-catenin/Tcf transcriptional
      activity. Our data reveal that PRC1 preserves Wnt/beta-catenin activity in adult 
      stem cells to maintain intestinal homeostasis and supports tumor formation
      induced by the constitutive activation of this pathway.

AB  - Serum-to-2i interconversion of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is a valuable
      in vitro model for early embryonic development. To assess whether 3D chromatin
      organization changes during this transition, we established Capture Hi-C with
      target-sequence enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites. We detected extremely
      long-range intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions between a small subset of
      H3K27me3 marked bivalent promoters involving the Hox clusters in serum-grown
      cells. Notably, these promoter-mediated interactions are not present in 2i
      ground-state pluripotent mESCs but appear upon their further development into
      primed-like serum mESCs. Reverting serum mESCs to ground-state 2i mESCs removes
      these promoter-promoter interactions in a spatiotemporal manner. H3K27me3, which 
      is largely absent at bivalent promoters in ground-state 2i mESCs, is necessary,
      but not sufficient, to establish these interactions, as confirmed by Capture Hi-C
      on Eed(-/-) serum mESCs. Our results implicate H3K27me3 and PRC2 as critical
      players in chromatin alteration during priming of ESCs for differentiation.

AB  - For many years, stem cell metabolism was viewed as a byproduct of cell fate
      status rather than an active regulatory mechanism; however, there is now a
      growing appreciation that metabolic pathways influence epigenetic changes
      associated with lineage commitment, specification, and self-renewal. Here we
      review how metabolites generated during glycolytic and oxidative processes are
      utilized in enzymatic reactions leading to epigenetic modifications and
      transcriptional regulation. We discuss how "metabolic reprogramming" contributes 
      to global epigenetic changes in the context of naive and primed pluripotent
      states, somatic reprogramming, and hematopoietic and skeletal muscle tissue stem 
      cells, and we discuss the implications for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Human somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds great potential in regenerative 
      medicine; however, its applicability has been limited by great variability in
      reprogramming efficiencies. A new study in this issue of Cell Stem Cell reports a
      simple way to expand human SCNT to hard-to-reprogram oocytes (Chung et al.,
      2015).

AB  - Modeling human neuronal aging at a cellular level remains challenging. Human
      neurons are accessible from iPSCs, but during reprogramming age-associated traits
      of somatic cells get lost. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Mertens et al. (2015)
      demonstrate that neurons obtained by direct cell conversion retain age-associated
      transcriptional traits and functional deficits of the donor cell population.

AB  - Adult stem cells may acquire mutations that modify cellular behavior, leading to 
      functional declines in homeostasis or providing a competitive advantage resulting
      in premalignancy. However, the frequency, phenotypic impact, and mechanisms
      underlying spontaneous mutagenesis during aging are unclear. Here, we report two 
      mechanisms of genome instability in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs)
      that cause phenotypic alterations in the aging intestine. First, we found
      frequent loss of heterozygosity arising from mitotic homologous recombination in 
      ISCs that results in genetic mosaicism. Second, somatic deletion of DNA sequences
      and large structural rearrangements, resembling those described in cancers and
      congenital diseases, frequently result in gene inactivation. Such modifications
      induced somatic inactivation of the X-linked tumor suppressor Notch in ISCs,
      leading to spontaneous neoplasias in wild-type males. Together, our findings
      reveal frequent genomic modification in adult stem cells and show that somatic
      genetic mosaicism has important functional consequences on aging tissues.

AB  - Recurrent mutations in cohesin complex proteins have been identified in
      pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells and during the early development of acute
      myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies. Although cohesins are involved
      in chromosome separation and DNA damage repair, cohesin complex functions during 
      hematopoiesis and leukemic development are unclear. Here, we show that mutant
      cohesin proteins block differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor
      cells (HSPCs) in vitro and in vivo and enforce stem cell programs. These effects 
      are restricted to immature HSPC populations, where cohesin mutants show increased
      chromatin accessibility and likelihood of transcription factor binding site
      occupancy by HSPC regulators including ERG, GATA2, and RUNX1, as measured by
      ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. Epistasis experiments show that silencing these
      transcription factors rescues the differentiation block caused by cohesin
      mutants. Together, these results show that mutant cohesins impair HSPC
      differentiation by controlling chromatin accessibility and transcription factor
      activity, possibly contributing to leukemic disease.

AB  - Transplantation of GABAergic interneurons (INs) can provide long-term functional 
      benefits in animal models of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Whereas
      GABAergic INs can be differentiated from embryonic stem cells, alternative
      sources of GABAergic INs may be more tractable for disease modeling and
      transplantation. We identified five factors (Foxg1, Sox2, Ascl1, Dlx5, and Lhx6) 
      that convert mouse fibroblasts into induced GABAergic INs (iGABA-INs) possessing 
      molecular signatures of telencephalic INs. Factor overexpression activates
      transcriptional networks required for GABAergic fate specification. iGABA-INs
      display progressively maturing firing patterns comparable to cortical INs, form
      functional synapses, and release GABA. Importantly, iGABA-INs survive and mature 
      upon being grafted into mouse hippocampus. Optogenetic stimulation demonstrated
      functional integration of grafted iGABA-INs into host circuitry, triggering
      inhibition of host granule neuron activity. These five factors also converted
      human cells into functional GABAergic INs. These properties suggest that
      iGABA-INs have potential for disease modeling and cell-based therapeutic
      approaches to neurological disorders.

AB  - The extremely low efficiency of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivation using
      somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) limits its potential application. Blastocyst
      formation from human SCNT embryos occurs at a low rate and with only some oocyte 
      donors. We previously showed in mice that reduction of histone H3 lysine 9
      trimethylation (H3K9me3) through ectopic expression of the H3K9me3 demethylase
      Kdm4d greatly improves SCNT embryo development. Here we show that overexpression 
      of a related H3K9me3 demethylase KDM4A improves human SCNT, and that, as in mice,
      H3K9me3 in the human somatic cell genome is an SCNT reprogramming barrier.
      Overexpression of KDM4A significantly improves the blastocyst formation rate in
      human SCNT embryos by facilitating transcriptional reprogramming, allowing
      efficient derivation of SCNT-derived ESCs using adult Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD) patient somatic nuclei donors. This conserved mechanistic
      insight has potential applications for improving SCNT in a variety of contexts,
      including regenerative medicine.

AB  - Epigenetic and epitranscriptomic networks have important functions in maintaining
      the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and somatic cell reprogramming.
      However, the mechanisms integrating the actions of these distinct networks are
      only partially understood. Here we show that the chromatin-associated zinc finger
      protein 217 (ZFP217) coordinates epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation.
      ZFP217 interacts with several epigenetic regulators, activates the transcription 
      of key pluripotency genes, and modulates N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) deposition on
      their transcripts by sequestering the enzyme m(6)A methyltransferase-like 3
      (METTL3). Consistently, Zfp217 depletion compromises ESC self-renewal and somatic
      cell reprogramming, globally increases m(6)A RNA levels, and enhances m(6)A
      modification of the Nanog, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc mRNAs, promoting their
      degradation. ZFP217 binds its own target gene mRNAs, which are also METTL3
      associated, and is enriched at promoters of m(6)A-modified transcripts.
      Collectively, these findings shed light on how a transcription factor can tightly
      couple gene transcription to m(6)A RNA modification to ensure ESC identity.

AB  - We have recently demonstrated that reactive glial cells can be directly
      reprogrammed into functional neurons by a single neural transcription factor,
      NeuroD1. Here we report that a combination of small molecules can also reprogram 
      human astrocytes in culture into fully functional neurons. We demonstrate that
      sequential exposure of human astrocytes to a cocktail of nine small molecules
      that inhibit glial but activate neuronal signaling pathways can successfully
      reprogram astrocytes into neurons in 8-10 days. This chemical reprogramming is
      mediated through epigenetic regulation and involves transcriptional activation of
      NEUROD1 and NEUROGENIN2. The human astrocyte-converted neurons can survive for >5
      months in culture and form functional synaptic networks with synchronous burst
      activities. The chemically reprogrammed human neurons can also survive for >1
      month in the mouse brain in vivo and integrate into local circuits. Our study
      opens a new avenue using chemical compounds to reprogram reactive glial cells
      into functional neurons.

AB  - Aging is a major risk factor for many human diseases, and in vitro generation of 
      human neurons is an attractive approach for modeling aging-related brain
      disorders. However, modeling aging in differentiated human neurons has proved
      challenging. We generated neurons from human donors across a broad range of ages,
      either by iPSC-based reprogramming and differentiation or by direct conversion
      into induced neurons (iNs). While iPSCs and derived neurons did not retain
      aging-associated gene signatures, iNs displayed age-specific transcriptional
      profiles and revealed age-associated decreases in the nuclear transport receptor 
      RanBP17. We detected an age-dependent loss of nucleocytoplasmic
      compartmentalization (NCC) in donor fibroblasts and corresponding iNs and found
      that reduced RanBP17 impaired NCC in young cells, while iPSC rejuvenation
      restored NCC in aged cells. These results show that iNs retain important
      aging-related signatures, thus allowing modeling of the aging process in vitro,
      and they identify impaired NCC as an important factor in human aging.

AB  - Differentiation of functional thyroid epithelia from pluripotent stem cells
      (PSCs) holds the potential for application in regenerative medicine. However,
      progress toward this goal is hampered by incomplete understanding of the
      signaling pathways needed for directed differentiation without forced
      overexpression of exogenous transgenes. Here we use mouse PSCs to identify key
      conserved roles for BMP and FGF signaling in regulating thyroid lineage
      specification from foregut endoderm in mouse and Xenopus. Thyroid progenitors
      derived from mouse PSCs can be matured into thyroid follicular organoids that
      provide functional secretion of thyroid hormones in vivo and rescue hypothyroid
      mice after transplantation. Moreover, by stimulating the same pathways, we were
      also able to derive human thyroid progenitors from normal and disease-specific
      iPSCs generated from patients with hypothyroidism resulting from NKX2-1
      haploinsufficiency. Our studies have therefore uncovered the regulatory
      mechanisms that underlie early thyroid organogenesis and provide a significant
      step toward cell-based regenerative therapy for hypothyroidism.

AB  - Embryonic pluripotency can be recapitulated in vitro by a spectrum of pluripotent
      stem cell states stabilized with different culture conditions. Their distinct
      spatiotemporal characteristics provide an unprecedented tool for the study of
      early human development. The newly unveiled ability of some stem cell types for
      crossing xeno-barriers will facilitate the generation of interspecies chimeric
      embryos from distant species, including humans. When combined with efficient
      zygote genome editing technologies, xenogeneic human pluripotent stem cells may
      also open new frontiers for regenerative medicine applications, including the
      possibility of generating human organs in animals via interspecies chimeric
      complementation.

AB  - The adult lung is largely quiescent, with airway epithelia turning over slowly.
      Peng et al. (2015) describe a key role for the Hedgehog pathway in actively
      maintaining this quiescence, a surprising turn of events given the pathway's
      established mitogenic role, and they show that Hedgehog pathway attenuation is
      required for proliferative regeneration.

AB  - In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Saito et al. (2015) examine how
      leukemia-initiating cells react to metabolic stress imposed by different tissue
      environments. They find that inhibition of the metabolic stress sensor
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) led to deranged glucose metabolism and redox 
      homeostasis, resulting in reduced leukemic progression that was further
      attenuated by dietary restriction.

      substantially contribute to placental development. Two studies by Kubaczka et al.
      (2015) and Benchetrit et al. (2015) in this issue of Cell Stem Cell now report
      reprogramming mouse fibroblasts into TSCs, surmounting the first lineage barrier 
      established in development and providing new tools for researching placental
      specification and diseases.

AB  - Reactive astrocytes (RAs) have been reported to convert to multipotent neural
      stem cells (NSCs) capable of neurosphere (NS) formation and multilineage
      differentiation in vitro. Using genetic tagging, we determined that
      subventricular zone (SVZ) NSCs give rise to NSs derived from the stroke-injured
      cortex. We demonstrate that these cells can be isolated from the cortex in two
      different models of stroke and from different stroke-lesioned cortical regions.
      Interestingly, SVZ NSCs give rise to a subpopulation of RAs in the cortex that
      contribute to astrogliosis and scar formation. Last, we show that these SVZ
      derived RAs can be converted to neurons in vivo by forced expression of Ascl1.
      Identifying the contribution of cells originating from the SVZ to injury repair
      has implications for neural regeneration strategies.

AB  - How cancer cells adapt to metabolically adverse conditions in patients and strive
      to proliferate is a fundamental question in cancer biology. Here we show that
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic checkpoint kinase, confers
      metabolic stress resistance to leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and promotes
      leukemogenesis. Upon dietary restriction, MLL-AF9-induced murine acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) activated AMPK and maintained leukemogenic potential. AMPK
      deletion significantly delayed leukemogenesis and depleted LICs by reducing the
      expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), compromising glucose flux, and
      increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage. LICs were particularly dependent on
      AMPK to suppress oxidative stress in the hypoglycemic bone marrow environment.
      Strikingly, AMPK inhibition synergized with physiological metabolic stress caused
      by dietary restriction and profoundly suppressed leukemogenesis. Our results
      indicate that AMPK protects LICs from metabolic stress and that combining AMPK
      inhibition with physiological metabolic stress potently suppresses AML by
      inducing oxidative stress and DNA damage.

TI  - Extensive Nuclear Reprogramming Underlies Lineage Conversion into Functional
      Trophoblast Stem-like Cells.

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) undergo extensive nuclear reprogramming
      and are generally indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in their
      functional capacity and transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles. However,
      direct conversion of cells from one lineage to another often yields incompletely 
      reprogrammed, functionally compromised cells, raising the question of whether
      pluripotency is required to achieve a high degree of nuclear reprogramming. Here,
      we show that transient expression of Gata3, Eomes, and Tfap2c in mouse
      fibroblasts induces stable, transgene-independent trophoblast stem-like cells
      (iTSCs). iTSCs possess transcriptional profiles highly similar to
      blastocyst-derived TSCs, with comparable methylation and H3K27ac patterns and
      genome-wide H2A.X deposition. iTSCs generate trophoectodermal lineages upon
      differentiation, form hemorrhagic lesions, and contribute to developing placentas
      in chimera assays, indicating a high degree of nuclear reprogramming, with no
      evidence of passage through a transient pluripotent state. Together, these data
      demonstrate that extensive nuclear reprogramming can be achieved independently of
      pluripotency.

AB  - Mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated oncogenes often arise in
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and promote acquisition of leukemia stem cell
      (LSC) phenotypes. However, as LSCs often share features of lineage-restricted
      progenitors, the relative contribution of differentiation status to LSC
      transformation is unclear. Using murine MLL-AF9 and MOZ-TIF2 AML models, we show 
      that myeloid differentiation to granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) is
      critical for LSC generation. Disrupting GMP formation by deleting the
      lineage-restricted transcription factor C/EBPa blocked normal granulocyte
      formation and prevented initiation of AML. However, restoring myeloid
      differentiation in C/EBPa mutants with inflammatory cytokines reestablished AML
      transformation capacity. Genomic analyses of GMPs, including gene expression and 
      H3K79me2 profiling in conjunction with ATAC-seq, revealed a permissive genomic
      environment for activation of a minimal transcription program shared by GMPs and 
      LSCs. Together, these findings show that myeloid differentiation is a
      prerequisite for LSC formation and AML development, providing insights for
      therapeutic development.

AB  - Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) arise from the first cell fate decision in the
      developing embryo and generate extra-embryonic lineages, giving rise to the fetal
      portion of the placenta. Mouse embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages are
      strictly separated by a distinct epigenetic barrier, which is not fully overcome 
      following expression of TSC-determining factors in embryonic stem cells. Here, we
      show that transient expression of Tfap2c, Gata3, Eomes, and Ets2 is sufficient to
      reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts and post-natal tail-tip-derived fibroblasts
      into induced TSCs (iTSCs) and surmount the epigenetic barrier separating somatic 
      from extra-embryonic lineages. iTSCs share nearly identical morphological
      characteristics, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation patterns with
      blastocyst-derived TSCs. Furthermore, iTSCs display transgene-independent
      self-renewal, differentiate along extra-embryonic lineages, and chimerize host
      placentas following blastocyst injection. These findings provide insights into
      the transcription factor networks governing TSC identity and opportunities for
      studying the epigenetic barriers underlying embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage
      segregation.

TI  - HDAC8 Inhibition Specifically Targets Inv(16) Acute Myeloid Leukemic Stem Cells
      by Restoring p53 Acetylation.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven and sustained by leukemia stem cells
      (LSCs) with unlimited self-renewal capacity and resistance to chemotherapy.
      Mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor is relatively rare in de novo AML; however,
      p53 can be regulated through post-translational mechanisms. Here, we show that
      p53 activity is inhibited in inv(16)(+) AML LSCs via interactions with the
      CBFbeta-SMMHC (CM) fusion protein and histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). HDAC8
      aberrantly deacetylates p53 and promotes LSC transformation and maintenance.
      HDAC8 deficiency or inhibition using HDAC8-selective inhibitors (HDAC8i)
      effectively restores p53 acetylation and activity. Importantly, HDAC8 inhibition 
      induces apoptosis in inv(16)(+) AML CD34(+) cells, while sparing the normal
      hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, in vivo HDAC8i administration profoundly
      diminishes AML propagation and abrogates leukemia-initiating capacity of both
      murine and patient-derived LSCs. This study elucidates an HDAC8-mediated
      p53-inactivating mechanism promoting LSC activity and highlights HDAC8 inhibition
      as a promising approach to selectively target inv(16)(+) LSCs.

AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Because
      this gene is expressed ubiquitously, it remains poorly understood why motor
      neurons (MNs) are one of the most affected cell types. To address this question, 
      we carried out RNA sequencing studies using fixed, antibody-labeled, and purified
      MNs produced from control and SMA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs). We found SMA-specific changes in MNs, including hyper-activation of the 
      ER stress pathway. Functional studies demonstrated that inhibition of ER stress
      improves MN survival in vitro even in MNs expressing low SMN. In SMA mice,
      systemic delivery of an ER stress inhibitor that crosses the blood-brain barrier 
      led to the preservation of spinal cord MNs. Therefore, our study implies that
      selective activation of ER stress underlies MN death in SMA. Moreover, the
      approach we have taken would be broadly applicable to the study of disease-prone 
      human cells in heterogeneous cultures.

TI  - Circulating IGF-I and IGFBP3 Levels Control Human Colonic Stem Cell Function and 
      Are Disrupted in Diabetic Enteropathy.
PG  - 486-498
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2015.07.010 [doi]
AB  - The role of circulating factors in regulating colonic stem cells (CoSCs) and
      colonic epithelial homeostasis is unclear. Individuals with long-standing type 1 
      diabetes (T1D) frequently have intestinal symptoms, termed diabetic enteropathy
      (DE), though its etiology is unknown. Here, we report that T1D patients with DE
      exhibit abnormalities in their intestinal mucosa and CoSCs, which fail to
      generate in vitro mini-guts. Proteomic profiling of T1D+DE patient serum revealed
      altered levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and its binding protein 3 
      (IGFBP3). IGFBP3 prevented in vitro growth of patient-derived organoids via
      binding its receptor TMEM219, in an IGF-I-independent manner, and disrupted in
      vivo CoSC function in a preclinical DE model. Restoration of normoglycemia in
      patients with long-standing T1D via kidney-pancreas transplantation or in
      diabetic mice by treatment with an ecto-TMEM219 recombinant protein normalized
      circulating IGF-I/IGFBP3 levels and reestablished CoSC homeostasis. These
      findings demonstrate that peripheral IGF-I/IGFBP3 controls CoSCs and their
      dysfunction in DE.

AB  - Embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture conditions are important for maintaining
      long-term self-renewal, and they influence cellular pluripotency state. Here, we 
      report single cell RNA-sequencing of mESCs cultured in three different
      conditions: serum, 2i, and the alternative ground state a2i. We find that the
      cellular transcriptomes of cells grown in these conditions are distinct, with 2i 
      being the most similar to blastocyst cells and including a subpopulation
      resembling the two-cell embryo state. Overall levels of intercellular gene
      expression heterogeneity are comparable across the three conditions. However,
      this masks variable expression of pluripotency genes in serum cells and
      homogeneous expression in 2i and a2i cells. Additionally, genes related to the
      cell cycle are more variably expressed in the 2i and a2i conditions. Mining of
      our dataset for correlations in gene expression allowed us to identify additional
      components of the pluripotency network, including Ptma and Zfp640, illustrating
      its value as a resource for future discovery.

AB  - Adult somatic stem cells in various organs maintain homeostatic tissue
      regeneration and enhance plasticity. Since its initial discovery five decades
      ago, investigations of adult neurogenesis and neural stem cells have led to an
      established and expanding field that has significantly influenced many facets of 
      neuroscience, developmental biology, and regenerative medicine. Here we review
      recent progress and focus on questions related to adult mammalian neural stem
      cells that also apply to other somatic stem cells. We further discuss emerging
      topics that are guiding the field toward better understanding adult neural stem
      cells and ultimately applying these principles to improve human health.

TI  - CD93 Marks a Non-Quiescent Human Leukemia Stem Cell Population and Is Required
      for Development of MLL-Rearranged Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

AB  - Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to share several properties with
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including cell-cycle quiescence and a capacity
      for self-renewal. These features are hypothesized to underlie leukemic
      initiation, progression, and relapse, and they also complicate efforts to
      eradicate leukemia through therapeutic targeting of LSCs without adverse effects 
      on HSCs. Here, we show that acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with genomic
      rearrangements of the MLL gene contain a non-quiescent LSC population. Although
      human CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs are generally highly quiescent, the C-type lectin CD93 
      is expressed on a subset of actively cycling, non-quiescent AML cells enriched
      for LSC activity. CD93 expression is functionally required for engraftment of
      primary human AML LSCs and leukemogenesis, and it regulates LSC self-renewal
      predominantly by silencing CDKN2B, a major tumor suppressor in AML. Thus, CD93
      expression identifies a predominantly cycling, non-quiescent leukemia-initiating 
      cell population in MLL-rearranged AML, providing opportunities for selective
      targeting and eradication of LSCs.

TI  - ELABELA Is an Endogenous Growth Factor that Sustains hESC Self-Renewal via the
      PI3K/AKT Pathway.

AB  - ELABELA (ELA) is a peptide hormone required for heart development that signals
      via the Apelin Receptor (APLNR, APJ). ELA is also abundantly secreted by human
      embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which do not express APLNR. Here we show that ELA
      signals in a paracrine fashion in hESCs to maintain self-renewal. ELA inhibition 
      by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion, shRNA, or neutralizing antibodies causes
      reduced hESC growth, cell death, and loss of pluripotency. Global
      phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses of ELA-pulsed hESCs show that it
      activates PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling required for cell survival. ELA promotes hESC
      cell-cycle progression and protein translation and blocks stress-induced
      apoptosis. INSULIN and ELA have partially overlapping functions in hESC medium,
      but only ELA can potentiate the TGFbeta pathway to prime hESCs toward the
      endoderm lineage. We propose that ELA, acting through an alternate cell-surface
      receptor, is an endogenous secreted growth factor in human embryos and hESCs that
      promotes growth and pluripotency.

AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can survive and proliferate for an extended
      period of time in culture, but unlike that of tumor-derived cells, this form of
      cellular immortality does not depend on genomic aberrations. In this study, we
      sought to elucidate the molecular basis of this long-term growth property of
      hESCs. We found that the survival of hESCs depends on the small GTPase Rho and
      its activator AKAP-Lbc. We show that AKAP-Lbc/Rho signaling sustains the nuclear 
      function of the transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ by modulating actin
      microfilament organization. By inducing reprogramming and differentiation, we
      found that dependency on this Rho signaling pathway is associated with the
      pluripotent state. Thus, our findings show that the capacity of hESCs to undergo 
      long-term expansion in vitro is intrinsically coupled to their cellular identity 
      through interconnected molecular circuits that link cell survival to
      pluripotency.

TI  - Aberrant Lipid Metabolism in the Forebrain Niche Suppresses Adult Neural Stem
      Cell Proliferation in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Lipid metabolism is fundamental for brain development and function, but its roles
      in normal and pathological neural stem cell (NSC) regulation remain largely
      unexplored. Here, we uncover a fatty acid-mediated mechanism suppressing
      endogenous NSC activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that postmortem AD 
      brains and triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) mice accumulate
      neutral lipids within ependymal cells, the main support cell of the forebrain NSC
      niche. Mass spectrometry and microarray analyses identified these lipids as oleic
      acid-enriched triglycerides that originate from niche-derived rather than
      peripheral lipid metabolism defects. In wild-type mice, locally increasing oleic 
      acid was sufficient to recapitulate the AD-associated ependymal triglyceride
      phenotype and inhibit NSC proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting the rate-limiting
      enzyme of oleic acid synthesis rescued proliferative defects in both adult
      neurogenic niches of 3xTg-AD mice. These studies support a pathogenic mechanism
      whereby AD-induced perturbation of niche fatty acid metabolism suppresses the
      homeostatic and regenerative functions of NSCs.

AB  - Infections are associated with extensive platelet consumption, representing a
      high risk for health. However, the mechanism coordinating the rapid regeneration 
      of the platelet pool during such stress conditions remains unclear. Here, we
      report that the phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment contains
      stem-like megakaryocyte-committed progenitors (SL-MkPs), a cell population that
      shares many features with multipotent HSCs and serves as a lineage-restricted
      emergency pool for inflammatory insults. During homeostasis, SL-MkPs are
      maintained in a primed but quiescent state, thus contributing little to
      steady-state megakaryopoiesis. Even though lineage-specific megakaryocyte
      transcripts are expressed, protein synthesis is suppressed. In response to acute 
      inflammation, SL-MkPs become activated, resulting in megakaryocyte protein
      production from pre-existing transcripts and a maturation of SL-MkPs and other
      megakaryocyte progenitors. This results in an efficient replenishment of
      platelets that are lost during inflammatory insult. Thus, our study reveals an
      emergency machinery that counteracts life-threatening platelet depletions during 
      acute inflammation.

AB  - Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured under serum/LIF conditions exhibit
      heterogeneous expression of pluripotency-associated factors that can be overcome 
      by two inhibitors (2i) of the MEK and GSK3 pathways. Several studies have shown
      that the "ground state" induced by 2i is characterized by global hypomethylation 
      and specific transcriptional profiles, but little is known about the contributing
      effectors. Here we show that 2i conditions rapidly alter the global binding
      landscape of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. The dynamic binding influences enhancer
      activity and shows enrichment for regulators linked to Wnt and Erk signaling.
      Epigenomic characterization provided limited insights to the immediate
      transcriptional dynamics, suggesting that these are likely more secondary
      effects. Likewise, loss of the PRC2 component EED to prevent H3K27me3 deposition 
      had minimal effect on the transcriptome, implying that it is largely dispensable 
      for continued repression of bivalent genes and de novo silencing in 2i.

AB  - Polycomb complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) are essential regulators of epigenetic gene
      silencing in embryonic and adult stem cells. Emerging evidence suggests that the 
      core subunit composition regulates distinct biological processes, yet little is
      known about the mechanistic underpinnings of how differently composed Polycomb
      complexes instruct and maintain cell fate. Here we find that Mel18, also known as
      Pcgf2 and one of six Pcgf paralogs, uniquely regulates PRC1 to specify mesoderm
      cell fate in embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, Mel18 functions as a
      classical Polycomb protein during early cardiac mesoderm differentiation by
      repressing pluripotency, lineage specification, late cardiac differentiation, and
      negative regulators of the BMP pathway. However, Mel18 also positively regulates 
      expression of key mesoderm transcription factors, revealing an unexpected
      function of Mel18 in gene activation during cardiac differentiation. Taken
      together, our findings reveal that Mel18 is required to specify PRC1 function in 
      both a context- and stage-specific manner.

TI  - The Daxx/Atrx Complex Protects Tandem Repetitive Elements during DNA
      Hypomethylation by Promoting H3K9 Trimethylation.
PG  - 273-86

AB  - In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for protecting repetitive sequences from
      aberrant transcription and recombination. In some developmental contexts (e.g.,
      preimplantation embryos) DNA is hypomethylated but repetitive elements are not
      dysregulated, suggesting that alternative protection mechanisms exist. Here we
      explore the processes involved by investigating the role of the chromatin factors
      Daxx and Atrx. Using genome-wide binding and transcriptome analysis, we found
      that Daxx and Atrx have distinct chromatin-binding profiles and are co-enriched
      at tandem repetitive elements in wild-type mouse ESCs. Global DNA hypomethylation
      further promoted recruitment of the Daxx/Atrx complex to tandem repeat sequences,
      including retrotransposons and telomeres. Knockdown of Daxx/Atrx in cells with
      hypomethylated genomes exacerbated aberrant transcriptional de-repression of
      repeat elements and telomere dysfunction. Mechanistically, Daxx/Atrx-mediated
      repression seems to involve Suv39h recruitment and H3K9 trimethylation. Our data 
      therefore suggest that Daxx and Atrx safeguard the genome by silencing repetitive
      elements when DNA methylation levels are low.

AB  - Cellular heterogeneity represents one of the greatest challenges in cancer
      therapeutics. In many malignancies, this heterogeneity is generated during tumor 
      evolution through a combination of genetic alterations and epigenetic events that
      recapitulate normal developmental processes including stem cell self-renewal and 
      differentiation. Many, if not most, tumors display similar hierarchal
      organization, at the apex of which are "stem-like cells" that drive tumor growth,
      mediate metastasis, and contribute to treatment resistance. Using breast cancer
      as a model, we discuss how an improved understanding of tumor cellular
      heterogeneity and plasticity may lead to development of more effective
      therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation remains the only cure for various
      hematological diseases, but low HSC numbers in many donor samples are a critical 
      problem preventing their clinical use. Now in Nature and Cell, two creative
      strategies to rescue and improve pre-existing engraftment potential are
      presented.

AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) generally rely on repressive histone modifications to
      silence retrotransposons, rather than DNA methylation as in differentiated cells.
      In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, He et al. (2015) show that Daxx/Atrx repress
      transposons in ESCs devoid of 5mC, demonstrating dynamic reorganization of
      epigenetic networks and crosstalk between distinct repressive mechanisms to
      maintain transposon silencing.

AB  - Cardiac stem/progenitor cells hold great potential for regenerative therapies;
      however, the mechanisms regulating their expansion and differentiation remain
      insufficiently defined. Here we show that Ldb1 is a central regulator of genome
      organization in cardiac progenitor cells, which is crucial for cardiac lineage
      differentiation and heart development. We demonstrate that Ldb1 binds to the key 
      regulator of cardiac progenitors, Isl1, and protects it from degradation.
      Furthermore, the Isl1/Ldb1 complex promotes long-range enhancer-promoter
      interactions at the loci of the core cardiac transcription factors Mef2c and
      Hand2. Chromosome conformation capture followed by sequencing identified specific
      Ldb1-mediated interactions of the Isl1/Ldb1 responsive Mef2c anterior heart field
      enhancer with genes that play key roles in cardiac progenitor cell function and
      cardiovascular development. Importantly, the expression of these genes was
      downregulated upon Ldb1 depletion and Isl1/Ldb1 haplodeficiency. In conclusion,
      the Isl1/Ldb1 complex orchestrates a network for heart-specific transcriptional
      regulation and coordination in three-dimensional space during cardiogenesis.

AB  - The breakthrough of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has raised
      the possibility that patient-specific iPSCs may become a renewable source of
      autologous cells for cell therapy without the concern of immune rejection.
      However, the immunogenicity of autologous human iPSC (hiPSC)-derived cells is not
      well understood. Using a humanized mouse model (denoted Hu-mice) reconstituted
      with a functional human immune system, we demonstrate that most teratomas formed 
      by autologous integration-free hiPSCs exhibit local infiltration of
      antigen-specific T cells and associated tissue necrosis, indicating immune
      rejection of certain hiPSC-derived cells. In this context, autologous
      hiPSC-derived smooth muscle cells (SMCs) appear to be highly immunogenic, while
      autologous hiPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are immune
      tolerated even in non-ocular locations. This differential immunogenicity is due
      in part to abnormal expression of immunogenic antigens in hiPSC-derived SMCs, but
      not in hiPSC-derived RPEs. These findings support the feasibility of developing
      hiPSC-derived RPEs for treating macular degeneration.

AB  - Somatic stem cells contribute to tissue ontogenesis, homeostasis, and
      regeneration through sequential processes. Systematic molecular analysis of stem 
      cell behavior is challenging because classic approaches cannot resolve cellular
      heterogeneity or capture developmental dynamics. Here we provide a comprehensive 
      resource of single-cell transcriptomes of adult hippocampal quiescent neural stem
      cells (qNSCs) and their immediate progeny. We further developed Waterfall, a
      bioinformatic pipeline, to statistically quantify singe-cell gene expression
      along a de novo reconstructed continuous developmental trajectory. Our study
      reveals molecular signatures of adult qNSCs, characterized by active niche
      signaling integration and low protein translation capacity. Our analyses further 
      delineate molecular cascades underlying qNSC activation and neurogenesis
      initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed
      translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors,
      metabolism, and energy sources. Our study reveals the molecular continuum
      underlying adult neurogenesis and illustrates how Waterfall can be used for
      single-cell omics analyses of various continuous biological processes.

      Leukemia Stem Cells and Leukemic Progression.

AB  - Signaling mechanisms underlying self-renewal of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are
      poorly understood, and identifying pathways specifically active in LSCs could
      provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. T-cell immunoglobin mucin-3
      (TIM-3) is expressed on the surface of LSCs in many types of human acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML), but not on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that
      TIM-3 and its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9), constitute an autocrine loop critical
      for LSC self-renewal and development of human AML. Serum Gal-9 levels were
      significantly elevated in AML patients and in mice xenografted with primary human
      AML samples, and neutralization of Gal-9 inhibited xenogeneic reconstitution of
      human AML. Gal-9-mediated stimulation of TIM-3 co-activated NF-kappaB and
      beta-catenin signaling, pathways known to promote LSC self-renewal. These changes
      were further associated with leukemic transformation of a variety of pre-leukemic
      disorders and together highlight that targeting the TIM-3/Gal-9 autocrine loop
      could be a useful strategy for treating myeloid leukemias.

TI  - Human Neuropsychiatric Disease Modeling using Conditional Deletion Reveals
      Synaptic Transmission Defects Caused by Heterozygous Mutations in NRXN1.

AB  - Heterozygous mutations of the NRXN1 gene, which encodes the presynaptic
      cell-adhesion molecule neurexin-1, were repeatedly associated with autism and
      schizophrenia. However, diverse clinical presentations of NRXN1 mutations in
      patients raise the question of whether heterozygous NRXN1 mutations alone
      directly impair synaptic function. To address this question under conditions that
      precisely control for genetic background, we generated human ESCs with different 
      heterozygous conditional NRXN1 mutations and analyzed two different types of
      isogenic control and NRXN1 mutant neurons derived from these ESCs. Both
      heterozygous NRXN1 mutations selectively impaired neurotransmitter release in
      human neurons without changing neuronal differentiation or synapse formation.
      Moreover, both NRXN1 mutations increased the levels of CASK, a critical synaptic 
      scaffolding protein that binds to neurexin-1. Our results show that,
      unexpectedly, heterozygous inactivation of NRXN1 directly impairs synaptic
      function in human neurons, and they illustrate the value of this conditional
      deletion approach for studying the functional effects of disease-associated
      mutations.

AB  - Heterogeneous pools of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to brain
      maintenance and regeneration after injury. The balance of NSC activation and
      quiescence, as well as the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors,
      may contribute to diversity of neuronal and glial fates. To identify molecular
      hallmarks governing these characteristics, we performed single-cell sequencing of
      an unbiased pool of adult subventricular zone NSCs. This analysis identified a
      discrete, dormant NSC subpopulation that already expresses distinct combinations 
      of lineage-specific transcription factors during homeostasis. Dormant NSCs enter 
      a primed-quiescent state before activation, which is accompanied by
      downregulation of glycolytic metabolism, Notch, and BMP signaling and a
      concomitant upregulation of lineage-specific transcription factors and protein
      synthesis. In response to brain ischemia, interferon gamma signaling induces
      dormant NSC subpopulations to enter the primed-quiescent state. This study
      unveils general principles underlying NSC activation and lineage priming and
      opens potential avenues for regenerative medicine in the brain.

AB  - Neuronal conversion from human fibroblasts can be induced by lineage-specific
      transcription factors; however, the introduction of ectopic genes limits the
      therapeutic applications of such induced neurons (iNs). Here, we report that
      human fibroblasts can be directly converted into neuronal cells by a chemical
      cocktail of seven small molecules, bypassing a neural progenitor stage. These
      human chemical-induced neuronal cells (hciNs) resembled hiPSC-derived neurons and
      human iNs (hiNs) with respect to morphology, gene expression profiles, and
      electrophysiological properties. This approach was further applied to generate
      hciNs from familial Alzheimer's disease patients. Taken together, our
      transgene-free and chemical-only approach for direct reprogramming of human
      fibroblasts into neurons provides an alternative strategy for modeling
      neurological diseases and for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Recently, direct reprogramming between divergent lineages has been achieved by
      the introduction of regulatory transcription factors. This approach may provide
      alternative cell resources for drug discovery and regenerative medicine, but
      applications could be limited by the genetic manipulation involved. Here, we show
      that mouse fibroblasts can be directly converted into neuronal cells using only a
      cocktail of small molecules, with a yield of up to >90% being TUJ1-positive after
      16 days of induction. After a further maturation stage, these chemically induced 
      neurons (CiNs) possessed neuron-specific expression patterns, generated action
      potentials, and formed functional synapses. Mechanistically, we found that a BET 
      family bromodomain inhibitor, I-BET151, disrupted the fibroblast-specific
      program, while the neurogenesis inducer ISX9 was necessary to activate
      neuron-specific genes. Overall, our findings provide a "proof of principle" for
      chemically induced direct reprogramming of somatic cell fates across germ layers 
      without genetic manipulation, through disruption of cell-specific programs and
      induction of an alternative fate.

AB  - Regeneration of skin and hair follicles after wounding--a process known as
      wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN)--is a rare example of adult organogenesis in
      mammals. As such, WIHN provides a unique model system for deciphering mechanisms 
      underlying mammalian regeneration. Here, we show that dsRNA, which is released
      from damaged skin, activates Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and its downstream
      effectors IL-6 and STAT3 to promote hair follicle regeneration. Conversely,
      TLR3-deficient animals fail to initiate WIHN. TLR3 activation promotes expression
      of hair follicle stem cell markers and induces elements of the core hair
      morphogenetic program, including ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) and the Wnt and 
      Shh pathways. Our results therefore show that dsRNA and TLR3 link the earliest
      events of mammalian skin wounding to regeneration and suggest potential
      therapeutic approaches for promoting hair neogenesis.

AB  - Patient-funded trials (PFTs) are gaining traction as a means of accelerating
      clinical translation. However, such trials sidestep mechanisms that promote
      rigor, relevance, efficiency, and fairness. We recommend that funding bodies or
      research institutions establish mechanisms for merit review of patient-funded
      trials, and we offer some basic criteria for evaluating PFT protocols.

AB  - Stem cell self-renewal is intrinsically associated with cell cycle control.
      However, the precise mechanisms coordinating cell fate choices and cell cycle
      remain to be fully uncovered. Now in Cell, Gonzales et al. (2015) and colleagues 
      demonstrate that factors controlling the G2/M phase are necessary to block
      pluripotency upon induction of differentiation.

TI  - Tetraspanin 3 Is Required for the Development and Propagation of Acute
      Myelogenous Leukemia.
PG  - 152-164
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2015.06.006 [doi]
AB  - Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer that strikes both adults
      and children and is frequently resistant to therapy. Thus, identifying signals
      needed for AML propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches
      for treating this disease. Here, we show that Tetraspanin 3 is a target of the
      RNA binding protein Musashi 2, which plays a key role in AML. We generated Tspan3
      knockout mice that were born without overt defects. However, Tspan3 deletion
      impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly
      improved survival in mouse models of AML. Additionally, Tspan3 inhibition blocked
      growth of AML patient samples, suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human 
      disease. As part of the mechanism, we show that Tspan3 deficiency disabled
      responses to CXCL12/SDF-1 and led to defects in AML localization within the
      niche. These identify Tspan3 as an important regulator of aggressive leukemias
      and highlight a role for Tspan3 in oncogenesis.

      Hemophilia A Patient-Derived iPSCs Using CRISPR-Cas9.

AB  - Hemophilia A is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene, 
      which encodes the blood coagulation factor VIII. Almost half of all severe
      hemophilia A cases result from two gross (140-kbp or 600-kbp) chromosomal
      inversions that involve introns 1 and 22 of the F8 gene, respectively. We derived
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these inversion
      genotypes and used CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases to revert these chromosomal segments
      back to the WT situation. We isolated inversion-corrected iPSCs with frequencies 
      of up to 6.7% without detectable off-target mutations based on whole-genome
      sequencing or targeted deep sequencing. Endothelial cells differentiated from
      corrected iPSCs expressed the F8 gene and functionally rescued factor VIII
      deficiency in an otherwise lethal mouse model of hemophilia. Our results
      therefore provide a proof of principle for functional correction of large
      chromosomal rearrangements in patient-derived iPSCs and suggest potential
      therapeutic applications.

AB  - Mechanisms underlying human germ cell development are unclear, partly due to
      difficulties in studying human embryos and lack of suitable experimental systems.
      Here, we show that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiate
      into incipient mesoderm-like cells (iMeLCs), which robustly generate human
      primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) that can be purified using the surface 
      markers EpCAM and INTEGRINalpha6. The transcriptomes of hPGCLCs and primordial
      germ cells (PGCs) isolated from non-human primates are similar, and although
      specification of hPGCLCs and mouse PGCs rely on similar signaling pathways,
      hPGCLC specification transcriptionally activates germline fate without
      transiently inducing eminent somatic programs. This includes genes important for 
      naive pluripotency and repression of key epigenetic modifiers, concomitant with
      epigenetic reprogramming. Accordingly, BLIMP1, which represses somatic programs
      in mice, activates and stabilizes a germline transcriptional circuit and
      represses a default neuronal differentiation program. Together, these findings
      provide a foundation for understanding and reconstituting human germ cell
      development in vitro.

AB  - The transcription factor RUNX1 is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome 
      and leukemia. RUNX1 mutations can be early events, creating preleukemic stem
      cells that expand in the bone marrow. Here we show, counterintuitively, that
      Runx1-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a slow
      growth, low biosynthetic, small cell phenotype and markedly reduced ribosome
      biogenesis (Ribi). The reduced Ribi involved decreased levels of rRNA and many
      mRNAs encoding ribosome proteins. Runx1 appears to directly regulate Ribi; Runx1 
      is enriched on the promoters of genes encoding ribosome proteins and binds the
      rDNA repeats. Runx1-deficient HSPCs have lower p53 levels, reduced apoptosis, an 
      attenuated unfolded protein response, and accordingly are resistant to genotoxic 
      and ER stress. The low biosynthetic activity and corresponding stress resistance 
      provides a selective advantage to Runx1-deficient HSPCs, allowing them to expand 
      in the bone marrow and outcompete normal HSPCs.

AB  - Mouse androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) can support full-term
      development of semi-cloned (SC) embryos upon injection into MII oocytes and thus 
      have potential applications in genetic modifications. However, the very low birth
      rate of SC pups limits practical use of this approach. Here, we show that
      AG-haESCs carrying deletions in the DMRs (differentially DNA methylated regions) 
      controlling two paternally repressed imprinted genes, H19 and Gtl2, can
      efficiently support the generation of SC pups. Genetic manipulation of these
      DKO-AG-haESCs in vitro using CRISPR-Cas9 can produce SC mice carrying multiple
      modifications with high efficiency. Moreover, transfection of DKO-AG-haESCs with 
      a constitutively expressed sgRNA library and Cas9 allows functional mutagenic
      screening. DKO-AG-haESCs are therefore an effective tool for the introduction of 
      organism-wide mutations in mice in a single generation.

AB  - Precise temporal control of gene expression or deletion is critical for
      elucidating gene function in biological systems. However, the establishment of
      human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines with inducible gene knockout (iKO)
      remains challenging. We explored building iKO hPSC lines by combining
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing with the Flp/FRT and Cre/LoxP system. We
      found that "dual-sgRNA targeting" is essential for biallelic knockin of FRT
      sequences to flank the exon. We further developed a strategy to simultaneously
      insert an activity-controllable recombinase-expressing cassette and remove the
      drug-resistance gene, thus speeding up the generation of iKO hPSC lines. This
      two-step strategy was used to establish human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and
      induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with iKO of SOX2, PAX6, OTX2, and
      AGO2, genes that exhibit diverse structural layout and temporal expression
      patterns. The availability of iKO hPSC lines will substantially transform the way
      we examine gene function in human cells.

AB  - Cell-based therapies to treat retinal degeneration are now being tested in
      clinical trials. However, it is not known whether the source of stem cells is
      important for the production of differentiated cells suitable for
      transplantation. To test this, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells
      (iPSCs) from murine rod photoreceptors (r-iPSCs) and scored their ability to make
      retinae by using a standardized quantitative protocol called STEM-RET. We
      discovered that r-iPSCs more efficiently produced differentiated retinae than did
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or fibroblast-derived iPSCs (f-iPSCs). Retinae
      derived from f-iPSCs had fewer amacrine cells and other inner nuclear layer
      cells. Integrated epigenetic analysis showed that DNA methylation contributes to 
      the defects in f-iPSC retinogenesis and that rod-specific CTCF insulator
      protein-binding sites may promote r-iPSC retinogenesis. Together, our data
      suggest that the source of stem cells is important for producing retinal neurons 
      in three-dimensional (3D) organ cultures.

TI  - TPO-Induced Metabolic Reprogramming Drives Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer 
      CD110+ Tumor-Initiating Cells.

AB  - Liver metastasis is a leading cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer. 
      We previously found that colorectal cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs)
      expressing CD110, the thrombopoietin (TPO)-binding receptor, mediate liver
      metastasis. Here, we show that TPO promotes metastasis of CD110+ TICs to the
      liver by activating lysine degradation. Lysine catabolism generates acetyl-CoA,
      which is used in p300-dependent LRP6 acetylation. This triggers tyrosine
      phosphorylation of LRP6, ultimately activating Wnt signaling to promote
      self-renewal of CD110+ TICs. Lysine catabolism also generates glutamate, which
      modulates the redox status of CD110+ TICs to promote liver colonization and drug 
      resistance. Mechanistically, TPO-mediated induction of c-myc orchestrates
      recruitment of chromatin modifiers to regulate metabolic gene expression. Our
      findings, therefore, establish TPO as a component of the physiological
      environment critical for metastasis of colorectal cancer to the liver.

AB  - Clinical investigations using stem cell products in regenerative medicine are
      addressing a wide spectrum of conditions using a variety of stem cell types. To
      date, there have been few reports of safety issues arising from autologous or
      allogeneic transplants. Many cells administered show transient presence for a few
      days with trophic influences on immune or inflammatory responses. Limbal stem
      cells have been registered as a product for eye burns in Europe and mesenchymal
      stem cells have been approved for pediatric graft versus host disease in Canada
      and New Zealand. Many other applications are progressing in trials, some with
      early benefits to patients.

AB  - Because of their similarity to humans, non-human primates are important models
      for studying human disease and developing therapeutic strategies. Establishment
      of chimeric animals using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could help with these
      investigations, but has not so far been achieved. Here, we show that cynomolgus
      monkey ESCs (cESCs) grown in adjusted culture conditions are able to incorporate 
      into host embryos and develop into chimeras with contribution in all three germ
      layers and in germ cell progenitors. Under the optimized culture conditions,
      which are based on an approach developed previously for naive human ESCs, the
      cESCs displayed altered growth properties, gene expression profiles, and
      self-renewal signaling pathways, suggestive of an altered naive-like cell state. 
      Thus our findings show that it is feasible to generate chimeric monkeys using
      ESCs and open up new avenues for the use of non-human primate models to study
      both pluripotency and human disease.

AB  - Direct lineage reprogramming induces dramatic shifts in cellular identity,
      employing poorly understood mechanisms. Recently, we demonstrated that expression
      of Neurog2 or Ascl1 in postnatal mouse astrocytes generates glutamatergic or
      GABAergic neurons. Here, we take advantage of this model to study dynamics of
      neuronal cell fate acquisition at the transcriptional level. We found that
      Neurog2 and Ascl1 rapidly elicited distinct neurogenic programs with only a small
      subset of shared target genes. Within this subset, only NeuroD4 could by itself
      induce neuronal reprogramming in both mouse and human astrocytes, while
      co-expression with Insm1 was required for glutamatergic maturation. Cultured
      astrocytes gradually became refractory to reprogramming, in part by the repressor
      REST preventing Neurog2 from binding to the NeuroD4 promoter. Notably, in
      astrocytes refractory to Neurog2 activation, the underlying neurogenic program
      remained amenable to reprogramming by exogenous NeuroD4. Our findings support a
      model of temporal hierarchy for cell fate change during neuronal reprogramming.

      Transformation.

AB  - Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are prone to mutagenesis, and
      accumulation of mutations can result in hematological malignancies. The
      mechanisms through which HSCs prevent such detrimental accumulation, however, are
      unclear. Here, we show that Aspp1 coordinates with p53 to maintain the genomic
      integrity of the HSC pool. Aspp1 is preferentially expressed in HSCs and
      restricts HSC pool size by attenuating self-renewal under steady-state
      conditions. After genotoxic stress, Aspp1 promotes HSC cycling and induces
      p53-dependent apoptosis in cells with persistent DNA damage foci. Beyond these
      p53-dependent functions, Aspp1 attenuates HSC self-renewal and accumulation of
      DNA damage in p53 null HSCs. Consequently, concomitant loss of Aspp1 and p53
      leads to the development of hematological malignancies, especially T cell
      leukemia and lymphoma. Together, these data highlight coordination between Aspp1 
      and p53 in regulating HSC self-renewal and DNA damage tolerance and suggest that 
      HSCs possess specific mechanisms that prevent accumulation of mutations and
      malignant transformation.

AB  - Despite great advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying blood
      production, lineage specification at the level of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) 
      remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MPP2 and MPP3 are distinct
      myeloid-biased MPP subsets that work together with lymphoid-primed MPP4 cells to 
      control blood production. We find that all MPPs are produced in parallel by
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but with different kinetics and at variable
      levels depending on hematopoietic demands. We also show that the normally rare
      myeloid-biased MPPs are transiently overproduced by HSCs in regenerating
      conditions, hence supporting myeloid amplification to rebuild the hematopoietic
      system. This shift is accompanied by a reduction in self-renewal activity in
      regenerating HSCs and reprogramming of MPP4 fate toward the myeloid lineage. Our 
      results support a dynamic model of blood development in which HSCs convey lineage
      specification through independent production of distinct lineage-biased MPP
      subsets that, in turn, support lineage expansion and differentiation.

AB  - Sox9 is a transcription factor expressed in most solid tumors. However, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying Sox9 function during tumorigenesis remain
      unclear. Here, using a genetic mouse model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the
      most frequent cancer in humans, we show that Sox9 is expressed from the earliest 
      step of tumor formation in a Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent manner. Deletion of Sox9 
      together with the constitutive activation of Hedgehog signaling completely
      prevents BCC formation and leads to a progressive loss of oncogene-expressing
      cells. Transcriptional profiling of oncogene-expressing cells with Sox9 deletion,
      combined with in vivo ChIP sequencing, uncovers a cancer-specific gene network
      regulated by Sox9 that promotes stemness, extracellular matrix deposition, and
      cytoskeleton remodeling while repressing epidermal differentiation. Our study
      identifies the molecular mechanisms regulated by Sox9 that link tumor initiation 
      and invasion.

TI  - Epigenetic Regulation of Phosphodiesterases 2A and 3A Underlies Compromised
      beta-Adrenergic Signaling in an iPSC Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy.

AB  - beta-adrenergic signaling pathways mediate key aspects of cardiac function. Its
      dysregulation is associated with a range of cardiac diseases, including dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM). Previously, we established an iPSC model of familial DCM
      from patients with a mutation in TNNT2, a sarcomeric protein. Here, we found that
      the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced mature beta-adrenergic
      signaling in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) but that this pathway was
      blunted in DCM iPSC-CMs. Although expression levels of several beta-adrenergic
      signaling components were unaltered between control and DCM iPSC-CMs, we found
      that phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 2A and PDE3A were upregulated in DCM iPSC-CMs and 
      that PDE2A was also upregulated in DCM patient tissue. We further discovered
      increased nuclear localization of mutant TNNT2 and epigenetic modifications of
      PDE genes in both DCM iPSC-CMs and patient tissue. Notably, pharmacologic
      inhibition of PDE2A and PDE3A restored cAMP levels and ameliorated the impaired
      beta-adrenergic signaling of DCM iPSC-CMs, suggesting therapeutic potential.

TI  - Krt19(+)/Lgr5(-) Cells Are Radioresistant Cancer-Initiating Stem Cells in the
      Colon and Intestine.

AB  - Epithelium of the colon and intestine are renewed every 3 days. In the intestine 
      there are at least two principal stem cell pools. The first contains rapid
      cycling crypt-based columnar (CBC) Lgr5(+) cells, and the second is composed of
      slower cycling Bmi1-expressing cells at the +4 position above the crypt base. In 
      the colon, however, the identification of Lgr5(-) stem cell pools has proven more
      challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the intermediate filament keratin-19
      (Krt19) marks long-lived, radiation-resistant cells above the crypt base that
      generate Lgr5(+) CBCs in the colon and intestine. In colorectal cancer models,
      Krt19(+) cancer-initiating cells are also radioresistant, while Lgr5(+) stem
      cells are radiosensitive. Moreover, Lgr5(+) stem cells are dispensable in both
      the normal and neoplastic colonic epithelium, as ablation of Lgr5(+) stem cells
      results in their regeneration from Krt19-expressing cells. Thus, Krt19(+) stem
      cells are a discrete target relevant for cancer therapy.

AB  - Stem cell decline is an important cellular driver of aging-associated
      pathophysiology in multiple tissues. Epigenetic regulation is central to
      establishing and maintaining stem cell function, and emerging evidence indicates 
      that epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the altered potential of stem cells 
      during aging. Unlike terminally differentiated cells, the impact of epigenetic
      dysregulation in stem cells is propagated beyond self; alterations can be
      heritably transmitted to differentiated progeny, in addition to being perpetuated
      and amplified within the stem cell pool through self-renewal divisions. This
      Review focuses on recent studies examining epigenetic regulation of
      tissue-specific stem cells in homeostasis, aging, and aging-related disease.

AB  - Aging is characterized by a decrease in genome integrity, impaired organ
      maintenance, and an increased risk of cancer, which coincide with clonal
      dominance of expanded mutant stem and progenitor cell populations in aging
      tissues, such as the intestinal epithelium, the hematopoietic system, and the
      male germline. Here we discuss possible explanations for age-associated increases
      in the initiation and/or progression of mutant stem/progenitor clones and
      highlight the roles of stem cell quiescence, replication-associated DNA damage,
      telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, and metabolic challenges as
      determinants of stem cell mutations and clonal dominance in aging.

AB  - The ability to reprogram adult somatic cells back to pluripotency presents a
      powerful tool for studying cell-fate identity and modeling human disease.
      However, the reversal of cellular age during reprogramming results in an
      embryonic-like state of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their
      derivatives, which presents specific challenges for modeling late onset disease. 
      This age reset requires novel methods to mimic age-related changes but also
      offers opportunities for studying cellular rejuvenation in real time. Here, we
      discuss how iPSC research may transform studies of aging and enable the precise
      programming of cellular age in parallel to cell-fate specification.

AB  - Longevity differs between sexes, with females being longer-lived in most mammals,
      including humans. One hallmark of aging is the functional decline of stem cells. 
      Thus, a key question is whether the aging of stem cells differs between males and
      females and whether this has consequences for disease and lifespan.

AB  - Age-related muscle decline is associated with functional impairment of satellite 
      cells (SCs). Conflicting data suggest dysregulation of cell-extrinsic or
      -intrinsic factors can independently contribute to such impairment. Here, we
      emphasize the importance of identifying nodes that integrate these factors into
      feed-forward circuits, which could provide targets for therapeutic intervention.

      propose that this paradox may be explained by the pervasive use of glycolysis by 
      somatic stem cells as opposed to the predominance of mitochondrial respiration in
      gametes.

AB  - Imperfect purity, subtypes, and retrospective functional assays compromise
      efforts to define the molecular identity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In
      this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Wilson et al. (2015) use a single-cell-based
      bioinformatics-experimental strategy to extract a consensus molecular signature
      from heterogeneous HSC pools. Their data and strategy provide a powerful resource
      for stem cell characterization.

AB  - Revealing how the core pluripotency circuitry is orchestrated to maintain the
      ground state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is fundamental for understanding
      self-renewal and early lineage specifications. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell,
      Ding et al. (2015) identify a new Sox2-interacting protein, Tex10, which,
      together with Tet1 and p300, regulate super-enhancers to sustain pluripotency.

AB  - Isolation of specific cell types, including pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived
      populations, is frequently accomplished using cell surface antigens expressed by 
      the cells of interest. However, specific antigens for many cell types have not
      been identified, making their isolation difficult. Here, we describe an efficient
      method for purifying cells based on endogenous miRNA activity. We designed
      synthetic mRNAs encoding a fluorescent protein tagged with sequences targeted by 
      miRNAs expressed by the cells of interest. These miRNA switches control their
      translation levels by sensing miRNA activities. Several miRNA switches (miR-1-,
      miR-208a-, and miR-499a-5p-switches) efficiently purified cardiomyocytes
      differentiated from human PSCs, and switches encoding the apoptosis inducer Bim
      enriched for cardiomyocytes without cell sorting. This approach is generally
      applicable, as miR-126-, miR-122-5p-, and miR-375-switches purified endothelial
      cells, hepatocytes, and insulin-producing cells differentiated from hPSCs,
      respectively. Thus, miRNA switches can purify cell populations for which other
      isolation strategies are unavailable.

AB  - Heterogeneity within the self-renewal durability of adult hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSCs) challenges our understanding of the molecular framework underlying
      HSC function. Gene expression studies have been hampered by the presence of
      multiple HSC subtypes and contaminating non-HSCs in bulk HSC populations. To gain
      deeper insight into the gene expression program of murine HSCs, we combined
      single-cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single-cell 
      gene expression assays. Through bioinformatic integration of these datasets, we
      designed an unbiased sorting strategy that separates non-HSCs away from HSCs, and
      single-cell transplantation experiments using the enriched population were
      combined with RNA-seq data to identify key molecules that associate with
      long-term durable self-renewal, producing a single-cell molecular dataset that is
      linked to functional stem cell activity. Finally, we demonstrated the broader
      applicability of this approach for linking key molecules with defined cellular
      functions in another stem cell system.

      co-occupied by multiple lineage-specific transcription factors driving expression
      of genes that define cell identity. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), SEs are
      highly enriched for the core pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. In this 
      study, we sought to dissect the molecular control mechanism of SE activity in
      pluripotency and reprogramming. Starting from a protein interaction network
      surrounding Sox2, we identified Tex10 as a key pluripotency factor that plays a
      functionally significant role in ESC self-renewal, early embryo development, and 
      reprogramming. Tex10 is enriched at SEs in a Sox2-dependent manner and
      coordinates histone acetylation and DNA demethylation at SEs. Tex10 activity is
      also important for pluripotency and reprogramming in human cells. Our study
      therefore highlights Tex10 as a core component of the pluripotency network and
      sheds light on its role in epigenetic control of SE activity for cell fate
      determination.

AB  - Maintaining genomic integrity is of paramount importance to embryonic stem cells 
      (ESCs), as mutations are readily propagated to daughter cells. ESCs display
      hypersensitivity to DNA damage-induced apoptosis (DIA) to prevent such
      propagation, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this apoptotic response
      are unclear. Here, we report that the regulatory RNA Apela positively regulates
      p53-mediated DIA. Apela is highly expressed in mouse ESCs and is repressed by p53
      activation, and Apela depletion compromises p53-dependent DIA. Although Apela
      contains a coding region, this coding ability is dispensable for Apela's role in 
      p53-mediated DIA. Instead, Apela functions as a regulatory RNA and interacts with
      hnRNPL, which prevents the mitochondrial localization and activation of p53.
      Together, these results describe a tri-element negative feedback loop composed of
      p53, Apela, and hnRNPL that regulates p53-mediated DIA, and they further
      demonstrate that regulatory RNAs add a layer of complexity to the apoptotic
      response of ESCs after DNA damage.

AB  - Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) hold great promise in cell-based therapy, but the
      genomic instability seen in culture hampers their full application. A greater
      understanding of the factors that regulate genomic stability in PSCs could help
      address this issue. Here we describe the identification of Filia as a specific
      regulator of genomic stability in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Filia
      expression is induced by genotoxic stress. Filia promotes centrosome integrity
      and regulates the DNA damage response (DDR) through multiple pathways, including 
      DDR signaling, cell-cycle checkpoints and damage repair, ESC differentiation, and
      apoptosis. Filia depletion causes ESC genomic instability, induces resistance to 
      apoptosis, and promotes malignant transformation. As part of its role in DDR,
      Filia interacts with PARP1 and stimulates its enzymatic activity. Filia also
      constitutively resides on centrosomes and translocates to DNA damage sites and
      mitochondria, consistent with its multifaceted roles in regulating centrosome
      integrity, damage repair, and apoptosis.

TI  - beta-Catenin Regulates Primitive Streak Induction through Collaborative
      Interactions with SMAD2/SMAD3 and OCT4.

AB  - Canonical Wnt and Nodal signaling are both required for induction of the
      primitive streak (PS), which guides organization of the early embryo. The Wnt
      effector beta-catenin is thought to function in these early lineage specification
      decisions via transcriptional activation of Nodal signaling. Here, we demonstrate
      a broader role for beta-catenin in PS formation by analyzing its genome-wide
      binding in a human embryonic stem cell model of PS induction. beta-catenin
      occupies regulatory regions in numerous PS and neural crest genes, and direct
      interactions between beta-catenin and the Nodal effectors SMAD2/SMAD3 are
      required at these regions for PS gene activation. Furthermore, OCT4 binding in
      proximity to these sites is likewise required for PS induction, suggesting a
      collaborative interaction between beta-catenin and OCT4. Induction of neural
      crest genes by beta-catenin is repressed by SMAD2/SMAD3, ensuring proper lineage 
      specification. This study provides mechanistic insight into how Wnt signaling
      controls early cell lineage decisions.

AB  - Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is believed to maintain a range of cognitive
      functions, many of which decline with age. We recently reported that radial
      neural stem cells (rNSCs) in the hippocampus undergo activation-dependent
      conversion into astrocytes, a mechanism that over time contributes to a reduction
      in the rNSC population. Here, we injected low and high levels of kainic acid (KA)
      in the dentate gyrus to assess whether neuronal hyperexcitation, a hallmark of
      epileptic disorders, could accelerate this conversion. At low levels of KA,
      generating epileptiform activity without seizures, we indeed found increased rNSC
      activation and conversion into astrocytes. At high levels, generating sustained
      epileptic seizures, however, we find that rNSCs divide symmetrically and that
      both mother and daughter cells convert into reactive astrocytes. Our results
      demonstrate that a threshold response for neuronal hyperexcitation provokes a
      dramatic shift in rNSC function, which impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis in 
      the long term.

AB  - Following myocardial infarction (MI), myeloid cells derived from the
      hematopoietic system drive a sharp increase in systemic leukocyte levels that
      correlates closely with mortality. The origin of these myeloid cells, and the
      response of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to MI, however, is
      unclear. Here, we identify a CCR2(+)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK hematopoietic subset as
      the most upstream contributor to emergency myelopoiesis after ischemic organ
      injury. This subset has 4-fold higher proliferation rates than
      CCR2(-)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK cells, displays a myeloid differentiation bias, and
      dominates the migratory HSPC population. We further demonstrate that the myeloid 
      translocation gene 16 (Mtg16) regulates CCR2(+) HSPC emergence. Mtg16(-/-) mice
      have decreased levels of systemic monocytes and infarct-associated macrophages
      and display compromised tissue healing and post-MI heart failure. Together, these
      data provide insights into regulation of emergency hematopoiesis after ischemic
      injury and identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate leukocyte output
      after MI.

AB  - Epithelia cover the surfaces and line the cavities of the body. Recent studies
      have highlighted the existence of multiple stem cell compartments within
      individual epithelia that exhibit striking plasticity in response to tissue
      damage, transplantation, or tumor development. New knowledge about the
      composition of the epithelial niche and the transcription factor networks that
      maintain cell identity has provided new insights into the extrinsic and intrinsic
      regulation of stem cell behavior. In addition new in vitro tissue substitutes
      allow better integration of data from human and mouse models.

TI  - Erosion of X Chromosome Inactivation in Human Pluripotent Cells Initiates with
      XACT Coating and Depends on a Specific Heterochromatin Landscape.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) display extensive epigenetic instability,
      particularly on the X chromosome. In this study, we show that, in hPSCs, the
      inactive X chromosome has a specific heterochromatin landscape that predisposes
      it to erosion of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process that occurs
      spontaneously in hPSCs. Heterochromatin remodeling and gene reactivation occur in
      a non-random fashion and are confined to specific H3K27me3-enriched domains,
      leaving H3K9me3-marked regions unaffected. Using single-cell monitoring of XCI
      erosion, we show that this instability only occurs in pluripotent cells. We also 
      provide evidence that loss of XIST expression is not the primary cause of XCI
      instability and that gene reactivation from the inactive X (Xi) precedes loss of 
      XIST coating. Notably, expression and coating by the long non-coding RNA XACT are
      early events in XCI erosion and, therefore, may play a role in mediating this
      process.

TI  - Opposing Roles for the lncRNA Haunt and Its Genomic Locus in Regulating HOXA Gene
      Activation during Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in controlling various aspects
      of embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology, although the functions of specific lncRNAs,
      and the molecular mechanisms through which they act, remain unclear. Here, we
      demonstrate discrete and opposing roles for the lncRNA transcript Haunt and its
      genomic locus in regulating the HOXA gene cluster during ESC differentiation.
      Reducing or enhancing Haunt expression, with minimal disruption of the Haunt
      locus, led to upregulation or downregulation of HOXA genes, respectively. In
      contrast, increasingly large genomic deletions within the Haunt locus attenuated 
      HOXA activation. The Haunt DNA locus contains potential enhancers of HOXA
      activation, whereas Haunt RNA acts to prevent aberrant HOXA expression. This work
      reveals a multifaceted model of lncRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of the
      HOXA cluster, with distinct roles for a lncRNA transcript and its genomic locus, 
      while illustrating the power of rapid CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing for
      assigning lncRNA functions.

AB  - Transplantation of in-vitro-generated organ buds is a promising approach toward
      regenerating functional and vascularized organs. Though it has been recently
      shown in the context of liver models, demonstrating the applicability of this
      approach to other systems by delineating the molecular mechanisms guiding organ
      bud formation is critical. Here, we demonstrate a generalized method for organ
      bud formation from diverse tissues by combining pluripotent stem cell-derived
      tissue-specific progenitors or relevant tissue samples with endothelial cells and
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The MSCs initiated condensation within these
      heterotypic cell mixtures, which was dependent upon substrate matrix stiffness.
      Defining optimal mechanical properties promoted formation of 3D, transplantable
      organ buds from tissues including kidney, pancreas, intestine, heart, lung, and
      brain. Transplanted pancreatic and renal buds were rapidly vascularized and
      self-organized into functional, tissue-specific structures. These findings
      provide a general platform for harnessing mechanical properties to generate
      vascularized, complex organ buds with broad applications for regenerative
      medicine.

AB  - Cell metabolism is adaptive to extrinsic demands; however, the intrinsic
      metabolic demands that drive the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) program
      remain unclear. Although glycolysis increases throughout the reprogramming
      process, we show that the estrogen-related nuclear receptors (ERRalpha and
      ERRgamma) and their partnered co-factors PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta are transiently
      induced at an early stage, resulting in a burst of oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS) activity. Upregulation of ERRalpha or ERRgamma is required for the
      OXPHOS burst in both human and mouse cells, respectively, as well as iPSC
      generation itself. Failure to induce this metabolic switch collapses the
      reprogramming process. Furthermore, we identify a rare pool of Sca1(-)/CD34(-)
      sortable cells that is highly enriched in bona fide reprogramming progenitors.
      Transcriptional profiling confirmed that these progenitors are ERRgamma and
      PGC-1beta positive and have undergone extensive metabolic reprogramming. These
      studies characterize a previously unrecognized, ERR-dependent metabolic gate
      prior to establishment of induced pluripotency.

AB  - Germ cell specification is accompanied by epigenetic remodeling, the scale and
      specificity of which are unclear. Here, we quantitatively delineate chromatin
      dynamics during induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to epiblast-like
      cells (EpiLCs) and from there into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs),
      revealing large-scale reorganization of chromatin signatures including H3K27me3
      and H3K9me2 patterns. EpiLCs contain abundant bivalent gene promoters
      characterized by low H3K27me3, indicating a state primed for differentiation.
      PGCLCs initially lose H3K4me3 from many bivalent genes but subsequently regain
      this mark with concomitant upregulation of H3K27me3, particularly at
      developmental regulatory genes. PGCLCs progressively lose H3K9me2, including at
      lamina-associated perinuclear heterochromatin, resulting in changes in nuclear
      architecture. T recruits H3K27ac to activate BLIMP1 and early mesodermal programs
      during PGCLC specification, which is followed by BLIMP1-mediated repression of a 
      broad range of targets, possibly through recruitment and spreading of H3K27me3.
      These findings provide a foundation for reconstructing regulatory networks of the
      germline epigenome.

      cells through activation of Wnt signaling.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent subtype of liver cancer, and
      it is characterized by a high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity. Liver cancer 
      stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both of these pathological properties,
      but the mechanisms underlying their self-renewal and maintenance are poorly
      understood. Here, using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a long
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) termed lncTCF7 that is highly expressed in HCC tumors and 
      liver CSCs. LncTCF7 is required for liver CSC self-renewal and tumor propagation.
      Mechanistically, lncTCF7 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the promoter of TCF7 to 
      regulate its expression, leading to activation of Wnt signaling. Our data suggest
      that lncTCF7-mediated Wnt signaling primes liver CSC self-renewal and tumor
      propagation. In sum, therefore, we have identified an lncRNA-based Wnt signaling 
      regulatory circuit that promotes tumorigenic activity in liver cancer stem cells,
      highlighting the role that lncRNAs can play in tumor growth and propagation.

AB  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is characterized by frequent loss of PTCH1, leading to
      constitutive activation of the Hedgehog pathway. Although the requirement for
      Hedgehog in BCC is well established, the identity of disease-initiating cells and
      the compartments in which they reside remain controversial. By using several
      inducible Cre drivers to delete Ptch1 in different cell compartments in mice, we 
      show here that multiple hair follicle stem cell populations readily develop
      BCC-like tumors. In contrast, stem cells within the interfollicular epidermis do 
      not efficiently form tumors. Notably, we observed that innervated Gli1-expressing
      progenitors within mechanosensory touch dome epithelia are highly tumorigenic.
      Sensory nerves activate Hedgehog signaling in normal touch domes, while
      denervation attenuates touch dome-derived tumors. Together, our studies identify 
      varying tumor susceptibilities among different stem cell populations in the skin,
      highlight touch dome epithelia as "hot spots" for tumor formation, and implicate 
      cutaneous nerves as mediators of tumorigenesis.

AB  - Embryonic development relies on the capacity of progenitor cells to appropriately
      respond to inductive cues, a cellular property known as developmental competence.
      Here, we report that epigenetic priming of enhancers signifies developmental
      competence during endodermal lineage diversification. Chromatin mapping during
      pancreatic and hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells revealed the
      en masse acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers specific to
      endoderm-derived cell lineages in gut tube intermediates. Experimentally, the
      acquisition of this poised enhancer state predicts the ability of endodermal
      intermediates to respond to inductive signals. Furthermore, these enhancers are
      first recognized by the pioneer transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 when
      competence is acquired, while subsequent recruitment of lineage-inductive
      transcription factors, such as PDX1, leads to enhancer and target gene
      activation. Together, our results identify the acquisition of a poised chromatin 
      state at enhancers as a mechanism by which progenitor cells acquire developmental
      competence.

AB  - The promising clinical results obtained with engineered T cells, including
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, call for further advancements to
      facilitate and broaden their applicability. One potentially beneficial innovation
      is to exploit new T cell sources that reduce the need for autologous cell
      manufacturing and enable cell transfer across histocompatibility barriers. Here
      we review emerging T cell engineering approaches that utilize alternative T cell 
      sources, which include virus-specific or T cell receptor-less allogeneic T cells,
      expanded lymphoid progenitors, and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived T
      lymphocytes. The latter offer the prospect for true off-the-shelf, genetically
      enhanced, histocompatible cell therapy products.

AB  - Specification of the epiblast and primitive endoderm is one of the earliest
      differentiation steps during embryogenesis. In vitro tracking of pluripotency
      markers in ESCs suggests that epiblast specification may be plastic; however,
      live imaging of blastocysts, as detailed in a recent paper from Xenopoulos et al 
      (2015), showed that, unlike in ESCs, fate commitment in vivo is largely
      irreversible.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence diverse cellular processes and have been 
      implicated in regulating stem cell properties. Now in Cell Stem Cell, Ramos et
      al. (2015) demonstrate that the neural-specific lncRNA Pnky regulates neuronal
      differentiation from neural stem cells and mediates RNA splicing through
      interactions with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1).

TI  - The long noncoding RNA Pnky regulates neuronal differentiation of embryonic and
      postnatal neural stem cells.
PG  - 439-447
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2015.02.007 [doi]
AB  - While thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, few
      lncRNAs that control neural stem cell (NSC) behavior are known. Here, we identify
      Pinky (Pnky) as a neural-specific lncRNA that regulates neurogenesis from NSCs in
      the embryonic and postnatal brain. In postnatal NSCs, Pnky knockdown potentiates 
      neuronal lineage commitment and expands the transit-amplifying cell population,
      increasing neuron production several-fold. Pnky is evolutionarily conserved and
      expressed in NSCs of the developing human brain. In the embryonic mouse cortex,
      Pnky knockdown increases neuronal differentiation and depletes the NSC
      population. Pnky interacts with the splicing regulator PTBP1, and PTBP1 knockdown
      also enhances neurogenesis. In NSCs, Pnky and PTBP1 regulate the expression and
      alternative splicing of a core set of transcripts that relates to the cellular
      phenotype. These data thus unveil Pnky as a conserved lncRNA that interacts with 
      a key RNA processing factor and regulates neurogenesis from embryonic and
      postnatal NSC populations.

AB  - X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) is a genetic disease that
      leaves newborns at high risk of serious infection and a predicted life span of
      less than 1 year in the absence of a matched bone marrow donor. The disease
      pathogenesis is due to mutations in the gene encoding the Interleukin-2 receptor 
      gamma chain (IL-2Rgamma), leading to a lack of functional lymphocytes. With the
      leukemogenic concerns of viral gene therapy there is a need to explore
      alternative therapeutic options. We have utilized induced pluripotent stem cell
      (iPSC) technology and genome editing mediated by TALENs to generate isogenic
      subject-specific mutant and gene-corrected iPSC lines. While the subject-derived 
      mutant iPSCs have the capacity to generate hematopoietic precursors and myeloid
      cells, only wild-type and gene-corrected iPSCs can additionally generate mature
      NK cells and T cell precursors expressing the correctly spliced IL-2Rgamma. This 
      study highlights the potential for the development of autologous cell therapy for
      SCID-X1 subjects.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess unique gene expression programs that
      enforce their identity and regulate lineage commitment. Long non-coding RNAs
      (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and cell fate
      decisions, although their functions in HSCs are unclear. Here we profiled the
      transcriptome of purified HSCs by deep sequencing and identified 323 unannotated 
      lncRNAs. Comparing their expression in differentiated lineages revealed 159
      lncRNAs enriched in HSCs, some of which are likely HSC specific (LncHSCs). These 
      lncRNA genes share epigenetic features with protein-coding genes, including
      regulated expression via DNA methylation, and knocking down two LncHSCs revealed 
      distinct effects on HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment. We mapped the
      genomic binding sites of one of these candidates and found enrichment for key
      hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites, especially E2A. Together, these
      results demonstrate that lncRNAs play important roles in regulating HSCs,
      providing an additional layer to the genetic circuitry controlling HSC function.

AB  - Predisposition to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) involves interactions
      between a person's unique combination of genetic variants and the environment.
      The molecular effect of these variants may be subtle and difficult to analyze
      with standard in vitro or in vivo models. Here we used hIPSCs to examine genetic 
      variation in the SORL1 gene and possible contributions to SAD-related phenotypes 
      in human neurons. We found that human neurons carrying SORL1 variants associated 
      with an increased SAD risk show a reduced response to treatment with BDNF, at the
      level of both SORL1 expression and APP processing. shRNA knockdown of SORL1
      demonstrates that the differences in BDNF-induced APP processing between
      genotypes are dependent on SORL1 expression. We propose that the variation in
      SORL1 expression induction by BDNF is modulated by common genetic variants and
      can explain how genetic variation in this one locus can contribute to an
      individual's risk of developing SAD.

AB  - To analyze cellular reprogramming at the single-cell level, mass cytometry was
      used to simultaneously measure markers of pluripotency, differentiation,
      cell-cycle status, and cellular signaling throughout the reprogramming process.
      Time-resolved progression analysis of the resulting data sets was used to
      construct a continuous molecular roadmap for three independent reprogramming
      systems. Although these systems varied substantially in Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and
      c-Myc stoichiometry, they presented a common set of reprogramming landmarks.
      Early in the reprogramming process, Oct4(high)Klf4(high) cells transitioned to a 
      CD73(high)CD104(high)CD54(low) partially reprogrammed state. Ki67(low) cells from
      this intermediate population reverted to a MEF-like phenotype, but Ki67(high)
      cells advanced through the M-E-T and then bifurcated into two distinct
      populations: an ESC-like Nanog(high)Sox2(high)CD54(high) population and a
      mesendoderm-like Nanog(low)Sox2(low)Lin28(high)CD24(high)PDGFR-alpha(high)
      population. The methods developed here for time-resolved, single-cell progression
      analysis may be used for the study of additional complex and dynamic systems,
      such as cancer progression and embryonic development.

AB  - The neural crest (NC) is an embryonic stem/progenitor cell population that
      generates a diverse array of cell lineages, including peripheral neurons,
      myelinating Schwann cells, and melanocytes, among others. However, there is a
      long-standing controversy as to whether this broad developmental perspective
      reflects in vivo multipotency of individual NC cells or whether the NC is
      comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of lineage-restricted progenitors. Here, we 
      resolve this controversy by performing in vivo fate mapping of single trunk NC
      cells both at premigratory and migratory stages using the R26R-Confetti mouse
      model. By combining quantitative clonal analyses with definitive markers of
      differentiation, we demonstrate that the vast majority of individual NC cells are
      multipotent, with only few clones contributing to single derivatives.
      Intriguingly, multipotency is maintained in migratory NC cells. Thus, our
      findings provide definitive evidence for the in vivo multipotency of both
      premigratory and migrating NC cells in the mouse.

AB  - The relationship between chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation is
      an area of intense investigation. We characterized the spatial relationships
      between alleles of the Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes in single cells during the
      earliest stages of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and during
      embryonic development. We describe homologous pairing of the Oct4 alleles during 
      ESC differentiation and embryogenesis, and we present evidence that pairing is
      correlated with the kinetics of ESC differentiation. Importantly, we identify
      critical DNA elements within the Oct4 promoter/enhancer region that mediate
      pairing of Oct4 alleles. Finally, we show that mutation of OCT4/SOX2 binding
      sites within this region abolishes inter-chromosomal interactions and affects
      accumulation of the repressive H3K9me2 modification at the Oct4 enhancer. Our
      findings demonstrate that chromatin organization and transcriptional programs are
      intimately connected in ESCs and that the dynamic positioning of the Oct4 alleles
      is associated with the transition from pluripotency to lineage specification.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) rely on instructive cues from the bone marrow
      (BM) niche to maintain their quiescence and adapt blood production to the
      organism's needs. Alterations in the BM niche are commonly observed in blood
      malignancies and directly contribute to the aberrant function of
      disease-initiating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Here, we review recent insights
      into the cellular and molecular determinants of the normal HSC niche and describe
      how genetic changes in stromal cells and leukemia-induced BM niche remodeling
      contribute to blood malignancies. Moreover, we discuss how these findings can be 
      applied to non-cell-autonomous therapies targeting the LSC niche.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are heterogeneous and primitive cells discovered
      first in the bone marrow (BM). They have putative roles in maintaining tissue
      homeostasis and are increasingly recognized as components of stem cell niches,
      which are best defined in the blood. The absence of in vivo MSC markers has
      limited our ability to track their behavior in vivo and draw comparisons with in 
      vitro observations. Here we review the historical background of BM-MSCs, advances
      made in their prospective isolation, their developmental origin and contribution 
      to maintaining subsets of hematopoietic cells, and how mesenchymal cells
      contribute to other stem cell niches.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumor cells that have the principal properties of
      self-renewal, clonal tumor initiation capacity, and clonal long-term repopulation
      potential. CSCs reside in niches, which are anatomically distinct regions within 
      the tumor microenvironment. These niches maintain the principle properties of
      CSCs, preserve their phenotypic plasticity, protect them from the immune system, 
      and facilitate their metastatic potential. In this perspective, we focus on the
      CSC niche and discuss its contribution to tumor initiation and progression. Since
      CSCs survive many commonly employed cancer therapies, we examine the prospects of
      targeting the niche components as preferable therapeutic targets.

      Nature Cell Biology, Zhou et al. (2015) report that glioma stem cells secrete
      Periostin (POSTN), which recruits tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and
      supports the tumor-promoting M2 subtype.

AB  - Neural crest precursors generate diverse cell lineages during development, which 
      have been proposed to arise either from multipotent precursor cells or pools of
      heterogeneous, restricted progenitors. Now in Cell Stem Cell, Baggiolini et al.
      (2015) perform rigorous in vivo lineage tracing to show that individual neural
      crest precursors are multipotent.

AB  - Pairing of homologous alleles is a phenomenon generally associated with imprinted
      and mono-allelically expressed loci. In this issue, Hogan et al. (2015) examine
      the earliest steps between pluripotency and lineage commitment in ESCs and find a
      critical role for transient pairing of Oct4 alleles in exiting the pluripotent
      state.

AB  - Autologous transplantation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell
      (iPSC)-derived neurons is a potential clinical approach for treatment of
      neurological disease. Preclinical demonstration of long-term efficacy,
      feasibility, and safety of iPSC-derived dopamine neurons in non-human primate
      models will be an important step in clinical development of cell therapy. Here,
      we analyzed cynomolgus monkey (CM) iPSC-derived midbrain dopamine neurons for up 
      to 2 years following autologous transplantation in a Parkinson's disease (PD)
      model. In one animal, with the most successful protocol, we found that unilateral
      engraftment of CM-iPSCs could provide a gradual onset of functional motor
      improvement contralateral to the side of dopamine neuron transplantation, and
      increased motor activity, without a need for immunosuppression. Postmortem
      analyses demonstrated robust survival of midbrain-like dopaminergic neurons and
      extensive outgrowth into the transplanted putamen. Our proof of concept findings 
      support further development of autologous iPSC-derived cell transplantation for
      treatment of PD.

AB  - Regulated blood production is achieved through the hierarchical organization of
      dormant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) subsets that differ in self-renewal
      potential and division frequency, with long-term (LT)-HSCs dividing the least.
      The molecular mechanisms underlying this variability in HSC division kinetics are
      unknown. We report here that quiescence exit kinetics are differentially
      regulated within human HSC subsets through the expression level of CDK6. LT-HSCs 
      lack CDK6 protein. Short-term (ST)-HSCs are also quiescent but contain high CDK6 
      protein levels that permit rapid cell cycle entry upon mitogenic stimulation.
      Enforced CDK6 expression in LT-HSCs shortens quiescence exit and confers
      competitive advantage without impacting function. Computational modeling suggests
      that this independent control of quiescence exit kinetics inherently limits
      LT-HSC divisions and preserves the HSC pool to ensure lifelong hematopoiesis.
      Thus, differential expression of CDK6 underlies heterogeneity in stem cell
      quiescence states that functionally regulates this highly regenerative system.

      epitranscriptomic modification of eukaryotic mRNAs, but its features, regulatory 
      mechanisms, and functions in cell reprogramming are largely unknown. Here, we
      report m(6)A modification profiles in the mRNA transcriptomes of four cell types 
      with different degrees of pluripotency. Comparative analysis reveals several
      features of m(6)A, especially gene- and cell-type-specific m(6)A mRNA
      modifications. We also show that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate m(6)A modification
      via a sequence pairing mechanism. Manipulation of miRNA expression or sequences
      alters m(6)A modification levels through modulating the binding of METTL3
      methyltransferase to mRNAs containing miRNA targeting sites. Increased m(6)A
      abundance promotes the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to
      pluripotent stem cells; conversely, reduced m(6)A levels impede reprogramming.
      Our results therefore uncover a role for miRNAs in regulating m(6)A formation of 
      mRNAs and provide a foundation for future functional studies of m(6)A
      modification in cell reprogramming.

AB  - Radiation therapy to the brain is a powerful tool in the management of many
      cancers, but it is associated with significant and irreversible long-term side
      effects, including cognitive decline and impairment of motor coordination.
      Depletion of oligodendrocyte progenitors and demyelination are major pathological
      features that are particularly pronounced in younger individuals and severely
      limit therapeutic options. Here we tested whether human ESC-derived
      oligodendrocytes can functionally remyelinate the irradiated brain using a rat
      model. We demonstrate the efficient derivation and prospective isolation of human
      oligodendrocyte progenitors, which, upon transplantation, migrate throughout the 
      major white matter tracts resulting in both structural and functional repair.
      Behavioral testing showed complete recovery of cognitive function while
      additional recovery from motor deficits required concomitant transplantation into
      the cerebellum. The ability to repair radiation-induced damage to the brain could
      dramatically improve the outlook for cancer survivors and enable more effective
      use of radiation therapies, especially in children.

AB  - Following injury, stem cells restore normal tissue architecture by producing the 
      proper number and proportions of differentiated cells. Current models of airway
      epithelial regeneration propose that distinct cytokeratin 8-expressing progenitor
      cells, arising from p63(+) basal stem cells, subsequently differentiate into
      secretory and ciliated cell lineages. We now show that immediately following
      injury, discrete subpopulations of p63(+) airway basal stem/progenitor cells
      themselves express Notch pathway components associated with either secretory or
      ciliated cell fate commitment. One basal cell population displays intracellular
      Notch2 activation and directly generates secretory cells; the other expresses
      c-myb and directly yields ciliated cells. Furthermore, disrupting Notch ligand
      activity within the basal cell population at large disrupts the normal pattern of
      lineage segregation. These non-cell-autonomous effects demonstrate that effective
      airway epithelial regeneration requires intercellular communication within the
      broader basal stem/progenitor cell population. These findings have broad
      implications for understanding epithelial regeneration and stem cell
      heterogeneity.

AB  - The bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as an effective tool for
      sequence-specific gene knockout through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but it
      remains inefficient for precise editing of genome sequences. Here we develop a
      reporter-based screening approach for high-throughput identification of chemical 
      compounds that can modulate precise genome editing through homology-directed
      repair (HDR). Using our screening method, we have identified small molecules that
      can enhance CRISPR-mediated HDR efficiency, 3-fold for large fragment insertions 
      and 9-fold for point mutations. Interestingly, we have also observed that a small
      molecule that inhibits HDR can enhance frame shift insertion and deletion (indel)
      mutations mediated by NHEJ. The identified small molecules function robustly in
      diverse cell types with minimal toxicity. The use of small molecules provides a
      simple and effective strategy to enhance precise genome engineering applications 
      and facilitates the study of DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian cells.

AB  - About half of the human genome consists of highly repetitive elements, most of
      which are considered dispensable for human life. Here, we report that repetitive 
      elements originating from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are systematically
      transcribed during human early embryogenesis in a stage-specific manner. Our
      analysis highlights that the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of ERVs provide the
      template for stage-specific transcription initiation, thereby generating hundreds
      of co-expressed, ERV-derived RNAs. Conversion of human embryonic stem cells
      (hESCs) to an epiblast-like state activates blastocyst-specific ERV elements,
      indicating that their activity dynamically reacts to changes in regulatory
      networks. In addition to initiating stage-specific transcription, many ERV
      families contain preserved splice sites that join the ERV segment with non-ERV
      exons in their genomic vicinity. In summary, we find that ERV expression is a
      hallmark of cellular identity and cell potency that characterizes the cell
      populations in early human embryos.

AB  - The direct lineage reprogramming of one specialized cell type into another using 
      defined factors has fundamentally re-shaped traditional concepts regarding the
      epigenetic stability of differentiated cells. With the rapid increase in cell
      types generated through direct conversion in recent years, this strategy has
      become a promising approach for producing functional cells. Here, we review
      recent advances in lineage reprogramming, including the identification of novel
      reprogramming factors, underlying molecular mechanisms, strategies for generating
      functionally mature cells, and assays for characterizing induced cells. We also
      discuss progress toward the application of lineage reprogramming and the major
      future challenges for this strategy.

      cancers increases with age. Recently in Science, Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) 
      refined this model by providing a potential explanation, arguing that early
      random mutational events within individual stem cells of regenerating organs may 
      underlie this correlation.

AB  - Ascl2 is a Wnt-responsive master transcription factor that controls the Lgr5(+)
      intestinal stem cell gene expression program. Now in Cell Stem Cell, Schuijers et
      al. (2015) report an Ascl2 positive feedback loop, tuned by previous Wnt pathway 
      activity, that perpetuates intestinal stem cell identity in response to
      Wnt/R-spondin stimulation.

TI  - Ascl2 acts as an R-spondin/Wnt-responsive switch to control stemness in
      intestinal crypts.

AB  - The Wnt signaling pathway controls stem cell identity in the intestinal
      epithelium and in many other adult organs. The transcription factor Ascl2 (a Wnt 
      target gene) is a master regulator of intestinal stem cell identity. It is
      unclear how the continuous Wnt gradient along the crypt axis is translated into
      discrete expression of Ascl2 and discrete specification of stem cells at crypt
      bottoms. We show that (1) Ascl2 is regulated in a direct autoactivatory loop,
      leading to a distinct on/off expression pattern, and (2) Wnt/R-spondin can
      activate this regulatory loop. This mechanism interprets the Wnt levels in the
      intestinal crypt and translates the continuous Wnt signal into a discrete Ascl2
      "on" or "off" decision. In turn, Ascl2, together with beta-catenin/Tcf, activates
      the genes fundamental to the stem cell state. In this manner, Ascl2 forms a
      transcriptional switch that is both Wnt responsive and Wnt dependent to define
      stem cell identity.

AB  - Stem cells undergo a shift in metabolic substrate utilization during
      specification and/or differentiation, a process that has been termed metabolic
      reprogramming. Here, we report that during the transition from quiescence to
      proliferation, skeletal muscle stem cells experience a metabolic switch from
      fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. This reprogramming of cellular metabolism
      decreases intracellular NAD(+) levels and the activity of the histone deacetylase
      SIRT1, leading to elevated H4K16 acetylation and activation of muscle gene
      transcription. Selective genetic ablation of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain in
      skeletal muscle results in increased H4K16 acetylation and deregulated activation
      of the myogenic program in SCs. Moreover, mice with muscle-specific inactivation 
      of the SIRT1 deacetylase domain display reduced myofiber size, impaired muscle
      regeneration, and derepression of muscle developmental genes. Overall, these
      findings reveal how metabolic cues can be mechanistically translated into
      epigenetic modifications that regulate skeletal muscle stem cell biology.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated
      destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. In most 
      cases, reversal of disease would require strategies combining islet cell
      replacement with immunotherapy that are currently available only for the most
      severely affected patients. Here, we demonstrate that immunotherapies that target
      T cell costimulatory pathways block the rejection of xenogeneic human
      embryonic-stem-cell-derived pancreatic endoderm (hESC-PE) in mice. The therapy
      allowed for long-term development of hESC-PE into islet-like structures capable
      of producing human insulin and maintaining normoglycemia. Moreover, short-term
      costimulation blockade led to robust immune tolerance that could be transferred
      independently of regulatory T cells. Importantly, costimulation blockade
      prevented the rejection of allogeneic hESC-PE by human PBMCs in a humanized model
      in vivo. These results support the clinical development of hESC-derived therapy, 
      combined with tolerogenic treatments, as a sustainable alternative strategy for
      patients with T1D.

AB  - Cellular reprogramming highlights the epigenetic plasticity of the somatic cell
      state. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerging roles in epigenetic
      regulation, but their potential functions in reprogramming cell fate have been
      largely unexplored. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the
      expression patterns of over 16,000 genes, including 437 lncRNAs, during defined
      stages of reprogramming to pluripotency. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were used as
      an intuitive way to structure and interrogate transcriptome data at the
      single-cell level. Early molecular events during reprogramming involved the
      activation of Ras signaling pathways, along with hundreds of lncRNAs.
      Loss-of-function studies showed that activated lncRNAs can repress
      lineage-specific genes, while lncRNAs activated in multiple reprogramming cell
      types can regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that
      reprogramming cells activate defined sets of functionally relevant lncRNAs and
      provide a resource to further investigate how dynamic changes in the
      transcriptome reprogram cell state.

TI  - Different levels of Twist1 regulate skin tumor initiation, stemness, and
      progression.

AB  - Twist1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, metastasis,
      and cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. However, it remains unclear whether Twist1
      is also required for tumor initiation and whether Twist1-induced cancer stemness 
      and EMT are functionally linked. Using a conditional deletion of Twist1 at
      different stages of skin carcinogenesis, we show that Twist1 is required for skin
      tumor initiation and progression in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. Moreover,
      conditional ablation of Twist1 in benign tumors leads to increased apoptosis,
      reduced cell proliferation, and defective tumor maintenance and propagation
      independently of its EMT-inducing abilities. Concomitant deletion of Twist1 and
      p53 rescues the apoptotic response, but not the cell proliferation and
      propagation defects. These results reveal that Twist1 is required for tumor
      initiation and maintenance in a p53-dependent and -independent manner.
      Importantly, our findings also indicate that tumor stemness and EMT can be
      regulated by distinct mechanisms.

AB  - Somatic reprogramming has relied heavily on theoretical models that view
      differentiation in terms of developmental branch point decisions. Recent studies 
      in Cell now reveal a dominant role of the microenvironment in shaping epigenetic 
      identity of macrophages, thus providing support for alternative models of cell
      fate acquisition.

AB  - Twist1 has a well-established role in inducing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 
      (EMT) to promote tumor invasion and metastasis and can also inhibit apoptosis and
      confer stemness. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Beck et al. (2015) now show
      that low levels of Twist1 are essential for tumor initiation, maintenance, and
      stemness independent of its EMT-inducing activity.

AB  - Mutations in the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene Rb are involved in many
      forms of human cancer. In this study, we investigated the early consequences of
      inactivating Rb in the context of cellular reprogramming. We found that Rb
      inactivation promotes the reprogramming of differentiated cells to a pluripotent 
      state. Unexpectedly, this effect is cell cycle independent, and instead reflects 
      direct binding of Rb to pluripotency genes, including Sox2 and Oct4, which leads 
      to a repressed chromatin state. More broadly, this regulation of pluripotency
      networks and Sox2 in particular is critical for the initiation of tumors upon
      loss of Rb in mice. These studies therefore identify Rb as a global
      transcriptional repressor of pluripotency networks, providing a molecular basis
      for previous reports about its involvement in cell fate pliability, and implicate
      misregulation of pluripotency factors such as Sox2 in tumorigenesis related to
      loss of Rb function.

AB  - The generation of pluripotent stem cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) 
      has recently been achieved in human cells and sparked new interest in this
      technology. The authors reporting this methodical breakthrough speculated that
      SCNT would allow the creation of patient-matched embryonic stem cells, even in
      patients with hereditary mitochondrial diseases. However, herein we show that
      mismatched mitochondria in nuclear-transfer-derived embryonic stem cells
      (NT-ESCs) possess alloantigenicity and are subject to immune rejection. In a
      murine transplantation setup, we demonstrate that allogeneic mitochondria in
      NT-ESCs, which are nucleus-identical to the recipient, may trigger an adaptive
      alloimmune response that impairs the survival of NT-ESC grafts. The immune
      response is adaptive, directed against mitochondrial content, and amenable for
      tolerance induction. Mitochondrial alloantigenicity should therefore be
      considered when developing therapeutic SCNT-based strategies.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in the perivascular niche of many organs,
      including kidney, lung, liver, and heart, although their roles in these tissues
      are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Gli1 marks perivascular MSC-like
      cells that substantially contribute to organ fibrosis. In vitro, Gli1(+) cells
      express typical MSC markers, exhibit trilineage differentiation capacity, and
      possess colony-forming activity, despite constituting a small fraction of the
      platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFRbeta)(+) cell population. Genetic
      lineage tracing analysis demonstrates that tissue-resident, but not circulating, 
      Gli1(+) cells proliferate after kidney, lung, liver, or heart injury to generate 
      myofibroblasts. Genetic ablation of these cells substantially ameliorates kidney 
      and heart fibrosis and preserves ejection fraction in a model of induced heart
      failure. These findings implicate perivascular Gli1(+) MSC-like cells as a major 
      cellular origin of organ fibrosis and demonstrate that these cells may be a
      relevant therapeutic target to prevent solid organ dysfunction after injury.

TI  - GPI-80 defines self-renewal ability in hematopoietic stem cells during human
      development.

AB  - Advances in pluripotent stem cell and reprogramming technologies have given us
      the hope of generating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in culture. To succeed,
      greater understanding of the self-renewing HSC during human development is
      required. We discovered that the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored surface
      protein GPI-80 defines a subpopulation of human fetal liver hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with self-renewal ability.
      CD34(+)CD38(lo/-)CD90(+)GPI-80(+) HSPCs were the sole population that maintained 
      proliferative potential and an undifferentiated state in stroma coculture and
      engrafted in immunodeficient mice. GPI-80 expression also enabled tracking of
      HSPCs once they emerged from endothelium and migrated between human fetal
      hematopoietic niches. GPI-80 colocalized on the surface of HSPCs with Integrin
      alpha-M (ITGAM), which in leukocytes cooperates with GPI-80 to support migration.
      Knockdown of GPI-80 or ITGAM was sufficient to compromise HSPC expansion in
      culture and engraftment in vivo. These findings indicate that human fetal HSCs
      employ mechanisms used in leukocyte adhesion and migration to mediate HSC
      self-renewal.

AB  - Cellular identity is established by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental
      factors that regulate organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Although some
      flexibility in fate potential is beneficial to overall organ health, dramatic
      changes in cellular identity can have disastrous consequences. Emerging data
      within the field of pancreas biology are revising current beliefs about how
      cellular identity is shaped by developmental and environmental cues under
      homeostasis and stress conditions. Here, we discuss the changes occurring in
      cellular states upon fate modulation and address how our understanding of the
      nature of this fluidity is shaping therapeutic approaches to pancreatic disorders
      such as diabetes and cancer.
