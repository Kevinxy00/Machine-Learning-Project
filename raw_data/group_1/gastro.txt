TI  - Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening in Detecting Earlier-stage Disease -
      a Nationwide Cohort Study in Denmark.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30405-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most studies of the effectiveness of screening for colorectal 
      cancer (CRC) using the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) tested the guaiac FOBT.
      However, the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is now commonly used in screening.
      We aimed to evaluate the effects of FIT-based screening for CRC on the number of 
      incident CRC diagnoses and stage at diagnosis for individuals in Denmark who were
      invited for screening vs not invited. METHODS: We collected data from a
      register-based retrospective cohort study during the first 16 months of the
      prevalence round of a FIT-based CRC screening program (March 1, 2014 through June
      30, 2015). A total of 402,826 residents of Denmark (50-72 years old) were
      randomly invited to undergo CRC screening within the study period and 956,514
      were invited thereafter. We obtained information on CRC diagnosis, date, and
      stage at diagnosis from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database. Cancer
      incidence per 100,000 invited/not yet invited individuals was calculated along
      with the relative risk (RR) of CRC among invited compared with not yet invited
      individuals. RESULTS: CRC incidence during the study period was 339.4/100,000
      invited individuals and 169.6/100,000 not yet invited individuals. CRC incidence 
      increased with age among invited and not yet invited individuals. For invited
      women compared to not yet invited women, the RR of being diagnosed with stage I
      CRC was 3.39 (95% CI, 2.61-4.39); with stage II CRC was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.71-2.72);
      with stage III CRC was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.08-1.75), and with stage IV CRC was 0.92
      (95% CI, 0.68-1.23). For invited men compared to not yet invited men, the RR of
      being diagnosed with stage I CRC was 3.71 (95% CI, 2.97-4.64); with stage II CRC 
      was 2.26 (95% CI, 1.84-2.77), with stage III CRC was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.53-2.30),
      and with stage IV CRC was 1.20 (95% CI, 0.95-1.52). CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing
      data from a register-based cohort study in Denmark, we found that inviting
      individuals to undergo FIT-based CRC screening led to detection of almost 2-fold 
      more cases of CRC than not inviting participants. The significant increase of CRC
      incidence among those invited for screening indicates a need for awareness of
      treatment capacity in countries introducing FIT-based CRC screening.

TI  - Female-specific Association Between Variants on Chromosome 9 and Self-reported
      Diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30407-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genetic factors are believed to affect risk for irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS), but there have been no sufficiently powered and adequately 
      sized studies. To identify DNA variants associated with IBS risk, we performed a 
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the large UK Biobank population-based
      cohort, which includes genotype and health data from 500,000 participants.
      METHODS: We studied 7,287,191 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
      individuals who self-reported a doctor's diagnosis of IBS (cases; m=9576)
      compared to the remainder of the cohort (controls; n=336,499) (mean age of study 
      subjects, 40-69 years). Genome-wide significant findings were further
      investigated in 2045 patients with IBS from tertiary centers and 7955 population 
      controls from Europe and the United States, and a small general population sample
      from Sweden (n=249). Functional annotation of GWAS results was carried out by
      integrating data from multiple biorepositories, to obtain biological insights
      from the observed associations. RESULTS: We identified a genome-wide significant 
      association on chromosome 9q31.2 (SNP rs10512344; P=3.57x10(-8)), in a region
      previously linked to age at menarche, and 13 additional loci of suggestive
      significance (P<5.0x10(-6)). Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the variants
      at 9q32.1 affect risk of IBS in only women (P=4.29x10(-10) in UK Biobank) and
      also associate with constipation-predominant IBS in women (P=.015 in the tertiary
      cohort) and harder stools in women (P=.0012 in the population-based sample).
      Functional annotation of the 9q32.1 locus identified 8 candidate genes, including
      the elongator complex protein 1 gene (ELP1 or IKBKAP), which is mutated in
      patients with familial dysautonomia. CONCLUSIONS: In a sufficiently powered GWAS 
      of IBS, we associated variants at the locus 9q32.1 with risk of IBS in women.
      This observation may provide additional rationale for investigating the role of
      sex hormones and autonomic dysfunction in IBS.

TI  - In Inflamed Intestinal Tissues and Epithelial Cells, Interleukin 22 Signaling
      Increases Expression of H19 Long Noncoding RNA, Which Promotes Mucosal
      Regeneration.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30367-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammation affects regeneration of the intestinal epithelia;
      long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate cell functions such as proliferation,
      differentiation, and migration. We investigated the mechanisms by which the
      lncRNA H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) regulates
      regeneration of intestinal epithelium using cell cultures and mouse models of
      inflammation. METHODS: We performed RNA-seq transcriptome analyses of intestinal 
      tissues from mice with LPS-induced sepsis to identify lncRNAs associated with
      inflammation; findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ
      hybridization analyses of intestinal tissues from mice with sepsis or dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mucosal wound healing and patients with ulcerative
      colitis, compared to healthy individuals (controls). We screened cytokines for
      their ability to induce expression of H19 in HT-29 cells and intestinal
      epithelial cells (IECs), and confirmed findings in crypt epithelial organoids
      derived from mouse small intestine. IECs were incubated with different signal
      transduction inhibitors and effects on H19 lncRNA levels were measured. We
      assessed intestinal epithelial proliferation or regeneration in H19(DeltaEx1/+)
      mice given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or DSS vs wild-type littermates (control
      mice). H19 was overexpressed in IECs using lentiviral vectors and cell
      proliferation was measured. We performed RNA antisense purification, RNA
      immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays to study functions of H19 in 
      IECs. RESULTS: In RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of lncRNA expression in
      intestinal tissues from mice, we found levels of only H19 to change significantly
      with LPS exposure. Levels of H19 lncRNA increased in intestinal tissues of
      patients with ulcerative colitis, mice with LPS-induced sepsis, or mice with
      DSS-induced colitis, compared with controls. Increased H19 lncRNA localized to
      epithelial cells in the intestine, regardless of Lgr5 mRNA expression. Exposure
      of IECs to interleukin 22 (IL22) increased levels of H19 lncRNA with time and
      dose, which required STAT3 and PKA activity. IL22 induced expression of H19 in
      mouse intestinal epithelial organoids within 6 hours. Exposure to IL22 increased 
      growth of intestinal epithelial organoids derived from control mice but not
      H19(DeltaEx1/+) mice. Overexpression of H19 in HT-29 cells increased their
      proliferation. Intestinal mucosa healed more slowly after withdrawal of DSS from 
      H19(DeltaEx1/+) mice vs control mice. Crypt epithelial cells from H19(DeltaEx1/+)
      mice proliferated more slowly than those from control mice after exposure to LPS.
      H19 lncRNA bound to p53 and microRNAs that inhibit cell proliferation, including 
      microRNA 34a and let-7; H19 lncRNA binding blocked their function, leading to
      increased expression of genes that promote regeneration of the epithelium.
      CONCLUSIONS: The level of lncRNA H19 is increased in inflamed intestinal tissues 
      from mice and patients. The inflammatory cytokine IL22 induces expression of H19 
      in IECs, which is required for intestinal epithelial proliferation and mucosal
      healing. H19 lncRNA appears to inhibit p53 protein and microRNA 34a and let-7 to 
      promote proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and epithelial regeneration.

AB  - The incidence of liver disease is increasing globally. The only curative therapy 
      for severe end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation, is limited by the
      shortage of organ donors. In vitro models of liver physiology have been developed
      and new technologies and approaches are progressing rapidly. Stem cells might be 
      used as a source of liver tissue for development of models, therapies, and
      tissue-engineering applications. However, we have been unable to generate and
      maintain stable and mature adult liver cells ex vivo. We review factors that
      promote hepatocyte differentiation and maturation, including growth factors,
      transcription factors, microRNAs, small molecules, and the microenvironment. We
      discuss how the hepatic circulation, microbiome, and nutrition affect liver
      function, and the criteria for considering cells derived from stem cells to be
      fully mature hepatocytes. We explain the challenges to cell transplantation and
      consider future technologies for use in hepatic stem cell maturation, including
      3-dimensional biofabrication and genome modification.

AB  - Chronic digestive diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases, cannot be disentangled from
      their psychological context-the substantial burden of these diseases is
      co-determined by symptom and disease severity and the ability of patients to cope
      with their symptoms without significant interruption to daily life. The growing
      field of psychogastroenterology focuses on the application of scientifically
      based psychological principles and techniques to the alleviation of digestive
      symptoms. In this Clinical Practice Update, we describe the structure and
      efficacy of 2 major classes of psychotherapy-cognitive behavior therapy and
      gut-directed hypnotherapy. We focus on the impact of these brain-gut
      psychotherapies on gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as their ability to
      facilitate improved coping, resilience, and self-regulation. The importance of
      the gastroenterologist in the promotion of integrated psychological care cannot
      be overstated, and recommendations are provided on how to address psychological
      issues and make an effective referral for brain-gut psychotherapy in routine
      practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite the availability of endoscopic therapy, many patients 
      in the United States undergo surgical resection for nonmalignant colorectal
      polyps. We aimed to quantify and examine trends in the use of surgery for
      nonmalignant colorectal polyps in a nationally representative sample. METHODS: We
      analyzed data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient
      Sample for 2000 through 2014. We included all adult patients who underwent
      elective colectomy or proctectomy and had a diagnosis of either nonmalignant
      colorectal polyp or colorectal cancer. We compared trends in surgery for
      nonmalignant colorectal polyps with surgery for colorectal cancer and calculated 
      age, sex, race, region, and teaching status/bed-size-specific incidence rates of 
      surgery for nonmalignant colorectal polyps. RESULTS: From 2000 through 2014,
      there were 1,230,458 surgeries for nonmalignant colorectal polyps and colorectal 
      cancer in the United States. Among those surgeries, 25% were performed for
      nonmalignant colorectal polyps. The incidence of surgery for nonmalignant
      colorectal polyps has increased significantly, from 5.9 in 2000 to 9.4 in 2014
      per 100,000 adults (incidence rate difference, 3.56; 95% confidence interval
      3.40-3.72), while the incidence of surgery for colorectal cancer has
      significantly decreased, from 31.5 to 24.7 surgeries per 100,000 adults
      (incidence rate difference, -6.80; 95% confidence interval -7.11 to -6.49). The
      incidence of surgery for nonmalignant colorectal polyps has been increasing among
      individuals age 20 to 79, in men and women and including all races and
      ethnicities. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of a large, nationally representative
      sample, we found that surgery for nonmalignant colorectal polyps is common and
      has significantly increased over the past 14 years.

TI  - Accuracy of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test vs FibroTest, Elastography, and
      Indirect Markers in Detection of Advanced Fibrosis in Patients With Alcoholic
      Liver Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcohol is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver-related
      mortality, but we lack serum markers to detect compensated disease. We compared
      the accuracy of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test (ELF), the FibroTest, liver
      stiffness measurements (made by transient elastography and 2-dimensional
      shear-wave elastography), and 6 indirect marker tests in detection of advanced
      liver fibrosis (Kleiner stage >/=F3). METHODS: We performed a prospective study
      of 10 liver fibrosis markers (patented and not), all performed on the same day.
      Patients were recruited from primary centers (municipal alcohol rehabilitation, n
      = 128; 6% with advanced fibrosis) and secondary health care centers (hospital
      outpatient clinics, n = 161; 36% with advanced fibrosis) in the Region of
      Southern Denmark from 2013 through 2016. Biopsy-verified fibrosis stage was used 
      as the reference standard. The primary aim was to validate ELF in detection of
      advanced fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease recruited from primary
      and secondary health care centers, using the literature-based cutoff value of
      10.5. Secondary aims were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ELF for
      significant fibrosis and cirrhosis and to determine whether combinations of
      fibrosis markers increase diagnostic yield. RESULTS: The ELF identified patients 
      with advanced liver fibrosis with an area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89-0.96);
      findings did not differ significantly between patients from primary vs secondary 
      care (P = .917). ELF more accurately identified patients with advanced liver
      fibrosis than indirect marker tests, but ELF and FibroTest had comparable
      diagnostic accuracies (AUROC of FibroTest, 0.90) (P = .209 for comparison with
      ELF). Results from the ELF and FibroTest did not differ significantly from those 
      of liver stiffness measurement in intention-to-diagnose analyses (AUROC for
      transient elastography, 0.90), but did differ in the per-protocol analysis (AUROC
      for transient elastography, 0.97) (P = .521 and .004 for comparison with ELF).
      Adding a serum marker to transient elastography analysis did not increase
      accuracy. For patients in primary care, ELF values below 10.5 and FibroTest
      values below 0.58 had negative predictive values for advanced liver fibrosis of
      98% and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In a prospective, direct comparison of
      tests, ELF and FibroTest identified advanced liver fibrosis in alcoholic patients
      from primary and secondary care with high diagnostic accuracy (AUROC values of
      0.90 or higher using biopsy as reference). Advanced fibrosis can be ruled out in 
      primary health care patients based on an ELF value below 10.5 or a FibroTest
      value below 0.58.

TI  - Increasing Infliximab Dose Based on Symptoms, Biomarkers, and Serum Drug
      Concentrations Does Not Increase Clinical, Endoscopic, and Corticosteroid-Free
      Remission in Patients With Active Luminal Crohn's Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A combination of infliximab and immunomodulators is the most
      efficacious treatment for Crohn's disease (CD). Patients have the best outcomes
      when their serum concentrations of these drugs are above a determined therapeutic
      threshold. We performed a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to maintain serum levels of infliximab above 3 
      mug/mL produced higher rates of clinical and endoscopic remission than adapting
      dose based only on symptoms. METHODS: We performed a double-blind trial in which 
      122 biologic-naive adult patients with active CD (71 female, median age 29.8
      years) received induction treatment with infliximab in combination with an
      immunosuppressant, from July 2012 through September 2015 at 27 centers in Europe.
      At week 14 of treatment, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 3 infliximab 
      maintenance groups: dose increases (2 maximum) in steps of 2.5 mg/kg based on
      clinical symptoms and biomarker analysis and/or serum infliximab concentrations
      (dose intensification strategy [DIS]1 group); dose increase from 5 to 10 mg/kg
      based on the same criteria (DIS2 group); dose increase to 10 mg/kg based on
      clinical symptoms alone (controls). Patients' CD activity index scores, levels of
      C-reactive protein, fecal levels of calprotectin, and serum concentrations of
      infliximab were determined at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, and 14 of
      treatment, and then every 4 weeks thereafter until week 54. The primary endpoint 
      was sustained corticosteroid-free clinical remission (CD activity index <150)
      from weeks 22 through 54 with no ulcers at week 54. RESULTS: The primary endpoint
      was reached by 15 (33%) of 45 patients in the DIS1 group, 10 (27%) of 37 patients
      in the DIS2 group, and 16 (40%) of 40 patients in the control group (P = .50).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective randomized exploratory trial of patients with
      active CD, we found increasing dose of infliximab based on a combination of
      symptoms, biomarkers, and serum drug concentrations does not lead to
      corticosteroid-free clinical remission in a larger proportion of patients than
      increasing dose based on symptoms alone. EUDRACT NUMBER: 2011-003038-14.

TI  - Glycome Patterns of Perfusate in Livers Before Transplantation Associate With
      Primary Nonfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Primary nonfunction (PNF) is a rare complication after liver
      transplantation that requires urgent retransplantation. PNF is associated with
      livers from extended criteria donors. Clinical and biochemical factors have not
      been identified that reliably associate with graft function after liver
      transplantation. Serum patterns of N-glycans associate with changes in the liver.
      We analyzed perfusate from grafted liver to identify protein glycosylation
      patterns associated with PNF. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of
      consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation (66 patients, from 1
      center, in the derivation set, and 56 patients, from 2 centers, in the validation
      set) in Belgium, from October 1, 2011, through April 30, 2017. All donor grafts
      were transported using cold static storage, and perfusate samples were collected 
      from the livers by flushing of hepatic veins before transplantation.
      Protein-linked N-glycans were isolated from perfusate samples and analyzed with a
      multicapillary electrophoresis-based ABI3130 sequencer. We compared glycan
      patterns between patients with vs without PNF of transplanted livers. PNF was
      defined as the need for urgent retransplantation when a graft had no evidence of 
      function, after exclusion of other causes, such as hepatic artery thrombosis or
      acute cellular rejection. RESULTS: The relative abundance of a single glycan,
      agalacto core-alpha-1,6-fucosylated biantennary glycan (NGA2F) was significantly 
      increased in perfusate of livers given to 4 patients who developed PNF after
      liver transplantation compared with livers given to patients who did not develop 
      PNF. Level of NGA2F identified patients with PNF with 100% accuracy. This
      glycomarker was the only factor associated with PNF in multivariate analysis in
      the derivation and the validation sets (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis
      of patients who underwent liver transplantation, we associated graft perfusate
      level of glycan NGA2F present on perfusate proteins with development of PNF with 
      100% accuracy, and validated this finding in a separate cohort of patients. This 
      biomarker might be used to assess grafts before transplantation, especially when 
      high-risk organs are under consideration.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Causes of inflammatory bowel diseases are not well
      understood and the most prominent forms, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
      colitis (UC), are sometimes hard to distinguish. Glycosylation of IgG has been
      associated with CD and UC. IgG Fc-glycosylation affects IgG effector functions.
      We evaluated changes in IgG Fc-glycosylation associated with UC and CD, as well
      as with disease characteristics in different patient groups. METHODS: We analyzed
      3441 plasma samples obtained from 2 independent cohorts of patients with CD (874 
      patients from Italy and 391 from the United States) or UC (1056 from Italy and
      253 from the US and healthy individuals [controls]; 427 in Italy and 440 from the
      United States). IgG Fc-glycosylation (tryptic glycopeptides) was analyzed by
      liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We analyzed associations
      between disease status (UC vs controls, CD vs controls, and UC vs CD) and
      glycopeptide traits, and associations between clinical characteristics and
      glycopeptide traits, using a logistic regression model with age and sex included 
      as covariates. RESULTS: Patients with CD or UC had lower levels of IgG
      galactosylation than controls. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for IgG1
      galactosylation in patients with CD was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.51-0.69) and for patients with UC was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.92). Fucosylation of
      IgG was increased in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG1: OR, 1.27; 95% CI,
      1.12-1.44), but decreased in patients with UC vs controls (for IgG23: OR, 0.72;
      95% CI, 0.63-0.82). Decreased galactosylation associated with more severe CD or
      UC, including the need for surgery in patients with UC vs controls (for IgG1: OR,
      0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89) and in patients with CD vs controls (for IgG23: OR,
      0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of plasma
      samples from patients with CD or UC, we associated levels of IgG Fc-glycosylation
      with disease (compared to controls) and its clinical features. These findings
      could increase our understanding of mechanisms of CD and UC pathogenesis and be
      used to develop diagnostics or guide treatment.

TI  - Hedgehog-YAP Signaling Pathway Regulates Glutaminolysis to Control Activation of 
      Hepatic Stellate Cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cirrhosis results from accumulation of myofibroblasts derived 
      from quiescent hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSCs); it regresses when myofibroblastic
      HSCs are depleted. Hedgehog signaling promotes transdifferentiation of HSCs by
      activating Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1 or YAP) and inducing aerobic
      glycolysis. However, increased aerobic glycolysis alone cannot meet the high
      metabolic demands of myofibroblastic HSCs. Determining the metabolic processes of
      these cells could lead to strategies to prevent progressive liver fibrosis, so we
      investigated whether glutaminolysis (conversion of glutamine to
      alpha-ketoglutarate) sustains energy metabolism and permits anabolism when Q-HSCs
      become myofibroblastic, and whether this is controlled by hedgehog signaling to
      YAP. METHODS: Primary HSCs were isolated from C57BL/6 or Smo(flox/flox) mice; we 
      also performed studies with rat and human myofibroblastic HSCs. We measured
      changes of glutaminolytic genes during culture-induced primary HSC
      transdifferentiation. Glutaminolysis was disrupted in cells by glutamine
      deprivation or pathway inhibitors
      (bis-2-[5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl] ethyl sulfide, CB-839,
      epigallocatechin gallate, and aminooxyacetic acid), and effects on mitochondrial 
      respiration, cell growth and migration, and fibrogenesis were measured. Hedgehog 
      signaling to YAP was disrupted in cells by adenovirus expression of
      Cre-recombinase or by small hairpin RNA knockdown of YAP. Hedgehog and YAP
      activity were inhibited by incubation of cells with cyclopamine or verteporfin,
      and effects on glutaminolysis were measured. Acute and chronic liver fibrosis
      were induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 or methionine
      choline-deficient diet. Some mice were then given injections of
      bis-2-[5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl] ethyl sulfide to inhibit
      glutaminolysis, and myofibroblast accumulation was measured. We also performed
      messenger RNA and immunohistochemical analyses of percutaneous liver biopsies
      from healthy human and 4 patients with no fibrosis, 6 patients with mild
      fibrosis, and 3 patients with severe fibrosis. RESULTS: Expression of genes that 
      regulate glutaminolysis increased during transdifferentiation of primary Q-HSCs
      into myofibroblastic HSCs, and inhibition of glutaminolysis disrupted
      transdifferentiation. Blocking glutaminolysis in myofibroblastic HSCs suppressed 
      mitochondrial respiration, cell growth and migration, and fibrogenesis;
      replenishing glutaminolysis metabolites to these cells restored these activities.
      Knockout of the hedgehog signaling intermediate smoothened or knockdown of YAP
      inhibited expression of glutaminase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis. 
      Hedgehog and YAP inhibitors blocked glutaminolysis and suppressed myofibroblastic
      activities in HSCs. In livers of patients and of mice with acute or chronic
      fibrosis, glutaminolysis was induced in myofibroblastic HSCs. In mice with liver 
      fibrosis, inhibition of glutaminase blocked accumulation of myofibroblasts and
      fibrosis progression. CONCLUSIONS: Glutaminolysis controls accumulation of
      myofibroblast HSCs in mice and might be a therapeutic target for cirrhosis.

TI  - Efficacy of Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication vs Transoral Incisionless
      Fundoplication or Proton Pump Inhibitors in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux
      Disease: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.

LID - S0016-5085(18)30001-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effects of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) and
      laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) have been compared with those of proton 
      pump inhibitors (PPIs) or a sham procedure in patients with gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD), but there has been no direct comparison of TIF vs LNF. We 
      performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials to compare the relative efficacies of TIF vs LNF in patients with GERD.
      METHODS: We searched publication databases and conference abstracts through May
      10, 2017 for randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of TIF or
      LNF with that of a sham procedure or PPIs in patients with GERD. We performed a
      network meta-analysis using Bayesian methods under random-effects multiple
      treatment comparisons. We assessed ranking probability by surface under the
      cumulative ranking curve. RESULTS: Our search identified 7 trials comprising 1128
      patients. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking indicated TIF had
      highest probability of increasing patients' health-related quality of life
      (0.96), followed by LNF (0.66), a sham procedure (0.35), and PPIs (0.042). LNF
      had the highest probability of increasing percent time at pH <4 (0.99), followed 
      by PPIs (0.64), TIF (0.32), and the sham procedure (0.05). LNF also had the
      highest probability of increasing LES pressure (0.78), followed by TIF (0.72) and
      PPIs (0.01). Patients who underwent the sham procedure had the highest
      probability for persistent esophagitis (0.74), followed by those receiving TIF
      (0.69), LNF (0.38), and PPIs (0.19). Meta-regression showed a shorter follow-up
      time as a significant confounder for the outcome of health-related quality of
      life in studies of TIF. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and network
      meta-analysis of trials of patients with GERD, we found LNF to have the greatest 
      ability to improve physiologic parameters of GERD, including increased LES
      pressure and decreased percent time pH <4. Although TIF produced the largest
      increase in health-related quality of life, this could be due to the shorter
      follow-up time of patients treated with TIF vs LNF or PPIs. TIF is a minimally
      invasive endoscopic procedure, yet based on evaluation of benefits vs risks, we
      do not recommend it as a long-term alternative to PPI or LNF treatment of GERD.

TI  - Effects of Weight-Loss Medications on Cardiometabolic Risk Profiles: A Systematic
      Review and Network Meta-analysis.

LID - S0016-5085(18)30004-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to 
      evaluate the overall and comparative effects of weight-loss medications approved 
      by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term use on cardiometabolic risk
      profiles of obese adults. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review
      through February 28, 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials of the effects
      of Food and Drug Administration-approved weight-loss medications (ie, orlistat,
      lorcaserin, naltrexone-bupropion, phentermine-topiramate, and liraglutide)
      administered to obese adults for 1 year or more, compared with placebo or another
      active agent. Outcomes of interest included changes in blood glucose (fasting
      blood glucose [FBG] and hemoglobin A1c), cholesterol profile (low-density
      lipoprotein and high-density lipoproteins), blood pressure (BP;
      systolic/diastolic), and waist circumference (WC). We performed pair-wise and
      network meta-analyses with outcomes reported as weighted and standardized mean
      differences. Quality of evidence was rated using GRADE (Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). RESULTS: In a
      meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials (29,018 participants; median
      body mass index, 36.1 kg/m(2)), we associated weight-loss medications with a
      modest decrease in FBG (weighted mean difference, 4.0 mg/dL; 95% confidence
      interval, -4.4 to -3.6 mg/dL) and WC (weighted mean difference, reduction of 3.3 
      cm; 95% confidence interval, -3.5 to -3.1 cm), without clinically meaningful
      changes in systolic/diastolic BP or cholesterol profile vs placebo (standardized 
      mean difference <0.2); effects varied among drugs. Phentermine-topiramate use was
      associated with a substantial decrease in WC and a modest decrease in FBG,
      hemoglobin A1c, and BP, and had minimal effect on cholesterol. Liraglutide use
      was associated with a substantial decrease in FBG, hemoglobin A1c, and WC, and a 
      minimal effect on BP and cholesterol. Naltrexone-bupropion use was associated
      with moderate increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but had a minimal
      effect on FBG and WC. Orlistat use was associated with a decrease in low-density 
      lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. No drug improved all
      cardiometabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and network
      meta-analysis, we found Food and Drug Administration-approved weight-loss
      medications to have only modest positive effects on cardiometabolic risk profile.
      Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term cardiometabolic benefits of 
      these medications. PROSPERO: CRD42016039486.

TI  - Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 Regulates Circadian Activity of
      NLRP3 Inflammasome to Reduce the Severity of Fulminant Hepatitis in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The innate immune system responds not only to bacterial
      signals, but also to non-infectious danger-associated molecular patterns that
      activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex after tissue injury. Immune functions
      vary over the course of the day, but it is not clear whether these changes affect
      the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We investigated whether the core clock
      component nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1, also called
      Rev-erbalpha) regulates expression, activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and its
      signaling pathway. METHODS: We collected naive peritoneal macrophages and plasma,
      at multiple times of day, from Nr1d1(-/-) mice and their Nr1d1(+/+) littermates
      (controls) and analyzed expression NLRP3, interleukin 1beta (IL1B, in plasma),
      and IL18 (in plasma). We also collected bone marrow-derived primary macrophages
      from these mice. Levels of NR1D1 were knocked down with small hairpin RNAs in
      human primary macrophages. Bone marrow-derived primary macrophages from mice and 
      human primary macrophages were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce 
      expression of NLRP3, IL1B, and IL18; cells were incubated with LPS and adenosine 
      triphosphate to activate the NLRP3 complex. We analyzed caspase 1 activity and
      cytokine secretion. NR1D1 was activated in primary mouse and human macrophages by
      incubation with SR9009; some of the cells were also incubated with an NLRP3
      inhibitor or inhibitors of caspase 1. Nr1d1(-/-) mice and control mice were given
      intraperitoneal injections of LPS to induce peritoneal inflammation; plasma
      samples were isolated and levels of cytokines were measured. Nr1d1(-/-) mice,
      control mice, and control mice given injections of SR9009 were given LPS and
      D-galactosamine to induce fulminant hepatitis and MCC950 to specifically inhibit 
      NLRP3; plasma was collected to measure cytokines and a marker of liver failure
      (alanine aminotransferase); liver tissues were collected and analyzed by
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry.
      RESULTS: In peritoneal macrophages, expression of NLRP3 and activation of its
      complex varied with time of day (circadian rhythm)-this regulation required
      NR1D1. Primary macrophages from Nr1d1(-/-) mice and human macrophages with
      knockdown of NR1D1 had altered expression patterns of NLRP3, compared to
      macrophages that expressed NR1D1, and altered patterns of IL1B and 1L18
      production. Mice with disruption of Nr1d1 developed more-severe acute peritoneal 
      inflammation and fulminant hepatitis than control mice. Incubation of macrophage 
      with the NR1D1 activator SR9009 reduced expression of NLRP3 and secretion of
      cytokines. Mice given SR9009 developed less-severe liver failure and had longer
      survival times than mice given saline (control). CONCLUSIONS: In studies of
      Nr1d1(-/-) mice and human macrophages with pharmacologic activation of NR1D1, we 
      found NR1D1 to regulate the timing of NLRP3 expression and production of
      inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Activation of NR1D1 reduced the severity
      of peritoneal inflammation and fulminant hepatitis in mice.

      Fistulas in Patients With Crohn's Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Therapies for perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's
      disease are often ineffective in producing long-term healing. We performed a
      randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the long-term efficacy and
      safety of a single local administration of allogeneic expanded adipose-derived
      stem cells (Cx601) in patients with Crohn's disease and perianal fistulas.
      METHODS: We performed a double-blind study at 49 hospitals in Europe and Israel, 
      comprising 212 patients with Crohn's disease and treatment-refractory, draining, 
      complex perianal fistulas. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given 
      a single local injection of 120 million Cx601 cells or placebo (control), in
      addition to the standard of care. Efficacy endpoints evaluated in the modified
      intention-to-treat population (randomly assigned, treated, and with 1 or more
      post-baseline efficacy assessment) at week 52 included combined remission
      (closure of all treated external openings draining at baseline with absence of
      collections >2 cm, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) and clinical
      remission (absence of draining fistulas). RESULTS: The study's primary endpoint, 
      at week 24, was previously reported (combined remission in 51.5% of patients
      given Cx601 vs 35.6% of controls, for a difference of 15.8 percentage points;
      97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-31.2; P = .021). At week 52, a significantly
      greater proportion of patients given Cx601 achieved combined remission (56.3%) vs
      controls (38.6%) (a difference of 17.7 percentage points; 95% CI 4.2-31.2; P =
      .010), and clinical remission (59.2% vs 41.6% of controls, for a difference of
      17.6 percentage points; 95% CI 4.1-31.1; P = .013). Safety was maintained
      throughout week 52; adverse events occurred in 76.7% of patients in the Cx601
      group and 72.5% of patients in the control group. CONCLUSION: In a phase 3 trial 
      of patients with Crohn's disease and treatment-refractory complex perianal
      fistulas, we found Cx601 to be safe and effective in closing external openings,
      compared with placebo, after 1 year. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01541579.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cell stress signaling pathways result in phosphorylation of
      the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (EIF2S1 or EIF2A),
      which affects regulation of protein translation. Translation reprogramming
      mitigates stress by activating pathways that result in autophagy and cell death, 
      to eliminate damaged cells. Actin is modified during stress and EIF2A is
      dephosphorylated to restore homeostasis. It is not clear how actin affects EIF2A 
      signaling. We studied the actin-binding proteins villin 1 (VIL1) and gelsolin
      (GSN) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to determine whether they respond to 
      cell stress response and affect signaling pathways. METHODS: We performed studies
      with mice with disruptions in Vil1 and Gsn (double-knockout mice). Wild-type (WT)
      mice either were or were not (controls) exposed to cell stressors such as tumor
      necrosis factor and adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. Distal ileum tissues were
      collected from mice; IECs and enteroids were cultured and analyzed by histology, 
      immunoblots, phalloidin staining, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and 
      flow cytometry. HT-29 cells were incubated with cell stressors such as DTT, IFN, 
      and adherent-invasive E coli or control agents; cells were analyzed by
      immunoblots and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Green fluorescent protein
      and green fluorescent protein tagged mutant EIF2A were expressed from a
      lentiviral vector. The mouse immunity-related GTPase (IRGM1) was overexpressed in
      embryonic fibroblasts from dynamin1 like (DNM1L) protein-knockout mice or their
      WT littermates. IRGM1 was overexpressed in embryonic fibroblasts from receptor
      interacting serine/threonine kinase 1-knockout mice or their WT littermates.
      Human IRGM was overexpressed in human epithelial cell lines incubated with the
      DNM1L-specific inhibitor Mdivi-1. Mitochondria were analyzed by semi-quantitative
      confocal imaging. We performed immunohistochemical analyses of distal ileum
      tissues from 6-8 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 6-8 individuals without
      CD (controls). RESULTS: In IECs exposed to cell stressors, EIF2A signaling
      reduced expression of VIL1 and GSN. However, VIL1 and GSN were required for
      dephosphorylation of EIF2A and recovery from cell stress. In mouse and human
      IECs, prolonged, unresolved stress was accompanied by continued down-regulation
      of VIL1 and GSN, resulting in constitutive phosphorylation of EIF2A and
      overexpression of IRGM1 (or IRGM), which regulates autophagy. Overexpression of
      IRGM1 (or IRGM) induced cell death by necroptosis, accompanied by release of
      damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In double-knockout mice,
      constitutive phosphorylation of EIF2A and over-expression of IRGM1 resulted in
      spontaneous ileitis that resembled human CD in symptoms and histology. Distal
      ileum tissues from patients with CD had lower levels of VIL1 and GSN, increased
      phosphorylation of EIF2A, increased levels of IRGM and necroptosis, and increased
      release of nuclear DAMPs compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of
      intestinal epithelial tissues from patients with CD and embryonic fibroblasts
      from mice, along with enteroids and human IEC lines, we found that induction of
      cell stress alters the cytoskeleton in IECs via changes in the actin-binding
      proteins VIL1 and GSN. Acute changes in actin dynamics increase IEC survival,
      whereas long-term changes in actin dynamics lead to IEC death and intestinal
      inflammation. IRGM regulates necroptosis and release of DAMPs to induce
      gastrointestinal inflammation, linking IRGM activity with CD.

      Stellate Cells to Produce Cytokines via Integrin Signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by
      activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), abundance of extracellular matrix
      (ECM), and production of cytokines and chemokines. Galectin 3 (GAL3), a
      beta-galactoside-specific lectin, contributes to PDAC development but its effects
      on the stroma and cytokine production are unclear. METHODS: The effect of
      recombinant human GAL3 (rGAL3) on activation of PSCs, production of cytokines,
      and ECM proteins was determined by proliferation, invasion, cytokine array, and
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We assessed co-cultures of PDAC cells
      with GAL3 genetic alterations with PSCs. Production of interleukin 8 (IL8) and
      activities of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were determined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay and luciferase reporter analyses. We studied the effects of
      inhibitors of NF-kappaB and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) on pathways activated by
      rGAL3. RESULTS: In analyses of the Gene Expression Omnibus database and our
      dataset, we observed higher levels of GAL3, IL8, and other cytokines in PDAC than
      in nontumor tissues. Production of IL8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor, chemokine ligand 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 increased in PSCs
      exposed to rGAL3 compared with controls. Culture of PSCs with PDAC cells that
      express different levels of GAL3 resulted in proliferation and invasion of PSCs
      that increased with level of GAL3. GAL3 stimulated transcription of IL8 through
      integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1) on PSCs, which activates NF-kappaB through ILK.
      Inhibitors of ILK or NF-kappaB or a neutralizing antibody against ITGB1 blocked
      transcription and production of IL8 from PSCs induced by rGAL3. The GAL3
      inhibitor significantly reduced growth and metastases of orthotopic tumors that
      formed from PDAC and PSC cells co-implanted in mice. CONCLUSION: GAL3 activates
      PSC cells to produce inflammatory cytokines via ITGB1signaling to ILK and
      activation of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of this pathway reduced growth and metastases
      of pancreatic orthotopic tumors in mice.

TI  - Efficacy of NS5A Inhibitors Against Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes 1-7 and Escape
      Variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein are a
      key component of effective treatment regimens, but the genetic heterogeneity of
      HCV has limited the efficacy of these agents and mutations lead to resistance. We
      directly compared the efficacy of all clinically relevant NS5A inhibitors against
      HCV genotype 1-7 prototype isolates and resistant escape variants, and
      investigated the effects of pre-existing resistance-associated substitutions
      (RAS) on HCV escape from treatment. METHODS: We measured the efficacy of
      different concentrations of daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir,
      ruzasvir, velpatasvir, and pibrentasvir in cultured cells infected with HCV
      recombinants expressing genotype 1-7 NS5A proteins with or without RAS. We
      engineered HCV variants that included RAS identified in escape experiments, using
      recombinants with or without T/Y93H and daclatasvir, or that contained RAS
      previously reported from patients. RESULTS: NS5A inhibitors had varying levels of
      efficacy against original and resistant viruses. Only velpatasvir and
      pibrentasvir had uniform high activity against all HCV genotypes tested. RAS
      hotspots in NS5A were found at amino acids 28, 30, 31, and 93. Engineered escape 
      variants had high levels of fitness. Pibrentasvir had the highest level of
      efficacy against variants; viruses with RAS at amino acids 28, 30, or 31 had no
      apparent resistance to pibrentasvir, and HCV with RAS at amino acid 93 had a low 
      level of resistance to this drug. However, specific combinations of RAS and
      deletion of amino acid 32 led to significant resistance to pibrentasvir. For the 
      remaining NS5A inhibitors tested, RAS at amino acids 28 and 93 led to high levels
      of resistance. Among these inhibitors, velpatasvir was more effective against
      variants with RAS at amino acid 30 and some variants with RAS at amino acid 31
      than the other agents. Variants with the pre-existing RAS T/Y93H acquired
      additional NS5A changes during escape experiments, resulting in HCV variants with
      specific combinations of RAS, showing high fitness and high resistance.
      CONCLUSIONS: We performed a comprehensive comparison of the efficacy of the 7
      clinically relevant inhibitors of HCV NS5A and identified variants associated
      with resistance to each agent. These findings could improve treatment of patients
      with HCV infection.

TI  - Knockdown of Anillin Actin Binding Protein Blocks Cytokinesis in Hepatocytes and 
      Reduces Liver Tumor Development in Mice Without Affecting Regeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytokinesis can fail during normal postnatal liver
      development, leading to polyploid hepatocytes. We investigated whether inhibiting
      cytokinesis in the liver slows tumor growth without compromising the health of
      normal hepatocytes. We inhibited cytokinesis in cancer cells by knocking down
      ANLN, a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein that regulates cytokinesis and might
      promote tumorigenesis, in mice with liver disease. METHODS: We analyzed clinical 
      and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Oncomine, PrognoScan, and 
      a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue microarray. We knocked down ANLN with
      small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in H2.35 liver cells and performed image analyses
      of cells undergoing cytokinesis. siRNAs were delivered to LAP-MYC mice, which
      develop hepatoblastoma, using lipid nanoparticles. H2.35 cells with knockdown of 
      ANLN or control cells were injected into FRG mice, which develop chronic liver
      damage, and tumor growth was monitored. We also developed mice with inducible
      expression of transgenes encoding small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Anln
      messenger RNA and studied liver tumorigenesis after administration of
      diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride. siRNAs against Anln messenger RNA
      were conjugated to N-acetylgalactosamine to reduce toxicity and increase
      hepatocyte tropism; their effects were studied in mouse models of liver cancer
      and regeneration. RESULTS: Levels of ANLN messenger RNA were increased in human
      HCC tissues compared to non-tumor liver tissues. siRNA knockdown of ANLN blocked 
      cytokinesis in H2.35 liver cells. Administration of siRNA against ANLN increased 
      survival times of LAP-MYC mice, compared to mice given a control siRNA. H2.35
      liver cells with shRNA knockdown of ANLN formed tumors more slowly in FRG mice
      than control H2.35 cells. Mice with inducible expression of shRNAs against Anln
      mRNA developed fewer liver tumors after administration of diethylnitrosamine and 
      carbon tetrachloride than control mice. Knockdown of ANLN did not affect liver
      regeneration after acute and chronic liver injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of
      ANLN in liver cells blocks cytokinesis and inhibits development of liver tumors
      in mice. Agents that inhibit ANLN in the liver might be effective for prevention 
      or treatment of HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A system is needed to determine the risk of patients with
      Barrett's esophagus for progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal 
      adenocarcinoma (EAC). We developed and validated a model to determine of
      progression to HGD or EAC in patients with BE, based on demographic data and
      endoscopic and histologic findings at the time of index endoscopy. METHODS: We
      performed a longitudinal study of patients with BE at 5 centers in United States 
      and 1 center in Netherlands enrolled in the Barrett's Esophagus Study database
      from 1985 through 2014. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had less
      than 1 year of follow-up, were diagnosed with HGD or EAC within the past year,
      were missing baseline histologic data, or had no intestinal metaplasia. Seventy
      percent of the patients were used to derive the model and 30% were used for the
      validation study. The primary outcome was development of HGD or EAC during the
      follow-up period (median, 5.9 years). Survival analysis was performed using the
      Kaplan-Meier method. We assigned a specific number of points to each BE risk
      factor, and point totals (scores) were used to create categories of low,
      intermediate, and high risk. We used Cox regression to compute hazard ratios and 
      95% confidence intervals to determine associations between risk of progression
      and scores. RESULTS: Of 4584 patients in the database, 2697 were included in our 
      analysis (84.1% men; 87.6% Caucasian; mean age, 55.4 +/- 20.1 years; mean body
      mass index, 27.9 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2); mean length of BE, 3.7 +/- 3.2 cm). During the 
      follow-up period, 154 patients (5.7%) developed HGD or EAC, with an annual rate
      of progression of 0.95%. Male sex, smoking, length of BE, and baseline-confirmed 
      low-grade dysplasia were significantly associated with progression. Scores
      assigned identified patients with BE that progressed to HGD or EAC with a
      c-statistic of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.80; P < .001). The
      calibration slope was 0.9966 (P = .99), determined from the validation cohort.
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed a scoring system (Progression in Barrett's Esophagus
      score) based on male sex, smoking, length of BE, and baseline low-grade dysplasia
      that identified patients with BE at low, intermediate, and high risk for HGD or
      EAC. This scoring system might be used in management of patients.

TI  - Loss of Pten and Activation of Kras Synergistically Induce Formation of
      Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasia From Pancreatic Ductal Cells in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasias (IPMNs) are
      precancerous cystic lesions that can develop into pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinomas (PDACs). These large macroscopic lesions are frequently detected 
      during medical imaging, but it is unclear how they form or progress to PDAC. We
      aimed to identify cells that form IPMNs and mutations that promote IPMN
      development and progression. METHODS: We generated mice with disruption of Pten
      specifically in ductal cells (Sox9CreER(T2);Pten(flox/flox);R26R(YFP) or
      Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) mice) and used Pten(DeltaDuct/+) and Pten(+/+) mice as 
      controls. We also generated Kras(G12D);Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) and
      Kras(G12D);Pten(DeltaDuct/+) mice. Pancreata were collected when mice were 28
      weeks to 14.5 months old and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and
      electron microscopy. We performed multiplexed droplet digital polymerase chain
      reaction to detect spontaneous Kras mutations in Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) mice
      and study the effects of Ras pathway activation on initiation and progression of 
      IPMNs. We obtained 2 pancreatic sections from a patient with an invasive
      pancreatobiliary IPMN and analyzed the regions with and without the invasive IPMN
      (control tissue) by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Mice with ductal cell-specific
      disruption of Pten but not control mice developed sporadic, macroscopic,
      intraductal papillary lesions with histologic and molecular features of human
      IPMNs. Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) mice developed IPMNs of several subtypes. In
      Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) mice, 31.5% of IPMNs became invasive; invasion was
      associated with spontaneous mutations in Kras.
      Kras(G12D);Pten(DeltaDuct/DeltaDuct) mice all developed invasive IPMNs within 1
      month. In Kras(G12D);Pten(DeltaDuct/+) mice, 70% developed IPMN, predominately of
      the pancreatobiliary subtype, and 63.3% developed PDAC. In all models, IPMNs and 
      PDAC expressed the duct-specific lineage tracing marker yellow fluorescent
      protein. In immunohistochemical analyses, we found that the invasive human
      pancreatobiliary IPMN tissue had lower levels of PTEN and increased levels of
      phosphorylated (activated) ERK compared with healthy pancreatic tissue.
      CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of mice with ductal cell-specific disruption of Pten,
      with or without activated Kras, we found evidence for a ductal cell origin of
      IPMNs. We also showed that PTEN loss and activated Kras have synergistic effects 
      in promoting development of IPMN and progression to PDAC.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori Depletes Cholesterol in Gastric Glands to Prevent Interferon 
      Gamma Signaling and Escape the Inflammatory Response.
PG  - 1391-1404.e9
LID - S0016-5085(17)36712-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite inducing an inflammatory response, Helicobacter pylori
      can persist in the gastric mucosa for decades. H pylori expression of
      cholesterol-alpha-glucosyltransferase (encoded by cgt) is required for gastric
      colonization and T-cell activation. We investigated how cgt affects gastric
      epithelial cells and the host immune response. METHODS: MKN45 gastric epithelial 
      cells, AGS cells, and human primary gastric epithelial cells (obtained from
      patients undergoing gastrectomy or sleeve resection or gastric antral organoids) 
      were incubated with interferon gamma (IFNG) or interferon beta (IFNB) and exposed
      to H pylori, including cagPAI and cgt mutant strains. Some cells were incubated
      with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (to deplete cholesterol from membranes) or myriocin
      and zaragozic acid to prevent biosynthesis of sphingolipids and cholesterol and
      analyzed by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and reverse transcription
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. We compared gene expression
      patterns among primary human gastric cells, uninfected or infected with H pylori 
      P12 wt or P12Deltacgt, using microarray analysis. Mice with disruption of the
      IFNG receptor 1 (Ifngr1-/- mice) and C57BL6 (control) mice were infected with
      PMSS1 (wild-type) or PMSS1Deltacgt H pylori; gastric tissues were collected and
      analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction or
      confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In primary gastric cells and cell lines, infection 
      with H pylori, but not cgt mutants, blocked IFNG-induced signaling via JAK and
      STAT. Cells infected with H pylori were depleted of cholesterol, which reduced
      IFNG signaling by disrupting lipid rafts, leading to reduced phosphorylation
      (activation) of JAK and STAT1. H pylori infection of cells also blocked signaling
      by IFNB, interleukin 6 (IL6), and IL22 and reduced activation of genes regulated 
      by these signaling pathways, including cytokines that regulate T-cell function
      (MIG and IP10) and anti-microbial peptides such as human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3). 
      We found that this mechanism allows H pylori to persist in proximity to infected 
      cells while inducing inflammation only in the neighboring, non-infected
      epithelium. Stomach tissues from mice infected with PMSS1 had increased levels of
      IFNG, but did not express higher levels of interferon-response genes. Expression 
      of the IFNG-response gene IRF1 was substantially higher in PMSS1Deltacgt-infected
      mice than PMSS1-infected mice. Ifngr1-/- mice were colonized by PMSS1 to a
      greater extent than control mice. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori expression of cgt reduces
      cholesterol levels in infected gastric epithelial cells and thereby blocks IFNG
      signaling, allowing the bacteria to escape the host inflammatory response. These 
      findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which H pylori might promote
      gastric carcinogenesis (persisting despite constant inflammation) and
      ineffectiveness of T-cell-based vaccines against H pylori.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are among the top 10 most
      prescribed medications worldwide. We investigated the association between PPI use
      and ischemic stroke. METHODS: We collected data on 68,514 women (mean age, 65 +/-
      7 years) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study since 2000 and 28,989 men (mean
      age, 69 +/- 8 years) in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study since 2004,
      without a history of stroke. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine
      the association between risk of incident stroke and PPI use among participants.
      The primary end point was first incident stroke. RESULTS: In the 2 cohorts, we
      documented 2599 incident strokes (2037 in women and 562 in men) over a 12-year
      period, encompassing 949,330 person-years. After adjustment for established risk 
      factors for stroke, PPI use was associated with a significant increase in risk of
      ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.37). The
      association was reduced after we adjusted for potential indications for PPI use, 
      including history of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or
      gastrointestinal bleeding, and prior use of histamine-2 receptor antagonist
      therapy (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.27). Regular PPI use
      was not associated with increased risk of stroke overall or hemorrhagic stroke.
      CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health 
      Professionals Follow-up Study, we did not find a significant association between 
      PPI use and ischemic stroke, after accounting for indications for PPI use. Prior 
      reports of an increased risk of stroke may be due to residual confounding related
      to chronic conditions associated with PPI use.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Activating mutations in KRAS are detected in most pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Expression of an activated form of KRAS
      (KrasG12D) in pancreata of mice is sufficient to induce formation of pancreatic
      intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs)-a precursor of PDAC. Pancreatitis increases
      formation of PanINs in mice that express KrasG12D by promoting acinar-to-ductal
      metaplasia (ADM). We investigated the role of the transcription factor
      Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) in ADM and KRAS-mediated formation of PanINs.
      METHODS: We performed studies in adult mice with conditional disruption of Klf5
      (Klf5(fl/fl)) and/or expression of Kras(G12D) (LSL-Kras(G12D)) via Cre(ERTM)
      recombinase regulated by an acinar cell-specific promoter (Ptf1a). Activation of 
      Kras(G12D) and loss of KLF5 was achieved by administration of tamoxifen.
      Pancreatitis was induced in mice by administration of cerulein; pancreatic
      tissues were collected, analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry, and
      transcriptomes were compared between mice that did or did not express KLF5. We
      performed immunohistochemical analyses of human tissue microarrays, comparing
      levels of KLF5 among 96 human samples of PDAC. UN-KC-6141 cells (pancreatic
      cancer cells derived from Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D) mice) were incubated with
      inhibitors of different kinases and analyzed in proliferation assays and by
      immunoblots. Expression of KLF5 was knocked down with small hairpin RNAs or
      CRISPR/Cas9 strategies; cells were analyzed in proliferation and gene expression 
      assays, and compared with cells expressing control vectors. Cells were
      subcutaneously injected into flanks of syngeneic mice and tumor growth was
      assessed. RESULTS: Of the 96 PDAC samples analyzed, 73% were positive for KLF5
      (defined as nuclear staining in more than 5% of tumor cells). Pancreata from
      Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D) mice contained ADM and PanIN lesions, which
      contained high levels of nuclear KLF5 within these structures. In contrast,
      Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D);Klf5(fl/fl) mice formed fewer PanINs. After
      cerulein administration, Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D) mice formed more
      extensive ADM than Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D);Klf5(fl/fl) mice. Pancreata
      from Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D);Klf5(fl/fl) mice had increased expression of 
      the tumor suppressor NDRG2 and reduced phosphorylation (activation) of STAT3,
      compared with Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D) mice. In UN-KC-6141 cells, PI3K and 
      MEK signaling increased expression of KLF5; a high level of KLF5 increased
      proliferation. Cells with knockdown of Klf5 had reduced proliferation, compared
      with control cells, had reduced expression of ductal markers, and formed smaller 
      tumors (71.61 +/- 30.79 mm(3) vs 121.44 +/- 34.90 mm(3) from control cells) in
      flanks of mice. CONCLUSION: Levels of KLF5 are increased in human PDAC samples
      and in PanINs of Ptf1a-Cre(ERTM);LSL-Kras(G12D) mice, compared with controls.
      KLF5 disruption increases expression of NDRG2 and reduces activation of STAT3 and
      reduces ADM and PanINs formation in mice. Strategies to reduce KLF5 activity
      might reduce progression of acinar cells from ADM to PanIN and pancreatic
      tumorigenesis.

TI  - JTC801 Induces pH-dependent Death Specifically in Cancer Cells and Slows Growth
      of Tumors in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is required for normal
      physiology, metabolism, and development. It is not clear how cell death is
      activated in response to changes in pH. We performed a screen to identify agents 
      that induce cell death in a pH-dependent manner (we call this alkaliptosis) in
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) cells and tested their effects in 
      mice. METHODS: We screened a library of 254 compounds that interact with
      G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to identify those with cytotoxic activity
      against a human PDAC cell line (PANC1). We evaluated the ability of JTC801, which
      binds the opiod receptor and has analgesic effects, to stimulate cell death in
      human PDAC cell lines (PANC1, MiaPaCa2, CFPAC1, PANC2.03, BxPc3, and CAPAN2),
      mouse pancreatic cancer-associated stellate cell lines, primary human pancreatic 
      ductal epithelial cells, and 60 cancer cell lines (the NCI-60 panel). Genes
      encoding proteins in cell death and GPCR signaling pathways, as well as those
      that regulate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, were knocked out,
      knocked down, or expressed from transgenes in cancer cell lines. JTC801 was
      administered by gavage to mice with xenograft tumors, C57BL/6 mice with
      orthographic pancreatic tumors grown from Pdx1-Cre;KRas(G12D/+);Tp53(R172H/+)
      (KPC) cells, mice with metastases following tail-vein injection of KPC cells, and
      Pdx-1-Cre;Kras(G12D/+) mice crossed with Hmgb1(flox/flox) mice (KCH mice).
      Pancreata were collected from mice and analyzed for tumor growth and by histology
      and immunohistochemistry. We compared gene and protein expression levels between 
      human pancreatic cancer tissues and patient survival times using online R2
      genomic or immunohistochemistry analyses. RESULTS: Exposure of human PDAC cell
      lines (PANC1 and MiaPaCa2) to JTC801 did not induce molecular markers of
      apoptosis (cleavage of caspase 3 or poly [ADP ribose] polymerase [PARP]),
      necroptosis (interaction between receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3
      [RIPK3] and mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase [MLKL]), or ferroptosis
      (degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 [GPX4]). Inhibitors of apoptosis
      (Z-VAD-FMK), necroptosis (necrosulfonamide), ferroptosis (ferrostatin-1), or
      autophagy (hydroxychloroquine) did not prevent JTC801-induced death of PANC1 or
      MiaPaCa2 cells. The cytotoxic effects of JTC801 in immortalized fibroblast cell
      lines was not affected by disruption of genes that promote apoptosis
      (Bax(-/-)/Bak(-/-) cells), necroptosis (Ripk1(-/-), Ripk3(-/-), or Mlkl(-/-)
      cells), ferroptosis (Gpx4(-/-) cells), or autophagy (Atg3(-/-), Atg5(-/-),
      Atg7(-/-), or Sqstm1(-/-) cells). We found JTC801 to induce a pH-dependent form
      cell death (alkaliptosis) in cancer cells but not normal cells (hepatocytes, bone
      marrow CD34(+) progenitor cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or dermal
      fibroblasts) or healthy tissues of C57BL/6 mice. JTC801 induced alkaliptosis in
      cancer cells by activating NF-kappaB, which repressed expression of the carbonic 
      anhydrase 9 gene (CA9), whose product regulates pH balance in cells. In analyses 
      of Cancer Genome Atlas data and tissue microarrays, we associated increased tumor
      level of CA9 mRNA or protein with shorter survival times of patients with
      pancreatic, kidney, or lung cancers. Knockdown of CA9 reduced the protective
      effects of NF-kappaB inhibition on JTC801-induced cell death and intracellular
      alkalinization in PANC1 and MiaPaCa2 cell lines. Oral administration of JTC801
      inhibited growth of xenograft tumors (from PANC1, MiaPaCa2, SK-MEL-28, PC-3,
      786-0, SF-295, HCT116, OV-CAR3, and HuH7 cells), orthotropic tumors (from KPC
      cells), lung metastases (from KPC cells) of mice, and slowed growth of tumors in 
      KCH mice. CONCLUSIONS: In a screen of agents that interact with GPCR pathways, we
      found JTC801 to induce pH-dependent cell death (alkaliptosis) specifically in
      cancer cells such as PDAC cells, by reducing expression of CA9. Levels of CA9 are
      increased in human cancer tissues. JTC801 might be developed for treatment of
      pancreatic cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed comprehensive models to determine risk of
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) based on genetic and 
      non-genetic factors. METHODS: We used pooled data from 3288 patients with BE,
      2511 patients with EAC, and 2177 individuals without either (controls) from
      participants in the international Barrett's and EAC consortium as well as the
      United Kingdom's BE gene study and stomach and esophageal cancer study. We
      collected data on 23 genetic variants associated with risk for BE or EAC, and
      constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for cases and controls by summing the
      risk allele counts for the variants weighted by their natural log-transformed
      effect estimates (odds ratios) extracted from genome-wide association studies. We
      also collected data on demographic and lifestyle factors (age, sex, smoking, body
      mass index, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and symptoms of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Risk models with various combinations of 
      non-genetic factors and the PRS were compared for their accuracy in identifying
      patients with BE or EAC using the area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: Individuals in the highest quartile
      of risk, based on genetic factors (PRS), had a 2-fold higher risk of BE (odds
      ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-2.60) or EAC (odds ratio, 2.46; 95%
      confidence interval, 2.07-2.92) than individual in the lowest quartile of risk
      based on PRS. Risk models developed based on only demographic or lifestyle
      factors or GERD symptoms identified patients with BE or EAC with AUC values
      ranging from 0.637 to 0.667. Combining data on demographic or lifestyle factors
      with data on GERD symptoms identified patients with BE with an AUC of 0.793 and
      patients with EAC with an AUC of 0.745. Including PRSs with these data only
      minimally increased the AUC values for BE (to 0.799) and EAC (to 0.754).
      Including the PRSs in the model developed based on non-genetic factors resulted
      in a net reclassification improvement for BE of 3.0% and for EAC of 5.6%.
      CONCLUSIONS: We used data from 3 large databases of patients from studies of BE
      or EAC to develop a risk prediction model based on genetic, clinical, and
      demographic/lifestyle factors. We identified a PRS that increases discrimination 
      and net reclassification of individuals with vs without BE and EAC. However, the 
      absolute magnitude of improvement is not sufficient to justify its clinical use.

TI  - Regular Use of Aspirin or Non-Aspirin Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Is Not
      Associated With Risk of Incident Pancreatic Cancer in Two Large Cohort Studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Use of aspirin and/or non-aspirin nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of several cancers, but it is
      not clear if use of these drugs is associated with risk of pancreatic cancer.
      METHODS: We evaluated aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID use and risk of pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma in 141,940 participants from the Health Professionals Follow-up
      Study and Nurses' Health Study using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional
      hazards regression. We considered several exposure classifications to model
      differing lag times between NSAID exposure and cancer development. We also
      conducted a nested case-control study of participants from 3 prospective cohorts 
      using conditional logistic regression to evaluate pre-diagnosis levels of plasma 
      salicylurate, a major metabolite of aspirin, in 396 pancreatic cancer cases and
      784 matched individuals without pancreatic cancer (controls). RESULTS: In the
      prospective cohort study, 1122 participants developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      over 4.2 million person-years. Use of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was not
      associated with pancreatic cancer risk, even after considering several latency
      exposure classifications. In a pre-planned subgroup analysis, regular aspirin use
      was associated with reduced pancreatic cancer risk among participants with
      diabetes (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94). In the nested case-control
      study, pre-diagnosis levels of salicylurate were not associated with pancreatic
      cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72-1.61; Ptrend 0.81; comparing
      participants in the highest quintile with those in the lowest quintile of plasma 
      salicylurate). CONCLUSIONS: Regular aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID use was not
      associated with future risk of pancreatic cancer in participants from several
      large prospective cohort studies. A possible reduction in risk for pancreatic
      cancer among people with diabetes who regularly use aspirin should be further
      examined in preclinical and human studies.

TI  - Association Between Obesity and Weight Change and Risk of Diverticulitis in
      Women.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.057 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is little evidence that adiposity associates with
      diverticulitis-especially among women. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
      obesity, weight change, and incidence of diverticulitis in a large cohort of
      women. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 46,079 women enrolled 
      in the Nurses' Health Study, 61-89 years old and free of diverticulitis,
      diverticular bleeding, cancers, or inflammatory bowel disease at baseline (in
      2008). We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the associations
      between risk of incident diverticulitis and body mass index (BMI), waist
      circumference, waist to hip ratio, and weight change from age 18 years to the
      present. The primary endpoint was first incident diverticulitis requiring
      antibiotic therapy or hospitalization. RESULTS: We documented 1084 incident cases
      of diverticulitis over 6 years of follow up, encompassing 248,001 person-years.
      After adjustment for other risk factors, women with a BMI >/= 35.0 kg/m2 had a
      hazard ratio (HR) for diverticulitis of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.08-1.85) compared to
      women with a BMI < 22.5 kg/m(2). Compared to women in the lowest quintile, the
      multivariable HRs among women in the highest quintile were 1.35 (95% CI,
      1.02-1.78) for waist circumference and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.07-1.84) for waist to hip 
      ratio; these associations were attenuated with further adjustment for BMI.
      Compared to women maintaining weight from age 18 years to the present, those who 
      gained 20 kg or more had a 73% increased risk of diverticulitis (95% CI,
      27%-136%). CONCLUSIONS: Over a 6-year follow-up period, we observed an
      association between obesity and risk of diverticulitis among women. Weight gain
      during adulthood was also associated with increased risk.

TI  - Detection of Mutations in Barrett's Esophagus Before Progression to High-grade
      Dysplasia or Adenocarcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the greatest risk factor for
      esophageal adenocarcinoma, but only a small proportion of patients with BE
      develop cancer. Biomarkers might be able to identify patients at highest risk of 
      progression. We investigated genomic differences in surveillance biopsies
      collected from patients whose BE subsequently progressed compared to patients
      whose disease did not progress. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      case-control study of 24 patients with BE that progressed to high-grade dysplasia
      (HGD, n=14) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC, n=10). The control group (n=73,
      called non-progressors) comprised patients with BE and least 5 years of total
      endoscopic biopsy surveillance without progression to HGD or EAC. From each
      patient, we selected a single tissue sample obtained more than 1 year before
      progression (cases) or more than 2 years before the end of follow up (controls). 
      Pathogenic mutations, gene copy numbers, and ploidy were compared between samples
      from progressors and non-progressors. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were detected in
      46% of samples from progressors and 5% of non-progressors. In this case-control
      sample set, TP53 mutations in BE tissues increased the adjusted risk of
      progression 13.8-fold (95% CI, 3.2-61.0) (P<.001). We did not observe significant
      differences in ploidy or copy number profile between groups. We identified 147
      pathogenic mutations in 57 distinct genes-the average number of pathogenic
      mutations was higher in samples from progressors (2.5) than non-progressors (1.2)
      (P<.001). TP53 and other somatic mutations were recurrently detected in samples
      with limited copy number changes (aneuploidy). CONCLUSIONS: In genomic analyses
      of BE tissues from patients with or without later progression to HGD or EAC, we
      found significantly higher numbers of TP53 mutations in BE from patients with
      subsequent progression. These mutations were frequently detected before the onset
      of dysplasia or substantial changes in copy number.

TI  - Immune Cell Production of Interleukin 17 Induces Stem Cell Features of Pancreatic
      Intraepithelial Neoplasia Cells.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30348-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about how the immune system affects stem cell 
      features of pancreatic cancer cells. Immune cells that produce interleukin 17 A
      (IL17A) in the chronically inflamed pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) contribute to
      PanIN initiation and progression. We investigated the effects of IL17A signaling 
      exerts on pancreatic cancer progenitor cells and the clinical relevance of this
      phenomena. METHODS: We performed studies with Mist1Cre;LSLKras;Rosa26mTmG
      (KC(iMist);G) and Kras(G12D); Trp53(R172H); Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice (which upon
      tamoxifen induction spontaneously develop pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias, 
      PanINs) and control littermates. Some mice were injected with neutralizing
      antibodies against IL17A or control antibody. Pancreata were collected, PanIN
      epithelial cells were isolated by flow cytometry based on lineage tracing, and
      gene expression profiles were compared. We collected cells from pancreatic tumors
      of KPC mice, incubated them with IL17 or control media, measured expression of
      genes regulated by IL17 signaling, injected the cancer cells into immune
      competent mice, and measured tumor growth. IL17A was overexpressed in pancreata
      of KC(iMist) mice from an adenoviral vector. Pancreata were collected from all
      mice and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Levels of doublecortin
      like kinase 1 (DCLK1) and other proteins were knocked down in KPC pancreatic
      cancer cells using small interfering or small hairpin RNAs; cells were analyzed
      by immunoblotting. We obtained 65 pancreatic tumor specimens from patients,
      analyzed protein levels by immunohistochemistry, and compared results with
      patient survival times. We also analyzed gene expression levels and patient
      outcome using the Cancer Genome Atlas database. RESULTS: PanIN cells from
      KC(iMist);G mice had a gene expression pattern associated with embryonic stem
      cells. Mice given injections of IL17 neutralizing antibodies, or with immune
      cells that did not secrete IL17, lost this expression pattern, and significantly 
      decreased expression of DCLK1 and POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3), which regulate
      tuft cell development. KC(iMist) mice that overexpressed IL17 formed more PanINs,
      with more DCLK1-positive cells, than control mice. Pancreatic tumor cells from
      KPC mice and human Capan-2 cells exposed to IL17A had increased activation of
      NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling, and increased expression of DCLK1 and ALDH1A1 (a
      marker of embryonic stem cells), compared to cells in control media. These cells 
      also formed tumors faster that cells not exposed to IL17 when they were injected 
      into immunocompetent mice. KPC cells with knockdown of DCLK1 expressed lower
      levels of ALDH1A1 following incubation with IL17 than cells without knockdown.
      Expression of the IL17 receptor C (IL17RC) was higher in DCLK1-positive PanIN
      cells from mice compared to DCLK1-negative PanIN cells. In human pancreatic tumor
      tissues, high levels of DCLK1 associated with a shorter median survival time of
      patients (17.7 months, compared with 26.6 months of patients whose tumors had low
      levels of DCLK1). Tumor levels of POU2F3 and LAMC2 also associated with patient
      survival time. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of mouse and human pancreatic tumors and
      precursors, we found immune cell-derived IL17 to regulate development of tuft
      cells and stem cell features of pancreatic cancer cells via increased expression 
      of DCLK1, POU2F3, ALDH1A1, and IL17RC. Strategies to disrupt this pathway might
      be developed to prevent pancreatic tumor growth and progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary modification has been recommended for treatment of
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although it is not clear whether
      improving diet quality can prevent its development. We performed a prospective
      study to examine the association between diet quality change and change in liver 
      fat change. We also examined the association between genetic risk score and liver
      fat change in individuals with different levels of diet quality change. METHODS: 
      Our study included 1521 participants who attended the seventh and eighth
      examinations (1998-2001 and 2005-2008) of the second-generation cohort or
      attended the first and second examinations (2002-2005 and 2008-2011) of the
      third-generation cohort in the Framingham Heart Study. The self-administered
      semi-quantitative 126-item Harvard food frequency questionnaire was used to
      determine dietary intake in the year leading up to an examination. We assessed
      levels of liver fat using liver-phantom ratio (LPR) and computed tomography
      images from 2002 through 2005 and again from 2008 through 2011. LPR values are
      inversely related to liver fat-increased LPR indicates decreased liver fat. We
      examined associations of changes in 2 diet scores-the Mediterranean-style diet
      score (MDS) and Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-with changes in liver fat
      and new-onset fatty liver. We evaluated interactions between diet score change
      and a weighted genetic risk score for NAFLD, determined based on multiple single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies of NAFLD. 
      The primary outcome was change in LPR between baseline and follow-up measurement.
      RESULTS: For each 1-standard deviation increase in MDS, the LPR increased
      (meaning liver fat decreased) by 0.57 (95% CI, 0.27-0.86; P<.001) and the odds
      for incident fatty liver decreased by 26% (95% CI, 10%-39%; P=.002). For each
      1-standard deviation increase in AHEI, LPR increased by 0.56 (95% CI, 0.29-0.84; 
      P<.001) and the odds for incident fatty liver decreased by 21% (95% CI, 5%-35%;
      P=.02). Increased diet scores were also associated with reduced odds of
      developing more-advanced fatty liver. Higher genetic risk scores were associated 
      with increased liver fat accumulation in participants who had decreased MDS
      (P<.001) or AHEI scores (P=.001), but not in those with stable or improved diet
      scores (P for gene-diet interaction <.001). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of
      participants in the Framingham Heart Study, increasing diet quality, determined
      based on MDS and AHEI scores, is associated with less liver fat accumulation and 
      reduced risk for new-onset fatty liver. An improved diet is particularly
      important for individuals with a high genetic risk for NAFLD.

TI  - ARID1A Maintains Differentiation of Pancreatic Ductal Cells and Inhibits
      Development of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in Mice.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30346-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The AT-rich interaction domain 1A gene (ARID1A) encodes a
      protein that is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex
      SWI/SNF and is frequently mutated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
      (PDACs). We investigated the functions of ARID1A during formation of PDACs in
      mice. METHODS: We performed studies with Ptf1a-Cre; Kras(G12D) mice, which
      express activated Kras in the pancreas and develop pancreatic intraepithelial
      neoplasias (PanINs), as well as those with disruption of Aird1a (Ptf1a-Cre;
      Kras(G12D); Arid1a(f/f) mice) or disruption of Brg1 (encodes a catalytic ATPase
      of the SWI/SNF complex) (Ptf1a-Cre; Kras(G12D); Brg1(f/f) mice). Pancreatic
      ductal cells (PDCs) were isolated from Arid1a(f/f) mice and from Arid1a(f/f);
      SOX9OE mice, which overexpress human SOX9 upon infection with an adenovirus
      expressing Cre recombinase. Pancreatic tissues were collected from all mice and
      analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry; cells were isolated and grown in 
      2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cultures. We performed microarray analyses to
      compare gene expression patterns in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms
      (IPMNs) from the different strains of mice. We obtained 58 samples of IPMN and 44
      samples of PDAC from patients who underwent pancreatectomy in Japan, and analyzed
      them by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Ptf1a-Cre; Kras(G12D) mice developed
      PanINs, whereas Ptf1a-Cre; Kras(G12D); Arid1a(f/f) mice developed IPMNs and
      PDACs; IPMNs originated from PDCs. ARID1A-deficient IPMNs did not express SOX9.
      ARID1A-deficient PDCs had reduced expression of SOX9 and dedifferentiated in
      culture. Overexpression of SOX9 in these cells allowed them to differentiate and 
      prevented dilation of ducts. Among mice with pancreatic expression of activated
      Kras, those with disruption of Arid1a developed fewer PDACs from IPMNs than mice 
      with disruption of Brg1. ARID1A-deficient IPMNs had reduced activity of the mTOR 
      pathway. Human IPMN and PDAC specimens had reduced levels of ARID1A, SOX9, and
      phosphorylated S6 (a marker of mTOR pathway activation). Levels of ARID1A
      correlated with levels of SOX9 and phosphorylated S6. CONCLUSIONS: ARID1A
      regulates expression of SOX9, activation of the mTOR pathway, and differentiation
      of PDCs. ARID1A inhibits formation of PDACs from IPMNs in mice with pancreatic
      expression of activated KRAS, and is downregulated in IPMN and PDAC tissues from 
      patients.

TI  - Intestinal failure and aberrant lipid metabolism in patients with DGAT1
      deficiency.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30347-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Congenital diarrheal disorders are rare inherited intestinal
      disorders characterized by intractable, sometimes life-threatening, diarrhea and 
      nutrient malabsorption; some have been associated with mutations in
      diacylglycerol-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), which catalyzes formation of
      triacylglycerol from diacylglycerol and acyl-CoA. We investigated the mechanisms 
      by which DGAT1 deficiency contributes to intestinal failure using patient-derived
      organoids. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 10 patients, from 6 unrelated
      pedigrees, who presented with early-onset severe diarrhea and/or vomiting,
      hypoalbuminemia, and/or (fatal) protein-losing enteropathy with intestinal
      failure; we performed next-generation sequence analysis of DNA from 8 patients.
      Organoids were generated from duodenal biopsies from 3 patients and 3 healthy
      individuals (controls). Caco-2 cells and patient-derived dermal fibroblasts were 
      transfected or transduced with vectors that express full-length or mutant forms
      of DGAT1 or full-length DGAT2. We performed CRISPR/Cas9-guided disruption of
      DGAT1 in control intestinal organoids. Cells and organoids were analyzed by
      immunoblot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, chromatography, quantitative
      real-time PCR, and for activities of caspases 3 and 7. RESULTS: In the 10
      patients, we identified 5 bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in DGAT1. In
      patient-derived fibroblasts and organoids, the mutations reduced expression of
      DGAT1 protein and altered triacylglycerol metabolism, resulting in decreased
      lipid droplet formation after oleic acid addition. Expression of full-length
      DGAT2 in patient-derived fibroblasts restored formation of lipid droplets.
      Organoids derived from patients with DGAT1 mutations were more susceptible to
      lipid-induced cell death than control organoids. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a
      large cohort of patients with congenital diarrheal disorders with mutations in
      DGAT1 that reduced expression of its product; dermal fibroblasts and intestinal
      organoids derived from these patients had altered lipid metabolism and were
      susceptible to lipid-induced cell death. Expression of full-length DGAT1 or DGAT2
      restored normal lipid metabolism in these cells. These findings indicate the
      importance of DGAT1 in fat metabolism and lipotoxicity in the intestinal
      epithelium. A fat-free diet might serve as the first line of therapy for patients
      with reduced DGAT1 expression. It is important to identify genetic variants
      associated with congenital diarrheal disorders for proper diagnosis and selection
      of treatment strategies.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.029 [doi]
AB  - Somatic mutations have been found in the mitochondria in different types of
      cancer cells, but it is not clear whether these affect tumorigenesis or tumor
      progression. We analyzed mitochondrial genomes of 268 early-stage, resected
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues and paired non-tumor tissues. We defined
      a mitochondrial somatic mutation (mtSNV) as a position where the difference in
      heteroplasmy fraction between tumor and normal sample was >/=0.2. Our analysis
      identified 304 mtSNVs, with at least 1 mtSNV in 61% (164 of 268) of tumor
      samples. The noncoding control region had the greatest proportion of mtSNVs (60
      of 304 mutations); this region contains sites that regulate mitochondrial DNA
      transcription and replication. Frequently mutated genes included ND5, RNR2, and
      CO1, plus 29 mutations in transfer RNA genes. mtSNVs in 2 separate mitochondrial 
      genes (ND4 and ND6) were associated with shorter overall survival time. This
      association appeared to depend on the level of mtSNV heteroplasmy. Non-random
      co-occurrence between mtSNVs and mutations in nuclear genes indicates
      interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. In an analysis of primary
      tumors and metastases from 6 patients, we found tumors to accumulate
      mitochondrial mutational mutations as they progress.

      Hemorrhage and Effects on Outcomes.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30340-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We aimed to determine the rate of hospital readmission within 
      30 days of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH) and its impact
      on mortality, morbidity and healthcare utilization in the United States. METHODS:
      We performed a retrospective study using the Agency for Healthcare Research and
      Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmission Database
      for the year 2014 (data on 14.9 million hospital stays at 2048 hospitals in 22
      states). We collected data on hospital readmissions of 203,220 adults
      hospitalized for urgent NVUGIH and discharged. The primary outcome was rate of
      all-cause readmission within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes were
      reasons for readmission, readmission mortality rate, morbidity (shock and
      prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) and resource utilization (length of stay
      and total hospitalization costs and charges). Independent risk factors for
      readmission were identified using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The 30-day
      rate of readmission was 13%. Only 18% of readmissions were due to recurrent
      non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The rate of death among patients
      readmitted to the hospital (4.7%) was higher than that for index admissions
      (1.9%) (P<.01). A higher proportion of readmitted patients had morbidities
      requiring PMV (1.5%) compared to index admissions (0.8%) (P<.01). A total of
      133,368 hospital days was associated with readmission, and the total healthcare
      in-hospital economic burden was $30.3 million (in costs) and $108 million (in
      charges). Independent predictors of readmission were Medicaid insurance, higher
      Charlson comorbidity score, lower income, residence in a metropolitan area,
      hemorrhagic shock, and longer stays in the hospital. Older age, private or no
      insurance, upper endoscopy, and PMV were associated with lower odds for
      readmission. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of patients hospitalized for
      non-variceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 13% are readmitted to the
      hospital within 30 days of discharge. Readmission is associated with higher
      mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization. Most readmissions are not for
      recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.

TI  - Identification of Variants in RET and IHH Pathway Members in a Large Family With 
      History of Hirschsprung Disease.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30341-X [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is an inherited congenital
      disorder characterized by absence of enteric ganglia in the distal part of the
      gut. Variants in ret proto-oncogene (RET) have been associated with up to 50% of 
      familial and 35% of sporadic cases. We searched for variants that affect disease 
      risk in a large, multi-generational family with history of HSCR in a linkage
      region previously associated with the disease (4q31.3-q32.3) and exome wide.
      METHODS: We performed exome sequencing analyses of a family in the Netherlands
      with 5 members diagnosed with HSCR and 2 members diagnosed with functional
      constipation. We initially focused on variants in genes located in 4q31.3-q32.3. 
      However, we also performed an exome-wide analysis in which known HSCR or
      HSCR-associated gene variants predicted to be deleterious were prioritized for
      further analysis. Candidate genes were expressed in HEK293, COS-7, and Neuro-2a
      cells and analyzed by luciferase and immunoblot assays. Morpholinos were designed
      to target exons of candidate genes and injected into 1-cell stage zebrafish
      embryos. Embryos were allowed to develop and stained for enteric neurons.
      RESULTS: Within the linkage region, we identified 1 putative splice variant in
      the LPS responsive beige-like anchor protein gene (LRBA). Functional assays could
      not confirm its predicted effect on mRNA splicing or on expression of the mab-21 
      like 2 gene (MAB21L2), which is embedded in LRBA. Zebrafish that developed
      following injection of the lrba morpholino had a shortened body axis and subtle
      gut morphological defects, but no significant reduction in number of enteric
      neurons compared with controls. Outside the linkage region, members of 1 branch
      of the family carried a previously unidentified RET variant or an in-frame
      deletion in the glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor gene (GDNF), which
      encodes a ligand of RET. This deletion was located 6 base pairs before the last
      codon. We also found variants in the indian hedgehog gene (IHH) and its mediator,
      the transcription factor GLI family zinc finger 3 (GLI3). When expressed in
      cells, the RET-P399L variant disrupted protein glycosylation and had altered
      phosphorylation following activation by GDNF. The deletion in GDNF prevented
      secretion of its gene product, reducing RET activation, and the IHH-Q51K variant 
      reduced expression of the transcription factor GLI1. Injection of morpholinos
      that target ihh reduced the number of enteric neurons to 13%+/-1.4% of control
      zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of a large family with history of HSCR, we
      identified variants in LRBA, RET, the gene encoding the RET ligand (GDNF), IHH,
      and a gene encoding a mediator of IHH signaling (GLI3). These variants altered
      functions of the gene products when expressed in cells and knockout of ihh
      reduced the number of enteric neurons in the zebrafish gut.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal fibrosis is a challenge to management of patients
      with Crohn's disease (CD); there is an urgent need to expedite development of
      anti-fibrosis drugs for this disease. The International Organization for the
      Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD) aimed to identify a set of endpoints 
      that can be used to determine efficacy of anti-fibrosis agents tested in clinical
      trials of patients with CD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify
      clinical, radiologic, biochemical, endoscopic, and composite endpoints used in
      assessing activity of fibrostenosing CD and response to treatment, and determined
      their operational properties. A panel of IOIBD experts performed a consensus
      process to identify the best endpoints for inclusion in clinical trials, through 
      a 2-round, Delphi-style online survey. RESULTS: A total of 36 potentially
      relevant endpoints for intestinal fibrosis were selected and assessed.
      Forty-eight physicians with expertise in inflammatory bowel disease, from 5
      regions (North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia/Pacific, and Latin America),
      participated in the Delphi consensus process. A core set of 13 endpoints
      (complete clinical response, long-term efficacy, sustained clinical benefit,
      treatment failure, radiological remission, normal quality of life, clinical
      remission without steroids, therapeutic failure, deep remission, complete absence
      of occlusive symptoms, symptom-free survival, bowel damage progression, and no
      disability) were rated as critical. Agreement was high among the experts.
      CONCLUSIONS: Members of the IOIBD reached expert consensus on a set of endpoints 
      that can be used to assess anti-fibrosis agents in trials of patients with CD.
      Studies are needed to clarify methods for measuring these outcomes and validate
      measurement instruments.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) can be used to calculate an individual's risk for colorectal cancer (CRC),
      called a genetic risk score (GRS). We investigated whether GRS can identify
      individuals with clinically relevant neoplasms in a screening colonoscopy
      population. METHODS: We derived a GRS based on 48 SNPs associated with CRC,
      identified in a comprehensive literature search. We obtained genetic data from
      1043 participants (50-79 years old) in a screening colonoscopy study in Germany, 
      recruited from 2005 through 2013 (294 with advanced neoplasms, 249 with
      non-advanced adenomas, and 500 without neoplasms). Each participant was assigned 
      a GRS by aggregating their risk alleles (0, 1, or 2). Risk of advanced neoplasms 
      and non-advanced adenoma according to GRS was calculated by multiple logistic
      regression. Risk advancement periods were calculated. We replicated our findings 
      using data from a subset of the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. RESULTS: An
      increased GRS was associated with higher prevalence of advanced neoplasms, but
      not non-advanced adenomas. Participants in the middle and upper tertile of GRSs
      had a 2.2-fold and 2.7-fold increase in risk, respectively, of advanced neoplasms
      compared to those in the lower tertile. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.09 (95%
      CI, 0.76-1.57) for non-advanced adenoma in the middle tertile and 1.05 (95% CI,
      0.70-1.55) for non-advanced adenoma in the upper tertile. The ORs were largest
      for proximal advanced neoplasms for participants in the middle tertile (OR, 3.55;
      95% CI 1.85-6.82) and the upper tertile (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.84-7.10). The risk
      advancement period for medium vs low GRS was 13.4 years (95% CI 4.8-22.0) and for
      high vs low GRS was 17.5 years (95% CI, 7.8-27.3). CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic
      analysis of participants in a CRC screening study in Germany, an increased GRS
      (based on CRC-associated SNPs) was associated with increased prevalence of
      advanced neoplasms. These findings might be used in defining risk-adapted
      screening ages.

TI  - Activity of Mesothelin-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells Against
      Pancreatic Carcinoma Metastases in a Phase 1 Trial.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30323-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.029 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is resistant to T-cell mediated
      immunotherapy. We engineered T cells to transiently express an mRNA encoding a
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for mesothelin-a protein that is
      over-expressed by PDAC cells. We performed a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of adoptive cell therapy with autologous mesothelin-specific CAR T
      cells (CARTmeso cells) in 6 patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic
      PDAC. Patients were given intravenous CARTmeso cells 3 times weekly for 3 weeks. 
      None of the patients developed cytokine release syndrome or neurologic symptoms
      and there were no dose limiting toxicities. Disease stabilized in 2 patients,
      with progression-free survival times of 3.8 and 5.4 months. We used FDG-positron 
      emission tomography/computed tomography imaging to monitor the metabolic active
      volume (MAV) of individual tumor lesions. The total MAV remained stable in 3
      patients and decreased by 69.2% in 1 patient with biopsy-proven mesothelin
      expression; in this patient, all liver lesions had a complete reduction in FDG
      uptake at 1 month compared to baseline, although there was no effect on the
      primary PDAC. Transient CAR expression was detected in patients' blood after
      infusion and led to expansion of new immunoglobulin G proteins. Our results
      provide evidence for the potential anti-tumor activity of mRNA CARTmeso cells, as
      well as PDAC resistance to the immune response.

TI  - Hepatitis B Virus Does Not Interfere With Innate Immune Responses in the Human
      Liver.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most viruses are detected at early stages of cell infection
      and induce an innate immune response mediated by production interferons (IFNs).
      IFNs induce expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Infection of
      chimpanzees with hepatitis C virus, but not hepatitis B virus (HBV), induces ISG 
      expression in the liver. HBV might not induce an innate immune response because
      it is not detected by pattern recognition receptors (the stealth properties of
      HBV) or because HBV suppresses IFN production or signaling despite detection by
      pattern recognition receptors. We studied innate immune signaling in liver
      biopsies from patients with different stages of chronic HBV infection and
      uninfected individuals (controls). METHODS: We obtained liver within 10 minutes
      after collection from 30 patients with chronic HBV infection (hepatitis B e
      antigen-positive or -negative, with or without hepatitis) and 42 controls (most
      with fatty liver disease). The liver tissues were analyzed by histology,
      immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
      reaction, in situ hybridization, HBV RNA quantification, and HBV genotyping; some
      specimens were incubated with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands
      (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid) or infected with Sendai virus and then
      analyzed. RESULTS: Liver specimens from patients with HBV infection were not
      expressing more IFN or ISGs than those from control patients, indicating that
      chronic HBV infection did not activate an innate immune response. However, liver 
      specimens from patients with HBV infection did produce IFN and induce expression 
      of ISGs following activation of TLR3 with poly(I:C) or Sendai virus infections,
      so the innate immune response is not suppressed in these tissues. CONCLUSION:
      Liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection do not have induction of
      an innate immune response, but this response can be activated by other factors
      (TLR3 binding, Sendai virus infection) in HBV-infected liver tissue. These
      findings support the hypothesis that HBV is invisible to pattern recognition
      receptors.

TI  - Effects of Helicobacter PYLORI Treatment on Incidence of Gastric Cancer in Older 
      Individuals.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30322-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection reduces 
      the risk of gastric cancer, few data are available on its effects in older
      subjects. We compared the age-specific risk of gastric cancer in a large cohort
      of subjects who received H pylori eradication therapy vs a matched general
      population. METHODS: We searched the Hospital Authority database of Hong Kong to 
      identify individuals with H pylori infection who had received a course of
      clarithromycin-containing eradication therapy from January 2003 through December 
      2012. We compared the gastric cancer incidence in this cohort with the expected
      incidence for the local general population by retrieving the gastric cancer
      incidence of the age- and sex-matched population from 2003 through 2014 (the
      latest available year) from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry. The primary outcome
      was the incidence of gastric cancer development in the cohort treated for H
      pylori infection vs the expected number of gastric cancer cases in the general
      population. Analyses were conducted by a priori age groups of less than 40 years,
      40-59 years, and 60 years or older. RESULTS: Among 73,237 subjects infected with 
      H pylori who received eradication therapy, 200 (0.27%) developed gastric cancer
      during a median follow-up time of 7.6 years. Compared with the matched general
      population, the gastric cancer risk was significantly lower in subjects 60 years 
      or older who had received H pylori treatment (standardized incidence ratio [SIR],
      0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.97; P=.02) but not in younger groups. When data were
      stratified based on time from H pylori treatment (less than 5 years, 5-9 years,
      and 10 or more years), the risk of gastric cancer was significantly lower than
      the general population 10 or more years after eradication in the group 40-59
      years old (SI, 0.32; 95% CI 0.08-0.88; P=.04) and the group 60 years or older
      (SIR, 0.42; 95% CI 0.42-0.84; p = 0.02) than the other age groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      In an analysis of data from a public hospital database on Hong Kong, we
      associated treatment of H pylori infection with a lower risk of gastric cancer,
      particularly in older subjects, 10 or more years after treatment.

TI  - Non-lytic Lymphocytes Engineered to Express Virus-specific T-cell Receptors Limit
      HBV Infection by Activating APOBEC3.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30321-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Strategies to develop virus-specific T cells against hepatic
      viral infections have been hindered by safety concerns. We engineered non-lytic
      human T cells to suppress replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) without overt hepatotoxicity, and investigated their antiviral
      activity. METHODS: We electroporated resting T cells or T cells activated by
      anti-CD3 with mRNAs encoding HBV or HCV-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) to
      create 2 populations of TCR-reprogrammed T cells. We tested their ability to
      suppress HBV or HCV replication without lysis in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional 
      cultures of HepG2.2.15 cells and HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells. We also injected
      TCR-reprogrammed resting and activated T cells into HBV-infected
      uPA/SCID/IL2gamma mice with humanized livers and measured levels of intrahepatic 
      and serological viral parameters and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Livers
      were collected for analysis of gene expression patterns to determine effects of
      the TCR-reprogrammed T cells. RESULTS: TCR-reprogrammed resting T cells produced 
      comparable levels of interferon gamma (IFNG) but lower levels of perforin and
      granzyme than activated T cells and did not lyse HCV- or HBV-infected hepatoma
      cells. While T-cell secretion of IFNG was required to inhibit HCV replication,
      the HBV-specific TCR-reprogrammed resting T cells reduced HBV replication also
      through intracellular activation of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme,
      catalytic polypeptide 3 (APOBEC3). The mechanism of APOBEC3 intracellular
      activation involved temporal expression of lymphotoxin-beta-receptor ligands on
      resting T cells after TCR-mediated antigen recognition and activation of
      lymphotoxin-beta-receptor in infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: We developed
      TCR-reprogrammed non-lytic T cells capable to activate APOBEC3 in hepatoma cells 
      and in HBV-infected human hepatocytes in mice, limiting viral infection. These
      cells with limited hepatotoxicity might be developed for treatment of chronic HBV
      infection.

LID - S0016-5085(18)30077-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We examined temporal trends in liver cancer incidence rates
      overall and by histological type from 1983 through 2007. We predict trends in
      liver cancer incidence rates through 2030 for selected Eastern and Southeastern
      Asian countries. METHODS: Data on yearly liver cancer incident cases by age group
      and sex were drawn from 6 major selected Eastern and Southeastern Asian countries
      or regions with cancer registries available in the CI5plus database, including
      China, Japan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Philippines,
      Singapore, and Thailand. We also analyzed data for the United States and
      Australia for comparative purposes. Age-standardized incidence rates were
      calculated and plotted from 1983 through 2007. Numbers of new cases and incidence
      rates were predicted through 2030 by fitting and extrapolating age-period-cohort 
      models. RESULTS: The incidence rates of liver cancer have been decreasing, and
      decreases will continue in all selected Eastern and Southeastern Asian countries,
      except for Thailand, whose liver cancer incidence rate will increase due to the
      increasing incidence rate of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Even though the
      incidence rates of liver cancer are predicted to decrease in most Eastern and
      Southeastern Asian countries, the burden, in terms of new cases, will continue to
      increase because of population growth and aging. CONCLUSIONS: Based on an
      analysis of data from cancer registries from Asian countries, incidence rates of 
      liver cancer are expected to decrease through 2030 in most Eastern and
      Southeastern Asian countries. However, in Thailand, the incidence rate of
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is predicted to increase, so health education
      programs are necessary.

AB  - The nuclear lamina is a multi-protein lattice composed of A- and B-type lamins
      and their associated proteins. This protein lattice associates with
      heterochromatin and integral inner nuclear membrane proteins, providing links
      among the genome, nucleoskeleton, and cytoskeleton. In the 1990s, mutations in
      EMD and LMNA were linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Since then, the
      number of diseases attributed to nuclear lamina defects, including laminopathies 
      and other disorders, has increased to include more than 20 distinct genetic
      syndromes. Studies of patients and mouse genetic models have indicated the
      important roles for lamins and their associated proteins in the function of
      gastrointestinal organs, including liver and pancreas. We review the interactions
      and functions of the lamina in relation to the nuclear envelope and genome, the
      ways in which its dysfunction is thought to contribute to human disease, and
      possible avenues for targeted therapies.

TI  - Dysregulated Response of Follicular Helper T cells to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
      Promotes HBV Persistence in Mice and Associates With Outcomes of Patients.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30313-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Production of neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis B
      surface antigen (HBsAg) is dysregulated in patients with persistent hepatitis V
      virus (HBV) infection. We investigated mechanisms by which this immune response
      to the virus is disrupted and whether it can be restored to promote clearance of 
      HBV. METHODS: Immune-competent C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J, as well as mice deficient
      in follicular helper T cells (Tfh cell-deficient), B cells, or Foxp3(+)
      T-regulatory cells (Treg cell-deficient), were given hydrodynamic injections of
      pAAV/HBV1.2 plasmids. Some mice were given injections of sorted Tfh cells, pan-B 
      cells, Treg cells, or a blocking antibody against CTLA4. Production of antibodies
      against HBsAg and clearance of HBV were assessed by flow cytometry, ELISA, PCR
      and immunohistochemical analyses. We obtained blood samples from patients with
      HBV infection and isolated Treg cells. We measured the ability of Treg cells to
      suppress production of interleukin 21 (IL21) in CD4(+) T cells. RESULTS:
      Immune-competent C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J mice transfected with the plasmid encoding
      HBV had features of viral clearance and viral persistence observed in humans. A
      Tfh-cell response to HBsAg was required for clearance of HBV and was suppressed
      by Treg cells in mice with persistent HBV infection. Depletion of Treg cells or
      inhibition of Treg-cell function (with blocking antibody against CTLA4) restored 
      the Tfh-cell response against HBsAg and clearance of HBV in mice. Impaired Tfh
      cell response to HBsAg was observed in blood from patients with chronic HBV
      infection, responsiveness was restored by depletion of Treg cells or blocking
      antibody against CTLA4. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of HBV-infected mice and blood
      from patients with chronic HBV infection, we found a Tfh-cell response to HBsAg
      of to be required for HBV clearance, and that this response was blocked by Treg
      cells. Inhibiting Treg cell activity using neutralizing antibody against CTLA4
      restored the ability of Tfh cells to clear HBV infection; this approach might be 
      developed for treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.

TI  - Secretion of Hepatitis C Virus Replication Intermediates Reduces Activation of
      Toll Like Receptor 3 in Hepatocytes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections most often result in
      chronic outcomes, although the virus constantly produces replication
      intermediates, in particular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), representing potent
      inducers of innate immunity. We aimed to characterize the fate of HCV dsRNA in
      hepatocyte cultures to identify mechanisms contributing to viral persistence in
      presence of an active innate immune response. METHODS: We analyzed
      hepatocyte-based culture models for HCV for induction of innate immunity,
      secretion of virus positive- or negative-strand RNA, and viral replication using 
      different quantification methods and microscopy techniques. Expression of pattern
      recognition receptors was reconstituted in hepatoma cells by lentiviral
      transduction. RESULTS: HCV-infected cells secrete substantial amounts of virus
      positive- and negative-strand RNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs), toward the
      apical and basolateral domain of hepatocytes. Secretion of negative-strand RNA
      was independent from virus production, and viral RNA secreted in EVs contained
      higher relative amounts of negative strands, indicating that mostly virus dsRNA
      is released. A substantial part of viral replication complexes and dsRNA was
      found in the endosomal compartment and multi-vesicular bodies, indicating that
      secretion of HCV replication intermediates is mediated by the exosomal pathway.
      Block of vesicle release in HCV-positive cells increased intracellular dsRNA
      levels and increased activation of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3), inhibiting HCV
      replication. CONCLUSIONS: Using hepatocyte-based culture models for HCV, we found
      a portion of HCV dsRNA intermediates to be released from infected cells in EVs,
      which reduces activation of TLR3. This represents a novel mechanism how HCV
      evades host immune responses, potentially contributing to viral persistence.

TI  - Baseline Factors Associated with Improvements in Decompensated Cirrhosis After
      Direct-acting Antiviral Therapy for HCV Infection.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30314-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents can reduce
      model for end-stage liver disease and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores in
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). However,
      many of these patients still die or require liver transplantation. We collected
      data on baseline features of patients and aimed to develop a scoring system to
      predict response to DAA therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis
      of data from 4 trials of the effects of sofosbuvir-based therapy in patients with
      HCV-associated decompensated cirrhosis (502 of CPT class B and 120 of CPT class
      C). In these trials, patients were given 12 or 24 weeks treatment with
      ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin or velpatasvir, sofosbuvir, and/or
      ribavirin, or 48 weeks treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. We collected
      demographic, clinical, treatment response, and laboratory data from patients and 
      tested their associations with patient outcomes at 36 weeks. The primary outcome 
      was factors associated with reduction of CPT score to class A. RESULTS: The
      presence of ascites or encephalopathy, serum level of albumin below 3.5g/dL or
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) below 60 U/L, and body mass index (BMI) above 25
      kg/m(2) associated with an increased risk of not achieving a reduction in CPT to 
      class A, independent of sustained viral response to therapy. Serum level of
      albumin below 2.8g/dL and abnormal level of bilirubin associated with an
      increased risk of liver transplantation or death. We developed a scoring system
      based on 5 baseline factors (BMI, encephalopathy, ascites, and serum levels of
      ALT and albumin), which we called the BE3A; scores associated significantly with 
      patient outcomes. For patients with scores of 4-5, the hazard ratio for reduction
      of CPT score to class A was 52.3 (95% CI, 15.2-179.7). CONCLUSIONS: We identified
      5 baseline factors (BMI, encephalopathy, ascites, and serum levels of ALT and
      albumin) associated with a reduction of CPT score to class A in patients with
      HCV-associated decompensated cirrhosis receiving DAA therapy. We developed a
      predictive score using these factors, called the BE3A score, that can be used as 
      a shared decision making tool, quantifying the potential benefits of DAA therapy 
      for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

TI  - Neuronal Transforming Growth Factor beta Signaling via SMAD3 Contributes to Pain 
      in Animal Models of Chronic Pancreatitis.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30247-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by pancreatic
      inflammation and fibrosis, associated with increased pancreatic expression of
      transforming growth factor beta (TGFB). It is not clear how these might
      contribute to pain. We investigated whether TGFB signaling via SMAD induces
      sensitization of pancreatic sensory neurons to increase nociception. METHODS: CP 
      was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by infusion of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid; 
      some rats were given intrathecal infusions of TGFB1. CP was induced in control
      mice by administration of cerulein; we also studied beta1glo/Ptf1acre-ER mice,
      which upon induction overexpress TGFB1 in pancreatic acinar cells, and
      TGFBr1(f/f-CGRPcreER) mice, which have inducible disruption of TGFBr1 in
      calcitonin gene-related peptide- positive neurons. Dominant negative forms of
      human TGFBR2 and SMAD3 were overexpressed from viral vectors in rat pancreas.
      Some rats were given the SMAD3 inhibitors SIS3 or halofuginone. After induction
      of CP, mice were analyzed in for pain in behavior tests or electrophysiologic
      studies of sensory neurons. Pancreatic nociceptor excitability was examined by
      patch clamp techniques and nociception was measured by Von Frey Filament tests
      for referred somatic hyperalgesia and behavioral responses to pancreatic
      electrical stimulation. Pancreata were collected from mice and rats and analyzed 
      histologically and by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Over-expression of
      TGFB in pancreatic acinar cells of mice and infusion of TGFB1 into rats resulted 
      in sensory neuron hyperexcitability, SMAD3 activation, and increased nociception.
      This was accompanied by a reduction in the transient A-type current in
      pancreas-specific sensory neurons in rats, a characteristic of nociceptive
      sensitization in animal models of CP. Conversely, pancreata from
      TGFBr1(f/f-CGRPcreER) mice, rats with pancreatic expression of dominant-negative 
      forms of human TGFBR2 or SMAD3, and rats given small molecule inhibitors of SMAD3
      had attenuated neuronal sensitization and pain behavior following induction of
      CP. In contrast to findings from peripheral administration of TGFB1, intrathecal 
      infusion of TGFB1 reduced hyperalgesia in rats with CP. CONCLUSIONS: In pancreata
      of mice and rats, TGFB promotes peripheral nociceptive sensitization via a direct
      effect on primary sensory neurons mediated by intra-neuronal SMAD3. This is
      distinct from the central nervous system, where TGFB reduces nociception. These
      results provide an explanation for the link between fibrosis and pain and pain in
      patients with CP. This signaling pathway might be targeted therapeutically to
      reduce pain in patients with CP.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.068 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopic submucosal dissection was developed in Japan, early in this century,
      to provide a minimally invasive yet curative treatment for the large numbers of
      patients with early gastric cancer identified by the national screening program. 
      Previously, the majority of these patients were treated surgically at substantial
      cost and with significant risk of short- and long-term morbidity. En-bloc
      excision of these early cancers, most with a limited risk of nodal metastasis,
      allowed complete staging of the tumor, stratification of the subsequent
      therapeutic approach, and potential cure. This transformative innovation changed 
      the nature of endoscopic treatment for superficial mucosal neoplasia and,
      ultimately, for the first time allowed endoscopists to assert that the early
      cancer had been definitively cured. Subsequently, Western endoscopists have
      increasingly embraced the therapeutic possibilities offered by endoscopic
      submucosal dissection, but with some justifiable scientific caution. Here we
      provide an evidence-based critical appraisal of the role of endoscopic submucosal
      dissection in advanced endoscopic tissue resection.

TI  - Nanoliposome C6-Ceramide Increases the Anti-tumor Immune Response and Slows
      Growth of Liver Tumors in Mice.
PG  - 1024-1036.e9
LID - S0016-5085(18)30099-4 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ceramide, a sphingolipid metabolite, affects T-cell signaling,
      induces apoptosis of cancer cells, and slows tumor growth in mice. However, it
      has not been used as a chemotherapeutic agent because of its cell impermeability 
      and precipitation in aqueous solution. We developed a nanoliposome-loaded
      C6-ceremide (LipC6) to overcome this limitation and investigated its effects in
      mice with liver tumors. METHODS: Immune competent C57BL/6 mice received
      intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride and intra-splenic injections
      of oncogenic hepatocytes. As a result, tumors resembling human hepatocellular
      carcinomas developed in a fibrotic liver setting. After tumors formed, mice were 
      given an injection of LipC6 or vehicle via tail vein every other day for 2 weeks.
      This was followed by administration, also via tail vein, of tumor
      antigen-specific (TAS) CD8(+) T cells isolated from the spleens of line 416 mice,
      and subsequent immunization by intraperitoneal injection of tumor
      antigen-expressing B6/WT-19 cells. Tumor growth was monitored with magnetic
      resonance imaging. Tumor apoptosis, proliferation, and AKT expression were
      analyzed using immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. Cytokine production,
      phenotype, and function of TAS CD8(+) T cells and tumor-associated macrophages
      (TAMs) were studied with flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR), and ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TAMs and bone marrow-derived
      macrophages, induced by colony stimulating factor 2 (GMCSF or CSF2) or colony
      stimulating factor 1 (MCSF or CSF1), were detected using a luminescent assay.
      RESULTS: Injection of LipC6 slowed tumor growth by reducing tumor cell
      proliferation and phosphorylation of AKT, and increasing tumor cell apoptosis,
      compared with vehicle. Tumors grew more slowly in mice given the combination of
      LipC6 injection and TAS CD8(+) T cells followed by immunization compared with
      mice given vehicle, LipC6, the T cells, or immunization alone. LipC6 injection
      also reduced numbers of TAMs and their production of ROS. LipC6 induced TAMs to
      differentiate into an M1 phenotype, which reduced immune suppression and
      increased activity of CD8(+) T cells. These results were validated by experiments
      with bone marrow-derived macrophages induced by GMCSF or MCSF. CONCLUSIONS: In
      mice with liver tumors, injection of LipC6 reduces the number of TAMs and the
      ability of TAMs to suppress the anti-tumor immune response. LipC6 also increases 
      the anti-tumor effects of TAS CD8(+) T cells. LipC6 might therefore increase the 
      efficacy of immune therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography have become routine small
      bowel imaging tests to evaluate patients with established or suspected Crohn's
      disease, but the interpretation and use of these imaging modalities can vary
      widely. A shared understanding of imaging findings, nomenclature, and utilization
      will improve the utility of these imaging techniques to guide treatment options, 
      as well as assess for treatment response and complications. Representatives from 
      the Society of Abdominal Radiology Crohn's Disease-Focused Panel, the Society of 
      Pediatric Radiology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and other
      experts, systematically evaluated evidence for imaging findings associated with
      small bowel Crohn's disease enteric inflammation and established recommendations 
      for the evaluation, interpretation, and use of computed tomography and magnetic
      resonance enterography in small bowel Crohn's disease. This work makes
      recommendations for imaging findings that indicate small bowel Crohn's disease,
      how inflammatory small bowel Crohn's disease and its complications should be
      described, elucidates potential extra-enteric findings that may be seen at
      imaging, and recommends that cross-sectional enterography should be performed at 
      diagnosis of Crohn's disease and considered for small bowel Crohn's disease
      monitoring paradigms. A useful morphologic construct describing how imaging
      findings evolve with disease progression and response is described, and standard 
      impressions for radiologic reports that convey meaningful information to
      gastroenterologists and surgeons are presented.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is accompanied by a fibrotic reaction that alters interactions 
      between tumor cells and the stroma to promote tumor progression. Consequently,
      strategies to target the tumor stroma might be used to treat patients with
      pancreatic cancer. We review recently developed approaches for reshaping the
      pancreatic tumor stroma and discuss how these might improve patient outcomes. We 
      also describe relationships between the pancreatic tumor extracellular matrix,
      the vasculature, the immune system, and metabolism, and discuss the implications 
      for the development of stromal compartment-specific therapies.

TI  - Neuromodulators for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (Disorders of Gut-Brain
      Interaction): A Rome Foundation Working Team Report.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Central neuromodulators (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and 
      other central nervous system-targeted medications) are increasingly used for
      treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), now recognized as
      disorders of gut-brain interaction. However, the available evidence and guidance 
      for the use of central neuromodulators in these conditions is scanty and
      incomplete. In this Rome Foundation Working Team report, a multidisciplinary team
      summarized available research evidence and clinical experience to provide
      guidance and treatment recommendations. METHODS: The working team summarized the 
      literature on the pharmacology of central neuromodulators and their effects on
      gastrointestinal sensorimotor function and conducted an evidence-based review on 
      their use for treating FGID syndromes. Because of the paucity of data for FGIDs, 
      we included data for non-gastrointestinal painful disorders and specific symptoms
      of pain, nausea, and vomiting. This information was combined into a final
      document comprising a synthesis of available evidence and recommendations for
      clinical use guided by the research and clinical experience of the experts on the
      committee. RESULTS: The evidence-based review on neuromodulators in FGID,
      restricted by the limited available controlled trials, was integrated with
      open-label studies and case series, along with the experience of experts to
      create recommendations using a consensus (Delphi) approach. Due to the diversity 
      of conditions and complexity of treatment options, specific recommendations were 
      generated for different FGIDs. However, some general recommendations include: (1)
      low to modest dosages of tricyclic antidepressants provide the most convincing
      evidence of benefit for treating chronic gastrointestinal pain and painful FGIDs 
      and serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors can also be recommended, though
      further studies are needed; (2) augmentation, that is, adding a second treatment 
      (adding quetiapine, aripiprazole, buspirone alpha2delta ligand agents) is
      recommended when a single medication is unsuccessful or produces side effects at 
      higher dosages; (3) treatment should be continued for 6-12 months to potentially 
      prevent relapse; and (4) implementation of successful treatment requires
      effective communication skills to improve patient acceptance and adherence, and
      to optimize the patient-provider relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Based on systematic
      and selectively focused review and the consensus of a multidisciplinary panel, we
      have provided summary information and guidelines for the use of central
      neuromodulators in the treatment of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and FGIDs. 
      Further studies are needed to confirm and refine these recommendations.

AB  - Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) develops in patients with
      chronic atrophic gastritis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori; it might be
      a precursor to intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenocarcinoma. Lineage tracing 
      experiments of the gastric corpus in mice have not established whether SPEM
      derives from proliferating stem cells or differentiated, post-mitotic zymogenic
      chief cells in the gland base. We investigated whether differentiated cells can
      give rise to SPEM using a nongenetic approach in mice. Mice were given
      intraperitoneal injections of 5-fluorouracil, which blocked gastric cell
      proliferation, plus tamoxifen to induce SPEM. Based on analyses of molecular and 
      histologic markers, we found SPEM developed even in the absence of cell
      proliferation. SPEM therefore did not arise from stem cells. In histologic
      analyses of gastric resection specimens from 10 patients with adenocarcinoma, we 
      found normal zymogenic chief cells that were transitioning into SPEM cells only
      in gland bases, rather than the proliferative stem cell zone. Our findings
      indicate that SPEM can arise by direct reprogramming of existing cells-mainly of 
      chief cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T-regulatory (Treg) cells control
      immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis. However, under inflammatory
      conditions, Treg cells produce cytokines that promote inflammation. We
      investigated production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by Treg cells in patients 
      with acute hepatitis A (AHA), and examined the characteristics of these cells and
      association with clinical factors. METHODS: We analyzed blood samples collected
      from 63 patients with AHA at the time of hospitalization (and some at later time 
      points) and 19 healthy donors in South Korea. Liver tissues were collected from
      patients with fulminant AHA during liver transplantation. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood and lymphocytes were isolated
      from liver tissues and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine production from Treg 
      cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)) was measured by immunofluorescence levels following
      stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Epigenetic stability of Treg cells was
      determined based on DNA methylation patterns. Phenotypes of Treg cells were
      analyzed by flow cytometry and an RORgammat inhibitor, ML-209, was used to
      inhibit TNF production. Treg cell suppression assay was performed by co-culture
      of Treg-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells s and isolated Treg cells.
      RESULTS: A higher proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells from patients
      with AHA compared with controls produced TNF upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and
      anti-CD28 (11.2% vs 2.8%). DNA methylation analysis confirmed the identity of the
      Treg cells. TNF-producing Treg cells had features of T-helper 17 cells, including
      up-regulation of RORgammat, which was required for TNF production. The Treg cells
      had reduced suppressive functions compared with Treg cells from controls. The
      frequency of TNF-producing Treg cells in AHA patients' blood correlated with
      their serum level of alanine aminotransferase. CONCLUSIONS: Treg cells from
      patients with AHA have altered functions compared with Treg cells from healthy
      individuals. Treg cells from patients with AHA produce higher levels of TNF, gain
      features of T-helper 17 cells, and have reduced suppressive activity. The
      presence of these cells is associated with severe liver injury in patients with
      AHA.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) increase risk for colorectal
      cancer. Mutations in the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV or pyrin) are associated 
      with hereditary autoinflammatory disease and severe IBD. Expression of MEFV, a
      sensor protein that the initiates assembly of the inflammasome complex, is
      increased in colon biopsies from patients with IBD. We investigated the role of
      pyrin in intestinal homeostasis in mice. METHODS: Mefv(-/-) mice and C57/BL6 mice
      (controls) were given azoxymethane followed by multiple rounds of dextran sodium 
      sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis and tumorigenesis. In some experiments, Mefv(-/-)
      mice were given injections of recombinant interleukin 18 (rIL18) or saline
      (control) during DSS administration. Colon tissues were collected at different
      time points during colitis development and analyzed by histology,
      immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, or ELISAs (to measure cytokines). Spleen and
      mesenteric lymph node were collected, processed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. 
      Colon epithelial permeability was measured in mice with colitis by gavage of
      fluorescent dextran and quantification of serum levels. RESULTS: MEFV was
      expressed in colons of control mice and expression increased during chronic and
      acute inflammation; high levels were detected in colon tumor and adjacent
      non-tumor tissues. Mefv-/- mice developed more severe colitis than control mice, 
      with a greater extent of epithelial hyperplasia and a larger tumor burden. Levels
      of inflammatory cytokines (IL6) and chemokines were significantly higher in
      colons of Mefv-/- mice than control mice following colitis induction, whereas the
      level IL18, which depends on the inflammasome for maturation and release, was
      significantly lower in colons of Mefv-/- mice. Mefv-/- mice had increased
      epithelial permeability following administration of DSS than control mice, and
      loss of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-2 from intercellular
      junctions. STAT3 was activated (phosphorylated) in inflamed colon tissues from
      Mefv-/-, which also had increased expression of stem cell markers (OLFM4, BMI1,
      and MSI1) compared with colons from control mice. Administration of rIL18 to
      Mefv-/- mice reduced epithelial permeability, intestinal inflammation, the
      severity of colitis, and colon tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: In studies with
      DSS-induced colitis, we found that pyrin (MEFV) is required for inflammasome
      activation and IL18 maturation, which promote intestinal barrier integrity and
      prevent colon inflammation and tumorigenesis. Strategies to increase activity of 
      MEFV or IL18 might be developed for the treatment of IBD and prevention of
      colitis-associated tumorigenesis.

TI  - A MicroRNA Signature Associated With Metastasis of T1 Colorectal Cancers to Lymph
      Nodes.

AB  - Most T1 colorectal cancers treated by radical surgery can now be cured by
      endoscopic submucosal dissection. Although 70%-80% of T1 colorectal cancers are
      classified as high risk, <16% of these patients actually have lymph node
      metastases. Biomarkers are needed to identify patients with T1 cancers with the
      highest risk of metastasis, to prevent unnecessary radical surgery. We collected 
      data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified 5 microRNAs (MIR32, MIR181B,
      MIR193B, MIR195, and MIR411) with significant changes in expression in T1 and T2 
      colorectal cancers with vs without lymph node metastases. Levels of the 5
      microRNAs identified patients with lymph node invasion by T1 or T2 cancers with
      an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value of 0.84. 
      We validated these findings in 2 cohorts of patients with T1 cancers, using
      findings from histology as the reference. The 5-microRNA signature identified T1 
      cancers with lymph node invasion in cohort 1 with an AUROC value of 0.83, and in 
      cohort 2 with an AUROC value of 0.74. When we analyzed biopsy samples from
      untreated patients, the 5-microRNA signature identified cancers with lymph node
      metastases with an AUROC value of 0.77. The 5-microRNA therefore identifies
      high-risk T1 colorectal cancers with a greater degree of accuracy than currently 
      used pathologic features.

TI  - Interactions Between Diet and the Intestinal Microbiota Alter Intestinal
      Permeability and Colitis Severity in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear how the complex interactions between diet and 
      the intestinal microbiota affect development of mucosal inflammation or
      inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated interactions between dietary
      ingredients, nutrients, and the microbiota in specific pathogen-free (SPF) and
      germ-free (GF) mice given more than 40 unique diets; we quantified individual and
      synergistic effects of dietary macronutrients and the microbiota on intestinal
      health and development of colitis. METHODS: C56BL/6J SPF and GF mice were placed 
      on custom diets containing different concentrations and sources of protein, fat, 
      digestible carbohydrates, and indigestible carbohydrates (fiber). After 1 week,
      SPF and GF mice were given dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis.
      Disease severity was determined based on the percent weight change from baseline,
      and modeled as a function of the concentration of each macronutrient in the diet.
      In unchallenged mice, we measured intestinal permeability by feeding mice labeled
      dextran and measuring levels in blood. Feces were collected and microbiota were
      analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. We collected colons from mice and performed
      transcriptome analyses. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota varied with diet; the
      concentration of protein and fiber had the strongest effect on colitis
      development. Among 9 fiber sources tested, psyllium, pectin, and cellulose fiber 
      reduced the severity of colitis in SPF mice, whereas methylcellulose increased
      severity. Increasing dietary protein increased the density of the fecal
      microbiota and the severity of colitis in SPF mice, but not in GF mice or mice
      given antibiotics. Psyllium fiber reduced the severity of colitis through
      microbiota-dependent and microbiota-independent mechanisms. Combinatorial
      perturbations to dietary casein protein and psyllium fiber in parallel accounted 
      for most variation in gut microbial density and intestinal permeability in
      unchallenged mice, as well as the severity of DSS-induced colitis; changes in 1
      ingredient could be offset by changes in another. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 
      the effects of different dietary components and the gut microbiota on mice with
      and without DSS-induced colitis, we found complex mixtures of nutrients affect
      intestinal permeability, gut microbial density, and development of intestinal
      inflammation.

      healing in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We performed a randomized
      controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of IN in patients with
      UC. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, double-blind trial evaluating the safety
      of 86 patients in Japan with active UC (Mayo scores of 6 or more), enrolled from 
      March 30 through December 27, 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to groups and
      given a daily dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g IN or placebo (1:1:1:1 ratio) for 8
      weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of clinical response at week 8, defined 
      as a 3-point decrease in the Mayo score and a decrease of at least 30% from
      baseline, with a decrease of at least 1 point for the rectal bleeding subscore or
      absolute rectal bleeding score of 0-1. The main secondary endpoint was the rate
      of clinical remission at week 8, defined as a Mayo score or </=2 and no subscores
      with a value >1. Mucosal healing was also assessed at week 8. RESULTS: The trial 
      was terminated because of an external reason: a report of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension in a patient who used self-purchased IN for 6 months. In the
      intent-to-treat analysis, we observed a significant, dose-dependent linear trend 
      in proportions of patients with clinical responses (13.6% with a clinical
      response to placebo; 69.6% to 0.5 g IN; 75.0% to 1.0 g IN; and 81.0% to 2.0 g IN)
      (Cochran-Armitage trend test P < .0001 compared with placebo). Proportions of
      patients in clinical remission at week 8 were significantly higher in the 1.0 g
      IN group (55.0%, P = .0004) and the 2.0 g IN group (38.1%, (P = .0093) than in
      the placebo group (4.5%). Proportions of patients with mucosal healing were 13.6%
      in the placebo group, 56.5% in the 0.5 g IN group, 60.0% in the 1.0 g IN group,
      and 47.6% in the 2.0 g IN group (P = .0278 compared with placebo). Although mild 
      liver dysfunction was observed in 10 patients who received IN, no serious adverse
      events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we 
      found 8 weeks of IN (0.5-2.0 g per day) to be effective in inducing a clinical
      response in patients with UC. However, IN should not yet be used because of the
      potential for adverse effects, including pulmonary arterial hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recommendations for surveillance after curative surgery for
      colorectal cancer (CRC) include a 1-year post-resection abdominal-pelvic computed
      tomography (CT) scan and optical colonoscopy (OC). CT colonography (CTC), when
      used in CRC screening, effectively identifies colorectal polyps >/=10 mm and
      cancers. We performed a prospective study to determine whether CTC, concurrent
      with CT, could substitute for OC in CRC surveillance. METHODS: Our study enrolled
      231 patients with resected stage 0-III CRC, identified at 5 tertiary care
      academic centers. Approximately 1 year after surgery, participants underwent
      outpatient CTC plus CT, followed by same-day OC. CTC results were revealed after 
      endoscopic visualization of sequential colonic segments, which were re-examined
      for discordant findings. The primary outcome was performance of CTC in the
      detection of colorectal adenomas and cancers using endoscopy as the reference
      standard. RESULTS: Of the 231 participants, 116 (50.2%) had polyps of any size or
      histology identified by OC, and 15.6% had conventional adenomas and/or serrated
      polyps >/=6 mm. No intra-luminal cancers were detected. CTC detected patients
      with polyps of >/=6 mm with 44.0% sensitivity (95% CI, 30.2-57.8) and 93.4%
      specificity (95% CI, 89.7-97.0). CTC detected polyps >/=10 mm with 76.9%
      sensitivity (95% CI, 54.0-99.8) and 89.0% specificity (95% CI, 84.8-93.1).
      Similar values were found when only adenomatous polyps were considered. The
      negative predictive value of CTC for adenomas >/=6 mm was 90.7% (95% CI,
      86.7-94.5) and for adenomas >/=10 mm the negative predictive value was 98.6% (95%
      CI, 97.0-100). CONCLUSIONS: In a CRC surveillance population 1 year following
      resection, CTC was inferior to OC for detecting patients with polyps >/=6 mm.

TI  - Factors Associated With Response to Teduglutide in Patients With Short-Bowel
      Syndrome and Intestinal Failure.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.11.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clinical studies showed teduglutide to increase urine
      production and reduce need for parenteral support volume in patients with short
      bowel syndrome (SBS) with intestinal failure, increasing intestinal wet weight
      absorption and reducing diarrhea. However, the effects of teduglutide on
      parenteral support vary among patients. We performed a post hoc analysis of a
      phase III placebo-controlled study to identify characteristics of patients in
      whom teduglutide has the largest effects on parenteral support volume response.
      METHODS: We collected data from 85 patients with SBS with intestinal failure,
      according to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism
      classification system, who received teduglutide or placebo between November 25,
      2008, and January 4, 2011, at 27 sites in 10 countries. Changes in parenteral
      support volume were evaluated according to baseline parenteral support volume,
      bowel anatomy (group 1, jejunostomy/ileostomy; group 2, >/=50%
      colon-in-continuity without stoma; and group 3, other colon anatomies), and
      disease features (with inflammatory bowel disease, mesenteric vascular diseases, 
      or other conditions). Correlation analyses were conducted using simple linear
      regression models, with unadjusted r(2) values reported. Two-sided t tests were
      used for comparisons between treatment groups. RESULTS: We correlated parenteral 
      support volume reduction with teduglutide treatment and baseline parenteral
      support volume (y = -0.3870x + 90.0279, r(2) = 0.61; P < .0001). The effects of
      teduglutide on absolute parenteral support volume were significantly greater in
      group 1 patients (reduction of 919 +/- 644 mL/d), not only compared with patients
      given placebo (reduction of 340 +/- 436 mL/d; P = .0112) but also compared with
      teduglutide-treated patients in group 2 (reduction of 355 +/- 306 mL/d; P =
      .0066). Teduglutide had an intermediate effect on patients in group 3. A minority
      of patients with SBS and inflammatory bowel diseases had colon-in-continuity
      (10.5% [n = 2/19]), whereas most patients with SBS and vascular or other diseases
      had colon-in-continuity (84.4% [n = 27/32] and 67.6% [n = 23/34], respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a post hoc analysis of data from a phase III study of the effects
      of teduglutide on patients with SBS, we associated reduced parenteral support
      volume with baseline parenteral support volume, bowel anatomy, and SBS features. 
      These findings may inform initial parenteral support volume adjustments and
      management of these severely disabled patients. ClinicalTrials.gov no:

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been reports of reactivation of hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) infection during treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with
      direct-acting antiviral agents. We performed a prospective study of risks and
      outcomes of HCV infection treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in patients
      with HBV infection. METHODS: We performed a phase 3b, multicenter, open-label
      study in Taiwan of 111 patients with HCV infection (61% HCV genotype 1, 39% HCV
      genotype 2 infection; 62% women, 16% with compensated cirrhosis) along with HBV
      infection. All but 1 were positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 1
      patient who was HBsAg-positive at screening was found to be HBsAg-negative at
      baseline. Overall, 33% of participants had received prior treatment for HCV and
      5% had previously been treated for HBV; no patient was on HBV therapy at the
      start of the study. All patients received a fixed-dose combination of 90 mg of
      the HCV NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir with 400 mg of the NS5B nucleotide analogue
      inhibitor sofosbuvir, once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained
      virologic response 12 weeks after the end of therapy. RESULTS: All 111 patients
      (100%) achieved a sustained virologic response. Of the 37 patients with baseline 
      HBV DNA below 20 IU/mL, 31 (84%) had at least 1 episode of quantifiable HBV DNA
      through posttreatment week 12. Of the 74 patients with baseline HBV DNA levels of
      20 IU/mL or more, 39 (53%) had increases of HBV DNA greater than 1 log10 IU/mL
      through posttreatment week 12. Overall, 5 patients had increased levels of HBV
      DNA concomitant with a level of alanine aminotransferase >2 times the upper limit
      of normal through posttreatment week 12. Of these, 3 patients started HBV
      treatment. In addition, 1 patient with HBV reactivation since week 8 and
      concomitant alanine aminotransferase elevation >2 times upper limit of normal at 
      posttreatment week 48 started treatment at posttreatment week 53. This patient
      had clinical signs and symptoms associated with HBV reactivation. The most common
      adverse events were headache, upper respiratory infection, and fatigue.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study, the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir
      for 12 weeks produced a sustained virologic response in 100% of patients with HCV
      infection who were coinfected with HBV. Most patients had an increase in level of
      HBV DNA not associated with signs or symptoms. ClinicalTrials.gov no:

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by
      cholestasis, ocular abnormalities, characteristic facial features, heart defects,
      and vertebral malformations. Most cases are associated with mutations in JAGGED1 
      (JAG1), which encodes a Notch ligand, although it is not clear how these
      contribute to disease development. We aimed to develop a mouse model of Alagille 
      syndrome to elucidate these mechanisms. METHODS: Mice with a missense mutation
      (H268Q) in Jag1 (Jag1(+/Ndr) mice) were outbred to a C3H/C57bl6 background to
      generate a mouse model for Alagille syndrome (Jag1(Ndr/Ndr) mice). Liver tissues 
      were collected at different timepoints during development, analyzed by histology,
      and liver organoids were cultured and analyzed. We performed transcriptome
      analysis of Jag1(Ndr/Ndr) livers and livers from patients with Alagille syndrome,
      cross-referenced to the Human Protein Atlas, to identify commonly dysregulated
      pathways and biliary markers. We used species-specific transcriptome separation
      and ligand-receptor interaction assays to measure Notch signaling and the ability
      of JAG1(Ndr) to bind or activate Notch receptors. We studied signaling of JAG1
      and JAG1(Ndr) via NOTCH 1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3 and resulting gene expression
      patterns in parental and NOTCH1-expressing C2C12 cell lines. RESULTS:
      Jag1(Ndr/Ndr) mice had many features of Alagille syndrome, including eye, heart, 
      and liver defects. Bile duct differentiation, morphogenesis, and function were
      dysregulated in newborn Jag1(Ndr/Ndr) mice, with aberrations in cholangiocyte
      polarity, but these defects improved in adult mice. Jag1(Ndr/Ndr) liver organoids
      collapsed in culture, indicating structural instability. Whole-transcriptome
      sequence analyses of liver tissues from mice and patients with Alagille syndrome 
      identified dysregulated genes encoding proteins enriched at the apical side of
      cholangiocytes, including CFTR and SLC5A1, as well as reduced expression of IGF1.
      Exposure of Notch-expressing cells to JAG1(Ndr), compared with JAG1, led to
      hypomorphic Notch signaling, based on transcriptome analysis. JAG1-expressing
      cells, but not JAG1(Ndr)-expressing cells, bound soluble Notch1 extracellular
      domain, quantified by flow cytometry. However, JAG1 and JAG1(Ndr) cells each
      bound NOTCH2, and signaling from NOTCH2 signaling was reduced but not completely 
      inhibited, in response to JAG1(Ndr) compared with JAG1. CONCLUSIONS: In mice,
      expression of a missense mutant of Jag1 (Jag1(Ndr)) disrupts bile duct
      development and recapitulates Alagille syndrome phenotypes in heart, eye, and
      craniofacial dysmorphology. JAG1(Ndr) does not bind NOTCH1, but binds NOTCH2, and
      elicits hypomorphic signaling. This mouse model can be used to study other
      features of Alagille syndrome and organ development.

      Score Predicts Survival of Patients With Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) have a high risk
      of death within 90 days. Corticosteroids, which can cause severe adverse events, 
      are the only treatment that increases short-term survival. It is a challenge to
      predict outcomes of patients with severe AH. Therefore, we developed a scoring
      system to predict patient survival, integrating baseline molecular and clinical
      variables. METHODS: We obtained fixed liver biopsy samples from 71 consecutive
      patients diagnosed with severe AH and treated with corticosteroids from July 2006
      through December 2013 in Brussels, Belgium (derivation cohort). Gene expression
      patterns were analyzed by microarrays and clinical data were collected for 180
      days. We identified gene expression signatures and clinical data that are
      associated with survival without liver transplantation at 90 and 180 days after
      initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Findings were validated using liver
      biopsies from 48 consecutive patients with severe AH treated with
      corticosteroids, collected from March 2010 through February 2015 at hospitals in 
      Belgium and Switzerland (validation cohort 1) and in liver biopsies from 20
      patients (9 received corticosteroid treatment), collected from January 2012
      through May 2015 in the United States (validation cohort 2). RESULTS: We
      integrated data on expression patterns of 123 genes and the model for end-stage
      liver disease (MELD) scores to assign patients to groups with poor survival (29% 
      survived 90 days and 26% survived 180 days) and good survival (76% survived 90
      days and 65% survived 180 days) (P < .001) in the derivation cohort. We named
      this assignment system the gene signature-MELD (gs-MELD) score. In validation
      cohort 1, the gs-MELD score discriminated patients with poor survival (43%
      survived 90 days) from those with good survival (96% survived 90 days) (P <
      .001). The gs-MELD score also discriminated between patients with a poor survival
      at 180 days (34% survived) and a good survival at 180 days (84% survived) (P <
      .001). The time-dependent area under the receiver operator characteristic curve
      for the score was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.99) for survival at 90
      days, and 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.96) for survival at 180 days. This
      score outperformed other clinical models to predict survival of patients with
      severe AH in validation cohort 1. In validation cohort 2, the gs-MELD
      discriminated patients with a poor survival at 90 days (12% survived) from those 
      with a good survival at 90 days (100%) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We integrated
      data on baseline liver gene expression pattern and the MELD score to create the
      gs-MELD scoring system, which identifies patients with severe AH, treated or not 
      with corticosteroids, most and least likely to survive for 90 and 180 days.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Few studies have examined the association between coffee
      intake and survival after diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a
      prospective study to investigate the association between coffee intake after a
      diagnosis of CRC and mortality. METHODS: We collected data from the Nurses'
      Health Study (1984-2012) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2012),
      following 1599 patients diagnosed with stage 1, 2, or 3 CRC. CRC was reported on 
      questionnaires and ascertained by review of medical records and pathology
      reports; intake of food and beverages was determined from responses to
      semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires. Participants were asked how
      often during the previous year that they consumed coffee, with 1 cup as the
      standard portion size. The first questionnaire response collected at least 6
      months but not more than 4 years after diagnosis was used for assessment of
      post-diagnostic intake (median time from diagnosis to the dietary assessment, 2.2
      years). The last semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire prior to
      diagnosis was used to assess pre-diagnostic dietary intake. RESULTS: During a
      median of 7.8 years of follow-up, we documented 803 deaths, of which 188 were
      because of CRC. In the multivariable adjusted models, compared with nondrinkers, 
      patients who consumed at least 4 cups of coffee per day had a 52% lower risk of
      CRC-specific death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.83; P for trend=.003) 
      and 30% reduced risk of all-cause death (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.91; P for trend
      <.001). High intake of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee (2 or more cups/day) 
      was associated with lower risk of CRC-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.
      When coffee intake before vs after CRC diagnosis were examined, compared with
      patients consistently consuming low amounts (less than 2 cups/day), those who
      maintained a high intake (2 or more cups/day) had a significantly lower risk of
      CRC-specific death (multivariable HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44-0.89) and death from any
      cause (multivariable HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis
      data from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we
      associated intake of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee after diagnosis of CRC 
      with lower risk of CRC-specific death and overall death. Studies are needed to
      determine the mechanisms by which coffee might reduce CRC progression.

AB  - Microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is
      detected in a small proportion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). dMMR
      and MSI have been associated with responses of metastatic tumors, including
      PDACs, to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We performed immunohistochemical
      analyses of a 445 PDAC specimens, collected from consecutive patients at multiple
      centers, to identify those with dMMR, based on loss of mismatch repair proteins
      MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and/or PMS2. We detected dMMR in 1.6% of tumor samples; we
      found dMMR in a larger proportion of intraductal papillary mucinous
      neoplasms-related tumors (4/58, 6.9%) than non- intraductal papillary mucinous
      neoplasms PDAC (5/385, 1.3%) (P = .02). PDACs with dMMR contained potentially
      immunogenic mutations because of MSI in coding repeat sequences. PDACs with dMMR 
      or MSI had a higher density of CD8+ T cells at the invasive front than PDACs
      without dMMR or MSI (P = .08; Fisher exact test). A higher proportion of PDACs
      with dMMR or MSI expressed the CD274 molecule (PD-L1, 8/9) than PDACs without
      dMMR or MSI (4/10) (P = .05). Times of disease-free survival and overall survival
      did not differ significantly between patients with PDACs with dMMR or MSI vs
      without dMMR or MSI. Studies are needed to determine whether these features of
      PDACs with dMMR or MSI might serve as prognostic factors.

      Neuroendocrine Tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Survival times vary among patients with neuroendocrine tumors 
      (NETs) - even among those with the same site, stage, and grade of primary tumor. 
      This makes it difficult to select treatment for patients with unresectable NETs
      because some patients can survive decades without treatment. (68)Gallium-DOTATATE
      positron emission tomography with computed tomography ((68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT) is
      a sensitive imaging technique for detection of NETs. We investigated the
      prognostic accuracy of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT-based analysis of tumor volume in
      patients with NETs. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 184 patients
      with NETs (128 [69.6%] with metastases and 11 patients [6.0%] with locally
      advanced disease) at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda,
      MD) from 2013 through 2017. All patients underwent (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT image
      analysis and total (68)Ga-DOTATATE-Avid tumor volume ((68)Ga-DOTATATE TV) was
      determined. We also measured fasting serum chromogranin A, neuron-specific
      enolase, gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, pancreatic
      polypeptide, and 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in all
      patients. Disease progression was defined as a new lesion or a growth of a known 
      lesion during the interval between baseline (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan and
      follow-up imaging (14.0 +/- 6.1 months; range, 1-35 months). The primary outcomes
      were progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific mortality during a
      median follow-up time of 18 months (range, 4-35 months). RESULTS: We found an
      inverse correlation between quartiles of (68)Ga-DOTATATE TV and PFS (P = .001)
      and disease-specific survival (P = .002). A (68)Ga-DOTATATE TV of 7.0 mL or more 
      was associated with higher odds of disease progression (hazard ratio, 3.0; P =
      .04). A (68)Ga-DOTATATE TV of 35.8 mL or more was associated with increased risk 
      of disease-specific death (hazard ratio, 10.6) in multivariable analysis (P =
      .01), as well as in subgroup analysis of patients with pancreatic NETs.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study, we demonstrated the prognostic utility of
      (68)Ga-DOTATATE TV in a large cohort of patients with NETs, in terms of PFS and
      disease-specific mortality.

      With Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies reported that black vs white disparities in
      survival among elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were because of
      differences in tumor characteristics (tumor stage, grade, nodal status, and
      comorbidity) rather than differences in treatment. We sought to determine the
      contribution of differences in insurance, comorbidities, tumor characteristics,
      and treatment receipt to disparities in black vs white patients with CRC 18-64
      years old. METHODS: We used data from the National Cancer Database, a
      hospital-based cancer registry database sponsored by the American College of
      Surgeons and the American Cancer Society, on non-Hispanic black (black) and
      non-Hispanic white (white) patients, 18-64 years old, diagnosed from 2004 through
      2012 with single or first primary invasive stage I-IV CRC. Each black patient was
      matched, based on demographic, insurance, comorbidity, tumor, and treatment
      features, with 5 white patients, from partially overlapping subgroups, using
      propensity score and greedy matching algorithms. We used the Kaplan-Meier method 
      to estimate 5-year survival and Cox proportional hazards models to generate
      hazard ratios. RESULTS: The absolute 5-year survival difference between black and
      white unmatched patients with CRC was 9.2% (57.3% for black patients vs 66.5% for
      white patients; P < .0001). The absolute difference in survival did not change
      after patient groups were matched for demographics, but decreased to 4.9% (47%
      relative decrease [4.3% of 9.2%]) when they were matched for insurance and to
      2.3% when they were matched for tumor characteristics (26% relative decrease
      [2.4% of 9.2%]). Further matching by treatment did not reduce the difference in
      5-year survival between black and white patients. In proportional hazards model, 
      insurance and tumor characteristics matching accounted for the 54% and 27% excess
      risk of death in black patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of
      data from the National Cancer Database, we found that insurance coverage
      differences accounted for approximately one half of the disparity in survival
      rate of black vs white patients with CRC, 18-64 years old; tumor characteristics 
      accounted for a quarter of the disparity. Affordable health insurance coverage
      for all populations could substantially reduce differences in survival times of
      black vs white patients with CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in individuals
      younger than 50 years is increasing. We sought to ascertain the proportion of
      young CRC cases associated with genetic predisposition. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective study of individuals diagnosed with CRC at an age younger than 50
      years, evaluated by the clinical genetics service at a single tertiary care
      cancer center from 1998 through 2015. We collected data on patient histories,
      tumor phenotypes, and results of germline DNA sequencing. For subjects with
      uninformative clinical evaluations, germline DNA samples were (re)sequenced using
      a research-based next-generation sequencing multigene panel. The primary outcome 
      was identification of a pathogenic germline mutation associated with cancer
      predisposition. RESULTS: Of 430 young CRC cases, 111 (26%) had a first-degree
      relative with CRC. Forty-one of the subjects with CRC (10%) had tumors with
      histologic evidence for mismatch repair deficiency. Of 315 subjects who underwent
      clinical germline sequencing, 79 had mutations associated with a hereditary
      cancer syndrome and 21 had variants of uncertain significance. Fifty-six subjects
      had pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome (25 with mutations in
      MSH2, 24 with mutations in MLH1, 5 with mutations in MSH6, and 2 with mutations
      in PMS2) and 10 subjects had pathogenic variants associated with familial
      adenomatous polyposis. Thirteen subjects had mutations in other cancer-associated
      genes (8 in MUTYH, 2 in SMAD4, 1 in BRCA1, 1 in TP53, and 1 in CHEK2), all
      identified through multigene panel tests. Among 117 patients with uninformative
      clinical evaluations, next-generation sequence analysis using a multigene panel
      detected actionable germline variants in 6 patients (5%). Only 43 of the 85
      subjects with germline mutations associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome
      (51%) reported a CRC diagnosis in a first-degree relative. CONCLUSIONS:
      Approximately 1 in 5 individuals diagnosed with CRC at age younger than 50 years 
      carries a germline mutation associated with cancer; nearly half of these do not
      have clinical histories typically associated with the identified syndrome.
      Germline testing with multigene cancer panels should be considered for all young 
      patients with CRC.

TI  - HLA-DQ-Gluten Tetramer Blood Test Accurately Identifies Patients With and Without
      Celiac Disease in Absence of Gluten Consumption.
PG  - 886-896.e6
LID - S0016-5085(17)36352-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.11.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is characterized by HLA-DQ2/8-restricted
      responses of CD4+ T cells to cereal gluten proteins. A diagnosis of celiac
      disease based on serologic and histologic evidence requires patients to be on
      gluten-containing diets. The growing number of individuals adhering to a
      gluten-free diet (GFD) without exclusion of celiac disease complicates its
      detection. HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers can be used to detect gluten-specific T cells 
      in blood of patients with celiac disease, even if they are on a GFD. We
      investigated whether an HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay accurately identifies 
      patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We produced HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers and
      added them to peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 143 HLA-DQ2.5(+)
      subjects (62 subjects with celiac disease on a GFD, 19 subjects without celiac
      disease on a GFD [due to self-reported gluten sensitivity], 10 subjects with
      celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet, and 52 presumed healthy individuals
      [controls]). T cells that bound HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers were quantified by flow
      cytometry. Laboratory tests and flow cytometry gating analyses were performed by 
      researchers blinded to sample type, except for samples from subjects with celiac 
      disease on a gluten-containing diet. Test precision analyses were performed using
      samples from 10 subjects. RESULTS: For the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay, we
      combined flow-cytometry variables in a multiple regression model that identified 
      individuals with celiac disease on a GFD with an area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]
      0.89-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The assay detected
      individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet vs controls with an
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.95 (95% CI
      0.90-1.00). Optimized cutoff values identified subjects with celiac disease on a 
      GFD with 97% sensitivity (95% CI 0.92-1.00) and 95% specificity (95% CI
      0.84-1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The values identified
      subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet with 100% sensitivity
      (95% CI 1.00-1.00]) and 90% specificity (95% CI 0.83-0.98) vs controls. In an
      analysis of 4 controls with positive results from the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer
      test, 2 had unrecognized celiac disease and the remaining 2 had T cells that
      proliferated in response to gluten antigen in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: An
      HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assays that detects gluten-reactive T cells
      identifies patients with and without celiac disease with a high level of
      accuracy, regardless of whether the individuals are on a GFD. This test would
      allow individuals with suspected celiac disease to avoid gluten challenge and
      duodenal biopsy, but requires validation in a larger study. Clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about substitutions that mediate resistance of
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), due to the small
      number of patients with treatment failure in approval studies. It is important to
      identify resistance patterns to select effective salvage treatments. METHODS: We 
      performed a comprehensive analysis for resistance-associated substitutions (RASs)
      in HCV genes (nonstructural protein [NS]3, NS5A, NS5B) targeted by DAAs. We
      compared NS3, NS5A, and NS5B sequences from 626 patients in Europe with DAA
      failure with sequences from 2322 DAA-naive patients, infected with HCV genotypes 
      1 to 4. We considered RASs to be relevant if they were associated with DAA
      failure in patients or conferred a greater than twofold change in susceptibility 
      compared with a reference strain in in vitro replicon assays. Data were collected
      on pretreatment status, DAA regimen, the treatment initiation date and duration, 
      and virologic response. Patients who received at least 4 weeks of antiviral
      treatment were included in the analysis. RESULTS: RASs in NS3 associated with
      simeprevir or paritaprevir failure include R155K and D168E/V. In addition,
      several RASs were specifically associated with failure of simeprevir (Q80K/R in
      patients with genotype 1a or 4) or paritaprevir (Y56H in combination with D168V
      in patients with genotype 1b). Y93H in NS5A was the RAS most frequently
      associated with failure of daclatasvir, ledipasvir, or ombitasvir in patients
      with genotype 1b infection, and L31M was associated with failure of daclatasvir
      or ledipasvir, but not ombitasvir. RASs in NS5A were heterogeneous among patients
      with HCV genotype 1a or genotype 4 infections. In patients with HCV genotype 3,
      Y93H was associated with resistance to daclatasvir, but no RASs were associated
      with ledipasvir failure, pointing to a limited efficacy of ledipasvir in patients
      with genotype 3. Among patients failed by sofosbuvir-containing regimens, L159F
      was enriched in patients with genotype 1b (together with C316N) or genotype 3
      infection, whereas the RAS S282T was rarely observed. CONCLUSIONS: We compared
      RASs in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B among patients failed by DAA therapy. Theses varied
      with the HCV genotype and subtype, and the different drug classes. These findings
      might be used to select salvage therapies.

TI  - Enteric Delivery of Regenerating Family Member 3 alpha Alters the Intestinal
      Microbiota and Controls Inflammation in Mice With Colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Paneth cell dysfunction causes deficiencies in intestinal
      C-type lectins and antimicrobial peptides, which leads to dysbiosis of the
      intestinal microbiota, alters the mucosal barrier, and promotes development of
      inflammatory bowel diseases. We investigated whether transgenic (TG) expression
      of the human regenerating family member 3 alpha gene (REG3A) alters the fecal
      microbiota and affects development of colitis in mice. METHODS: We performed
      studies with C57BL/6 mice that express human regenerating family member 3 alpha
      (hREG3A) in hepatocytes, via the albumin gene promoter. In these mice, hREG3A
      travels via the bile to the intestinal lumen. Some mice were given dextran sodium
      sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Feces were collected from mice and the
      composition of the microbiota was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The
      fecal microbiome was also analyzed from mice that express only 1 copy of human
      REG3A transgene but were fed feces from control mice (not expressing hREG3A) as
      newborns. Mice expressing hREG3A were monitored for DSS-induced colitis after
      cohousing or feeding feces from control mice. Colitis was induced in another set 
      of control and hREG3A-TG mice by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid;
      some mice were given intrarectal injections of the hREG3A protein. Colon tissues 
      were collected from mice and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to
      detect mucin 2, as well as by 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ
      hybridization, transcriptional analyses, and quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction. We measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacterial
      cultures and fecal microbiota using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and flow 
      cytometry. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota of mice that express hREG3A had a
      significant shift in composition, compared with control mice, with enrichment of 
      Clostridiales (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae) and depletion of Bacteroidetes
      (Prevotellaceae); the TG mice developed less-severe colitis following
      administration of DSS than control mice, associated with preserved gut barrier
      integrity and reduced bacterial translocation, epithelial inflammation, and
      oxidative damage. A similar shift in the composition of the fecal microbiota
      occurred after a few months in TG mice heterozygous for REG3A that harbored a
      wild-type maternal microbiota at birth; these mice developed less-severe forms of
      colitis following DSS administration. Cohoused and germ-free mice fed feces from 
      REG3A-TG mice and given DSS developed less-severe forms of colitis and had
      reduced lipopolysaccharide activation of the toll-like receptor 4 and increased
      survival times compared with mice not fed feces from REG3A-TG mice. REG3A TG mice
      developed only mild colonic inflammation after exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene 
      sulfonic acid, compared with control mice. Control mice given intrarectal hREG3A 
      and exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid showed less colon damage and
      inflammation than mice not given intrarectal hREG3A. Fecal samples from REG3A-TG 
      mice had lower levels of ROS than feces from control mice during DSS
      administration. Addition of hREG3A to bacterial cultures reduced levels of ROS
      and increased survival of oxygen-sensitive commensal bacteria (Faecalibacterium
      prausnitzii and Roseburia intestinalis). CONCLUSIONS: Mice with hepatocytes that 
      express hREG3A, which travels to the intestinal lumen, are less sensitive to
      colitis than control mice. We found hREG3A to alter the colonic microbiota by
      decreasing levels of ROS. Fecal microbiota from REG3A-TG mice protect non-TG mice
      from induction of colitis. These findings indicate a role for reduction of
      oxidative stress in preserving the gut microbiota and its ability to prevent
      inflammation.

TI  - Low-Dose Aspirin Use Does Not Increase Survival in 2 Independent Population-Based
      Cohorts of Patients With Esophageal or Gastric Cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Preclinical studies have shown aspirin to have anticancer
      properties and epidemiologic studies have associated aspirin use with longer
      survival times of patients with cancer. We studied 2 large cohorts to determine
      the association between aspirin use and cancer-specific mortality in patients
      with esophageal or gastric cancer. METHODS: We performed a population-based study
      using cohorts of patients newly diagnosed with esophageal or gastric cancer,
      identified from cancer registries in England from 1998 through 2012 and the
      Scottish Cancer Registry from 2009 through 2012. Low-dose aspirin prescriptions
      were identified from linkages to the United Kingdom Clinical Research Practice
      Datalink in England and the Prescribing Information System in Scotland. Deaths
      were identified from linkage to national mortality records, with follow-up until 
      September 2015 in England and January 2015 in Scotland. Time-dependent Cox
      regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific mortality by low-dose aspirin use after
      adjusting for potential confounders. Meta-analysis was used to pool results
      across the 2 cohorts. RESULTS: The combined English and Scottish cohorts
      contained 4654 patients with esophageal cancer and 3833 patients with gastric
      cancer, including 3240 and 2392 cancer-specific deaths, respectively. The
      proportions surviving 1 year, based on cancer-specific mortality, were similar in
      aspirin users vs non-users after diagnosis with esophageal cancer (48% vs 50% in 
      England and 49% vs 46% in Scotland, respectively) or gastric cancer (58% vs 57%
      in England and 59% vs 55% in Scotland, respectively). There was no association
      between postdiagnosis use of low-dose aspirin and cancer-specific mortality among
      patients with esophageal cancer (pooled adjusted HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.09) or 
      gastric cancer (pooled adjusted HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08). Long-term aspirin
      use was not associated with cancer-specific mortality after diagnosis of
      esophageal cancer (pooled adjusted HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.25) or gastric cancer
      (pooled adjusted HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of 2
      large independent cohorts in the United Kingdom, low-dose aspirin usage was not
      associated with increased survival of patients diagnosed with esophageal or
      gastric cancer.

TI  - No Increase in Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Privately Insured Adults
      Prescribed Proton Pump Inhibitors vs Histamine-2 Receptor Antagonists
      (2002-2014).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used medications.
      Recent studies reported an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 
      PPI users vs non-users. We evaluated MI risk associated with PPIs compared with
      histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in privately insured adults in the
      United States. METHODS: Using administrative claims from commercial and Medicare 
      Supplemental plans (2001-2014), we compared risk of MI in patients who started a 
      new prescription for PPIs vs H2RAs. Enrollees were followed from their first
      prescription until MI, medication discontinuation, plan disenrollment, or
      December 31, 2014. MI was defined using hospital diagnosis codes. Risk
      differences (RD), risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated 
      using Kaplan-Meier methods at 3, 12, and 36 months after treatment initiation.
      Standardized morbidity ratio weights were used to control measured confounding.
      Analyses were stratified by plan type (commercial vs Medicare Supplemental).
      RESULTS: We identified more than 5 million new users of prescription PPIs and
      H2RAs. Median follow-up time was 60 days for patients with commercial insurance
      and 96 days in patients with Medicare Supplemental insurance. The 12-month
      weighted risk of MI was low overall (approximately 2 cases per 1000 among
      patients in commercial plans; 8 per 1000 among patients in Medicare Supplemental 
      plans). In the RD analysis, we found no significant differences in MI risk
      between patients who started PPIs vs H2RAs for the first 12 months, either in the
      commercial population (weighted RD per 1000, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.51 to 0.36) or the
      Medicare Supplemental population (weighted RD per 1000, -0.45; 95% CI, -1.53 to
      0.58). CONCLUSION: In an analysis of administrative claims from commercial and
      Medicare Supplemental plans, we found no evidence that prescription PPIs increase
      risk of MI compared with prescription H2RAs. Physicians and patients should not
      avoid starting a PPI because of concerns related to MI risk.

TI  - MIR21 Drives Resistance to Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibition in
      Cholangiocarcinoma.

LID - S0016-5085(17)36331-X [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) are resistant to chemotherapy, so
      new therapeutic agents are needed. We performed a screen to identify
      small-molecule compounds that are active against CCAs. Levels of microRNA 21
      (MIR21 or miRNA21) are increased in CCAs. We investigated whether miRNA21
      mediates resistance of CCA cells and organoids to HSP90 inhibitors. METHODS: We
      performed a high-throughput screen of 484 small-molecule compounds to identify
      those that reduced viability of 6 human CCA cell lines. We tested the effects of 
      HSP90 inhibitors on cells with disruption of the MIR21 gene, cells incubated with
      MIR21 inhibitors, and stable cell lines with inducible expression of MIR21. We
      obtained CCA biopsies from patients, cultured them as organoids (patient-derived 
      organoids). We assessed their architecture, mutation and gene expression
      patterns, response to compounds in culture, and when grown as subcutaneous
      xenograft tumors in mice. RESULTS: Cells with IDH1 and PBRM1 mutations had the
      highest level of sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors. HSP90 inhibitors 
      were effective in all cell lines, irrespective of mutations. Sensitivity of cells
      to HSP90 inhibitors correlated inversely with baseline level of MIR21. Disruption
      of MIR21 increased cell sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors. CCA cells that expressed
      transgenic MIR21 were more resistant to HSP90 inhibitors than cells transfected
      with control vectors; inactivation of MIR21 in these cells restored sensitivity
      to these agents. MIR21 was shown to target the DnaJ heat shock protein family
      (Hsp40) member B5 (DNAJB5). Transgenic expression of DNAJB5 in CCA cells that
      overexpressed MIR21 re-sensitized them to HSP90 inhibitors. Sensitivity of
      patient-derived organoids to HSP90 inhibitors, in culture and when grown as
      xenograft tumors in mice, depended on expression of miRNA21. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA21
      appears to mediate resistance of CCA cells to HSP90 inhibitors by reducing levels
      of DNAJB5. HSP90 inhibitors might be developed for the treatment of CCA and
      miRNA21 might be a marker of sensitivity to these agents.

TI  - Analysis of Genes Associated with Monogenic Primary Immunodeficiency Identifies
      Rare Variants in XIAP in Patients With Crohn's disease.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30245-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A few rare monogenic primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are
      characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation that resembles Crohn's disease
      (CD). We investigated whether 23 genes associated with 10 of these monogenic
      disorders contain common, low-frequency or rare variants that increase risk for
      CD. METHODS: Common and low frequency variants in 1 Mb loci centered on the
      candidate genes were analyzed using meta-data corresponding to genotypes of
      approximately 17,000 patients with CD or without CD (controls) in Europe. The
      contribution of rare variants was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 4750 
      individuals, including 660 early-onset and/or familial cases among the 2390
      patients with CD. Variants were expressed from vectors in SW480 or HeLa cells and
      functions of their products were analyzed in immunofluorescence, luciferase,
      immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot assays. RESULTS: We reproduced the
      association of the IL10 locus with CD (P=.007), although none of the
      significantly associated variants modified the coding sequence of IL10. We found 
      XIAP to be significantly enriched for rare coding mutations in patients with CD
      vs controls (P=.02). We identified 4 previously unreported missense variants
      associated with CD. Variants in XIAP cause PID X-linked lymphoproliferative
      disease type 2 (XLP2), yet none of the carriers of these variants had all the
      clinical features of XLP2. Identified XIAP variants S123N, R233Q and P257A were
      associated with an impaired activation of NOD2 signaling following MDP
      stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic analysis of variants in 23
      PID-associated genes, we confirmed the association of variants in XIAP with CD.
      Further screens for CD-associated variants and analyses of their functions could 
      increase our understanding of the relationship between PID-associated genes and
      CD pathogenesis.

      Emptying in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Muscularis propria macrophages lie close to cells that
      regulate gastrointestinal motor function, including interstitial cells of Cajal
      (ICC) and myenteric neurons. In animal models of diabetic gastroparesis,
      development of delayed gastric emptying has been associated with loss of
      macrophages that express cytoprotective markers and reduced networks of ICC. Mice
      with long-term diabetes and normal gastric emptying have macrophages that express
      anti-inflammatory markers and have normal gastric ICC. Mice homozygous for the
      osteopetrosis spontaneous mutation in the colony stimulating factor 1 gene
      (Csf1op/op) do not have macrophages; when they are given streptozotocin to induce
      diabetes, they do not develop delayed gastric emptying. We investigated whether
      population of the gastric muscularis propria of diabetic Csf1op/op mice with
      macrophages is necessary to change gastric emptying, ICC, and myenteric neurons
      and investigated the macrophage-derived factors that determine whether diabetic
      mice do or do not develop delayed gastric emptying. METHODS: Wild-type and
      Csf1op/op mice were given streptozotocin to induce diabetes. Some Csf1op/op mice 
      were given daily intraperitoneal injections of CSF1 for 7 weeks; gastric tissues 
      were collected and cellular distributions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. 
      CD45+, CD11b+, F4/80+ macrophages were dissociated from gastric muscularis
      propria, isolated by flow cytometry and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.
      Cultured gastric muscularis propria from Csf1op/op mice was exposed to medium
      that was conditioned by culture with bone marrow derived macrophages from wild
      type mice. RESULTS: Gastric muscularis propria from Csf1op/op mice given CSF1
      contained macrophages; 11/15 diabetic mice given CSF1 developed delayed gastric
      emptying and had damaged ICC. In non-diabetic Csf1op/op mice, administration of
      CSF1 reduced numbers of gastric myenteric neurons but did not affect the
      proportion of nitrergic neurons or ICC. In diabetic Csf1op/op mice given CSF1
      that developed delayed gastric emptying the proportion of nitrergic neurons was
      the same as in non-diabetic wild type controls. Medium conditioned by macrophages
      previously exposed to oxidative injury caused damage to ICC in cultured gastric
      muscularis propria from Csf1op/op mice; neutralizing antibodies against IL6R or
      TNF prevented this damage to ICC. CD45+, CD11b+, F4/80+ macrophages isolated from
      diabetic wild type mice with delayed gastric emptying expressed higher levels of 
      mRNAs encoding inflammatory markers (IL6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and
      lower levels of mRNAs encoding markers of anti-inflammatory cells (heme oxygenase
      1, arginase 1, and FIZZ1) than macrophages isolated from diabetic mice with
      normal gastric emptying. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of Csf1op/op and wild-type mice 
      with diabetes, we found delayed gastric emptying to be associated with increased 
      production of inflammatory factors, and reduced production of anti-inflammatory
      factors, by macrophages, leading to loss of ICC.

TI  - Loss of Chromatin Remodeling Proteins and/or CDKN2A Associates With Metastasis of
      Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors and Reduced Patient Survival Times.

AB  - Despite prognostic grading and staging systems, it is a challenge to predict
      outcomes for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Sequencing
      studies of PanNETs have identified alterations in death domain-associated protein
      (DAXX) and ATRX chromatin remodeler (ATRX). In tumors, mutations in DAXX or ATRX 
      and corresponding loss of protein expression correlate with shorter times of
      disease-free survival and disease-specific survival of patients. However, DAXX or
      ATRX proteins were lost in only 50% of distant metastases analyzed. We performed 
      whole-exome sequencing analyses of 20 distant metastases from 20 patients with a 
      single non-syndrome, non-functional PanNET. We found distant metastases contained
      alterations in MEN1 (n=8), ATRX (n=5), DAXX (n=5), TSC2 (n=3), and DEPDC5 (n=3). 
      We found copy number loss of CDKN2A in 15 metastases (75%) and alterations in
      genes that regulate chromatin remodeling including SETD2 (n=4), ARID1A (n=2),
      CHD8 (n=2), and DNMT1 (n=2). In a separate analysis of 347 primary PanNETs, we
      found loss or deletion of DAXX and ATRX, disruption of SETD2 function (based on
      loss of H3K36me3), loss of ARID1A expression or deletions in CDKN2A in 81% of
      primary PanNETs with distant metastases. Among patients with loss or deletion of 
      at least 1 of these proteins or genes, 39% survived disease free for 5 years and 
      44% had disease-specific survival times of 10 years. Among patients without any
      of these alterations, 98% survived disease free for 5 years and 95% had
      disease-specific survival times of 10 years. Therefore, primary PanNETs with loss
      of DAXX, ATRX, H3K36me3, ARID1A, and/or CDKN2A associate with shorter survival
      times of patients. Our findings indicate that alterations in chromatin remodeling
      genes and CDKN2A contribute to metastasis of PanNETs.

AB  - Recent advances in minimally invasive endoscopic approaches have pushed the
      boundaries of well-established resection techniques for therapeutic and
      diagnostic applications. Endoscopic full thickness resection techniques are a key
      development in the management of challenging epithelial and subepithelial lesions
      that are not amenable to conventional endoscopic resection methods and previously
      required a surgical approach. Endoscopic full thickness biopsy represents a
      paradigm shift in tissue acquisition and will enhance our understanding of the
      pathophysiology, and guide therapy of gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases, as
      well as other inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. This review highlights
      current tools and techniques available for endoscopic full thickness resection
      and biopsy, as well as outcomes from such interventions.

TI  - Dietary Patterns After the Weaning and Lactation Period Associate with Celiac
      Disease Autoimmunity in Children.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30228-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There have been many studies of associations between infant
      feeding practices and development of celiac disease during childhood, but few
      studies have focused on overall diets of young children following the weaning
      period. We aimed to examine the association between common dietary patterns in
      infants and the occurrence of celiac disease autoimmunity during childhood.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of data from the Generation R Study 
      that comprised 1997 children born from April 2002 through January 2006 in
      Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Food consumption around 1 year of age was assessed
      with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary data were examined using a
      priori (based on existing guidelines) and a posteriori (Principal Component
      Analysis and Reduced Rank Regression) dietary pattern analyses. Five dietary
      patterns were compared. Celiac disease autoimmunity, determined based on serum
      concentration of transglutaminase-2 autoantibody (TG2A) below or above 7 U/mL,
      was evaluated at 6 years. Associations between dietary pattern adherence scores
      and celiac disease autoimmunity were examined using multivariable logistic
      regression models. RESULTS: Higher adherence to the a posteriori-derived prudent 
      dietary pattern (high intake of vegetables, vegetable oils, pasta, and grains and
      low consumption of refined cereals and sweet beverages) at 1 year was
      significantly associated with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity at 6
      years (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.84). No significant associations were
      found for other 4 dietary patterns. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of
      dietary patterns of young children in the Netherlands, we associated a diet with 
      high consumption of vegetables and grains, and low consumption of refined cereals
      and sweet beverages, with lower odds of celiac disease autoimmunity. Early-life
      dietary patterns might therefore be involved in the development of celiac disease
      during childhood.

AB  - There are few data on the effects of methotrexate on reproductive capacity in men
      with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We performed a case-control study to
      determine the effects of methotrexate on sperm quality and genetic integrity. We 
      compared sperm samples from 7 men with IBD who had been exposed to methotrexate
      for at least 3 months with sperm samples collected from 1912 age-matched men at
      fertility centers (controls), where sperm parameters would be expected to be
      worse than those of the general population. Sperm were evaluated by basic semen
      analysis and advanced sperm integrity testing. In samples from men with IBD, all 
      basic semen analysis parameters were within normal limits. However, these samples
      had reduced sperm integrity, based on significant increases in levels of DNA
      fragmentation and damage from oxidative stress compared with controls. Our
      findings indicate that methotrexate can reduce DNA integrity in sperm and cause
      damage via oxidative stress.

AB  - Endoscopic techniques such as high-definition and optical-chromoendoscopy have
      had enormous impact on endoscopy practice. Since these techniques allow
      assessment of most subtle morphological mucosal abnormalities, further
      improvements in endoscopic practice lay in increasing the detection efficacy of
      endoscopists. Several new developments could assist in this. First, web based
      training tools could improve the skills of the endoscopist for enhancing the
      detection and classification of lesions. Secondly, incorporation of computer
      aided detection will be the next step to raise endoscopic quality of the captured
      data. These systems will aid the endoscopist in interpreting the increasing
      amount of visual information in endoscopic images providing real-time objective
      second reading. In addition, developments in the field of molecular imaging open 
      opportunities to add functional imaging data, visualizing biological parameters, 
      of the gastrointestinal tract to white-light morphology imaging. For the
      successful implementation of abovementioned techniques, a true multi-disciplinary
      approach is of vital importance.

TI  - Determining Risk of Colorectal Cancer and Starting Age of Screening Based on
      Lifestyle, Environmental, and Genetic Factors.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
      are based on family history but do not consider lifestyle, environmental, or
      genetic risk factors. We developed models to determine risk of CRC, based on
      lifestyle and environmental factors and genetic variants, and to identify an
      optimal age to begin screening. METHODS: We collected data from 9748 CRC cases
      and 10,590 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
      Consortium and the Colorectal Transdisciplinary study, from 1992 through 2005.
      Half of the participants were used to develop the risk determination model and
      the other half were used to evaluate the discriminatory accuracy (validation
      set). Models of CRC risk were created based on family history, 19 lifestyle and
      environmental factors (E-score), and 63 CRC-associated single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies (G-score). We
      evaluated the discriminatory accuracy of the models by calculating area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values, adjusting for study, age,
      and endoscopy findings for the validation set. We used the models to project the 
      10-year absolute risk of CRC for a given risk profile and recommend ages to begin
      screening, in comparison to CRC risk for an average individual at 50 years of
      age, using external population incidence rates for non-Hispanic whites from the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registry. RESULTS: In our
      models, E-score and G-score each determined risk of CRC with greater accuracy
      than family history. A model that combined both scores and family history
      estimated CRC risk with an AUC value of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.62-0.64) for men and 0.62
      (95% CI, 0.61-0.63) for women; AUC values based on only family history ranged
      from 0.53 to 0.54 and those based only E-score or G-score ranged from 0.59 to
      0.60. Although screening is recommended to begin at age 50 years for individuals 
      with no family history of CRC, starting ages calculated based on combined E-score
      and G-score differed by 12 years for men and 14 for women, for individuals with
      the highest vs the lowest 10% of risk. CONCLUSIONS: We used data from 2 large
      international consortia to develop CRC risk calculation models that included
      genetic and environmental factors along with family history. These determine risk
      of CRC and starting ages for screening with greater accuracy than the family
      history only model, which is based on the current screening guideline. These
      scoring systems might serve as a first step toward developing individualized CRC 
      prevention strategies.

TI  - The Effect of Endoscopic Surveillance in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus: A
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30225-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance of patients with 
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) to identify those with dysplasia (a precursor of
      carcinoma) or early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), who can be treated
      endoscopically. However, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survival
      times of patients with BE. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
      qualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association of
      endoscopic surveillance in patients with BE with survival and other outcomes.
      METHODS: We searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects of
      endoscopic surveillance on mortality and other EAC-related outcomes. We reviewed 
      randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patients
      with BE who received regular surveillance to those who did not receive regular
      surveillance, as well as studies comparing outcomes of patients with
      surveillance-detected EAC vs. symptom-detected EACs. We performed a meta-analysis
      of surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effects
      model. The primary aim was to examine the association of BE surveillance on
      EAC-related mortality. Secondary aims were to examine the association of BE
      surveillance with all-cause mortality and EAC stage at time of diagnosis.
      RESULTS: A single case-control study did not reveal any association between
      surveillance and EAC-related mortality. A meta-analysis of 4 cohort studies found
      lower EAC-related and all-cause mortality associated with regular surveillance
      (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.71 and hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI,
      0.59-0.94). Meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies demonstrated lower EAC-related and
      all-cause mortality among patients with surveillance-detected EAC vs.
      symptom-detected EAC (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94 and hazard ratio,
      0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76). Lead- and length-time bias adjustment substantially
      attenuated/eliminated the observed benefits. Surveillance was associated with
      detection of EAC at earlier stages. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate
      the effects of endoscopic surveillance on mortality in patients with BE.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of
      surveillance in patients with BE, surveillance as currently performed was
      associated with detection of earlier stage EAC and may provide a small survival
      benefit. However, the effects of confounding biases on these estimates are not
      fully defined, and may completely or partially explain the observed differences
      between surveyed and unsurveyed patients.

AB  - The role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has transitioned from a diagnostic to a
      therapeutic one over the past 40 years. With the advent of curvilinear array
      echoendoscopes in the 1990's with an accessory channel, multiple tools and
      devices have been developed and utilized for a variety of transluminal
      interventions. EUS provides a viable option and is becoming the procedure of
      choice for many interventions including bile and pancreatic duct drainage,
      guiding angiotherapy, pancreatic fluid collection management, gallbladder
      drainage, and creating a gastrojejunostomy. Although reports demonstrate the
      technical success of these interventions, there is tremendous study heterogeneity
      and a relative lack of controlled randomized trials, which may limit our
      understanding of their role and utility. Furthermore, adverse events are
      relatively common and occasionally severe. Despite the limitations, available
      data strongly indicate the efficacy of EUS interventions when performed by
      well-trained endosonographers in carefully selected patients and managed in a
      multi-disciplinary setting.

AB  - Advances in endoscopic eradication therapy for Barrett's Esophagus-associated
      neoplasia have resulted in a significant paradigm shift in the diagnosis and
      management of this complex disease. A robust body of literature critically
      evaluating outcomes of resection and ablative strategies has allowed
      gastroenterologists to make quality, evidence-based decisions for their patients.
      Despite this progress, there are still many unanswered questions and challenges
      that remain. Ultimately, identification of a cost-effective screening modality,
      biomarkers for risk stratification, and strides to eliminate post surveillance
      endoscopy after endoscopic eradication therapy are essential to reach our
      long-term goal for eradication of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.11.295 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) are the mainstays of interventional endoscopic practice. EUS occupies a
      central role in the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary neoplasms and offers a platform
      for a wide range of direct tumor therapies. Initial steps have demonstrated the
      feasibility of such applications in animal models and pilot studies. Larger
      clinical trials and incorporation of EUS-based therapies into cooperative cancer 
      studies might demonstrate an impact in the clinical prognosis of patients with
      pancreatic cancer. ERCP plays an important role in elucidating indeterminate
      biliary strictures and in treating patients with malignant biliary obstruction
      who are symptomatic or have borderline resectable or unresectable disease.
      ERCP-directed ablative therapies enable neoadjuvant and palliative intervention
      in patients with malignant biliary obstruction, in particular perihilar
      cholangiocarcinoma. Additional comparative, multicenter studies are needed to
      better understand the safety and efficacy of endobiliary brachytherapy,
      photodynamic therapy, and radiofrequency ablation in patients with
      pancreatobiliary malignancies.

AB  - Articles appearing in Gastroenterology have played an integral role in the
      evolution of our understanding of Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD), including
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), beginning with the prescient contributions of
      Almy and Tulin in 1947 and 1949 that highlighted the role of stress to enhance
      perception of abdominal pain and promote colon contractions. Subsequent
      publications have codified diagnostic criteria and stratified subpopulations of
      FBD (Manning and ROME I-IV), which resulted in improved symptom-based therapeutic
      interventions. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of FBD,
      particularly IBS, published in Gastroenterology has led to our current
      appreciation that FBD represent dysfunction in the bidirectional brain-gut axis, 
      intestinal barrier dysfunction and interactions with the microbiota and dietary
      factors. Team science and the application of next-generation -omics methods are
      leading the way to improved diagnostic criteria and targeted therapeutic
      interventions. As the field evolves, publications appearing in Gastroenterology
      will continue to be at the forefront of these advances.

TI  - Alterations in Intestinal Microbiota Lead to Production of Interleukin 17 by
      Intrahepatic gammadelta T-cell Receptor-positive Cells and Pathogenesis of
      Cholestatic Liver Disease.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30214-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Variants at the ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 4 gene
      (ABCB4 or MDR2) locus, which encodes a biliary transport protein, are associated 
      with a spectrum of cholestatic liver diseases. Exacerbation of liver disease has 
      been linked to increased hepatic levels of interleukin 17 (IL17), yet the
      mechanisms of this increase are not understood. We studied mice with disruption
      of Mdr2 to determine how defects in liver and alteration in the microbiota
      contribute to production of IL17 by intrahepatic gammadelta T cells. METHODS: We 
      performed studies with Mdr2-/- and littermate FVB/NJ (control) mice. IL17 was
      measured in serum samples by an ELISA. Mice were injected with neutralizing
      antibodies against the gammadelta T-cell receptor (TCR; anti-gammadelta TCR) or
      mouse IL17A (anti-IL17A). Livers were collected and bacteria were identified in
      homogenates by culture procedures; TCRgammadelta+ cells were isolated by flow
      cytometry. Fecal samples were collected from mice and analyzed by 16s ribosomal
      DNA sequencing. Cells were stimulated with antibodies or bacteria, and cytokine
      production was measured. We obtained tissues from 10 patients undergoing liver
      transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis or chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection. Tissues were analyzed for cytokine production by gammadelta TCR+
      cells. RESULTS: Mdr2-/- mice had collagen deposition around hepatic bile ducts
      and periportal-bridging fibrosis with influx of inflammatory cells and increased 
      serum levels of IL17 compared with control mice. Administration of anti-IL17A
      reduced hepatic fibrosis. Livers from Mdr2-/- mice had increased numbers of
      IL17A+ gammadeltaTCR+ cells-particularly of IL17A+ Vgamma6Jgamma1 gammadelta TCR+
      cells. Fecal samples from Mdr2-/- mice were enriched in Lactobacillus, and liver 
      tissues were enriched in Lactobacillus gasseri compared with control mice.
      Mdr2-/- mice also had increased intestinal permeability. The gammadelta TCR+
      cells isolated from Mdr2-/- livers produced IL17 in response to heat-killed L
      gasseri. Intraperitoneal injection of control mice with L gasseri led to
      increased serum levels of IL17 and liver infiltration by inflammatory cells;
      injection of these mice with anti-gammadelta TCR reduced serum level of IL17.
      Intravenous injections of Mdr2-/- mice with anti-gammadelta TCR reduced fibrosis;
      liver levels of IL17, and inflammatory cells; and serum levels of IL17.
      gammadeltaTCR+ cells isolated from livers of patients with primary sclerosing
      cholangitis, but not HCV infection, produced IL17. CONCLUSIONS: In Mdr2-/- mice, 
      we found development of liver fibrosis and inflammation to require hepatic
      activation of gammadelta TCR+ cells and production of IL17 production, mediated
      by exposure to L gasseri. This pathway appears to contribute to development of
      cholestatic liver disease in patients.

AB  - Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an advanced endoscopic procedure classically
      performed for the treatment of achalasia. The procedure is based on principles of
      submucosal endoscopy and is comprised of a mucosal incision, submucosal
      tunneling, myotomy and mucosal closure. Multiple published studies that
      collectively include more than 6000 patients reported clinical success in more
      than 80-90% of patients. Recent literature also suggested durability of response 
      over a medium-term follow-up. POEM is associated with a low rate of adverse
      events when performed by experienced operators. Gastroesophageal reflux is not
      infrequent after POEM but does not seem significantly different from reflux which
      occurs after Heller myotomy. POEM also seems to be effective in the treatment of 
      spastic esophageal disorders (e.g. Jackhammer and diffuse esophageal spasm).
      Lastly, the role of gastric POEM (G-POEM) in the treatment of gastroparesis has
      been investigated in recent studies with promising results.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is amongst the most commonly diagnosed cancers and causes
      of death from cancer across the world. CRC can, however, be detected in
      asymptomatic patients at a curable stage, and several studies have shown lower
      mortality among patients who undergo screening compared to those who do not.
      Using colonoscopy in CRC screening also results in the detection of precancerous 
      polyps that can be directly removed during the procedure, thereby reducing the
      incidence of cancer. In the past decade, convincing evidence has appeared that
      the effectiveness of colonoscopy as CRC prevention tool is associated with the
      quality of the procedure. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of
      recent efforts to improve colonoscopy effectiveness of by enhancing detection and
      improving the completeness and safety of resection of colorectal lesions.

TI  - HCV Genotype 6a Escape from and Resistance to Velpatasvir, Pibrentasvir, and
      Sofosbuvir in Robust Infectious Cell Culture Models.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30212-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic liver diseases caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      genotype 6 are prevalent in Asia, and millions of people require treatment with
      direct-acting antiviral regimens, such as NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir combined
      with the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir. We developed infectious cell
      culture models of HCV genotype 6a infection to study the effects of these
      inhibitors and the development of resistance. METHODS: The consensus sequences of
      prototype strains HK2 (MG717925) and HK6a (MG717928), originating from serum of
      patients with chronic HCV infection, were determined by Sanger sequencing of
      genomes amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. In vitro non-infectious
      full-length clones of these 6a strains were subsequently adapted in Huh7.5 cells,
      primarily by using substitutions identified in JFH1-based core-NS5A and core-NS5B
      genotype 6a recombinants. We studied the efficacy of NS5A- and NS5B- inhibitors
      in concentration-response assays. We examined the effects of long-term culture of
      Huh7.5 cells incubated with velpatasvir and sofosbuvir singly or combined
      following infection with passaged full-length HK2 or HK6a recombinant viruses.
      Resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) were identified by Sanger and
      next-generation sequencing, and their effects on viral fitness and in drug
      susceptibility were determined in reverse-genetic experiments. RESULTS: Adapted
      full-length HCV genotype 6a recombinants HK2cc and HK6acc had fast propagation
      kinetics and high infectivity titers. Compared to a HCV genotype 1a recombinant, 
      HCV genotype 6a recombinants of strains HK2 and HK6a were equally sensitive to
      daclatasvir, elbasvir, velpatasvir, pibrentasvir, and sofosbuvir, but less
      sensitive to ledipasvir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir. Long-term exposure of HCV
      genotype 6a-infected Huh7.5 cells with a combination of velpatasvir and
      sofosbuvir resulted in clearance of the virus, but the virus escaped the effects 
      of single inhibitors via emergence of the RAS L31V in NS5A (conferring resistance
      to velpatasvir) and S282T in NS5B (conferring resistance to sofosbuvir).
      Engineered recombinant genotype 6a viruses with single RAS mediated resistance to
      velpatasvir or sofosbuvir. HCV genotype 6a viruses with RAS NS5A-L31V or
      NS5B-S282T was however able to propagate and escape in Huh7.5 cells exposed to
      the combination of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir. Further, HCV genotype 6a with
      NS5A-L31V was able to propagate and escape in the presence of pibrentasvir with
      emergence of NS5A-L28S, conferring a high level of resistance to this inhibitor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Strains of HCV genotype 6a isolated from patients can be adapted to 
      propagate in cultured cells, permitting studies of the complete life cycle for
      this important genotype. The combination of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir is
      required to block propagation of original HCV genotype 6a, which quickly becomes 
      resistant to single inhibitors via the rapid emergence and persistence of RAS.
      These features of HCV genotype 6a could compromise treatment.

TI  - P300 Acetyltransferase Mediates Stiffness-Induced Activation of Hepatic Stellate 
      Cells Into Tumor-promoting Myofibroblasts.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30209-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) contribute to desmoplasia and
      stiffness of liver metastases by differentiating into matrix-producing
      myofibroblasts. We investigated whether stiffness due to the presence of tumors
      increases activation of HSCs into myofibroblasts and their tumor-promoting
      effects, as well as the role of E1A binding protein p300 (EP300 or p300), a
      histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription, in these processes.
      METHODS: HSCs were isolated from liver tissues of patients, mice in which the
      p300 gene was flanked by 2 loxP sites (p300F/F mice), and p300+/+ mice
      (controls). The HSCs were placed on polyacrylamide gels with precisely defined
      stiffness, and their activation (differentiation into myofibroblasts) was
      assessed by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses for alpha-smooth muscle
      actin. In HSCs from mice, the p300 gene was disrupted by cre recombinase. In
      human HSCs, levels of p300 were knocked down with small hairpin RNAs or a mutant 
      form of p300 that is not phosphorylated by AKT (p300S1834A) was overexpressed.
      Human HSCs were also cultured with inhibitors of p300 (C646), PI3K signaling to
      AKT (LY294002), or RHOA (C3 transferase) and effects on stiffness-induced
      activation were measured. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation
      quantitative PCR were used to identified HSC genes that changed expression levels
      in response to stiffness. We measured effects of HSC-conditioned media on
      proliferation of HT29 colon cancer cells and growth of tumors following
      subcutaneous injection of these cells into mice. MC38 colon cancer cells were
      injected into portal veins of p300F/Fcre and control mice and liver metastases
      were measured. p300F/Fcre and control mice were given intraperitoneal injections 
      of CCl4 to induce liver fibrosis. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by
      immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and histology. RESULT: Substrate stiffness was
      sufficient to activate HSCs, leading to nuclear accumulation of p300. Disrupting 
      p300 level or activity blocked stiffness-induced activation of HSC. In HSCs,
      substrate stiffness activated AKT signaling via RHOA to induce phosphorylation of
      p300 at serine 1834; this caused p300 to translocate to the nucleus, where it
      upregulated transcription of genes that increase activation of HSCs and
      metastasis, including CXCL12. MC38 cells, injected into portal veins, formed
      fewer metastases in livers of p300F/Fcre mice than control mice. Expression of
      p300 was increased in livers of mice following injection of CCl4; HSC activation 
      and collagen deposition were reduced in livers of p300F/Fcre mice compared with
      control mice. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of mice, we found liver stiffness to
      activate HSC differentiation into myofibroblasts, which required nuclear
      accumulation of p300. P300 increases HSC expression of genes that promote
      metastasis.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with monogenic disorders of phagocyte function
      develop chronic colitis that resembles Crohn's Disease (CD). We tested for
      associations between mutations in genes encoding NADPH oxidases, neutrophil
      function, and phenotypes of CD in pediatric patients. METHODS: We performed
      whole-exome sequence analysis to identify mutations in genes encoding NADPH
      oxidases (such as CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4, RAC1, and RAC2) using DNA from
      543 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Blood samples were
      collected from an additional 129 pediatric patients with CD and 26 children
      without IBD (controls); we performed assays for neutrophil activation, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) production, and bacteria uptake and killing. Whole-exome
      sequence analysis was performed using DNA from 46 of the children with CD to
      examine associations with NADPH gene mutations; RNA sequence analyses were
      performed using blood cells from 46 children with CD to test for variations in
      neutrophil gene expression associated with ROS production. RESULTS: We identified
      26 missense mutations in CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4. Patients with CD who
      carried mutations in these genes were 3-fold more likely to have perianal disease
      (P=.0008) and stricturing complications (P=.002) than children with CD without
      these mutations. Among patients with CD with none of these mutations, 9% had
      undergone abdominal surgery; among patients with mutations in these NADPH oxidase
      genes, 31% had undergone abdominal surgery (P=.0004). A higher proportion of
      neutrophils from children with CD had low ROS production (47%) than from controls
      (15%) among the 129 patients tested for ROS (P=.002). Minor alleles of the NADPH 
      genes were detected in 7% of children with CD whose neutrophils produced normal
      levels of ROS vs 38% of children whose neutrophils produced low levels of ROS
      (P=.009). Neutrophils that produced low levels of ROS had specific alterations in
      genes that regulate glucose metabolism and anti-microbial responses. CONCLUSIONS:
      We identified missense mutations in genes that encode NADPH oxidases in children 
      with CD; these associated with a more aggressive disease course and reduced ROS
      production by neutrophils from the patients.

AB  - Transmural defects of the gastrointestinal tract can be classified into three
      distinct entities that include leaks, perforations, and fistulae. Each arise from
      different mechanisms and are managed accordingly. Leaks occur most often
      following surgery, while perforations occur most often following flexible
      endoscopic maneuvers. Fistula arise from a variety of mechanisms, such as an
      evolution from surgical leaks as well as from specific disease states. Endoscopic
      management plays a vital role in the treatment of transmural defects as long as
      the region of interest can be accessed with the appropriate endoscopic
      accessories. Endoscopic approaches can be broadly classified into those that
      provide closure and those that provide diversion of luminal contents. With
      advances in technology, a myriad of devices and accessories are available that
      allow a tailored approach. Endoscopic approaches to leaks, perforations, and
      fistulae are discussed in this review.

TI  - Increased Expression of the Long Non-coding RNA LINC01503, Regulated by TP63, in 
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Effects on Oncogenic Activities of Cancer Cell Lines.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30213-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in
      tissue-specific pattern, but it is not clear how these are regulated. We aimed to
      identify squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-specific lncRNAs and investigate
      mechanisms that control their expression and function. METHODS: We studied
      expression patterns and functions of 4 SCC-specific lncRNAs. We obtained 113
      esophageal SCC (ESCC) and matched non-tumor esophageal tissues from a hospital in
      Shantou City, China, and performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays 
      to measure expression levels of LINC01503. We collected clinical data from
      patients and compared expression levels with survival times. LINC01503 was
      knocked down using small interfering RNAs and oligonucleotides in TE7, TE5 and
      KYSE510 cell lines and overexpressed in KYSE30 cells. Cells were analyzed by
      chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, luciferase reporter assays, colony
      formation, migration and invasion, and mass spectrometry analyses. Cells were
      injected into nude mice and growth of xenograft tumors was measured. LINC01503
      interaction with proteins was studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization,
      RNA pulldown, and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses. RESULTS: We identified a
      lncRNA, LINC01503, which is regulated by a super-enhancer and is expressed at
      significantly higher levels in esophageal and head and neck SCCs than in
      non-tumor tissues. High levels in SCCs correlated with shorter survival times of 
      patients. The transcription factor TP63 bound to the super-enhancer at the
      LINC01503 locus and activated its transcription. Expression of LINC01503 in ESCC 
      cell lines increased their proliferation, colony formation, migration and
      invasion. Knockdown of LINC01503 in SCC cells reduced their proliferation, colony
      formation, migration and invasion, and growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice.
      Expression of LINC01503 in ESCC cell lines reduced ERK2 dephosphorylation by
      DUSP6, leading to activation of ERK signaling via MAPK. LINC01503 disrupted the
      interaction between EBP1 and the p85 subunit of PI3K, increasing AKT signaling.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified a lncRNA, LINC01503, that is increased in SCC cells
      compared with non-tumor cells. Increased expression of LINC01503 promotes ESCC
      cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth of xenograft tumors. It might
      be developed as a biomarker of aggressive SCCs in patients.

LID - S0016-5085(18)30220-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.044 [doi]
AB  - A substantial literature documents inappropriate usage of gastrointestinal
      endoscopy in a variety of clinical settings. Overusage of endoscopy appears to be
      common, and 30% or more of procedures performed in some clinical settings have
      questionable indications. The potential reasons for overuse of endoscopy are
      multiple, and include cancer phobia, fear of medical malpractice litigation,
      profit motive, the investigation of "incidentalomas" found on other imaging, and 
      under-appreciation of the delayed harms of endoscopy, among other reasons.
      Clinical guidelines, which should limit overuse of endoscopy, may instead serve
      to promote it, if authors opt to be "conservative," recommending endoscopy in
      situations of unclear utility. Several strategies may decrease overuse of
      endoscopy, including careful attention to risk stratification when choosing
      patients to screen, adherence to guidelines for surveillance intervals for
      colonoscopy, the use of quality indicators to identify outliers in endoscopy
      utilization, and education on appropriate indications and the risks of overuse at
      the medical student, residency and fellowship levels.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.11.293 [doi]
AB  - One of the challenges of the current era is ensuring that endoscopic training is 
      accomplished effectively in the face of multiple competing demands. As healthcare
      delivery evolves, with rising patient complexity and increasing productivity
      requirements, there is mounting pressure on the time available for training in
      the clinical setting. The practice of endoscopy itself continues to expand to
      include increasingly complex procedures (e.g. therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM),
      etc.), all of which require dedicated endoscopy training. The rapid pace of
      progress in the field of endoscopy means that the demand for endoscopy training
      is not limited to the formal period of training but instead spans the spectrum to
      include physicians already in practice. In the light of recent advances in our
      understanding of endoscopy training, the following review will serve to highlight
      the current state of affairs with respect to endoscopic training and how we can
      consider approaching these challenges.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.02.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute pancreatitis may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer;
      however, findings from studies on this association are conflicting. We
      investigated the association between acute pancreatitis and increased risk of
      pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, matched 
      cohort study of all patients admitted to a hospital in Denmark with a diagnosis
      of acute pancreatitis from January 1, 1980, through October 31, 2012. As many as 
      5 individuals from the general population without acute pancreatitis were matched
      for age and sex to each patient with acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic cancer risk
      was expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs),
      calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Cox models were stratified
      by age, sex, and year of pancreatitis diagnosis and adjusted for alcohol- and
      smoking-related conditions, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. RESULTS: We
      included 41,669 patients diagnosed with incident acute pancreatitis and 208,340
      comparison individuals. Patients with acute pancreatitis had an increased risk of
      pancreatic cancer compared with the age- and sex-matched general population
      throughout the follow-up period. The risk decreased over time but remained high
      after more than 5 years of follow-up (adjusted HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.57-2.61). Two-
      and 5-year absolute risks of pancreatic cancer among patients with acute
      pancreatitis were 0.68% (95% CI 0.61%-0.77%) and 0.85% (95% CI 0.76%-0.94),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide, population-based, matched cohort
      study, we observed an association between diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and
      long-term risk of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Society guidelines differ in their recommendations for
      surveillance to detect early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients
      with cirrhosis. We compared the performance of surveillance imaging, with or
      without alpha fetoprotein (AFP), for early detection of HCC in patients with
      cirrhosis. METHODS: Two reviewers searched MEDLINE and SCOPUS from January 1990
      through August 2016 to identify published sensitivity and specificity of
      surveillance strategies for overall and early detection of HCC. Pooled estimates 
      were calculated and compared using the DerSimonian and Laird method for a random 
      effects model. The study was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting
      Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines. RESULTS: Thirty-two
      studies (comprising 13,367 patients) characterized sensitivity of imaging with or
      without AFP measurement for detection of HCC in patients with cirrhosis.
      Ultrasound detected any stage HCC with 84% sensitivity (95% confidence interval
      [CI] 76%-92%), but early-stage HCC with only 47% sensitivity (95% CI 33%-61%). In
      studies comparing ultrasound with vs without AFP measurement, ultrasound detected
      any stage HCC with a lower level of sensitivity than ultrasound plus AFP
      measurement (relative risk [RR] 0.88; 95% CI 0.83-0.93) and early-stage HCC with 
      a lower level of sensitivity than ultrasound plus AFP measurement (RR 0.81; 95%
      CI 0.71-0.93). However, ultrasound alone detected HCC with a higher level of
      specificity than ultrasound plus AFP measurement (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.09).
      Ultrasound with vs without AFP detected early-stage HCC with 63% sensitivity (95%
      CI 48%-75%) and 45% sensitivity (95% CI 30%-62%), respectively (P = .002). Only 4
      studies evaluated computed tomography or magnetic resonance image-based
      surveillance, which detected HCC with 84% sensitivity (95% CI 70%-92%).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of publications, we found ultrasound alone to
      detect early-stage HCC with a low level of sensitivity in patients with
      cirrhosis. Addition of AFP to ultrasound analysis significantly increases the
      sensitivity of HCC detection in clinical practice.

TI  - Effects of Training and Feedback on Accuracy of Predicting Rectosigmoid
      Neoplastic Lesions and Selection of Surveillance Intervals by Endoscopists
      Performing Optical Diagnosis of Diminutive Polyps.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30154-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.063 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Real-time differentiation of diminutive polyps (1-5 mm) during
      endoscopy could replace histopathology analysis. According to guidelines,
      implementation of optical diagnosis into routine practice would require it to
      identify rectosigmoid neoplastic lesions with a negative predictive value (NPV)
      of more than 90%, using histologic findings as a reference, and agreement with
      histology-based surveillance intervals for more than 90% of cases. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective study with 39 endoscopists accredited to perform
      colonoscopies on participants with positive results from fecal immunochemical
      tests in the Bowel Cancer Screening Program at 13 centers in the Netherlands.
      Endoscopists were trained in optical diagnosis using a validated module
      (Workgroup serrAted polypS and Polyposis). After meeting predefined performance
      thresholds in the training program, the endoscopists started a 1-year program
      (continuation phase) in which they performed narrow band imaging analyses during 
      colonoscopies of participants in the screening program and predicted histological
      findings with confidence levels. The endoscopists were randomly assigned to
      groups that received feedback or no feedback on the accuracy of their
      predictions. Primary outcome measures were endoscopists' abilities to identify
      rectosigmoid neoplastic lesions (using histology as a reference) with NPVs of 90%
      or more, and selecting surveillance intervals that agreed with those determined
      by histology for at least 90% of cases. RESULTS: Of 39 endoscopists initially
      trained, 27 (69%) completed the training program. During the continuation phase, 
      these 27 endoscopists performed 3144 colonoscopies in which 4504 diminutive
      polyps were removed. The endoscopists identified neoplastic lesions with a pooled
      NPV of 90.8% (95% confidence interval 88.6-92.6); their proposed surveillance
      intervals agreed with those determined by histologic analysis for 95.4% of cases 
      (95% confidence interval 94.0-96.6). Findings did not differ between the group
      that did vs did not receive feedback. Sixteen endoscopists (59%) identified
      rectosigmoid neoplastic lesions with NPVs greater than 90% and selected
      surveillance intervals in agreement with those determined from histology for more
      than 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study following a validated
      training module, we found that a selected group of endoscopists identified
      rectosigmoid neoplastic lesions with pooled NPVs greater than 90% and accurately 
      selected surveillance intervals for more than 90% of patients over the course of 
      1 year. Providing regular interim feedback on the accuracy of neoplastic lesion
      prediction and surveillance interval selection did not lead to differences in
      those endpoints. Monitoring is suggested, as individual performance varied.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by severe
      inflammation and acinar cell death. Transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173 or STING) 
      is a pattern recognition receptor on immune cells that recognizes cytosolic
      nucleic acids and transmits signals that activate production of interferons and
      the innate immune response. We investigated whether leukocyte STING signaling
      mediates inflammation in mice with AP. METHODS: We induced AP in C57BL/6J mice
      (control) and C57BL/6J-Tmem173gt/J mice (STING-knockout mice) by injection of
      cerulein or placement on choline-deficient DL-ethionine supplemented diet. In
      some mice, STING signaling was induced by administration of a pharmacologic
      agonist. AP was also induced in C57BL/6J mice with bone marrow transplants from
      control or STING-knockout mice and in mice with disruption of the cyclic GMP-AMP 
      synthase (Cgas) gene. Pancreata were collected, analyzed by histology, and acini 
      were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction, immunoblots, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bone-marrow-derived
      macrophages were collected from mice and tested for their ability to detect DNA
      from dying acinar cells in the presence and absence of deoxyribonuclease
      (DNaseI). RESULTS: STING signaling was activated in pancreata from mice with AP
      but not mice without AP. STING-knockout mice developed less severe AP (less
      edema, inflammation, and markers of pancreatic injury) than control mice, whereas
      mice given a STING agonist developed more severe AP than controls. In immune
      cells collected from pancreata, STING was expressed predominantly in macrophages.
      Levels of CGAS were increased in mice with vs without AP, and CGAS-knockout mice 
      had decreased edema, inflammation, and other markers of pancreatic injury upon
      induction of AP than control mice. Wild-type mice given bone marrow transplants
      from STING-knockout mice had less pancreatic injury and lower serum levels of
      lipase and pancreatic trypsin activity following induction of AP than mice given 
      wild-type bone marrow. DNA from dying acinar cells activated STING signaling in
      macrophages, which was inhibited by addition of DNaseI. CONCLUSIONS: In mice with
      AP, STING senses acinar cell death (by detecting DNA from dying acinar cells) and
      activates a signaling pathway that promotes inflammation. Macrophages express
      STING and activate pancreatic inflammation in AP.

TI  - Prevalence of and Factors Associated With Fecal Incontinence: Results From a
      Population-based Survey.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30144-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal incontinence (FI) is characterized by uncontrolled
      passage of solid or liquid stool. We aimed to determine the prevalence and
      severity of FI in a large sample of US residents. METHODS: We recruited a
      representative sample of patients in October 2015 to complete the National
      Gastrointestinal (GI) Survey; a mobile app called MyGiHealth was used to
      systematically collect data on GI symptoms. FI was defined as accidental leakage 
      of solid or liquid stool. Severity of FI was determined by responses to the
      National Institutes of Health FI Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System questionnaire. Multivariable regression models were used to
      identify factors associated with FI prevalence and severity. RESULTS: Among
      71,812 individuals who completed the National GI Survey, 14.4% reported FI in the
      past; of these, 33.3% had FI within the past 7 days. Older age, male sex, and
      Hispanicethnicity increased the likelihood of having FI within the past week.
      Individuals with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, irritable
      bowel syndrome, or diabetes were more likely to report FI. Non-Hispanic black and
      Hispanic individuals and individuals with Crohn's disease, celiac disease,
      diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or
      chronic idiopathic constipation had more severe symptoms of FI than individuals
      without these features. CONCLUSIONS: In a large population-based survey, 1 in 7
      people reported previous FI. FI is age-related and more prevalent among
      individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome, or diabetes than people without these disorders. Proactive screening
      for FI among these groups is warranted.

TI  - HBV Bypasses the Innate Immune Response and Does Not Protect HCV From Antiviral
      Activity of Interferon.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30112-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is sensitive to interferon
      (IFN)-based therapy, whereas hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not. It is
      unclear whether HBV escapes detection by the IFN-mediated immune response or
      actively suppresses it. Moreover, little is known on how HBV and HCV influence
      each other in coinfected cells. We investigated interactions between HBV and the 
      IFN-mediated immune response using HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes
      (PHHs). We analyzed the effects of HBV on HCV replication, and vice versa, at the
      single-cell level. METHODS: PHHs were isolated from liver resection tissues from 
      HBV-, HCV-, and human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients. Differentiated
      HepaRG cells overexpressing the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting
      polypeptide (dHepaRGNTCP) and PHHs were infected with HBV. Huh7.5 cells were
      transfected with circular HBV DNA genomes resembling viral covalently closed
      circular DNA (cccDNA), and subsequently infected with HCV; this served as a model
      of HBV and HCV coinfection. Cells were incubated with IFN inducers, or IFNs, and 
      antiviral response and viral replication were analyzed by immune fluorescence,
      reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays, and flow cytometry. RESULTS: HBV infection of dHepaRGNTCP
      cells and PHHs neither activated nor inhibited signaling via pattern recognition 
      receptors. Incubation of dHepaRGNTCP cells and PHHs with IFN had little effect on
      HBV replication or levels of cccDNA. HBV infection of these cells did not inhibit
      JAK-STAT signaling or up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes. In coinfected cells,
      HBV did not prevent IFN-induced suppression of HCV replication. CONCLUSIONS: In
      dHepaRGNTCP cells and PHHs, HBV evades the induction of IFN and IFN-induced
      antiviral effects. HBV infection does not rescue HCV from the IFN-mediated
      response.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Exposure Response Relationships of Ustekinumab in Patients
      With Crohn's Disease.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30111-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high
      affinity to the p40 subunit of human interleukin 12 (IL12 and IL23) that has been
      approved for treatment of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). 
      However, there are few data on its pharmacokinetic properties or the relationship
      between drug exposure levels and patient response. We collected data from 2 Phase
      3 induction studies and 1 maintenance study to determine ustekinumab's
      pharmacokinetic features, relationship between exposure and response, and optimal
      serum concentrations for efficacy. METHODS: We collected data on serum
      concentrations of ustekinumab and efficacy from induction studies of patients
      with moderate to severe CD given ustekinumab for 8 weeks following a single
      intravenous dose (either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg/kg). We collected the same 
      data from a maintenance study of patients with a response to ustekinumab in the
      induction study who then received subcutaneous injections (90 mg) every 8 or 12
      weeks for 44 weeks. At week 44 of the maintenance study (52 weeks after treatment
      began), patients were evaluated for the primary endpoint of clinical remission
      (defined as a CD activity index score below 150 points), endoscopic markers of
      efficacy, and serum level of C-reactive protein. Ustekinumab concentration data
      were categorized into quartiles and relationships between exposure and response
      were assessed. Optimal concentration cutoff values were evaluated using receiver 
      operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of
      ustekinumab over time were proportional to dose and did not differ significantly 
      between the induction studies. In the maintenance study, ustekinumab
      concentration reached the steady state by the second maintenance dose; the median
      trough concentration was approximately threefold higher in patients given
      ustekinumab at 8-week intervals compared with 12-week intervals. Ustekinumab
      serum concentrations associated with rates of clinical remission and endoscopic
      efficacy endpoints, correlated inversely with level of C-reactive protein, and
      did not associate with use of immunomodulators. Trough concentrations of
      ustekinumab of 0.8 (or even up to 1.4 mug/mL) or greater were associated with
      maintenance of clinical remission in a higher proportion of patients than
      patients with lower trough concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data
      from Phase 3 studies of patients with moderate to severe CD, we found serum
      concentrations of ustekinumab to be proportional to dose and associate with
      treatment efficacy. Concentrations of ustekinumab did not seem to be affected by 
      cotreatment with immunomodulators. Clinicaltrials.gov no. NCT01369329 (UNITI 1),

      Pancreas.

AB  - We investigated whether intrapancreatic coagulation, with deposition of the
      fibrinogen-gamma dimer (Fib-gammaD) and hypoxia, affect the severity of acute
      pancreatitis (AP) in mice. Pancreata of mice with AP induced by administration of
      cerulein or by L-arginine, or from patients with AP, had increased deposition of 
      Fib-gammaD compared with control pancreata. Heparin administration protected mice
      from cerulein-induced AP and prevented Fib-gammaD formation. Cerulein
      administration resulted in activation and stabilization of hypoxia-inducible
      factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) in pancreata of oxygen-dependent degradation
      domain-luciferase HIF1alpha reporter mice. Cerulein also led to induction of
      genes regulated by HIF1alpha, including VEGFA and ERO1A, before evidence of
      Fib-gammaD deposition or histologic features of AP. Expression of tissue factor, 
      which is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, also increased
      following cerulein administration. Mice with acinar cell-specific disruption of
      Hif1a (Hif1aAc-/-) developed spontaneous endoplasmic reticulum stress and less
      severe AP, but did not accumulate Fib-gammaD following administration of
      cerulein. Feeding mice increased pancreatic expression of HIF1alpha, indicating a
      physiologic role in the exocrine pancreas. Therefore, HIF1alpha has bifunctional 
      roles, in exocrine pancreas homeostasis and progression of AP that is promoted by
      intrapancreatic coagulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Campylobacter jejuni, a prevalent foodborne bacterial
      pathogen, exploits the host innate response to induce colitis. Little is known
      about the roles of microbiota in C jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation. We
      investigated interactions between microbiota and intestinal cells during C jejuni
      infection of mice. METHODS: Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10-/- mice were colonized with
      conventional microbiota and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10(9)
      colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional microbiota were cultured
      under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into
      germ-free Il10-/- mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by
      histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal
      microbiota and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance 
      liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Introduction
      of conventional microbiota reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously
      germ-free Il10-/- mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by
      reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Microbiota transplantation
      and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI,
      Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice
      colonized with microbiota cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis)
      compared with mice fed microbiota cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible 
      to colitis). Oral administration to mice of microbiota-derived secondary bile
      acid sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic acid or lithocholic acid,
      reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile acid-producing
      bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C
      jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10-/- mice compared with the
      nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic acid; colitis induction by antibiotics was
      associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate. CONCLUSIONS: We identified
      a mechanism by which the microbiota controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection
      in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Improved therapy has substantially increased survival of
      persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). But the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in
      adults with CF is 5-10 times greater compared to the general population, and
      25-30 times greater in CF patients after an organ transplantation. To address
      this risk, the CF Foundation convened a multi-stakeholder task force to develop
      CRC screening recommendations. METHODS: The 18-member task force consisted of
      experts including pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, a social worker, nurse
      coordinator, surgeon, epidemiologist, statistician, CF adult, and a parent. The
      committee comprised 3 workgroups: Cancer Risk, Transplant, and Procedure and
      Preparation. A guidelines specialist at the CF Foundation conducted an evidence
      synthesis February-March 2016 based on PubMed literature searches. Task force
      members conducted additional independent searches. A total of 1159 articles were 
      retrieved. After initial screening, the committee read 198 articles in full and
      analyzed 123 articles to develop recommendation statements. An independent
      decision analysis evaluating the benefits of screening relative to harms and
      resources required was conducted by the Department of Public Health at Erasmus
      Medical Center, Netherlands using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model
      from the Cancer Innervation and Surveillance Modeling Network. The task force
      included recommendation statements in the final guideline only if they reached an
      80% acceptance threshold. RESULTS: The task force makes 10 CRC screening
      recommendations that emphasize shared, individualized decision-making and
      familiarity with CF-specific gastrointestinal challenges. We recommend
      colonoscopy as the preferred screening method, initiation of screening at age 40 
      years, 5-year re-screening and 3-year surveillance intervals (unless shorter
      interval is indicated by individual findings), and a CF-specific intensive bowel 
      preparation. Organ transplant recipients with CF should initiate CRC screening at
      age 30 years within 2 years of the transplantation because of the additional risk
      for colon cancer associated with immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: These
      recommendations aim to help CF adults, families, primary care physicians,
      gastroenterologists, and CF and transplantation centers address the issue of CRC 
      screening. They differ from guidelines developed for the general population with 
      respect to the recommended age of screening initiation, screening method,
      preparation, and the interval for repeat screening and surveillance.

AB  - In June 2016, the National Institutes of Health hosted a workshop on functional
      bowel disorders (FBDs), particularly irritable bowel syndrome, with the objective
      of elucidating gaps in current knowledge and recommending strategies to address
      these gaps. The workshop aimed to provide a roadmap to help strategically guide
      research efforts during the next decade. Attendees were a diverse group of
      internationally recognized leaders in basic and clinical FBD research. This
      document summarizes the results of their deliberations, including the following
      general conclusions and recommendations. First, the high prevalence, economic
      burden, and impact on quality of life associated with FBDs necessitate an urgent 
      need for improved understanding of FBDs. Second, preclinical discoveries are at a
      point that they can be realistically translated into novel diagnostic tests and
      treatments. Third, FBDs are broadly accepted as bidirectional disorders of the
      brain-gut axis, differentially affecting individuals throughout life. Research
      must integrate each component of the brain-gut axis and the influence of
      biological sex, early-life stressors, and genetic and epigenetic factors in
      individual patients. Fourth, research priorities to improve diagnostic and
      management paradigms include enhancement of the provider-patient relationship,
      longitudinal studies to identify risk and protective factors of FBDs,
      identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment
      response, and incorporation of emerging "-omics" discoveries. These paradigms can
      be applied by well-trained clinicians who are familiar with multimodal
      treatments. Fifth, essential components of a successful program will include the 
      generation of a large, validated, broadly accessible database that is rigorously 
      phenotyped; a parallel, linkable biorepository; dedicated resources to support
      peer-reviewed, hypothesis-driven research; access to dedicated bioinformatics
      expertise; and oversight by funding agencies to review priorities, progress, and 
      potential synergies with relevant stakeholders.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The 4 genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV) that infect humans 
      (genotypes 1-4) vary in geographical distribution, transmission, and
      pathogenesis. Little is known about the properties of HEV or its hosts that
      contribute to these variations. Primary isolates grow poorly in cell culture;
      most studies have relied on variants adapted to cancer cell lines, which likely
      alter virus biology. We investigated the infection and replication of primary
      isolates of HEV in hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human embryonic and 
      induced pluripotent stem cells. METHODS: Using a cell culture-adapted genotype 3 
      strain and primary isolates of genotypes 1 to 4, we compared viral replication
      kinetics, sensitivity to drugs, and ability of HEV to activate the innate immune 
      response. We studied HLCs using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction and immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assays. We used an embryonic stem cell line that can be induced to express the
      CRISPR-Cas9 machinery to disrupt the peptidylprolyl isomerase A gene, encoding
      cyclophilin A (CYPA), a protein reported to inhibit replication of cell
      culture-adapted HEV. We further modified this line to rescue expression of CYPA
      before terminal differentiation to HLCs and performed HEV infection studies.
      RESULTS: HLCs were permissive for infection by nonadapted, primary isolates of
      HEV genotypes 1 to 4. HEV infection of HLCs induced a replication-dependent type 
      III interferon response. Replication of primary HEV isolates, unlike the cell
      culture-adapted strain, was not affected by disruption of the peptidylprolyl
      isomerase A gene or exposure to the CYPA inhibitor cyclosporine A. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cell culture adaptations alter the replicative capacities of HEV. HLCs offer an
      improved, physiologically relevant, and genetically tractable system for studying
      the replication of primary HEV isolates. HLCs could provide a model to aid
      development of HEV drugs and a system to guide personalized regimens, especially 
      for patients with chronic hepatitis E who have developed resistance to ribavirin.

AB  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can damage the gastrointestinal
      tract, causing widespread morbidity and mortality. Although mechanisms of damage 
      involve the activities of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1 or
      cyclooxygenase [COX] 1) and PTGS1 (COX2), other factors are involved. We review
      the mechanisms of gastrointestinal damage induction by NSAIDs via COX-mediated
      and COX-independent processes. NSAIDs interact with phospholipids and uncouple
      mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which initiates biochemical changes that
      impair function of the gastrointestinal barrier. The resulting increase in
      intestinal permeability leads to low-grade inflammation. NSAID inhibition of COX 
      enzymes, along with luminal aggressors, results in erosions and ulcers, with
      potential complications of bleeding, protein loss, stricture formation, and
      perforation. We propose a model for NSAID-induced damage to the gastrointestinal 
      tract that includes these complex, interacting, and inter-dependent factors. This
      model highlights the obstacles for the development of safer NSAIDs.

AB  - Concern has arisen about the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
      patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treated with direct-acting
      antivirals (DAAs). To identify patients at risk for HCC, we evaluated serum
      levels of immune mediators before, during, and after DAA treatment of HCV
      infection. Our study included 13 patients who developed HCC within 18 months
      after treatment (3 with HCC recurrence and 10 with new HCC) and 10 patients who
      did not develop HCC (controls), within at least 24 months of treatment (median,
      26 months). We identified a set of 12 immune mediators (cytokines, growth
      factors, and apoptosis markers) whose levels were significantly higher in serum
      before DAA treatment of patients who eventually developed de novo HCC compared
      with controls. A panel of 9 cytokines, measured in serum before treatment (MIG,
      IL22, TRAIL, APRIL, VEGF, IL3, TWEAK, SCF, IL21), identified patients who
      developed de novo HCC with an area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve value higher than 0.8. Further analyses of changes in levels of
      inflammatory cytokines during DAA treatment also provides important information
      about HCV-induced carcinogenesis and the effects of DAAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is increasing
      among elderly persons (60 years or older). We performed a nationwide
      population-based study to estimate incidence and treatment of IBD. METHODS: We
      identified all incident IBD cases in Sweden from 2006 through 2013 using national
      registers and up to 10 matched population comparator subjects. We collected data 
      on the patients' health care contacts and estimated incidence rates, health
      service burden, pharmacologic treatments, extra-intestinal manifestations, and
      surgeries in relation to age of IBD onset (pediatric, <18 years; adults, 18-59
      years; elderly, >/=60 years). RESULTS: Of 27,834 persons diagnosed with incident 
      IBD, 6443 (23%) had a first diagnosis of IBD at 60 years or older, corresponding 
      to an incidence rate of 35/100,000 person-years (10/100,000 person-years for
      Crohn's disease, 19/100,000 person-years for ulcerative colitis, and 5/100,000
      person-years for IBD unclassified). During a median follow-up period of 4.2 years
      (range, 0-9 years), elderly patients had less IBD-specific outpatient health care
      but more IBD-related hospitalizations and overall health care use than adult
      patients with IBD. Compared with patients with pediatric or adult-onset IBD,
      elderly patients used fewer biologics and immunomodulators but more systemic
      corticosteroids. Occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations was similar in
      elderly and adult patients, but bowel surgery was more common in the elderly (13%
      after 5 years vs 10% in adults) (P < .001). The absolute risk of bowel surgery
      was higher in the elderly than in the general population, but in relative terms, 
      the risk increase was larger in younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide 
      cohort study in Sweden, we associated diagnosis of IBD at age 60 years or older
      with a lower use of biologics and immunomodulators but higher absolute risk of
      bowel surgery, compared with diagnosis at a younger age. The large differences in
      pharmacologic treatment of adults and elderly patients are not necessarily
      because of a milder course of disease and warrant further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and risk is higher 
      among those who received an organ transplant. We performed a cost-effectiveness
      analysis to determine optimal CRC screening strategies for patients with cystic
      fibrosis. METHODS: We adjusted the existing Microsimulation Screening
      Analysis-Colon model to reflect increased CRC risk and lower life expectancy in
      patients with cystic fibrosis. Modeling was performed separately for individuals 
      who never received an organ transplant and patients who had received an organ
      transplant. We modeled 76 colonoscopy screening strategies that varied the age
      range and screening interval. The optimal screening strategy was determined based
      on a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per life-year gained. Sensitivity
      and supplementary analyses were performed, including fecal immunochemical test
      (FIT) as an alternative test, earlier ages of transplantation, and increased
      rates of colonoscopy complications, to assess if optimal screening strategies
      would change. RESULTS: Colonoscopy every 5 years, starting at an age of 40 years,
      was the optimal colonoscopy strategy for patients with cystic fibrosis who never 
      received an organ transplant; this strategy prevented 79% of deaths from CRC.
      Among patients with cystic fibrosis who had received an organ transplant, optimal
      colonoscopy screening should start at an age of 30 or 35 years, depending on the 
      patient's age at time of transplantation. Annual FIT screening was predicted to
      be cost-effective for patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the level of
      accuracy of the FIT in this population is not clear. CONCLUSIONS: Using a
      Microsimulation Screening Analysis-Colon model, we found screening of patients
      with cystic fibrosis for CRC to be cost effective. Because of the higher risk of 
      CRC in these patients, screening should start at an earlier age with a shorter
      screening interval. The findings of this study (especially those on FIT
      screening) may be limited by restricted evidence available for patients with
      cystic fibrosis.

TI  - Fructan, Rather Than Gluten, Induces Symptoms in Patients With Self-Reported
      Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is characterized by symptom
      improvement after gluten withdrawal in absence of celiac disease. The mechanisms 
      of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are unclear, and there are no biomarkers for
      this disorder. Foods with gluten often contain fructans, a type of fermentable
      oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols. We aimed to investigate the effect of
      gluten and fructans separately in individuals with self-reported gluten
      sensitivity. METHODS: We performed a double-blind crossover challenge of 59
      individuals on a self-instituted gluten-free diet, for whom celiac disease had
      been excluded. The study was performed at Oslo University Hospital in Norway from
      October 2014 through May 2016. Participants were randomly assigned to groups
      placed on diets containing gluten (5.7 g), fructans (2.1 g), or placebo,
      concealed in muesli bars, for 7 days. Following a minimum 7-day washout period
      (until the symptoms induced by the previous challenge were resolved),
      participants crossed over into a different group, until they completed all 3
      challenges (gluten, fructan, and placebo). Symptoms were measured by
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS)
      version. A linear mixed model for analysis was used. RESULTS: Overall GSRS-IBS
      scores differed significantly during gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges;
      mean values were 33.1 +/- 13.3, 38.6 +/- 12.3, and 34.3 +/- 13.9, respectively (P
      = .04). Mean scores for GSRS-IBS bloating were 9.3 +/- 3.5, 11.6 +/- 3.5, and
      10.1 +/- 3.7, respectively, during the gluten, fructan, and placebo challenges (P
      = .004). The overall GSRS-IBS score for participants consuming fructans was
      significantly higher than for participants consuming gluten (P = .049), as was
      the GSRS bloating score (P = .003). Thirteen participants had the highest overall
      GSRS-IBS score after consuming gluten, 24 had the highest score after consuming
      fructan, and 22 had the highest score after consuming placebo. There was no
      difference in GSRS-IBS scores between gluten and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of individuals
      with self-reported non-celiac gluten sensitivity, we found fructans to induce
      symptoms, measured by the GSRS-IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02464150.

TI  - Efficacy of NVR 3-778, Alone and In Combination With Pegylated Interferon, vs

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: NVR3-778 is a capsid assembly modulator in clinical
      development. We determined the in vivo antiviral efficacy and effects on innate
      and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses of NVR3-778 alone or in
      combination with pegylated interferon alpha (peg-IFN) and compared with
      entecavir. METHODS: We performed 2 studies, with a total of 61 uPA/SCID mice with
      humanized livers. Mice were infected with a hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C
      preparation; we waited 8 weeks for persistent infection of the human hepatocytes 
      in livers of mice. Mice were then randomly assigned to groups (5 or 6 per group) 
      given vehicle (control), NVR3-778, entecavir, peg-IFN, NVR3-778 + entecavir, or
      NVR3-778 + peg-IFN for 6 weeks. We measured levels of HB surface antigen, HB e
      antigen, HBV RNA, alanine aminotransferase, and human serum albumin at different 
      time points. Livers were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry; levels
      of HBV DNA, covalently closed circular DNA, and HBV RNA, along with markers of ER
      stress and IFN response, were quantified. RESULTS: Mice given NVR3-778 or
      entecavir alone for 6 weeks had reduced serum levels of HBV DNA compared with
      controls or mice given peg-IFN. The largest reduction was observed in mice given 
      NVR3-778 + peg-IFN; in all mice in this group, the serum level of HBV DNA was
      below the limit of quantification. NVR3-778 and peg-IFN, but not entecavir, also 
      reduced serum level of HBV RNA. The largest effect was obtained in the NVR3-778 +
      peg-IFN group, in which serum level of HBV RNA was below the limit of
      quantification. Levels of HB surface antigen and HB e antigen were reduced
      significantly in only the groups that received peg-IFN. Levels of covalently
      closed circular DNA did not differ significantly among groups. NVR3-778 was not
      associated with any significant changes in level of alanine aminotransferase, the
      ER stress response, or IFN-stimulated genes. CONCLUSIONS: NVR3-778 has high
      antiviral activity in mice with humanized livers and stable HBV infection,
      reducing levels of serum HBV DNA and HBV RNA. Entecavir reduced levels of serum
      HBV DNA, but had no effect on HBV RNA. The combination of NVR3-778 and peg-IFN
      prevented viral replication and HBV RNA particle production to a greater extent
      than each compound alone or entecavir.

      Increases Severity of Pancreatitis in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute pancreatitis is characterized by premature intracellular
      activation of digestive proteases within pancreatic acini and a consecutive
      systemic inflammatory response. We investigated how these processes interact
      during severe pancreatitis in mice. METHODS: Pancreatitis was induced in C57Bl/6 
      wild-type (control), cathepsin B (CTSB)-knockout, and cathepsin L-knockout mice
      by partial pancreatic duct ligation with supramaximal caerulein injection, or by 
      repetitive supramaximal caerulein injections alone. Immune cells that infiltrated
      the pancreas were characterized by immunofluorescence detection of Ly6g, CD206,
      and CD68. Macrophages were isolated from bone marrow and incubated with bovine
      trypsinogen or isolated acinar cells; the macrophages were then transferred into 
      pancreatitis control or cathepsin-knockout mice. Activities of proteases and
      nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were determined using fluorogenic substrates and
      trypsin activity was blocked by nafamostat. Cytokine levels were measured using a
      cytometric bead array. We performed immunohistochemical analyses to detect
      trypsinogen, CD206, and CD68 in human chronic pancreatitis (n = 13) and acute
      necrotizing pancreatitis (n = 15) specimens. RESULTS: Macrophages were the
      predominant immune cell population that migrated into the pancreas during
      induction of pancreatitis in control mice. CD68-positive macrophages were found
      to phagocytose acinar cell components, including zymogen-containing vesicles, in 
      pancreata from mice with pancreatitis, as well as human necrotic pancreatic
      tissues. Trypsinogen became activated in macrophages cultured with purified
      trypsinogen or co-cultured with pancreatic acini and in pancreata of mice with
      pancreatitis; trypsinogen activation required macrophage endocytosis and
      expression and activity of CTSB, and was sensitive to pH. Activation of
      trypsinogen in macrophages resulted in translocation of NF-kB and production of
      inflammatory cytokines; mice without trypsinogen activation (CTSB-knockout mice) 
      in macrophages developed less severe pancreatitis compared with control mice.
      Transfer of macrophage from control mice to CTSB-knockout mice increased the
      severity of pancreatitis. Inhibition of trypsin activity in macrophages prevented
      translocation of NF-kappaB and production of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS:
      Studying pancreatitis in mice, we found activation of digestive proteases to
      occur not only in acinar cells but also in macrophages that infiltrate pancreatic
      tissue. Activation of the proteases in macrophage occurs during endocytosis of
      zymogen-containing vesicles, and depends on pH and CTSB. This process involves
      macrophage activation via NF-kappaB-translocation, and contributes to systemic
      inflammation and severity of pancreatitis.

AB  - We conducted a case-control exome-wide association study to discover germline
      variants in coding regions that affect risk for pancreatic cancer, combining data
      from 5 studies. We analyzed exome and genome sequencing data from 437 patients
      with pancreatic cancer (cases) and 1922 individuals not known to have cancer
      (controls). In the primary analysis, BRCA2 had the strongest enrichment for rare 
      inactivating variants (17/437 cases vs 3/1922 controls) (P = 3.27x10(-6);
      exome-wide statistical significance threshold P < 2.5x10(-6)). Cases had more
      rare inactivating variants in DNA repair genes than controls, even after
      excluding 13 genes known to predispose to pancreatic cancer (adjusted odds ratio,
      1.35; P = .045). At the suggestive threshold (P < .001), 6 genes were enriched
      for rare damaging variants (UHMK1, AP1G2, DNTA, CHST6, FGFR3, and EPHA1) and 7
      genes had associations with pancreatic cancer risk, based on the sequence-kernel 
      association test. We confirmed variants in BRCA2 as the most common
      high-penetrant genetic factor associated with pancreatic cancer and we also
      identified candidate pancreatic cancer genes. Large collaborations and novel
      approaches are needed to overcome the genetic heterogeneity of pancreatic cancer 
      predisposition.

      Associates With Cyst Size.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS & AIMS: Most guidelines for management of patients with intraductal
      papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) vary in proposed surveillance intervals and
      durations-these are usually determined based on expert opinions rather than
      substantial evidence. The progression of and optimal surveillance intervals for
      branch-duct IPMNs (BD-IPMN) has not been widely studied. We evaluated the
      progression of BD-IPMN under surveillance at a single center, and determined
      optimal follow-up intervals and duration. METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      analysis of 1369 patients with BD-IPMN seen at Seoul National University Hospital
      in Korea from January 2001 through December 2016. We included only patients whose
      imaging studies showed classical features of BD-IPMN, and collected data from
      each patient over time periods of at least 3 years. We reviewed radiologic and
      pathologic findings, and performed linear and binary logistic regressions to
      estimate cyst growth. RESULTS: The median annual growth rate of the cyst was 0.8 
      mm over a median follow-up time of 61 months. During surveillance, 46 patients
      (3.4%) underwent surgery because of disease progression after a median follow-up 
      time (in this group) of 62 months. Worrisome features were observed in 209
      patients (15.3%) during surveillance, including cyst size of 3 cm or more (n =
      109, 8.0%), cyst wall thickening (n = 51, 3.7%), main pancreatic duct dilatation 
      (n = 77, 5.6%), and mural nodule (n = 43, 3.1%). Along with annual rate of cyst
      growth, incidences of main pancreatic duct dilatation and mural nodules
      associated with the sizes of cysts at detection (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      retrospective analysis of patients with BD-IPMN followed for more than 5 years,
      we found most cysts to be indolent, but some rapidly grew and progressed.
      Surveillance protocols should therefore be individualized based on initial cyst
      size and rate of growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the signaling pathways that initiate and
      promote acute pancreatitis (AP). The pathogenesis of AP has been associated with 
      abnormal increases in cytosolic Ca(2+), mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired
      autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We analyzed the mechanisms of
      these dysfunctions and their relationships, and how these contribute to
      development of AP in mice and rats. METHODS: Pancreatitis was induced in C57BL/6J
      mice (control) and mice deficient in peptidylprolyl isomerase D (cyclophilin D,
      encoded by Ppid) by administration of L-arginine (also in rats), caerulein, bile 
      acid, or an AP-inducing diet. Parameters of pancreatitis, mitochondrial function,
      autophagy, ER stress, and lipid metabolism were measured in pancreatic tissue,
      acinar cells, and isolated mitochondria. Some mice with AP were given trehalose
      to enhance autophagic efficiency. Human pancreatitis tissues were analyzed by
      immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreas of mice with
      AP was induced by either mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload or through a Ca(2+)
      overload-independent pathway that involved reduced activity of ATP synthase (80% 
      inhibition in pancreatic mitochondria isolated from rats or mice given
      L-arginine). Both pathways were mediated by cyclophilin D and led to
      mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused 
      pancreatic ER stress, impaired autophagy, and deregulation of lipid metabolism.
      These pathologic responses were abrogated in cyclophilin D-knockout mice.
      Administration of trehalose largely prevented trypsinogen activation, necrosis,
      and other parameters of pancreatic injury in mice with L-arginine AP. Tissues
      from patients with pancreatitis had markers of mitochondrial damage and impaired 
      autophagy, compared with normal pancreas. CONCLUSIONS: In different animal
      models, we find a central role for mitochondrial dysfunction, and for impaired
      autophagy as its principal downstream effector, in development of AP. In
      particular, the pathway involving enhanced interaction of cyclophilin D with ATP 
      synthase mediates L-arginine-induced pancreatitis, a model of severe AP the
      pathogenesis of which has remained unknown. Strategies to restore mitochondrial
      and/or autophagic function might be developed for treatment of AP.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Helicobacter pylori is remarkable for its genetic variation;
      yet, little is known about its genetic changes during early stages of human
      infection, as the bacteria adapt to their new environment. We analyzed genome and
      methylome variations in a fully virulent strain of H pylori during experimental
      infection. METHODS: We performed a randomized Phase I/II, observer-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of 12 healthy, H pylori-negative adults in Germany from 
      October 2008 through March 2010. The volunteers were given a prophylactic vaccine
      candidate (n = 7) or placebo (n = 5) and then challenged with H pylori strain
      BCM-300. Biopsy samples were collected and H pylori were isolated. Genomes of the
      challenge strain and 12 reisolates, obtained 12 weeks after (or in 1 case, 62
      weeks after) infection were sequenced by single-molecule, real-time technology,
      which, in parallel, permitted determination of genome-wide methylation patterns
      for all strains. Functional effects of genetic changes observed in H pylori
      strains during human infection were assessed by measuring release of interleukin 
      8 from AGS cells (to detect cag pathogenicity island function), neutral red
      uptake (to detect vacuolating cytotoxin activity), and adhesion assays. RESULTS: 
      The observed mutation rate was in agreement with rates previously determined from
      patients with chronic H pylori infections, without evidence of a mutation burst. 
      A loss of cag pathogenicity island function was observed in 3 reisolates. In
      addition, 3 reisolates from the vaccine group acquired mutations in the
      vacuolating cytotoxin gene vacA, resulting in loss of vacuolization activity. We 
      observed interstrain variation in methylomes due to phase variation in genes
      encoding methyltransferases. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed adaptation of a fully
      virulent strain of H pylori to 12 different volunteers to obtain a robust
      estimate of the frequency of genetic and epigenetic changes in the absence of
      interstrain recombination. Our findings indicate that the large amount of genetic
      variation in H pylori poses a challenge to vaccine development.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mammalian intestinal epithelium self-renews rapidly and 
      homeostasis is preserved via tightly controlled mechanisms. Long noncoding RNAs
      transcribed from ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) control different cell
      functions, but little is known about their role in maintaining the integrity of
      the intestinal epithelium. We searched for T-UCRs that regulate growth of the
      intestinal mucosa and investigated the mechanism by which T-UCR uc.173 regulates 
      epithelial renewal. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were deprived of food for 48 hours in 
      fasting experiments. Some mice were given intraperitoneal injections of a plasmid
      encoding LNA-anti-uc.173, to knock down endogenous uc.173. For studies using
      organoids, primary enterocytes were isolated from the intestine and transfected
      with the uc.173 transgene to increase uc.173 levels. Intestinal epithelial cells 
      (Caco-2 and IEC-6 lines) were transfected with LNA-anti-uc.173 or uc.173
      transgene. We quantified intestinal epithelial renewal based on BrdU
      incorporation, villus height and crypt depth, and cell number. The association of
      uc.173 with microRNA 195 (miRNA195) was determined by RNA pull-down assays.
      RESULTS: Genome-wide profile analyses identified 21 T-UCRs, including uc.173,
      that were differentially expressed between intestinal mucosa of fasted vs
      non-fasted mice. Increasing levels of uc.173 by expression of a transgene
      increased growth of intestinal epithelial cells and organoids. Decreasing uc.173 
      levels by LNA-anti-uc.173 in mice reduced renewal of the intestinal epithelium.
      We found that uc.173 interacted directly with the primary transcript of miRNA195,
      leading to miRNA195 degradation. CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of intestinal
      epithelial cells and mice, we identified uc.173 noncoding RNA that regulates
      growth of the intestinal mucosa and stimulates intestinal epithelial renewal by
      reducing levels of miRNA195.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Narrow-band imaging is an image-enhanced form of endoscopy
      used to observed microstructures and capillaries of the mucosal epithelium which 
      allows for real-time prediction of histologic features of colorectal polyps.
      However, narrow-band imaging expertise is required to differentiate hyperplastic 
      from neoplastic polyps with high levels of accuracy. We developed and tested a
      system of computer-aided diagnosis with a deep neural network (DNN-CAD) to
      analyze narrow-band images of diminutive colorectal polyps. METHODS: We collected
      1476 images of neoplastic polyps and 681 images of hyperplastic polyps, obtained 
      from the picture archiving and communications system database in a tertiary
      hospital in Taiwan. Histologic findings from the polyps were also collected and
      used as the reference standard. The images and data were used to train the DNN. A
      test set of images (96 hyperplastic and 188 neoplastic polyps, smaller than 5
      mm), obtained from patients who underwent colonoscopies from March 2017 through
      August 2017, was then used to test the diagnostic ability of the DNN-CAD vs
      endoscopists (2 expert and 4 novice), who were asked to classify the images of
      the test set as neoplastic or hyperplastic. Their classifications were compared
      with findings from histologic analysis. The primary outcome measures were
      diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
      negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic time. The accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic time were compared among DNN-CAD, the
      novice endoscopists, and the expert endoscopists. The study was designed to
      detect a difference of 10% in accuracy by a 2-sided McNemar test. RESULTS: In the
      test set, the DNN-CAD identified neoplastic or hyperplastic polyps with 96.3%
      sensitivity, 78.1% specificity, a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%. Fewer than
      half of the novice endoscopists classified polyps with a NPV of 90% (their NPVs
      ranged from 73.9% to 84.0%). DNN-CAD classified polyps as neoplastic or
      hyperplastic in 0.45 +/- 0.07 seconds-shorter than the time required by experts
      (1.54 +/- 1.30 seconds) and nonexperts (1.77 +/- 1.37 seconds) (both P < .001).
      DNN-CAD classified polyps with perfect intra-observer agreement (kappa score of
      1). There was a low level of intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in
      classification among endoscopists. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a system called
      DNN-CAD to identify neoplastic or hyperplastic colorectal polyps less than 5 mm. 
      The system classified polyps with a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%, and in a
      shorter time than endoscopists. This deep-learning model has potential for not
      only endoscopic image recognition but for other forms of medical image analysis, 
      including sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The full spectrum of serious non-gastrointestinal post-colonoscopy
      complications has not been well characterized. We analyzed rates of and factors
      associated with adverse post-colonoscopy gastrointestinal (GI) and
      non-gastrointestinal events (cardiovascular, pulmonary, or infectious)
      attributable to screening or surveillance colonoscopy (S-colo) and non-screening 
      or non-surveillance colonoscopy (NS-colo). METHODS: We performed a
      population-based study of colonoscopy complications using databases from
      California hospital-owned and nonhospital-owned ambulatory facilities, emergency 
      departments, and hospitals from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2011. We
      identified patients who underwent S-colo (1.58 million), NS-colo (1.22 million), 
      or low-risk comparator procedures (joint injection, aspiration, lithotripsy;
      arthroscopy, carpal tunnel; or cataract; 2.02 million) in California's Ambulatory
      Services Databases. We identified patients who developed adverse events within 30
      days, and factors associated with these events, through patient-level linkage to 
      California's Emergency Department and Inpatient Databases. RESULTS: After S-colo,
      the numbers of lower GI bleeding, perforation, myocardial infarction, and
      ischemic stroke per 10,000-persons were 5.3 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      4.8-5.9), 2.9 (95% CI, 2.5-3.3), 2.5 (95% CI, 2.1-2.9), and 4.7 (95% CI, 4.1-5.2)
      without biopsy or intervention; with biopsy or intervention, numbers per
      10,000-persons were 36.4 (95% CI, 35.1-37.6), 6.3 (95% CI, 5.8-6.8), 4.2 (95% CI,
      3.8-4.7), and 9.1 (95% CI, 8.5-9.7). Rates of dysrhythmia were higher. After
      NS-colo, event rates were substantially higher. Most serious complications led to
      hospitalization, and most GI complications occurred within 14 days of
      colonoscopy. Ranges of adjusted odds ratios for serious GI complications,
      myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and serious pulmonary events after S-colo
      vs comparator procedures were 2.18 (95% CI, 2.02-2.36) to 5.13 (95% CI,
      4.81-5.47), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.56-0.81) to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.83-1.19), 0.66 (95% CI,
      0.59-0.75) to 1.13 (95% CI, 0.99-1.29), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68) to 1.05 (95%
      CI, 0.98-1.11). Biopsy or intervention, comorbidity, black race, low income,
      public insurance, and NS-colo were associated with post-colonoscopy adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in California, we found that
      following S-colo, rates of serious GI adverse events were low but clinically
      relevant, and that rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and serious pulmonary 
      events were no higher than after low-risk comparator procedures. Rates of
      myocardial infarction are similar to, but rates of stroke are higher than, those 
      reported for the general population.

      Pediatric Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Differentiate Disease

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We analyzed DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes of
      primary intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) of children newly diagnosed with
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) to learn more about pathogenesis. METHODS: We
      obtained mucosal biopsies (N = 236) collected from terminal ileum and ascending
      and sigmoid colons of children (median age 13 years) newly diagnosed with IBD (43
      with Crohn's disease [CD], 23 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), and 30 children
      without IBD (controls). Patients were recruited and managed at a hospital in the 
      United Kingdom from 2013 through 2016. We also obtained biopsies collected at
      later stages from a subset of patients. IECs were purified and analyzed for
      genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and gene expression profiles. Adjacent
      microbiota were isolated from biopsies and analyzed by 16S gene sequencing. We
      generated intestinal organoid cultures from a subset of samples and genome-wide
      DNA methylation analysis was performed. RESULTS: We found gut segment-specific
      differences in DNA methylation and transcription profiles of IECs from children
      with IBD vs controls; some were independent of mucosal inflammation. Changes in
      gut microbiota between IBD and control groups were not as large and were
      difficult to assess because of large amounts of intra-individual variation. Only 
      IECs from patients with CD had changes in DNA methylation and transcription
      patterns in terminal ileum epithelium, compared with controls. Colon epithelium
      from patients with CD and from patients with ulcerative colitis had distinct
      changes in DNA methylation and transcription patterns, compared with controls. In
      IECs from patients with IBD, changes in DNA methylation, compared with controls, 
      were stable over time and were partially retained in ex-vivo organoid cultures.
      Statistical analyses of epithelial cell profiles allowed us to distinguish
      children with CD or UC from controls; profiles correlated with disease outcome
      parameters, such as the requirement for treatment with biologic agents.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified specific changes in DNA methylation and transcriptome 
      patterns in IECs from pediatric patients with IBD compared with controls. These
      data indicate that IECs undergo changes during IBD development and could be
      involved in pathogenesis. Further analyses of primary IECs from patients with IBD
      could improve our understanding of the large variations in disease progression
      and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates gastrointestinal
      function via different subtypes of neurons, organized into fine-tuned neural
      circuits. It is not clear how cell diversity is created within the embryonic ENS;
      information required for development of cell-based therapies and models of
      enteric neuropathies. We aimed to identify proteins that regulate ENS
      differentiation and network formation. METHODS: We generated and compared RNA
      expression profiles of the entire ENS, ENS progenitor cells, and non-ENS gut
      cells of mice, collected at embryonic days 11.5 and 15.5, when different subtypes
      of neurons are formed. Gastrointestinal tissues from R26ReYFP reporter mice
      crossed to Sox10-CreER(T2) or Wnt1-Cre mice were dissected and the 6 populations 
      of cells were isolated by flow cytometry. We used histochemistry to map
      differentially expressed proteins in mouse and human gut tissues at different
      stages of development, in different regions. We examined enteric neuronal
      diversity and gastric function in Wnt1-Cre x Sox6(fl/fl) mice, which do not
      express the Sox6 gene in the ENS. RESULTS: We identified 147 transcription and
      signaling factors that varied in spatial and temporal expression during
      development of the mouse ENS. Of the factors also analyzed in human ENS, most
      were conserved. We uncovered 16 signaling pathways (such as fibroblast growth
      factor and Eph/ephrin pathways). Transcription factors were grouped according to 
      their specific expression in enteric progenitor cells (such as MEF2C), enteric
      neurons (such as SOX4), or neuron subpopulations (such as SATB1 and SOX6). Lack
      of SOX6 in the ENS reduced the numbers of gastric dopamine neurons and delayed
      gastric emptying. CONCLUSIONS: Using transcriptome and histochemical analyses of 
      the developing mouse and human ENS, we mapped expression patterns of
      transcription and signaling factors. Further studies of these candidate
      determinants might elucidate the mechanisms by which enteric stem cells
      differentiate into neuronal subtypes and form distinct connectivity patterns
      during ENS development. We found expression of SOX6 to be required for
      development of gastric dopamine neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: B cells infiltrate tumors, but little is known about how they 
      affect tumor growth and progression. microRNA15A (MIR15A or miRNA15A) and
      microRNA16-1 (MIR16-1 or miRNA16-1) regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
      drug resistance. We investigated their involvement in B-cell-mediated immune
      suppression by colorectal tumors. METHODS: Mice with disruptions of the gene
      cluster that encodes MIR15A and MIR16-1 (knockout mice), and control (C57BL/B6)
      mice were given azoxymethane with dextran sodium sulfate (AD) to induce formation
      of colorectal tumors. Mice were given anti-CD20 to delete B cells, or injections 
      of agomir to increase MIR15A and MIR16-1. Proliferation of CD8(+)T cells was
      measured by carboxyfluorescein-succinimidyl-ester analysis. Colon tissues were
      collected from mice and analyzed by flow cytometry, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing, 
      and for cytokine production. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were isolated and
      transfected with miRNA mimics, to identify their targets. We analyzed miRNA
      expression patterns and quantified B cells in colorectal cancer tissue
      microarrays derived from 90 patients who underwent surgical resection, from July 
      2006 through April 2008, in Shanghai, China; expression data were compared with
      clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Tumors that developed in knockout mice following
      administration of AD were larger and contained greater numbers of B cells than
      tumors that grew in control mice. Most of the B cells in the tumors were positive
      for immunoglobulin A (IgA(+)). IgA(+) B cells expressed high levels of immune
      regulatory molecules (programmed death ligand 1, interleukin 10, and transforming
      growth factor beta), and repressed the proliferation and activation of CD8(+) T
      cells. Levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 were reduced in colon tumors from mice,
      compared with nontumor colon tissue. Incubation of IECs with IL17A reduced
      expression of MIR15A and MIR16-1. Transgenic expression of MIR15A and MIR16-1 in 
      IECs decreased activation of NF-kappaB and STAT1 by reducing expression of
      I-kappaB kinases; this resulted in reduced production of chemokine (C-X-C motif) 
      ligands 9 and 10 and decreased chemotaxis of IgA(+) B cells. Tumors in mice
      injected with AD and agomir grew more slowly than tumors in mice not given in
      agomir and contained fewer IgA(+) B cells. We found a negative correlation
      between levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 and numbers of IgA(+)B cells in human
      colorectal tumor tissues; high levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 and low numbers of
      IgA(+)B cells were associated with longer survival times of patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found increased levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1 to reduce numbers of
      IgA(+) B cells in colorectal tumor tissues and correlate with increased survival 
      time of patients. In mice that lack MIR15A and MIR16-1, colon tumors grow more
      rapidly and contain increased numbers of IgA(+) B cells. MIR15A and MIR16-1
      appear to activate signaling pathways required for B-cell-mediated immune
      suppression.

TI  - Interleukin 35 Expression Correlates With Microvessel Density in Pancreatic
      Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Recruits Monocytes, and Promotes Growth and Angiogenesis
      of Xenograft Tumors in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cells of the monocyte lineage contribute to tumor
      angiogenesis. Interleukin 35 (IL35) is a member of the IL12 family produced by
      regulatory, but not effector, T cells. IL35 is a dimer comprising the IL12 alpha 
      and IL27 beta chains, encoded by IL12A and EBI3, respectively. Expression of IL35
      is increased in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) compared with normal
      pancreatic tissues, and promotes metastasis. We investigated the role of IL35 in 
      monocyte-induced angiogenesis of PDAC in mice. METHODS: We measured levels of
      IL35 protein, microvessel density, and numbers of monocytes in 123 sequential
      PDAC tissues from patients who underwent surgery in China in 2010. We performed
      studies with the human PDAC cell lines CFPAC-1, BxPC-3, Panc-1, MIA-PaCa-2, and
      mouse PDAC cell line Pan02. Monocyte subsets were isolated by flow cytometry from
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Fused human or mouse IL12A and EBI3
      genes were overexpressed in PDAC cells or knocked down using small hairpin RNAs. 
      Cells were grown as xenograft tumors in SCID mice; some mice were given
      injections of an IL35-neutralizing antibody and tumor growth was monitored. We
      performed chemotaxis assays to measure the ability of IL35 to recruit monocytes. 
      We analyzed mRNA sequences of 179 PDACs in the Cancer Genome Atlas to identify
      correlations between expression of IL12A and EBI3 and monocyte markers. Monocytes
      incubated with IL35 or PDAC cell supernatants were analyzed in tube formation and
      endothelial migration assays. RESULTS: In PDAC samples from patients, levels of
      IL35 mRNA and protein correlated with microvessel density and infiltration of
      monocyte lineage cells. In cells and mice with xenograft tumors, IL35 increased
      recruitment of monocytes into PDAC tumors, which required CCL5. Upon exposure to 
      IL35, monocytes increased expression of genes whose products promote angiogenesis
      (CXCL1 and CXCL8). IL35 activated transcription of CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL8 by
      inducing GP130 signaling, via IL12RB2 and phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT4. A
      combination of a neutralizing antibody against IL35 and gemcitabine significantly
      decreased monocyte infiltration, microvessel density, and volume of xenograft
      tumors grown from PDAC cells in mice. CONCLUSIONS: PDAC cells produce IL35 to
      recruit monocytes via CCL5 and induce macrophage to promote angiogenesis via
      expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8. IL35 signaling promotes angiogenesis and growth of
      xenograft tumors from PDAC cells in mice. IL35 might serve as a therapeutic
      target for patients with pancreatic cancer.

TI  - TLR7 Agonist Increases Responses of Hepatitis B Virus-Specific T Cells and
      Natural Killer Cells in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Treated With
      Nucleos(T)Ide Analogues.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30072-6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The oral Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist GS-9620 has
      antiviral effects in woodchuck and chimpanzee models of chronic hepatitis B virus
      (HBV) infection. We investigated, in a clinical trial, the capacity of this agent
      to reconstitute protective immunity in patients with chronic HBV infection.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 28 patients with suppression of HBV 
      infection by nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy and who tested negative for hepatitis
      B e antigen at 4 medical centers in Italy. Patients were randomly assigned
      (1:3:3:3) to groups given placebo or different doses of GS-9620 (1, 2, and 4 mg, 
      weekly for 12 weeks). We added data from 8 patients receiving nucleos(t)ide
      analogue therapy to the placebo group (controls); 13 treatment-naive patients
      with chronic HBV infection and 15 subjects who spontaneously recovered from an
      acute HBV infection served as additional controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells were collected at baseline, during administration of GS-9620 or placebo,
      and 12 weeks afterward. Phenotype and function of natural killer (NK) and
      HBV-specific T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. T cells were expanded by
      incubation with peptides from the entire HBV proteome and studied after overnight
      or 10 days culture. NK-cell inhibition of T-cell responses was measured by
      assessing cytokine production by T cells stimulated with peptides in the presence
      or absence of NK cells. RESULTS: T cells collected at baseline before addition of
      GS-9620, when patients were receiving only nucleos(t)ide therapy, had greater
      responses to HBV than T cells from treatment-naive patients, based on cytokine
      production in response to HBV peptides. However, during or after administration
      of GS-9620, T cells produced higher levels of cytokines compared to baseline.
      NK-cell activation and function increased after patients were given GS-9620, but 
      the ability of NK cells to suppress T-cell responses was lower during GS-9620
      therapy than before. Changes in T-cell or NK-cell function did not correlate with
      levels of hepatitis B surface antigen. Serum levels of hepatitis B surface
      antigen did not decrease significantly compared to baseline in patients given any
      dose of GS-9620. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks administration of GS-9620 had no
      significant effect on serum hepatitis B surface antigen levels, but did appear to
      increase T-cell and NK-cell responses and reduce the ability of NK to suppress T 
      cells. GS-9620 might therefore be included in therapies to increase the immune
      response to HBV.

TI  - Histologic Factors Associated With Need for Surgery in Patients With Pedunculated
      T1 Colorectal Carcinomas.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most patients with pedunculated T1 colorectal tumors referred 
      for surgery are not found to have lymph node metastases, and were therefore
      unnecessarily placed at risk for surgery-associated complications. We aimed to
      identify the factors associated with need for surgery in patients with
      pedunculated T1 colorectal tumors. METHODS: We performed a cohort-nested matched 
      case-control study of 708 patients diagnosed with pedunculated T1 colorectal
      tumors at 13 hospitals in The Netherlands, from January 1, 2000 through December 
      31, 2014, followed for a median of 44 months (interquartile range, 20-80 months).
      We identified 37 patients (5.2%) who required surgery (due to lymph node,
      intramural, or distant metastases). These patients were matched with patients
      with pedunculated T1 colorectal tumors without a need for surgery (no metastases,
      controls, n = 111). Blinded pathologists analyzed specimens from each tumor,
      stained with H&E. We evaluated associations between histologic factors and
      patient need for surgery using univariable conditional logistic regression
      analysis. We used multivariable least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
      (LASSO; an online version of the LASSO model is available at:
      http://t1crc.com/calculator/) regression to develop models for identification of 
      patients with tumors requiring surgery, and tested the accuracy of our model by
      projecting our case-control data toward the entire cohort (708 patients). We
      compared our model with previously developed strategies to identify high-risk
      tumors: conventional model 1 (based on poor differentiation, lymphovascular
      invasion, or Haggitt level 4) and conventional model 2 (based on poor
      differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, Haggitt level 4, or tumor budding).
      RESULTS: We identified 5 histologic factors that differentiated cases from
      controls: lymphovascular invasion, Haggitt level 4 invasion, muscularis mucosae
      type B (incompletely or completely disrupted), poorly differentiated clusters and
      tumor budding, which identified patients who required surgery with an area under 
      the curve (AUC) value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.90). When we used 
      a clinically plausible predicted probability threshold of >/=4.0%, 67.5% (478 of 
      708) of patients were predicted to not need surgery. This threshold identified
      patients who required surgery with 83.8% sensitivity (95% confidence interval,
      68.0%-93.8%) and 70.3% specificity (95% confidence interval, 60.9%-78.6%).
      Conventional models 1 and 2 identified patients who required surgery with lower
      AUC values (AUC, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.74; P = .002 and AUC, 0.64; 95% CI,
      0.58-0.70; P < .001, respectively) than our LASSO model. When we applied our
      LASSO model with a predicted probability threshold of >/=4.0%, the percentage of 
      missed cases (tumors mistakenly assigned as low risk) was comparable (6 of 478
      [1.3%]) to that of conventional model 1 (4 of 307 [1.3%]) and conventional model 
      2 (3 of 244 [1.2%]). However, the percentage of patients referred for surgery
      based on our LASSO model was much lower (32.5%, n = 230) than that for
      conventional model 1 (56.6%, n = 401) or conventional model 2 (65.5%, n = 464).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort-nested matched case-control study of 708 patients with
      pedunculated T1 colorectal carcinomas, we developed a model based on histologic
      features of tumors that identifies patients who require surgery (due to high risk
      of metastasis) with greater accuracy than previous models. Our model might be
      used to identify patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with mood
      disorders, such as anxiety or depression, but it is not clear whether one
      contributes to development of the other, or if the interaction is bi-directional 
      (anxiety or depression contributes to the progression of IBD, and IBD affects
      psychological health). We performed a 2-year longitudinal prospective study of
      patients in secondary to care investigate the bi-directionality of IBD and mood
      disorders. METHODS: We collected data from 405 adult patients with a diagnosis of
      Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) from November 2012 through June
      2017. Demographic features, subtypes of IBD, treatments, symptoms, somatization, 
      and fecal level of calprotectin were recorded at baseline. IBD activity was
      determined at baseline and after the follow-up period (2 years or more) using the
      Harvey-Bradshaw Index for CD and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index for
      UC (scores >/=5 used to define disease activity). Anxiety and depression data
      were collected using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), at
      baseline and after the follow-up period. Objective markers of disease activity,
      including glucocorticosteroid prescription or flare of disease activity,
      escalation of therapy, hospitalization secondary to IBD activity, and intestinal 
      resection during follow-up were assessed via case note review. A brain-gut
      direction of disease activity was defined as development of new IBD activity in
      patients with quiescent IBD and abnormal HADS scores at baseline. A gut-brain
      direction of disease activity was defined by subsequent development of abnormal
      HADS scores in patients with active IBD and normal HADS scores at baseline. We
      performed multivariate Cox regression controlling for patient characteristics and
      follow-up duration. RESULTS: Baseline CD or UC disease activity were associated
      with an almost 6-fold increase in risk for a later abnormal anxiety score (hazard
      ratio [HR], 5.77; 95% CI, 1.89-17.7). In patients with quiescent IBD at baseline,
      baseline abnormal anxiety scores were associated with later need for
      glucocorticosteroid prescription or flare of IBD activity (HR, 2.08; 95% CI,
      1.31-3.30) and escalation of therapy (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.19-2.80). These
      associations persisted when normal IBD activity index scores and fecal level of
      calprotectin <250 mug/g were used to define quiescent disease at baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a 2-year study of patients with CD or UC, we found evidence for
      bi-directional effects of IBD activity and psychological disorders. Patients with
      IBD should be monitored for psychological well-being.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.024 [doi]
AB  - Lamins have important roles in nuclear structure and cell signaling. Several
      diseases are associated with mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA in humans).
      Patients with familial partial lipodystrophy caused by LMNA mutations develop
      pancreatitis, but it is not clear how these mutations affect pancreatic function.
      We generated mice with inducible exocrine pancreas-specific disruption of Lmna
      and showed that LMNA is lost from most exocrine pancreas cells. LMNA-knockout
      pancreata develop endoplasmic reticulum stress with loss of acinar cell markers, 
      increased autophagy, apoptosis, and cell proliferation, compared to CreERT2(-)
      mice (littermate controls). Disruption of Lmna led to a phenotype that resembled 
      chronic pancreatitis, with increased Sirius Red staining and alpha-smooth muscle 
      actin in male LMNA-knockout mice compared to littermate males, but not in female 
      mice. LMNA-knockout pancreata have reduced levels of RB and activation of E2F,
      based on increased expression of its target genes. Therefore, lamins maintain
      pancreatic homeostasis by regulating RB stability and E2F activity.

TI  - Ceragenin CSA13 Reduces Clostridium difficile Infection in Mice by Modulating the
      Intestinal Microbiome and Metabolites.
LID - S0016-5085(18)30067-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clostridium difficile induces intestinal inflammation by
      releasing toxins A and B. The antimicrobial compound cationic steroid
      antimicrobial 13 (CSA13) has been developed for treating gastrointestinal
      infections. The CSA13-Eudragit formulation can be given orally and releases CSA13
      in the terminal ileum and colon. We investigated whether this form of CSA13
      reduces C difficile infection (CDI) in mice. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were infected
      with C difficile on day 0, followed by subcutaneous administration of pure CSA13 
      or oral administration of CSA13-Eudragit (10 mg/kg/d for 10 days). Some mice were
      given intraperitoneal vancomycin (50 mg/kg daily) on days 0-4 and relapse was
      measured after antibiotic withdrawal. The mice were monitored until day 20; colon
      and fecal samples were collected on day 3 for analysis. Blood samples were
      collected for flow cytometry analyses. Fecal pellets were collected each day from
      mice injected with CSA13 and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
      or 16S sequencing; feces were also homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline and
      fed to mice with CDI via gavage. RESULTS: CDI of mice caused 60% mortality,
      significant bodyweight loss, and colonic damage 3 days after infection; these
      events were prevented by subcutaneous injection of CSA13 or oral administration
      CSA13-Eudragit. There was reduced relapse of CDI after administration of CSA13
      was stopped. Levels of CSA13 in feces from mice given CSA13-Eudragit were
      significantly higher than those of mice given subcutaneous CSA13. Subcutaneous
      and oral CSA13 each significantly increased the abundance of
      Peptostreptococcaceae bacteria and reduced the abundance of C difficile in fecal 
      samples of mice. When feces from mice with CDI and given CSA13 were fed to mice
      with CDI that had not received CSA13, the recipient mice had significantly
      increased rates of survival. CSA13 reduced fecal levels of inflammatory
      metabolites (endocannabinoids) and increased fecal levels of 4 protective
      metabolites (ie, citrulline, 3-aminoisobutyric acid, retinol, and ursodeoxycholic
      acid) in mice with CDI. Oral administration of these CSA13-dependent protective
      metabolites reduced the severity of CDI. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of mice, we
      found the CSA13-Eudragit formulation to be effective in eradicating CDI by
      modulating the intestinal microbiota and metabolites.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2018.01.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) have been associated
      with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Little is known about their prevalence among
      patients with cirrhosis or clinical effects. We investigated the prevalence and
      characteristics of SPSS in patients with cirrhosis and their outcomes. METHODS:
      We performed a retrospective study of 1729 patients with cirrhosis who underwent 
      abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging analysis from 2010
      through 2015 at 14 centers in Canada and Europe. We collected data on demographic
      features, etiology of liver disease, comorbidities, complications, treatments,
      laboratory and clinical parameters, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
      score, and endoscopy findings. Abdominal images were reviewed by a radiologist
      (or a hepatologist trained by a radiologist) and searched for the presence of
      SPSS, defined as spontaneous communications between the portal venous system or
      splanchnic veins and the systemic venous system, excluding gastroesophageal
      varices. Patients were assigned to groups with large SPSS (L-SPSS, >/=8 mm),
      small SPSS (S-SPSS, <8 mm), or without SPSS (W-SPSS). The main outcomes were the 
      incidence of complications of cirrhosis and mortality according to the presence
      of SPSS. Secondary measurements were the prevalence of SPSS in patients with
      cirrhosis and their radiologic features. RESULTS: L-SPSS were identified in 488
      (28%) patients, S-SPSS in 548 (32%) patients, and no shunt (W-SPSS) in 693 (40%) 
      patients. The most common L-SPSS was splenorenal (46% of L-SPSS). The presence
      and size of SPSS increased with liver dysfunction: among patients with MELD
      scores of 6-9, 14% had L-SPSS and 28% had S-SPSS; among patients with MELD scores
      of 10-13, 30% had L-SPSS and 34% had S-SPSS; among patients with MELD scores of
      14 or higher, 40% had L-SPSS and 32% had S-SPSS (P < .001 for multiple comparison
      among MELD groups). HE was reported in 48% of patients with L-SPSS, 34% of
      patients with S-SPSS, and 20% of patients W-SPSS (P < .001 for multiple
      comparison among SPSS groups). Recurrent or persistent HE was reported in 52% of 
      patients with L-SPSS, 44% of patients with S-SPSS, and 37% of patients W-SPSS (P 
      = .007 for multiple comparison among SPSS groups). Patients with SPSS also had a 
      larger number of portal hypertension-related complications (bleeding or ascites) 
      than those W-SPSS. Quality of life and transplantation-free survival were lower
      in patients with SPSS vs without. SPSS were an independent factor associated with
      death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval,
      1.06-1.49) (P = .008) in multivariate analysis. When patients were stratified by 
      MELD score, SPSS were associated with HE independently of liver function: among
      patients with MELD scores of 6-9, HE was reported in 23% with L-SPSS, 12% with
      S-SPSS, and 5% with W-SPSS (P < .001 for multiple comparison among SPSS groups); 
      among those with MELD scores of 10-13, HE was reported in 48% with L-SPSS, 33%
      with S-SPSS, and 23% with W-SPSS (P < .001 for multiple comparison among SPSS
      groups); among patients with MELD scores of 14 or more, HE was reported in 59%
      with L-SPSS, 57% with S-SPSS, and 48% with W-SPSS (P = .043 for multiple
      comparison among SPSS groups). Patients with SPSS and MELD scores of 6-9 were at 
      higher risk for ascites (40.5% vs 23%; P < .001) and bleeding (15% vs 9%; P =
      .038) than patients W-SPSS and had lower odds of transplant-free survival (hazard
      ratio 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.51) (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      retrospective analysis of almost 2000 patients, we found 60% to have SPSS;
      prevalence increases with deterioration of liver function. SPSS increase risk for
      HE and chronic course. In patients with preserved liver function, SPSS increase
      risk for complications and death. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02692430.

      Basolateral Exocytosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic acinar cells are polarized epithelial cells that
      store enzymes required for digestion as inactive zymogens, tightly packed at the 
      cell apex. Stimulation of acinar cells causes the zymogen granules to fuse with
      the apical membrane, and the cells undergo exocytosis to release proteases into
      the intestinal lumen. Autophagy maintains homeostasis of pancreatic acini.
      Syntaxin 2 (STX2), an abundant soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor
      attachment protein receptor in pancreatic acini, has been reported to mediate
      apical exocytosis. Using human pancreatic tissues and STX2-knockout (KO) mice, we
      investigated the functions of STX2 in zymogen granule-mediated exocytosis and
      autophagy. METHODS: We obtained pancreatic tissues from 5 patients undergoing
      surgery for pancreatic cancer and prepared 80-mum slices; tissues were exposed to
      supramaximal cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) or ethanol and a low
      concentration of CCK-8 and analyzed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence
      analyses. STX2-KO mice and syntaxin 2(+/+) C57BL6 mice (controls) were given
      intraperitoneal injections of supramaximal caerulein (a CCK-8 analogue) or fed
      ethanol and then given a low dose of caerulein to induce acute pancreatitis, or
      saline (controls); pancreata were isolated and analyzed by histology and
      immunohistochemistry. Acini were isolated from mice, incubated with CCK-8, and
      analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy or used in immunoprecipitation
      experiments. Exocytosis was quantified using live-cell exocytosis and Ca(2+)
      imaging analyses and based on formation of exocytotic soluble N-ethyl maleimide
      sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes. Dysregulations in
      autophagy were identified using markers, electron and immunofluorescence
      microscopy, and protease activation assays. RESULTS: Human pancreatic tissues and
      dispersed pancreatic acini from control mice exposed to CCK-8 or ethanol plus
      CCK-8 were depleted of STX2. STX2-KO developed more severe pancreatitis after
      administration of supramaximal caerulein or a 6-week ethanol diet compared with
      control. Acini from STX2-KO mice had increased apical exocytosis after exposure
      to CCK-8, as well as increased basolateral exocytosis, which led to ectopic
      release of proteases. These increases in apical and basolateral exocytosis
      required increased formation of fusogenic soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive
      factor attachment protein receptor complexes, mediated by STX3 and STX4. STX2
      bound ATG16L1 and prevented it from binding clathrin. Deletion of STX2 from acini
      increased binding of AT16L1 to clathrin, increasing formation of
      pre-autophagosomes and inducing autophagy. Induction of autophagy promoted the
      CCK-8-induced increase in autolysosome formation and the activation of
      trypsinogen. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of human pancreatic tissues and pancreata
      from STX2-KO and control mice, we found STX2 to block STX3- and STX4-mediated
      fusion of zymogen granules with the plasma membrane and exocytosis and prevent
      binding of ATG16L1 to clathrin, which contributes to induction of autophagy.
      Exposure of pancreatic tissues to CCK-8 or ethanol depletes acinar cells of STX2,
      increasing basolateral exocytosis and promoting autophagy induction, leading to
      activation of trypsinogen.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic and impose significant,
      multidimensional burdens on patients and health care systems. The increasing
      prevalence of IBD will only worsen this problem globally-population health
      management (PHM) strategies are needed to increase quality of care and population
      health outcomes while reducing health care costs. We discuss the key components
      of PHM in IBD. Effective implementation of PHM strategies requires accurate
      identification of at-risk patients and key areas of variability in care.
      Improving outcomes of the at-risk population requires implementation of a
      multicomponent chronic care model designed to shift delivery of ambulatory care
      from acute, episodic, and reactive encounters, to proactive, planned, long-term
      care. This is achieved through team care of an activated patient with the help of
      remote monitoring, clinical information systems, and integrated decision support,
      with accompanying changes in delivery systems. Performance measurement is
      integral to any PHM strategy. This involves developing and implementing
      meaningful metrics of different phases of quality of IBD care and measuring them 
      efficiently using modern clinical information systems. Such an integrated
      framework of PHM in IBD will facilitate the delivery of high-value care to
      patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are few effective treatments for nausea and other
      symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and related syndromes. We performed a
      randomized trial of the ability of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist
      aprepitant to reduce symptoms in patients with chronic nausea and vomiting caused
      by gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a 4-week
      multicenter, double-masked trial of 126 patients with at least moderate symptoms 
      of chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin for a minimum of 6
      months. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given oral aprepitant (125
      mg/day, n = 63) or placebo (n = 63). The primary outcome from the
      intention-to-treat analysis was reduction in nausea, defined as a decrease of 25 
      mm or more, or absolute level below 25 mm, on a daily patient-reported 0-to-100
      visual analog scale (VAS) of nausea severity. We calculated relative risks of
      nausea improvement using stratified Cochran-Mental-Haenszel analysis. RESULTS:
      Aprepitant did not reduce symptoms of nausea, based on the primary outcome
      measure (46% reduction in the VAS score in the aprepitant group vs 40% reduction 
      in the placebo group; relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) (P = .43). However,
      patients in the aprepitant group had significant changes in secondary outcomes
      such as reduction in symptom severity (measured by the 0-5 Gastroparesis Clinical
      Symptom Index) for nausea (1.8 vs 1.0; P = .005), vomiting (1.6 vs 0.5; P =
      .001), and overall symptoms (1.3 vs 0.7; P = .001). Adverse events, predominantly
      mild or moderate in severity grade, were more common in aprepitant (22 of 63
      patients, 35% vs 11 of 63, 17% in the placebo group) (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      randomized trial of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting caused by
      gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like syndrome, aprepitant did not reduce the
      severity of nausea when reduction in VAS score was used as the primary outcome.
      However, aprepitant had varying effects on secondary outcomes of symptom
      improvement. These findings support the need to identify appropriate patient
      outcomes for trials of therapies for gastroparesis, including potential
      additional trials for aprepitant. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT01149369.

AB  - Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis and fulminant liver failure. However, due to a shortage
      of donor livers and complications associated with immune suppression, there is an
      urgent need for new therapeutic strategies for patients with end-stage liver
      diseases. Given their unique function in self-renewal and differentiation
      potential, stem cells might be used to regenerate damaged liver tissue. Recent
      studies have shown that stem cell-based therapies can improve liver function in a
      mouse model of hepatic failure. Moreover, acellular liver scaffolds seeded with
      hepatocytes produced functional bioengineered livers for organ transplantation in
      preclinical studies. The therapeutic potential of stem cells or their
      differentiated progenies will depend on their capacity to differentiate into
      mature and functional cell types after transplantation. It will also be important
      to devise methods to overcome their genomic instability, immune reactivity, and
      tumorigenic potential. We review directions and advances in the use of
      mesenchymal stem cells and their derived hepatocytes for liver regeneration. We
      also discuss the potential applications of hepatocytes derived from human
      pluripotent stem cells and challenges to using these cells in treating end-stage 
      liver disease.

AB  - The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is complex and
      involves changes in reflux exposure, epithelial resistance, and visceral
      sensitivity. The gastric refluxate is a noxious material that injures the
      esophagus and elicits symptoms. Esophageal exposure to gastric refluxate is the
      primary determinant of disease severity. This exposure arises via compromise of
      the anti-reflux barrier and reduced ability of the esophagus to clear and buffer 
      the refluxate, leading to reflux disease. However, complications and symptoms
      also occur in the context of normal reflux burden, when there is either poor
      epithelial resistance or increased visceral sensitivity. Reflux therefore
      develops via alterations in the balance of aggressive and defensive forces.

AB  - Esophageal cancer is characterized by early and frequent metastasis. Surgery is
      the primary treatment for early-stage disease, whereas patients with patients
      with locally advanced disease receive perioperative chemotherapy or
      chemoradiotherapy. Squamous cancers can be treated with primary chemoradiotherapy
      without surgery, depending on their response to therapy and patient tolerance for
      subsequent surgery. Chemotherapy with a fluorinated pyrimidine and a platinum
      agent, followed by later treatment with taxanes and irinotecan, provides some
      benefit. Agents that inhibit the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2 or
      HER2), or vascular endothelial growth factor, including trastuzumab, ramucirumab,
      and apatinib, increase response and survival times. Esophageal adenocarcinomas
      have mutations in tumor protein p53 and mutations that activate
      receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cell
      cycle pathways, whereas esophageal squamous tumors have a distinct set of
      mutations. Esophageal cancers develop systems to evade anti-tumor immune
      responses, but studies are needed to determine how immune checkpoint modification
      contributes to esophageal tumor development.

AB  - Although researchers have identified genetic alterations that contribute to
      development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, we know little about features of
      patients or environmental factors that mediate progression of chronic acid
      biliary reflux to Barrett's esophagus and cancer. Increasing our understanding of
      the mechanisms by which normal squamous epithelium progresses to early-stage
      invasive cancer will help formulate rational surveillance guidelines and allow us
      to divest resources away from patients at low risk of malignancy. We review the
      cellular and genetic alterations that occur during progression of Barrett's
      esophagus, based on findings from clinical studies and mouse models of disease.
      We review the features of the luminal and mucosal microenvironment of Barrett's
      esophagus that promote, in a small proportion of patients, development of
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. Markers of clonal evolution can be used to determine
      patient risk for cancer and set surveillance intervals.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) are determined by cancer-related and non-related events. Treatments for
      hepatitis C virus infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients
      receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable
      end point. We performed a competing-risk analysis to evaluate factors associated 
      with survival of patients with HCC and developed a prognostic model based on
      features of HCC patients before liver transplantation. METHODS: We performed
      multivariable competing-risk regression analysis to identify factors associated
      with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The
      training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC 
      from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The
      validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver
      transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in
      Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver
      disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
      model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of
      treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates,
      and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC
      recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor
      relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative
      incidence of death was segregated for hepatitis C virus status. RESULTS: In the
      competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of
      AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P < .001), returning
      an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95% confidence interval, 0.763-0.798). Five-year
      cumulative incidence of non-HCC-related death was 8.6% in HCV-negative patients
      and 18.1% in HCV-positive patients. For patients with HCC to have a 70% chance of
      HCC-specific survival 5 years after transplantation, their level of AFP should be
      <200 ng/mL and the sum of number and size of tumors (in centimeters) should not
      exceed 7; if the level of AFP was 200-400 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size
      of tumors should be </=5; if their level of AFP was 400-1000 ng/mL, the sum of
      the number and size of tumors should be </=4. In the validation set, the model
      identified patients who survived 5 years after liver transplantation with 0.721
      accuracy (95% confidence interval, 0.648%-0.793%). Our model, based on patients' 
      level of AFP and HCC number and size, outperformed the Milan; University of
      California, San Francisco; Shanghai-Fudan; Up-to-7 criteria (P < .001); and AFP
      French model (P = .044) to predict which patients will survive for 5 years after 
      liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a model based on level of AFP,
      tumor size, and tumor number, to determine risk of death from HCC-related factors
      after liver transplantation. This model might be used to select end points and
      refine selection criteria for liver transplantation for patients with HCC. To
      predict 5-year survival and risk of HCC-related death using an online calculator,

      Ethanol-Induced Liver Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic, excessive alcohol consumption leads to alcoholic
      liver disease (ALD) characterized by steatosis, inflammation, and eventually
      cirrhosis. The hepatocyte specific microRNA 122 (MIR122) regulates hepatocyte
      differentiation and metabolism. We investigated whether an alcohol-induced
      decrease in level of MIR122 contributes to development of ALD. METHODS: We
      obtained liver samples from 12 patients with ALD and cirrhosis and 9 healthy
      individuals (controls) and analyzed them by histology and immunohistochemistry.
      C57Bl/6 mice were placed on a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet, in which they were fed 
      ethanol for 8 weeks, as a model of ALD, or a control diet. These mice were also
      given injections of CCl4, to increase liver fibrosis, for 8 weeks. On day 28,
      mice with ethanol-induced liver disease and advanced fibrosis, and controls, were
      given injections of recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector that expressed
      the primary miR-122 transcript (pri-MIR122, to overexpress MIR122 in hepatocytes)
      or vector (control). Two weeks before ethanol feeding, some mice were given
      injections of a vector that expressed an anti-MIR122, to knock down its
      expression. Serum and liver tissues were collected; hepatocytes and liver
      mononuclear cells were analyzed by histology, immunoblots, and confocal
      microscopy. We performed in silico analyses to identify targets of MIR122 and
      chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses in 
      Huh-7 cells. RESULTS: Levels of MIR122 were decreased in liver samples from
      patients with ALD and mice on the Lieber-DeCarli diet, compared with controls.
      Transgenic expression of MIR122 in hepatocytes of mice with ethanol-induced liver
      disease and advanced fibrosis significantly reduced serum levels of alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) and liver steatosis and fibrosis, compared with mice given
      injections of the control vector. Ethanol feeding reduced expression of
      pri-MIR122 by increasing expression of the spliced form of the transcription
      factor grainyhead like transcription factor 2 (GRHL2) in liver tissues from mice.
      Levels of GRHL2 also were increased in liver tissues from patients with ALD,
      compared with controls; increases correlated with decreases in levels of MIR122
      in human liver. Mice given injections of the anti-MIR122 before ethanol feeding
      had increased steatosis, inflammation, and serum levels of alanine
      aminotransferase compared with mice given a control vector. Levels of
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha) mRNA, a target of MIR122, were
      increased in liver tissues from patients and mice with ALD, compared with
      controls. Mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Hif1alpha developed
      less-severe liver injury following administration of ethanol, injection of
      anti-MIR122, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of MIR122 decrease in livers from
      patients with ALD and mice with ethanol-induced liver disease, compared with
      controls. Transcription of MIR122 is inhibited by GRHL2, which is increased in
      livers of mice and patients with ALD. Expression of an anti-MIR122 worsened the
      severity of liver damage following ethanol feeding in mice. MIR122 appears to
      protect the liver from ethanol-induced damage by reducing levels of HIF1alpha.
      These processes might be manipulated to reduce the severity of ALD in patients.

      Histories of Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) decreases with age
      among individuals with a family history of CRC. However, no screening
      recommendations specify less frequent screening with increasing age. We aimed to 
      determine whether such a refinement would be cost effective. METHODS: We
      determined the relative risk for CRC for individuals based on age and number of
      affected first-degree relatives (FDRs) using data from publications. For each
      number of affected FDRs, we used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model to 
      estimate costs and effects of colonoscopy screening strategies with different age
      ranges and intervals. Screening was then optimized sequentially, starting with
      the youngest age group, and allowing the interval of screening to change at
      certain ages. Strategies with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio below
      $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year were considered cost effective. RESULTS: 
      For people with 1 affected FDR (92% of those with a family history), screening
      every 3 years beginning at an age of 40 years is most cost effective. If no
      adenomas are found, the screening interval can gradually be extended to 5 and 7
      years, at ages 45 and 55 years, respectively. From a cost-effectiveness
      perspective, individuals with more affected FDRs should start screening earlier
      and at shorter intervals. However, frequency can be reduced if no abnormalities
      are found. CONCLUSIONS: Using a microsimulation model, we found that for
      individuals with a family history of CRC, it is cost effective to gradually
      increase the screening interval if several subsequent screening colonoscopies
      have negative results and no new cases of CRC are found in family members.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A variety of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin 
      (Hb) are used in colorectal cancer screening. It is unclear to what extent
      differences in reported sensitivities and specificities reflect true
      heterogeneity in test performance or differences in study populations or varying 
      pre-analytical conditions. We directly compared the sensitivity and specificity
      values with which 9 quantitative (laboratory-based and point-of-care) FITs
      detected advanced neoplasms (AN) in a single colorectal cancer screening study.
      METHODS: Pre-colonoscopy stool samples were obtained from participants of
      screening colonoscopy in Germany from 2005 through 2010 and frozen at -80 degrees
      C until analysis. The stool samples were thawed, homogenized, and used for 9
      different quantitative FITs in parallel. Colonoscopy and histology reports were
      collected from all participants and evaluated by 2 independent, trained research 
      assistants who were blinded to the test results. Comparative evaluations of
      diagnostic performance for AN were made at preset manufacturers' thresholds
      (range, 2.0-17.0 mug Hb/g feces), at a uniform threshold (15 mug Hb/g feces), and
      at adjusted thresholds yielding defined levels of specificity (99%, 97%, and
      93%). RESULTS: Of the 1667 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, all
      cases with AN (n = 216) and 300 randomly selected individuals without AN were
      included in the analysis. Sensitivities and specificities for AN varied widely
      when we used the preset thresholds (21.8%-46.3% and 85.7%-97.7%, respectively) or
      the uniform threshold (16.2%-34.3% and 94.0%-98.0%, respectively). Adjusting
      thresholds to yield a specificity of 99%, 97%, or 93% resulted in almost equal
      sensitivities for detection of AN (14.4%-18.5%, 21.3%-23.6%, and 30.1%-35.2%,
      respectively) and almost equal positivity rates (2.8%-3.4%, 5.8%-6.1%, and
      10.1%-10.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Apparent heterogeneity in diagnostic
      performance of quantitative FITs can be overcome to a large extent by adjusting
      thresholds to yield defined levels of specificity or positivity rates. Rather
      than simply using thresholds recommended by the manufacturer, screening programs 
      should choose thresholds based on intended levels of specificity and manageable
      positivity rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a major cause of acute
      hepatitis worldwide. Approximately 2 billion people live in areas endemic for HEV
      and are at risk of infection. The HEV genome encodes 3 proteins, including the
      ORF2 capsid protein. Detailed analyses of the HEV life cycle has been hampered by
      the lack of an efficient viral culture system. METHODS: We performed studies with
      gt3 HEV cell culture-produced particles and patient blood and stool samples.
      Samples were fractionated on iodixanol gradients and cushions. Infectivity assays
      were performed in vitro and in human liver chimeric mice. Proteins were analyzed 
      by biochemical and proteomic approaches. Infectious particles were analyzed by
      transmission electron microscopy. HEV antigen levels were measured with the
      Wantai enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We developed an efficient cell
      culture system and isolated HEV particles that were infectious in vitro and in
      vivo. Using transmission electron microscopy, we defined the ultrastructure of
      HEV cell culture-produced particles and particles from patient sera and stool
      samples. We also identified the precise sequence of the infectious
      particle-associated ORF2 capsid protein. In cultured cells and in samples from
      patients, HEV produced 3 forms of the ORF2 capsid protein:
      infectious/intracellular ORF2 (ORF2i), glycosylated ORF2 (ORF2g), and cleaved
      ORF2 (ORF2c). The ORF2i protein associated with infectious particles, whereas the
      ORF2g and ORF2c proteins were massively secreted glycoproteins not associated
      with infectious particles. ORF2g and ORF2c were the most abundant antigens
      detected in sera from patients. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a cell culture system
      and characterized HEV particles; we identified 3 ORF2 capsid proteins (ORF2i,
      ORF2g, and ORFc). These findings will advance our understanding of the HEV life
      cycle and improve diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a disorder of copper (Cu) misbalance caused 
      by mutations in ATP7B. ATP7B is highly expressed in the liver-the major site of
      Cu accumulation in patients with Wilson disease. The intestine also expresses
      ATP7B, but little is known about the contribution of intestinal ATP7B to normal
      intestinal copper homeostasis or to Wilson disease manifestations. We
      characterized the role of ATP7B in mouse intestinal organoids and tissues.
      METHODS: We collected intestinal tissues from ATP7B-knockout (Atp7b(-/-)) and
      control mice, and established 3-dimensional enteroids. Immunohistochemistry and
      x-ray fluorescence were used to characterize the distribution of ATP7B and Cu in 
      tissues. Electron microscopy, histologic analyses, and immunoblotting were used
      to determine the effects of ATP7B loss. Enteroids derived from control and
      ATP7B-knockout mice were incubated with excess Cu or with Cu-chelating reagents; 
      effects on cell fat content and ATP7B levels and localization were determined by 
      fluorescent confocal microscopy. RESULTS: ATP7B maintains a Cu gradient along the
      duodenal crypt-villus axis and buffers Cu levels in the cytosol of enterocytes.
      These functions are mediated by rapid Cu-dependent enlargement of
      ATP7B-containing vesicles and increased levels of ATP7B. Intestines of Atp7b(-/-)
      mice had reduced Cu storage pools in intestine, Cu depletion, accumulation of
      triglyceride-filled vesicles in enterocytes, mislocalization of apolipoprotein B,
      and loss of chylomicrons. In primary 3-dimensional enteroids, administration of
      excess Cu or Cu chelators impaired assembly of chylomicrons. CONCLUSIONS: ATP7B
      regulates vesicular storage of Cu in mouse intestine. ATP7B buffers Cu levels in 
      enterocytes to maintain a range necessary for formation of chylomicrons.
      Misbalance of Cu and lipid in the intestine could account for gastrointestinal
      manifestations of Wilson disease.

TI  - Risk of Metachronous High-Risk Adenomas and Large Serrated Polyps in Individuals

      Colonoscopy Registry.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Surveillance guidelines for serrated polyps (SPs) are based on
      limited data on longitudinal outcomes of patients. We used the New Hampshire
      Colonoscopy Registry to evaluate risk of clinically important metachronous
      lesions associated with SPs detected during index colonoscopies. METHODS: We
      collected data from a population-based colonoscopy registry that has been
      collecting and analyzing data on colonoscopies across the state of New Hampshire 
      since 2004, including rates of adenoma and SP detection. Patients completed a
      questionnaire to determine demographic characteristics, health history, and risk 
      factors for colorectal cancer, and were followed from index colonoscopy through
      all subsequent surveillance colonoscopies. Our analyses included 5433
      participants (median age, 61 years; 49.7% male) with 2 colonoscopies (median time
      to surveillance, 4.9 years). We used multivariable logistic regression models to 
      assess effects of index SPs (n = 1016), high-risk adenomas (HRA, n = 817),
      low-risk adenomas (n = 1418), and no adenomas (n = 3198) on subsequent HRA or
      large SPs (>1 cm) on surveillance colonoscopy (metachronous lesions). Synchronous
      SPs, within each index risk group, were assessed for size and by histology. SPs
      comprise hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps), and
      traditional serrated adenomas. In this study, SSA/Ps and traditional serrated
      adenomas are referred to collectively as STSAs. RESULTS: HRA and synchronous
      large SP (odds ratio [OR], 5.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-18.28), HRA
      with synchronous STSA (OR, 16.04; 95% CI, 6.95-37.00), and HRA alone (OR, 3.86;
      95% CI, 2.77-5.39) at index colonoscopy significantly increased the risk of
      metachronous HRA compared to the reference group (no index adenomas or SPs).
      Large index SPs alone (OR, 14.34; 95% CI, 5.03-40.86) or index STSA alone (OR,
      9.70; 95% CI, 3.63-25.92) significantly increased the risk of a large
      metachronous SP. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from a population-based
      colonoscopy registry, we found index large SP or index STSA with no index HRA
      increased risk of metachronous large SPs but not metachronous HRA. HRA and
      synchronous SPs at index colonoscopy significantly increased risk of metachronous
      HRA. Individuals with HRA and synchronous large SP or any STSA could therefore
      benefit from close surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholera toxin can act as a modulator of the immune response
      with anti-inflammatory effects; it reduces development of colon polyps in mouse
      models of colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a population-based study to
      determine whether, in patients with a diagnosis of CRC, subsequent administration
      of the cholera vaccine (killed Vibrio cholerae O1 whole cells and recombinant
      cholera toxin B subunit) affects mortality. METHODS: We identified patients from 
      the Swedish Cancer Register who were diagnosed with CRC from July 2005 through
      December 2012. These patients were linked to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register
      to retrieve cholera vaccine use. We used Cox regression analysis to calculate the
      hazard ratio (HR) of death from CRC and overall mortality in patients with
      post-diagnostic use of cholera vaccine compared with matched controls. RESULTS: A
      total of 175 patients were diagnosed with CRC and given a prescription for the
      cholera vaccine after their cancer diagnosis. Compared with propensity
      score-matched controls and adjusted for confounding factors, patients with CRC
      who received the cholera vaccine had a decreased risk of death from CRC (HR,
      0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.99) and a decreased risk of death overall (HR, 0.59; 95% CI,
      0.37-0.94). The decrease in mortality with cholera vaccination was largely
      observed, irrespective of patient age or tumor stage at diagnosis or sex.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study, we associated administration of the
      cholera vaccine after CRC diagnosis with decreased risk of death from CRC and
      overall mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
      kinase (NADK2, also called MNADK) catalyzes phosphorylation of NAD to yield NADP.
      Little is known about the functions of mitochondrial NADP and MNADK in liver
      physiology and pathology. We investigated the effects of reduced mitochondrial
      NADP by deleting MNADK in mice. METHODS: We generated MNADK knockout (KO) mice on
      a C57BL/6NTac background; mice with a wild-type Mnadk gene were used as controls.
      Some mice were placed on an atherogenic high-fat diet (16% fat, 41% carbohydrate,
      and 1.25% cholesterol supplemented with 0.5% sodium cholate) or given
      methotrexate intraperitoneally. We measured rates of fatty acid oxidation in
      primary hepatocytes using radiolabeled palmitate and in mice using indirect
      calorimetry. We measured levels of reactive oxygen species in mouse livers and
      primary hepatocytes. Metabolomic analyses were used to quantify serum
      metabolites, such as amino acids and acylcarnitines. RESULTS: The KO mice had
      metabolic features of MNADK-deficient patients, such as increased serum
      concentrations of lysine and C10:2 carnitine. When placed on the atherogenic
      high-fat diet, the KO mice developed features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      and had increased levels of reactive oxygen species in livers and primary
      hepatocytes, compared with control mice. During fasting, the KO mice had a defect
      in fatty acid oxidation. MNADK deficiency reduced the activation of
      cAMP-responsive element binding protein-hepatocyte specific and peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha, which are transcriptional activators that 
      mediate the fasting response. The activity of mitochondrial sirtuins was reduced 
      in livers of the KO mice. Methotrexate inhibited the catalytic activity of MNADK 
      in hepatocytes and in livers in mice with methotrexate injection. In mice given
      injections of methotrexate, supplementation of a diet with nicotinamide riboside,
      an NAD precursor, replenished hepatic NADP and protected the mice from
      hepatotoxicity, based on markers such as increased level of serum alanine
      aminotransferase. CONCLUSION: MNADK facilitates fatty acid oxidation, counteracts
      oxidative damage, maintains mitochondrial sirtuin activity, and prevents
      metabolic stress-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.

TI  - Analysis of Genomes and Transcriptomes of Hepatocellular Carcinomas Identifies
      Mutations and Gene Expression Changes in the Transforming Growth Factor-beta
      Pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated
      with alterations in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling
      pathway, which regulates liver inflammation and can have tumor suppressor or
      promoter activities. Little is known about the roles of specific members of this 
      pathway at specific of HCC development. We took an integrated approach to
      identify and validate the effects of changes in this pathway in HCC and identify 
      therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed transcriptome analyses for a total of 
      488 HCCs that include data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We also screened 301
      HCCs reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and 202 from Cancer
      Genome Atlas for mutations in genome sequences. We expressed mutant forms of
      spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1) in HepG2, SNU398, and SNU475 cells and
      measured phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of 
      SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3). RESULTS: We found somatic mutations in at least 1
      gene whose product is a member of TGF-beta signaling pathway in 38% of HCC
      samples. SPTBN1 was mutated in the largest proportion of samples (12 of 202, 6%).
      Unsupervised clustering of transcriptome data identified a group of HCCs with
      activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway (increased transcription of genes in
      the pathway) and a group of HCCs with inactivation of TGF-beta signaling (reduced
      expression of genes in this pathway). Patients with tumors with inactivation of
      TGF-beta signaling had shorter survival times than patients with tumors with
      activation of TGF-beta signaling (P = .0129). Patterns of TGF-beta signaling
      correlated with activation of the DNA damage response and sirtuin signaling
      pathways. HepG2, SNU398, and SNU475 cells that expressed the D1089Y mutant or
      with knockdown of SPTBN1 had increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and
      reduced survival compared with cells that expressed normal SPTBN1 (controls).
      CONCLUSIONS: In genome and transcriptome analyses of HCC samples, we found
      mutations in genes in the TGF-beta signaling pathway in almost 40% of samples.
      These correlated with changes in expression of genes in the pathways;
      up-regulation of genes in this pathway would contribute to inflammation and
      fibrosis, whereas down-regulation would indicate loss of TGF-beta tumor
      suppressor activity. Our findings indicate that therapeutic agents for HCCs can
      be effective, based on genetic features of the TGF-beta pathway; agents that
      block TGF-beta should be used only in patients with specific types of HCCs.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been associated
      with development of allergies in infants. However, it is not clear what microbes 
      might contribute to this process. We investigated what microbe(s) might be
      involved in analyses of infant twins and mice. METHODS: We studied fecal
      specimens prospectively in a twin cohort (n = 30) and age-matched singletons (n =
      14) born at National Taiwan University Children's Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, from 
      April 2011 to March 2013. Clinical parameters (gestational age, birth body
      weight, mode of delivery and feeding, immunizations, and medical events) were
      recorded. Fecal samples were collected beginning immediately after birth and for 
      1 year; the children were followed until 3 years of age and allergic symptoms
      (repetitive and continuous for at least 6 months) were noted. A skin prick test
      was used to ascertain atopy. Bacterial communities in fecal samples were profiled
      by 16S ribosomal RNA-based polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature
      gradient gel electrophoresis and next-generation sequencing. BALB/c mice without 
      and with ovalbumin sensitization/challenge were infected with candidate bacteria 
      by oral gauge intragastric intubation. Fecal, serum, lung, and colon tissue
      samples were collected from mice and analyzed for mechanisms of allergy
      development. RESULTS: During the investigation period, 20 children (45.5%)
      developed allergic diseases, including respiratory (allergic rhinitis and asthma)
      and skin (atopic dermatitis and eczema) allergies. Lachnospiraceae were detected 
      at significantly higher frequency in allergic infants than nonallergic infants (P
      < .004); the high fecal count of Lachnospiraceae in allergic subjects appeared at
      2 months of age and persisted until 12 months of age. The enrichment of
      Lachnospiraceae in allergic infants was attributed to the overgrowth of
      Ruminococcus gnavus, which tended to have a low frequency in nonallergic subjects
      (P = .0004). Increased R gnavus was observed before the onset of allergic
      manifestations, and was associated with respiratory allergies (P < .002) or
      respiratory allergies coexistent with atopic eczema (P < .001). In mice,
      endogenous R gnavus grew rapidly after sensitization and challenge with
      ovalbumin. Mice gavaged with purified R gnavus developed airway
      hyper-responsiveness and had histologic evidence of airway inflammation (asthma).
      Expansion of R gnavus in mice stimulated secretion of cytokines (interleukin [IL]
      25, IL33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) by colon tissues, which activated
      type 2 innate lymphoid cells and dendritic cells to promote differentiation of
      T-helper 2 cells and production of their cytokines (IL4, IL5, and IL13). This led
      to infiltration of the colon and lung parenchyma by eosinophils and mast cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a study of a twin cohort (some infants with, some without
      allergies), we associated development of allergies, particularly respiratory
      allergies, with increased fecal abundance of R gnavus. Mice fed R gnavus
      developed airway inflammation, characterized by expansion of T-helper 2 cells in 
      the colon and lung, and infiltration of colon and lung parenchyma by eosinophils 
      and mast cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although there is a genetic predisposition to colorectal
      cancer (CRC), few of the genes that affect risk have been identified. We
      performed whole-exome sequence analysis of individuals in a high-risk family
      without mutations in genes previously associated with CRC risk to identify
      variants associated with inherited CRC. METHODS: We collected blood samples from 
      3 relatives with CRC in Spain (65, 62, and 40 years old at diagnosis) and
      performed whole-exome sequence analyses. Rare missense, truncating or splice-site
      variants shared by the 3 relatives were selected. We used targeted pooled DNA
      amplification followed by next generation sequencing to screen for mutations in
      candidate genes in 547 additional hereditary and/or early-onset CRC cases (502
      additional families). We carried out protein-dependent yeast growth assays and
      transfection studies in the HT29 human CRC cell line to test the effects of the
      identified variants. RESULTS: A total of 42 unique or rare (population minor
      allele frequency below 1%) nonsynonymous genetic variants in 38 genes were shared
      by all 3 relatives. We selected the BRF1 gene, which encodes an RNA polymerase
      III transcription initiation factor subunit for further analysis, based on the
      predicted effect of the identified variant and previous association of BRF1 with 
      cancer. Previously unreported or rare germline variants in BRF1 were identified
      in 11 of 503 CRC families, a significantly greater proportion than in the control
      population (34 of 4300). Seven of the identified variants (1 detected in 2
      families) affected BRF1 mRNA splicing, protein stability, or expression and/or
      function. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of families with a history of CRC, we
      associated germline mutations in BRF1 with predisposition to CRC. We associated
      deleterious BRF1 variants with 1.4% of familial CRC cases, in individuals without
      mutations in high-penetrance genes previously associated with CRC. Our findings
      add additional evidence to the link between defects in genes that regulate
      ribosome synthesis and risk of CRC.

      Inflammation and Metaplasia in Mice and Is Associated With Type II
      Hypersensitivity/Autoimmunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic gastrointestinal inflammation increases the risk of
      cancer by mechanisms that are not well understood. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 
      (IDO1) is a heme-binding enzyme that regulates the immune response via
      catabolization and regulation of tryptophan availability for immune cell uptake. 
      IDO1 expression is increased during the transition from chronic inflammation to
      gastric metaplasia. We investigated whether IDO1 contributes to the inflammatory 
      response that mediates loss of parietal cells leading to metaplasia. METHODS:
      Chronic gastric inflammation was induced in Ido1(-/-) and CB57BL/6 (control) mice
      by gavage with Helicobacter felis or overexpression of interferon gamma in
      gastric parietal cells. We also performed studies in Jh(-/-) mice, which are
      devoid of B cells. Gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry,
      immunostaining, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Plasma
      samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric tissues were 
      obtained from 20 patients with gastric metaplasia and 20 patients without gastric
      metaplasia (controls) and analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction; gastric tissue arrays were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We
      collected genetic information on gastric cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas
      database. RESULTS: H felis gavage induced significantly lower levels of
      pseudopyloric metaplasia in Ido1(-/-) mice, which had lower frequencies of
      gastric B cells, than in control mice. Blood plasma from H felis-infected control
      mice had increased levels of autoantibodies against parietal cells, compared to
      uninfected control mice, but this increase was lower in Ido1(-/-) mice.
      Chronically inflamed stomachs of Ido1(-/-) mice had significantly lower
      frequencies of natural killer cells in contact with parietal cells, compared with
      stomachs of control mice. Jh(-/-) mice had lower levels of pseudopyloric
      metaplasia than control mice in response to H felis infection. Human gastric
      pre-neoplasia and carcinoma specimens had increased levels of IDO1 messenger RNA 
      compared with control gastric tissues, and IDO1 protein colocalized with B cells.
      Co-clustering of IDO1 messenger RNA with B-cell markers was corroborated by The
      Cancer Genome Atlas database. CONCLUSIONS: IDO1 mediates gastric metaplasia by
      regulating the B-cell compartment. This process appears to be associated with
      type II hypersensitivity/autoimmunity. The role of autoimmunity in the
      progression of pseudopyloric metaplasia warrants further investigation.

AB  - Skin tests and measurement of serum levels of immunoglobulin E do not accurately 
      identify foods for elimination from the diets of patients with eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE). We investigated whether an esophageal prick test, in which the
      esophageal mucosa is challenged by local injection of allergen extracts, could
      identify individuals with esophageal sensitization. During endoscopy, 6 allergens
      were injected in the esophagus of 8 patients with EoE and 3 patients without EoE 
      (controls). A second endoscopy was performed after 24 hours to evaluate delayed
      responses. Five of the 8 patients with EoE had evidence for an acute response
      (luminal obstruction and mucosal blanching); 2 other patients had a delayed wheal
      or flare reaction. No responses were observed in controls. We conclude that
      esophageal mucosal food allergen injections induce acute and/or delayed responses
      in patients with EoE but not controls. The esophageal prick test deserves further
      exploration because it may guide elimination diets.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The increase in use of anesthesia assistance (AA) to achieve
      deep sedation with propofol during colonoscopy has significantly increased
      colonoscopy costs without evidence for increased quality and with possible harm. 
      We investigated the effects of AA on colonoscopy complications, specifically
      bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and splenic injury. METHODS: In a
      population-based cohort study using administrative databases, we studied adults
      in Ontario, Canada undergoing outpatient colonoscopy from 2005 through 2012.
      Patient, endoscopist, institution, and procedure factors were derived. The
      primary outcome was bowel perforation, defined using a validated algorithm.
      Secondary outcomes were splenic injury and aspiration pneumonia. Using a matched 
      propensity score approach, we matched persons who had colonoscopy with AA (1:1)
      with those who did not. We used logistic regression models under a generalized
      estimating equations approach to explore the relationship between AA and
      outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 3,059,045 outpatient colonoscopies were analyzed;
      862,817 of these included AA. After propensity matching, a cohort of 793,073
      patients who had AA and 793,073 without AA was retained for analysis (51% female;
      78% were age 50 years or older). Use of AA did not significantly increase risk of
      perforation (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.16) or
      splenic injury (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.62-1.90]. Use of AA was associated with an
      increased risk of aspiration pneumonia (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.11-2.37).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based cohort study, AA for outpatient colonoscopy
      was associated with a significantly increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, but
      not bowel perforation or splenic injury. Endoscopists should warn patients,
      especially those with respiratory compromise, of this risk.

AB  - GED-0301 is an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide with a sequence complementary to
      the Smad7 mRNA transcript. Smad7 is a negative regulator of transforming growth
      factor-beta, which is increased in the intestinal mucosa of patients with active 
      Crohn's disease (CD). We randomly assigned 63 CD patients to 4-, 8-, or 12-week
      treatment groups receiving oral GED-0301 (160 mg/day). The primary objective was 
      to determine GED-0301's effect on endoscopic CD measures; secondary objectives
      included effects on clinical activity. Endoscopic improvement was observed in 37%
      of participants with evaluable endoscopy results at week 12. At week 12, 32% (4
      weeks), 35% (8 weeks), and 48% (12 weeks) of patients receiving GED-0301 were in 
      remission (CD activity index score <150); corresponding reductions from baseline 
      in mean CD activity index scores were -124, -112, and -133 points. No new safety 
      signals were observed. These findings support a GED-0301 benefit in active CD.

AB  - Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) commonly starts with an
      empiric trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and complementary lifestyle 
      measures, for patients without alarm symptoms. Optimization of therapy (improving
      compliance and timing of PPI doses), or increasing PPI dosage to twice daily in
      select circumstances, can reduce persistent symptoms. Patients with continued
      symptoms can be evaluated with endoscopy and tests of esophageal physiology, to
      better determine their disease phenotype and optimize treatment. Laparoscopic
      fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation, and endoscopic therapies can
      benefit patients with well-characterized GERD. Patients with functional diseases 
      that overlap with or mimic GERD can also be treated with neuromodulators
      (primarily antidepressants), or psychological interventions (psychotherapy,
      hypnotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapy). Future approaches to treatment
      of GERD include potassium-competitive acid blockers, reflux-reducing agents, bile
      acid binders, injection of inert substances into the esophagogastric junction,
      and electrical stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for about 90% of the 456,000
      incident esophageal cancers each year. Regions of high incidence include Eastern 
      to Central Asia, along the Rift Valley in East Africa, and into South Africa.
      There are many causes of ESCC, which vary among regions. Early studies in France 
      associated smoking cigarettes and heavy alcohol consumption with high rates of
      ESCC, but these factors cannot explain the high incidence in other regions. We
      discuss other risk factors for ESCC, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
      from a variety of sources, high-temperature foods, diet, and oral health and the 
      microbiome-all require further research. A growing list of defined genomic
      regions affects susceptibility, but large genome-wide association studies have
      been conducted with ethnic Chinese subjects only; more studies are called for in 
      the rest of Asia and Africa. ESCC has been understudied, but growing
      infrastructure in more high-incidence countries will allow rapid progress in our 
      understanding.

AB  - The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased in many Western
      countries and is higher in men than women. Some risk factors for EAC have been
      identified-mainly gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, obesity, 
      and tobacco smoking. It is not clear whether interventions to address these
      factors can reduce risk of EAC, although some evidence exists for smoking
      cessation. Although consumption of alcohol is not associated with EAC risk, other
      exposures, such as physical activity, nutrition, and medication use, require
      further study. Genetic variants have been associated with risk for EAC, but their
      overall contribution is low. Studies are needed to investigate associations
      between risk factors and the molecular subtypes of EAC. The prognosis for
      patients with EAC has slightly improved, but remains poor-screening and
      surveillance trials of high-risk individuals are needed.

AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal
      disorder in the United States, and leads to substantial morbidity, though
      associated mortality is rare. The prevalence of GERD symptoms appeared to
      increase until 1999. Risk factors for complications of GERD include advanced age,
      male sex, white race, abdominal obesity, and tobacco use. Most patients with GERD
      present with heartburn and effortless regurgitation. Coexistent dysphagia is
      considered an alarm symptom, prompting evaluation. There is substantial overlap
      between symptoms of GERD and those of eosinophilic esophagitis, functional
      dyspepsia, and gastroparesis, posing a challenge for patient management.

AB  - Because the esophagus is easily accessible with endoscopy, early diagnosis and
      curative treatment of esophageal cancer is possible. However, diagnosis is often 
      delayed because symptoms are not specific during early stages of tumor
      development. The onset of dysphagia is associated with advanced disease, which
      has a survival at 5 years lower than 15%. Population screening by endoscopy is
      not cost-effective, but a number of alternative imaging and cell analysis
      technologies are under investigation. The ideal screening test should be
      inexpensive, well tolerated, and applicable to primary care. Over the past 10
      years, significant progress has been made in endoscopic diagnosis and treatment
      of dysplasia (squamous and Barrett's), and early esophageal cancer using
      resection and ablation technologies supported by evidence from randomized
      controlled trials. We review the state-of-the-art technologies for early
      diagnosis and minimally invasive treatment, which together could reduce the
      burden of disease.

AB  - Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) has emerged over the past 2 decades as a major
      cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity. Over this time, the epidemiology of
      EoE has also rapidly evolved. EoE has transformed from a rare case-reportable
      condition to disease that is commonly encountered in the gastroenterology clinic,
      hospital emergency room, and endoscopy suite. The incidence and prevalence are
      increasing at rates that outpace increased disease recognition. Current incidence
      estimates range from 5 to 10 cases per 100,000, and current prevalence estimates 
      range from 0.5 to 1 case per 1000. We review the data and potential reasons
      behind this increase, examine risk factors, and identify important areas for
      research into disease etiology. The article also discusses the progression of EoE
      from an inflammatory to fibrostenotic phenotype. An accurate view of the natural 
      history of EoE is central to discussions with patients regarding disease
      prognosis and decisions about long-term use of medical, endoscopic, and diet
      therapies. Progressive remodelling appears to be gradual, but not universal, and 
      the duration of untreated disease is the best predictor of stricture risk.
      Ultimately, prospective, long-term outcome studies focusing on multiple aspects
      of disease activity are needed to fully understand the natural history of EoE.

AB  - A detailed critique of objective measurements of gastroesophageal reflux disease 
      (GERD) would improve management of patients suspecting of having reflux, leading 
      to rational selection of treatment and better outcomes. Many diagnostic tests for
      GERD have been developed over the past decades. We analyze their development,
      positive- and negative-predictive values, and ability to predict response to
      treatment. These features are important for development of medical, surgical, and
      endoscopic therapies for GERD. We discuss the value of available diagnostic tests
      and review their role in management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms
      despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. This is becoming a significant
      health economic problem, due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors.
      GERD is believed to cause nonesophageal symptoms, such as those provoked by ear, 
      nose, throat, or respiratory disorders. We analyze the value of GERD diagnostic
      tests in evaluation of these troublesome, nonesophageal symptoms.

AB  - Eosinophilic esophagitis is an emerging disease that is distinguished from
      gastroesophageal reflux disease by the expression of a unique esophageal
      transcriptome and the interplay of early life environmental factors with distinct
      genetic susceptibility elements at 5q22 (TSLP) and 2p23 (CAPN14). Rare genetic
      syndromes have uncovered the contribution of barrier disruption, mediated in part
      by defective desmosomes and dysregulated transforming growth factor beta
      production and signaling, to eosinophilic esophagitis pathophysiology.
      Experimental modeling has defined a cooperative role of activated eosinophils,
      mast cells, and the cytokines IL-5 and IL-13, mediated by allergic sensitization 
      to multiple foods. Understanding these processes is opening the way to better
      treatment based on disrupting allergic inflammatory and type 2 cytokine-mediated 
      responses, including anti-cytokine therapeutics and dietary therapy.

AB  - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common malignancy without
      effective therapy. The exomes of more than 600 ESCCs have been sequenced in the
      past 4 years, and numerous key aberrations have been identified. Recently,
      researchers reported both inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Although these are
      interesting observations, their clinical implications are unclear due to the
      limited number of samples profiled. Epigenomic alterations, such as changes in
      DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and RNA editing, also have been observed in
      ESCCs. However, it is not clear what proportion of ESCC cells carry these
      epigenomic aberrations or how they contribute to tumor development. We review the
      genomic and epigenomic characteristics of ESCCs, with a focus on emerging themes.
      We discuss their clinical implications and future research directions.

AB  - Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a new disease. It is caused by a T-helper type 
      2 cell response to food antigens in contact with the esophageal mucosa. Although 
      no single feature defines EoE, a constellation of compatible demographic,
      clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings establish the diagnosis. Children
      present with symptoms and endoscopic patterns characteristic of inflammation,
      whereas adolescents and adults have manifestations of fibrosis and gross
      esophageal strictures. Clinical and endoscopic scoring systems have helped to
      standardize diagnosis. There is controversy in EoE research over the optimal
      endpoint for treatment. Although the most common endpoint is a reduced number of 
      eosinophils in biopsies, changes in symptoms and endoscopic features are becoming
      important targets of therapy. We should improve our understanding of EoE
      progression and the need for maintenance therapy, and continue development of
      diagnostic tools that avoid endoscopy and biopsy analyses to more easily monitor 
      disease activity.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.12.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to the general population, and risk is higher
      among those who received an organ transplant. We performed a cost-effectiveness
      analysis to determine optimal CRC screening strategies for patients with cystic
      fibrosis. METHODS: We adjusted the existing Microsimulation Screening
      Analysis-Colon microsimulation model to reflect increased CRC risk and lower life
      expectancy in patients with cystic fibrosis. Modeling was performed separately
      for individuals who never received an organ transplant and patients who had
      received an organ transplant. We modeled 76 colonoscopy screening strategies that
      varied the age range and screening interval. The optimal screening strategy was
      determined based on a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per life-year
      gained. Sensitivity and supplementary analyses were performed, including fecal
      immunochemical test (FIT) as an alternative test, earlier ages of
      transplantation, and increased rates of colonoscopy complications, to assess
      whether optimal screening strategies would change. RESULTS: Colonoscopy every 5
      years, starting at age 40 years, was the optimal colonoscopy strategy for
      patients with cystic fibrosis who never received an organ transplant; this
      strategy prevented 79% of deaths from CRC. Among patients with cystic fibrosis
      who had received an organ transplant, optimal colonoscopy screening should start 
      at an age of 30 or 35 years, depending on the patient's age at time of
      transplantation. Annual FIT screening was predicted to be cost-effective for
      patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the level of accuracy of the FIT in
      population is not clear. CONCLUSIONS: Using a Microsimulation Screening
      Analysis-Colon microsimulation model, we found screening of patients with cystic 
      fibrosis for CRC to be cost-effective. Due to the higher risk in these patients
      for CRC, screening should start at an earlier age with a shorter screening
      interval. The findings of this study (especially those on FIT screening) may be
      limited by restricted evidence available for patients with cystic fibrosis.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Access Expansion to Treatment of Hepatitis C Virus
      Infection Through Primary Care Providers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major burden on
      individuals and health care systems. The Extension for Community Healthcare
      Outcomes (Project ECHO) enables primary care providers to deliver best-practice
      care for complex conditions to underserved populations. The US Congress passed
      the ECHO Act in late 2016, requiring the Department of Health and Human Services 
      to investigate the model. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess
      diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection in a primary care patient panel with and
      without the implementation of Project ECHO. METHODS: We used Markov models to
      simulate disease progression, quality of life, and life expectancy among
      individuals with HCV infection and for the general population. Data from the
      University of New Mexico's ECHO operation for HCV show an increase in treatment
      rates. Corresponding increases in survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
      costs, and resulting budget impact between ECHO and non-ECHO patients with HCV
      were then compared. RESULTS: Project ECHO increased costs and QALYs. The
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECHO was $10,351 per QALY compared with
      the status quo; >99.9% of iterations fell below the willingness-to-pay threshold 
      of $100,000 per QALY. We were unable to confirm whether the increase in rates of 
      treatment associated with Project ECHO were due to increased or more targeted
      screening, higher adherence, or access to treatment. Our sensitivity analyses
      show that the results are largely independent of the cause. Budget impact
      analysis shows payers would have to invest an additional $339.54 million over a
      5-year period to increase treatment by 4446 patients, per 1 million covered
      lives. CONCLUSION: Using a simulated primary care patient panel, we showed that
      Project ECHO is a cost-effective way to find and treat patients with HCV
      infection at scale using existing primary care providers. This approach could
      substantially reduce the burden of chronic HCV infection in the United States,
      but high budgetary costs suggest that incremental rollout of ECHO may be best.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 Engineering of Adult Mouse Liver Demonstrates That the Dnajb1-Prkaca 
      Gene Fusion Is Sufficient to Induce Tumors Resembling Fibrolamellar
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a primary
      liver cancer that predominantly affects children and young adults with no
      underlying liver disease. A somatic, 400 Kb deletion on chromosome 19 that fuses 
      part of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1 gene (DNAJB1) to the
      protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha gene (PRKACA) has been
      repeatedly identified in patients with FL-HCC. However, the DNAJB1-PRKACA gene
      fusion has not been shown to induce liver tumorigenesis. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 
      technique to delete in mice the syntenic region on chromosome 8 to create a
      Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion and monitored the mice for liver tumor development. METHODS:
      We delivered CRISPR/Cas9 vectors designed to juxtapose exon 1 of Dnajb1 with exon
      2 of Prkaca to create the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion associated with FL-HCC, or
      control Cas9 vector, via hydrodynamic tail vein injection to livers of 8-week-old
      female FVB/N mice. These mice did not have any other engineered genetic
      alterations and were not exposed to liver toxins or carcinogens. Liver tissues
      were collected 14 months after delivery; genomic DNA was analyzed by PCR to
      detect the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion, and tissues were characterized by histology,
      immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and whole-exome sequencing. RESULTS: Livers
      from 12 of the 15 mice given the vectors to induce the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion,
      but none of the 11 mice given the control vector, developed neoplasms. The tumors
      contained the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion and had histologic and cytologic features
      of human FL-HCCs: large polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic, and
      mitochondria-rich cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and markers of hepatocytes and
      cholangiocytes. In comparing expression levels of genes between the mouse tumor
      and non-tumor liver cells, we identified changes similar to those detected in
      human FL-HCC, which included genes that affect cell cycle and mitosis regulation.
      Genomic analysis of mouse neoplasms induced by the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion revealed 
      a lack of mutations in genes commonly associated with liver cancers, as observed 
      in human FL-HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we found generation
      of the Dnajb1-Prkaca fusion gene in wild-type mice to be sufficient to initiate
      formation of tumors that have many features of human FL-HCC. Strategies to block 
      DNAJB1-PRKACA might be developed as therapeutics for this form of liver cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The clinical course of chronic pancreatitis is unpredictable. 
      There is no model to assess disease severity or progression or predict patient
      outcomes. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 91 patients with chronic
      pancreatitis; data were collected from patients seen at academic centers in
      Europe from January 2011 through April 2014. We analyzed correlations between
      clinical, laboratory, and imaging data with number of hospital readmissions and
      in-hospital days over the next 12 months; the parameters with the highest degree 
      of correlation were used to develop a 3-stage chronic pancreatitis prognosis
      score (COPPS). The predictive strength was validated in 129 independent subjects 
      identified from 2 prospective databases. RESULTS: The mean number of hospital
      admissions was 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-2.44) and 15.2 for
      hospital days (95% CI, 10.76-19.71) for the development cohort and 10.9 for the
      validation cohort (95% CI, 7.54-14.30) (P = .08). Based on bivariate
      correlations, pain (numeric rating scale), level of glycated hemoglobin A1c,
      level of C-reactive protein, body mass index, and platelet count were used to
      develop the COPPS system. The patients' median COPPS was 8.9 points (range,
      5-14). The system accurately discriminated stages of disease severity (low to
      high): A (5-6 points), B (7-9), and C (10-15). In Pearson correlation analysis of
      the development cohort, the COPPS correlated with hospital admissions (0.39; P < 
      .01) and number of hospital days (0.33; P < .01). The correlation was validated
      in the validation set (Pearson correlation values of 0.36 and 0.44; P < .01).
      COPPS did not correlate with results from the Cambridge classification system.
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated an easy to use dynamic multivariate
      scoring system, similar to the Child-Pugh-Score for liver cirrhosis. The COPPS
      allows objective monitoring of patients with chronic pancreatitis, determining
      risk for readmission to hospital and potential length of hospital stay.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In most patients with Parkinson's disease, gastrointestinal
      (GI) dysfunctions, such as gastroparesis and constipation, are prodromal to the
      cardinal motor symptoms of the disease. Sporadic Parkinson's disease has been
      proposed to develop after ingestion of neurotoxicants that affect the brain-gut
      axis via the vagus nerve, and then travel to higher centers, compromising the
      substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and, later, the cerebral cortex. We aimed
      to identify the pathway that connects the brainstem vagal nuclei and the SNpc,
      and to determine whether this pathway is compromised in a rat model of
      Parkinsonism. METHODS: To study this neural pathway in rats, we placed tracers in
      the dorsal vagal complex or SNpc; brainstem and midbrain were examined for tracer
      distribution and neuronal neurochemical phenotype. Rats were given injections of 
      paraquat once weekly for 3 weeks to induce features of Parkinsonism, or vehicle
      (control). Gastric tone and motility were recorded after N-methyl-d-aspartate
      microinjection in the SNpc and/or optogenetic stimulation of nigro-vagal
      terminals in the dorsal vagal complex. RESULTS: Stimulation of the SNpc increased
      gastric tone and motility via activation of dopamine 1 receptors in the dorsal
      vagal complex. In the paraquat-induced model of Parkinsonism, this nigro-vagal
      pathway was compromised during the early stages of motor deficit development.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified and characterized a nigro-vagal monosynaptic pathway
      in rats that controls gastric tone and motility. This pathway might be involved
      in the prodromal gastric dysmotility observed in patients with early-stage
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Association Between Inflammatory Diet Pattern and Risk of Colorectal Carcinoma
      Subtypes Classified by Immune Responses to Tumor.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary patterns affect systemic and local intestinal
      inflammation, which have been linked to colorectal carcinogenesis. Chronic
      inflammation can interfere with the adaptive immune response. We investigated
      whether the association of a diet that promotes intestinal inflammation with risk
      of colorectal carcinoma was stronger for tumors with lower lymphocytic reactions 
      than tumors with higher lymphocytic reactions. METHODS: We collected data from
      the molecular pathological epidemiology databases of 2 prospective cohort
      studies: the Nurses' Health Study (since 1976) and the Health Professionals
      Follow-Up Study (since 1986). We used duplication-method time-varying Cox
      proportional cause-specific hazards regression to assess the association of
      empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score (derived from food frequency 
      questionnaire data) with colorectal carcinoma subtype. Foods that contribute to
      high EDIP scores include red and processed meats, refined grains, carbonated
      beverages, and some vegetables; foods that contribute to low EDIP scores include 
      beer, wine, coffee, tea, yellow and leafy vegetables, and fruit juice. Colorectal
      tissue samples were analyzed histologically for patterns of lymphocytic reactions
      (Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction, peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, intratumoral
      periglandular reaction, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). RESULTS: During
      follow-up of 124,433 participants, we documented 1311 incident colon and rectal
      cancer cases with available tissue data. The association between the EDIP and
      colorectal cancer risk was significant (Ptrend = .02), and varied with degree of 
      peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (Pheterogeneity < .001). Higher EDIP scores were
      associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer with an absent or low
      peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (highest vs lowest EDIP score quintile hazard
      ratio, 2.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-4.23; Ptrend < .001), but not risk of 
      tumors with intermediate or high peritumoral lymphocytic reaction (Ptrend > .80).
      CONCLUSIONS: In 2 prospective cohort studies, we associated inflammatory diets
      with a higher risk of colorectal cancer subtype that contains little or no
      peritumoral lymphocytic reaction. These findings suggest that diet-related
      inflammation might contribute to development of colorectal cancer, by suppressing
      the adaptive anti-tumor immune response.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Separation of newborn rats from their mothers induces visceral
      hypersensitivity and impaired epithelial secretory cell lineages when they are
      adults. Little is known about the mechanisms by which maternal separation causes 
      visceral hypersensitivity or its relationship with defects in epithelial
      secretory cell lineages. METHODS: We performed studies with C3H/HeN mice
      separated from their mothers as newborns and mice genetically engineered
      (Sox9(flox/flox)-vil-cre on C57BL/6 background) to have deficiencies in Paneth
      cells. Paneth cell deficiency was assessed by lysozyme staining of ileum tissues 
      and lysozyme activity in fecal samples. When mice were 50 days old, their
      abdominal response to colorectal distension was assessed by electromyography.
      Fecal samples were collected and microbiota were analyzed using Gut Low-Density
      Array quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Mice with maternal
      separation developed visceral hypersensitivity and defects in Paneth cells, as
      reported from rats, compared with mice without maternal separation.
      Sox9(flox/flox)-vil-Cre mice also had increased visceral hypersensitivity
      compared with control littermate Sox9(flox/flox) mice. Fecal samples from mice
      with maternal separation and from Sox9(flox/flox)-vil-cre mice had evidence for
      intestinal dysbiosis of the microbiota, characterized by expansion of Escherichia
      coli. Daily gavage of conventional C3H/HeN adult mice with 10(9) commensal E coli
      induced visceral hypersensitivity. Conversely, daily oral administration of
      lysozyme prevented expansion of E coli during maternal separation and visceral
      hypersensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Mice with defects in Paneth cells (induced by
      maternal separation or genetically engineered) have intestinal expansion of E
      coli leading to visceral hypersensitivity. These findings provide evidence that
      Paneth cell function and intestinal dysbiosis are involved in visceral
      sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) locus encodes 
      the nuclear protein and tumor suppressor menin. MEN1 mutations frequently cause
      neuroendocrine tumors such as gastrinomas, characterized by their predominant
      duodenal location and local metastasis at time of diagnosis. Diffuse gastrin cell
      hyperplasia precedes the appearance of MEN1 gastrinomas, which develop within
      submucosal Brunner's glands. We investigated how menin regulates expression of
      the gastrin gene and induces generation of submucosal gastrin-expressing cell
      hyperplasia. METHODS: Primary enteric glial cultures were generated from the
      VillinCre:Men1(FL/FL):Sst(-/-) mice or C57BL/6 mice (controls), with or without
      inhibition of gastric acid by omeprazole. Primary enteric glial cells from
      C57BL/6 mice were incubated with gastrin and separated into nuclear and
      cytoplasmic fractions. Cells were incubated with forskolin and H89 to activate or
      inhibit protein kinase A (a family of enzymes whose activity depends on cellular 
      levels of cyclic AMP). Gastrin was measured in blood, tissue, and cell cultures
      using an ELISA. Immunoprecipitation with menin or ubiquitin was used to
      demonstrate post-translational modification of menin. Primary glial cells were
      incubated with leptomycin b and MG132 to block nuclear export and proteasome
      activity, respectively. We obtained human duodenal, lymph node, and pancreatic
      gastrinoma samples, collected from patients who underwent surgery from 1996
      through 2007 in the United States or the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Enteric glial
      cells that stained positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) expressed
      gastrin de novo through a mechanism that required PKA. Gastrin-induced nuclear
      export of menin via cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR)-mediated activation of
      PKA. Once exported from the nucleus, menin was ubiquitinated and degraded by the 
      proteasome. GFAP and other markers of enteric glial cells (eg, p75 and S100B),
      colocalized with gastrin in human duodenal gastrinomas. CONCLUSIONS:
      MEN1-associated gastrinomas, which develop in the submucosa, might arise from
      enteric glial cells through hormone-dependent PKA signaling. This pathway
      disrupts nuclear menin function, leading to hypergastrinemia and associated
      sequelae.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      develops, in part, via excess insulin-stimulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis,
      which increases, paradoxically, in patients with obesity-induced insulin
      resistance. Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 
      (PHLPP2) terminates insulin signaling by dephosphorylating Akt; levels of PHLPP2 
      are reduced in livers from obese mice. We investigated whether loss of hepatic
      PHLPP2 is sufficient to induce fatty liver in mice, mechanisms of PHLPP2
      degradation in fatty liver, and expression of genes that regulate PHLPP2 in
      livers of patients with NAFLD. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice (controls), obese db/db
      mice, and mice with liver-specific deletion of PHLPP2 (L-PHLPP2) fed either
      normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD) were analyzed for metabolic phenotypes,
      including glucose tolerance and hepatic steatosis. PHLPP2-deficient primary
      hepatocytes or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PHLPP2-knockout hepatoma cells were analyzed 
      for insulin signaling and gene expression. We performed mass spectrometry
      analyses of liver tissues from C57BL/6J mice transduced with Ad-HA-Flag-PHLPP2 to
      identify posttranslational modifications to PHLPP2 and proteins that interact
      with PHLPP2. We measured levels of mRNAs by quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction in liver biopsies from patients with varying degrees of
      hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: PHLPP2-knockout hepatoma cells and hepatocytes from
      L-PHLPP2 mice showed normal initiation of insulin signaling, but prolonged
      insulin action. Chow-fed L-PHLPP2 mice had normal glucose tolerance but hepatic
      steatosis. In HFD-fed C57BL/6J or db/db obese mice, endogenous PHLPP2 was
      degraded by glucagon and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PHLPP2 (at Ser1119 and 
      Ser1210), which led to PHLPP2 binding to potassium channel tetramerization domain
      containing 17 (KCTD17), a substrate-adaptor for Cul3-RING ubiquitin ligases.
      Levels of KCTD17 mRNA were increased in livers of HFD-fed C57BL/6J or db/db obese
      mice and in liver biopsies patients with NAFLD, compared with liver tissues from 
      healthy control mice or patients without steatosis. Knockdown of KCTD17 with
      small hairpin RNA in primary hepatocytes increased PHLPP2 protein but not Phlpp2 
      mRNA, indicating that KCTD17 mediates PHLPP2 degradation. KCTD17 knockdown in
      obese mice prevented PHLPP2 degradation and decreased expression of lipogenic
      genes. CONCLUSIONS: In mouse models of obesity, we found that PHLPP2 degradation 
      induced lipogenesis without affecting gluconeogenesis. KCTD17, which is
      up-regulated in liver tissues of obese mice and patients with NAFLD, binds to
      phosphorylated PHLPP2 to target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation; this
      increases expression of genes that regulate lipogenesis to promote hepatic
      steatosis. Inhibitors of this pathway might be developed for treatment of
      patients with NAFLD.

      were isolated from spleen and liver for analysis by flow cytometry. Liver was
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry and mRNA levels were measured by quantitative
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasma levels of HBV DNA
      were quantified by PCR reaction, and antigen-specific antibodies were detected by
      immunocytochemistry of HBV-transfected BHK-21 cells. RESULTS: Following HBV
      infection, a complete viral life cycle, with production of HBV DNA, hepatitis B e
      (HBe), core (HBc) and surface (HBs) antigens, and covalently closed circular DNA,
      was observed in HUHEP and HIS-HUHEP mice. HBV replicated unrestricted in HUHEP
      mice resulting in high viral titers without pathologic effects. In contrast,
      HBV-infected HIS-HUHEP mice developed chronic hepatitis with 10-fold lower titers
      and antigen-specific IgGs, (anti-HBs, anti-HBc), consistent with partial immune
      control. HBV-infected HIS-HUHEP livers contained infiltrating Kupffer cells,
      mature activated natural killer cells (CD69+), and PD-1+ effector memory T cells 
      (CD45RO+). Reducing the viral inoculum resulted in more efficient immune control.
      Plasma from HBV-infected HIS-HUHEP mice had increased levels of inflammatory and 
      immune-suppressive cytokines (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 and interleukin
      10), which correlated with populations of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells
      (CD45RO+PD-1+). Mice with high levels of viremia had HBV-infected liver
      progenitor cells. Giving the mice the nucleoside analogue entecavir reduced viral
      loads and decreased liver inflammation. CONCLUSION: In HIS-HUHEP mice, HBV
      infection completes a full life cycle and recapitulates some of the
      immunopathology observed in patients with chronic infection. Inoculation with
      different viral loads led to different immune responses and levels of virus
      control. We found HBV to infect liver progenitor cells, which could be involved
      in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. This is an important new system to study
      anti-HBV immune responses and screen for combination therapies against
      hepatotropic viruses.

TI  - The Combination of Alcohol and Cigarette Smoke Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum
      Stress and Cell Death in Pancreatic Acinar Cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Smoking, an independent risk factor for pancreatitis,
      accelerates the development of alcoholic pancreatitis. Alcohol feeding of mice
      induces up-regulation of spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s), which regulates
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response and promotes cell
      survival upon ER stress. We examined whether smoking affects the adaptive
      mechanisms induced by alcohol and accelerates disorders of the ER in pancreatic
      acinar cells. METHODS: We studied the combined effects of ethanol (EtOH) and
      cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on ER stress and cell death responses in mouse and 
      human primary acini and the acinar cell line AR42J. Cells were incubated with
      EtOH (50 mmol/L), CSE (20-40 mug/mL), or both (CSE+EtOH), and analyzed by
      immunoblotting, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and
      cell death assays. Some cells were incubated with MKC-3946, an inhibitor of
      endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling 1 (ERN1, also called IRE1) that blocks
      XBP1s formation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed isocaloric amounts of an
      EtOH-containing (Lieber-DeCarli) or control diet for 11 weeks and exposed to
      cigarette smoke or room air in an exposure chamber for 2 hours each day. During
      the last 3 weeks, a subset of rats received intravenous injections of
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3 mg/kg per week) to induce pancreatitis or saline
      (control). Pancreatic tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and
      immunostaining techniques. RESULTS: In AR42J and primary acini, CSE+EtOH induced 
      cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), but neither agent alone had this effect.
      Cell death was associated with a significant decrease in expression of XBP1s.
      CSE+EtOH, but neither agent alone, slightly decreased adenosine triphosphate
      levels in AR42J cells, but induced oxidative stress and sustained activation
      (phosphorylation) of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3
      (EIF2AK3, also called PERK) and increased protein levels of DNA damage inducible 
      transcript 3 (DDIT3, also called CHOP). CHOP regulates transcription to promote
      apoptosis. Incubation of AR42J or primary mouse or human acinar cells with
      MKC-3946 reduced expression of XBP1s, increased levels of CHOP, and induced cell 
      death. In rats fed an EtOH diet, exposure to cigarette smoke increased ER stress 
      in acinar cells and sensitized the pancreas to LPS-induced pathology.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoke promotes cell death and features of pancreatitis in 
      EtOH-sensitized acinar cells by suppressing the adaptive unfolded protein
      response signaling pathway. It also activates ER stress pathways that promote
      acinar cell death.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Methylation of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) often occurs in an 
      age-dependent manner, as a field defect in some instances, and may be an early
      event in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. We aimed to determine whether
      specific mRNA signature patterns (MIR1, MIR9, MIR124, MIR137, MIR34B/C) could be 
      used to identify patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are at increased risk 
      for colorectal neoplasia. METHODS: We obtained 387 colorectal tissue specimens
      collected from 238 patients with UC (152 without neoplasia, 17 with dysplasia,
      and 69 with UC-associated colorectal cancer [UC-CRC]), from 2 independent cohorts
      in Japan between 2005 and 2015. We quantified methylation of miRNAs by bisulfite 
      pyrosequencing analysis. We analyzed clinical data to determine whether miRNA
      methylation patterns were associated with age, location, or segment of the
      colorectum (cecum, transverse colon, and rectum). Differences in tissue miRNA
      methylation and expression levels were compared among samples and associated with
      cancer risk using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests as
      appropriate. We performed a validation study of samples from 90 patients without 
      UC and 61 patients with UC-associated dysplasia or cancer to confirm the
      association between specific methylation patterns of miRNAs in non-tumor rectal
      mucosa from patients with UC at risk of UC-CRC. RESULTS: Among patients with UC
      without neoplasia, rectal tissues had significantly higher levels of methylation 
      levels of MIR1, MIR9, MIR124, and MIR137 than in proximal mucosa; levels of
      methylation were associated with age and duration of UC in rectal mucosa.
      Methylation of all miRNAs was significantly higher in samples from patients with 
      dysplasia or CRC compared with samples from patients without neoplasia. Receiver 
      operating characteristic analysis revealed that methylation levels of miRNAs in
      rectal mucosa accurately differentiated patients with CRC from those without.
      Methylation of MIR137 in rectal mucosa was an independent risk factor for UC-CRC.
      Methylation patterns of a set of miRNAs (panel) could discriminate discriminate
      UC patients with or without dysplasia or CRC in the evaluation cohort (area under
      the curve, 0.81) and the validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.78).
      CONCLUSIONS: In evaluation and validation cohorts, we found specific miRNAs to be
      methylated in rectal mucosal samples from patients with UC with dysplasia or CRC 
      compared with patients without neoplasms. This pattern also associated with
      patient age and might be used to identify patients with UC at greatest risk for
      developing UC-CRC. Our findings provide evidence for a field defect in rectal
      mucosa from patients with UC-CRC.

AB  - There is controversy over how to best manage patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease and flat low-grade dysplasia (fLGD) in the colon. We performed a
      retrospective analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colon tissues with
      fLGD from 37 patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy for inflammatory bowel 
      disease from 1990 to 2015 at the University of California at San Francisco
      Medical Center, to determine whether detection of aneuploidy is associated with
      later development of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal cancer. Medical
      data were collected from the patients for a mean follow-up time of 37 months.
      Using flow cytometry analysis of paraffin-embedded colon tissue, we detected
      aneuploidy in 15 of 37 samples with fLGD (40.5%). By comparison, aneuploidy was
      detected in 14 of 15 samples with flat HGD (93.3%) and 2 of 45 samples that were 
      negative for dysplasia (4.4%). The univariate hazard ratio for subsequent
      detection of HGD or colorectal cancer in patients with fLGD and aneuploidy was
      5.3 (95% CI, 1.542-24.121) within a mean follow-up time of 37 months. The
      presence of aneuploidy therefore identifies patients with fLGD in colon tissue
      who have an increased risk for HGD or colorectal cancer and may provide
      supportive evidence to a morphologic impression or suspicion of flat HGD.

TI  - Predictors of Use of Monitored Anesthesia Care for Outpatient Gastrointestinal
      Endoscopy in a Capitated Payment System.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Use of monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy has increased in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as in
      fee-for-service environments, despite the absence of financial incentives. We
      investigated factors associated with use of MAC in an integrated health care
      delivery system with a capitated payment model. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective cohort study using multilevel logistic regression, with MAC use
      modeled as a function of procedure year, patient- and provider-level factors, and
      facility effects. We collected data from 2,091,590 veterans who underwent
      outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy during fiscal years
      2000-2013 at 133 facilities. RESULTS: The adjusted rate of MAC use in the VHA
      increased 17% per year (odds ratio for increase, 1.17; 95% confidence interval,
      1.09-1.27) from fiscal year 2000 through 2013. The most rapid increase occurred
      starting in 2011. VHA use of MAC was associated with patient-level factors that
      included obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, higher comorbidity, and use of
      prescription opioids and/or benzodiazepines, although the magnitude of these
      effects was small. Provider-level and facility factors were also associated with 
      use of MAC, although again the magnitude of these associations was small.
      Unmeasured facility-level effects had the greatest effect on the trend of MAC
      use. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective study of veterans who underwent outpatient
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy from fiscal year 2000 through 2013,
      we found that even in a capitated system, patient factors are only weakly
      associated with use of MAC. Facility-level effects are the most prominent factor 
      influencing increasing use of MAC. Future studies should focus on better defining
      the role of MAC and facility and organizational factors that affect choice of
      endoscopic sedation. It will also be important to align resources and incentives 
      to promote appropriate allocation of MAC based on clinically meaningful patient
      factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Administration of tryptophan and some of its metabolites
      reduces the severity of colitis in mice, whereas removing tryptophan from the
      diet increases susceptibility to colitis. Transfer of the intestinal microbiome
      transfers the colitogenic phenotype from tryptophan starved animals to normally
      nourished mice. We aimed to systematically evaluate serum levels of tryptophan
      and its metabolites in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and study
      their association with clinical and serologic features. METHODS: We studied 535
      consecutive patients with IBD (211 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 234 with Crohn's
      disease [CD]; 236 male), enrolled in Germany from August 2013 through April 2014 
      and followed until July 2016. Serum samples were collected from patients and 291 
      matched individuals without IBD (controls); levels of tryptophan were measured
      using high-performance liquid chromatography. Metabolites of tryptophan were
      measured in serum from 148 patients and 100 controls by mass spectrometry. We
      measured levels of interleukin 22 in serum from 28 patients by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Paired stool and serum samples were collected from a subset 
      of patients with active UC (n = 10) or CD (n = 8) to investigate associations
      between serum levels of tryptophan and composition of the fecal microbiota,
      analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing. We used real-time polymerase
      chain reaction to measure levels of messenger RNAs in colonic biopsies from 60
      patients with UC, 50 with CD, and 30 controls. We collected information on
      patients' disease activity scores, medications, laboratory assessments, and
      clinical examinations during recruitment and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Serum
      levels of tryptophan were significantly lower in patients with IBD than in
      controls (P = 5.3 x 10(-6)) with a stronger reduction in patients with CD (vs
      control; P = 1.1 x 10(-10)) than UC (vs control; P = 2.8 x 10(-3)). We found a
      negative correlation between serum levels of tryptophan and disease activity or
      levels of C-reactive protein. Levels of messenger RNAs encoding tryptophan
      2,3-dioxygenase-2 and solute carrier family 6 member 19 (also called B0AT1) were 
      significantly decreased in colonic biopsies from patients with IBD compared with 
      controls, whereas level of messenger RNA encoding indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1
      was significantly increased. The composition of the fecal microbiota associated
      with serum levels of tryptophan. Analysis of tryptophan metabolites revealed
      activation of the kynurenine pathway, based on high levels of quinolinic acid, in
      patients with IBD compared with controls. Serum concentration of interleukin 22
      associated with disease activity in patients with IBD; there was an inverse
      association between levels of interleukin 22 and serum levels of tryptophan.
      CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of serum samples from more than 500 patients with
      IBD, we observed a negative correlation between serum levels of tryptophan and
      disease activity. Increased levels of tryptophan metabolites-especially of
      quinolinic acid-indicated a high activity of tryptophan degradation in patients
      with active IBD. Tryptophan deficiency could contribute to development of IBD or 
      aggravate disease activity. Interventional clinical studies are needed to
      determine whether modification of intestinal tryptophan pathways affects the
      severity of IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Altered gut microbiota is implicated in development of
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to
      potentiate intestinal carcinogenesis by producing genotoxins, altering the immune
      response and intestinal microenvironment, and activating oncogenic signaling
      pathways. We investigated whether stool from patients with CRC could directly
      induce colorectal carcinogenesis in mice. METHODS: We obtained stored stool
      samples from participants in a metagenome study performed in Hong Kong.
      Conventional (male C57BL/6) mice were given azoxymethane to induce colon
      neoplasia after receiving a course of antibiotics in drinking water. Mice were
      gavaged twice weekly with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5 healthy individuals
      (controls) for 5 weeks. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were gavaged once with stool from 
      5 patients with CRC or 5 controls. We collected intestinal tissues from mice and 
      performed histology, immunohistochemistry, expression microarray, quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and flow cytometry analyses. We performed 
      16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of feces from mice. RESULTS:
      Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool from
      individuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia (P < .05) 
      and macroscopic polyps (P < .01). We observed a higher proportion of
      proliferating (Ki-67-positive) cells in colons of germ-free mice fed with stool
      from patients with CRC vs those fed with stool from controls (P < .05). Feces
      from germ-free and conventional mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs
      controls contained different microbial compositions, with lower richness in mice 
      fed with stool from patients with CRC. Intestines collected from conventional and
      germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC had increased expression of 
      cytokines that modulate inflammation, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1,
      C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, interleukin 17A (IL17A), IL22, and IL23A.
      Intestines from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with
      CRC contained higher proportions of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (2.25% vs 0.44%) and
      Th17 cells (2.08% vs 0.31%) (P < .05 for each) than mice fed with stool from
      controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction arrays revealed up-regulation of
      genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
      invasiveness, and metastasis in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC.
      CONCLUSIONS: We fed stool samples from patients with CRC and heathy individuals
      to germ-free mice and conventional mice with azoxymethane. We found stool from
      patients with CRC to increase the numbers of polyps, levels of intestinal
      dysplasia and proliferation, markers of inflammation, and proportions of Th1 and 
      Th17 cells in colon, compared with stool from individuals without CRC. This study
      provides evidence that the fecal microbiota from patients with CRC can promote
      tumorigenesis in germ-free mice and mice given a carcinogen.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Polycomb group proteins are epigenetic factors that silence
      gene expression; they are dysregulated in cancer cells and contribute to
      carcinogenesis by unclear mechanisms. We investigated whether BMI1
      proto-oncogene, polycomb ring finger (BMI1), and polycomb group ring finger 2
      (PCGF2, also called MEL18) are involved in the initiation and progression of
      colitis-associated cancer (CAC) in mice. METHODS: We generated mice containing
      floxed alleles of Bmi1 and/or Mel18 and/or Reg3b using the villin-Cre promoter
      (called Bmi1(DeltaIEC), Mel18(DeltaIEC), DKO, and TKO mice). We also disrupted
      Bmi1 and/or Mel18 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) using the
      villin-CreER(T2)-inducible promoter. CAC was induced in cre-negative littermate
      mice (control) and mice with conditional disruption of Bmi1 and/or Mel18 by
      intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM) followed by addition of dextran
      sulfate sodium (DSS) to drinking water. Colon tissues were collected from mice
      and analyzed by histology and immunoblots; IECs were isolated and used in cDNA
      microarray analyses. RESULTS: Following administration of AOM and DSS, DKO mice
      developed significantly fewer polyps than control, Bmi1(DeltaIEC),
      Mel18(DeltaIEC), Reg3b(DeltaIEC), or TKO mice. Adenomas in the colons of DKO mice
      were low-grade dysplasias, whereas adenomas in control, Bmi1(DeltaIEC),
      Mel18(DeltaIEC), Reg3b(DeltaIEC), or TKO mice were high-grade dysplasias with
      aggressive invasion of the muscularis mucosa. Disruption of Bmi1 and Mel18 (DKO
      mice) during late stages of carcinogenesis significantly reduced the numbers of
      large adenomas and the load of total adenomas, reduced proliferation, and
      increased apoptosis in colon tissues. IECs isolated from DKO mice after AOM and
      DSS administration had increased expression of Reg3b compared with control,
      Bmi1(DeltaIEC), or Mel18(DeltaIEC) mice. Expression of REG3B was sufficient to
      inhibit cytokine-induced activation of STAT3 in IECs. The human REG3beta protein,
      the functional counterpart of mouse REG3B, inhibited STAT3 activity in human 293T
      cells, and its expression level in colorectal tumors correlated inversely with
      pSTAT3 level and survival times of patients. CONCLUSIONS: BMI1 and MEL18
      contribute to the development of CAC in mice by promoting proliferation and
      reducing apoptosis via suppressing expression of Reg3b. REG3B negatively
      regulates cytokine-induced activation of STAT3 in colon epithelial cells. This
      pathway might be targeted in patients with colitis to reduce carcinogenesis.

TI  - Clinical Practice Update: The Use of Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy in Achalasia:
      Expert Review and Best Practice Advice From the AGA Institute.

LID - S0016-5085(17)36201-7 [pii]

AB  - The purpose of this review is to describe a place for per-oral endoscopic myotomy
      (POEM) among the currently available robust treatments for achalasia. The
      recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on
      relevant publications from PubMed and EMbase. The Clinical Practice Updates
      Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association proposes the following 
      recommendations: 1) in determining the need for achalasia therapy,
      patient-specific parameters (Chicago Classification subtype, comorbidities, early
      vs late disease, primary or secondary causes) should be considered along with
      published efficacy data; 2) given the complexity of this procedure, POEM should
      be performed by experienced physicians in high-volume centers because an
      estimated 20-40 procedures are needed to achieve competence; 3) if the expertise 
      is available, POEM should be considered as primary therapy for type III
      achalasia; 4) if the expertise is available, POEM should be considered as
      treatment option comparable with laparoscopic Heller myotomy for any of the
      achalasia syndromes; and 5) post-POEM patients should be considered high risk to 
      develop reflux esophagitis and advised of the management considerations
      (potential indefinite proton pump inhibitor therapy and/or surveillance
      endoscopy) of this before undergoing the procedure.

AB  - Pancreatitis is a common disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, yet
      little is known about its pathogenesis, and there is no specific or effective
      treatment. Its development involves dysregulated autophagy and unresolved
      inflammation, demonstrated by studies in genetic and experimental mouse models.
      Disease severity depends on whether the inflammatory response resolves or
      amplifies, leading to multi-organ failure. Dysregulated autophagy might promote
      the inflammatory response in the pancreas. We discuss the roles of autophagy and 
      inflammation in pancreatitis, mechanisms of deregulation, and connections among
      disordered pathways. We identify gaps in our knowledge and delineate perspective 
      directions for research. Elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms could lead to new
      targets for treating or reducing the severity of pancreatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alterations in signaling pathways that regulate resolution of 
      inflammation (resolving pathways) contribute to pathogenesis of ulcerative
      colitis (UC). The resolution process is regulated by lipid mediators, such as
      those derived from the omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whose esterified form 
      is transported by the major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A (MFSD2A)
      through the endothelium of brain, retina, and placenta. We investigated if and
      how MFSD2A regulates lipid metabolism of gut endothelial cells to promote
      resolution of intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We performed lipidomic and
      functional analyses of MFSD2A in mucosal biopsies and primary human intestinal
      microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) isolated from surgical specimens from
      patients with active, resolving UC and healthy individuals without UC (controls).
      MFSD2A was knocked down in HIMECs with small hairpin RNAs or overexpressed from a
      lentiviral vector. Human circulating endothelial progenitor cells that
      overexpress MFSD2A were transferred to CD1 nude mice with dextran sodium
      sulfate-induced colitis, with or without oral administration of DHA. RESULTS:
      Colonic biopsies from patients with UC had reduced levels of
      inflammation-resolving DHA-derived epoxy metabolites compared to healthy colon
      tissues or tissues with resolution of inflammation. Production of these
      metabolites by HIMECs required MFSD2A, which is required for DHA retention and
      metabolism in the gut vasculature. In mice with colitis, transplanted endothelial
      progenitor cells that overexpressed MFSD2A not only localized to the inflamed
      mucosa but also restored the ability of the endothelium to resolve intestinal
      inflammation, compared with mice with colitis that did not receive
      MFSD2A-overexpressing endothelial progenitors. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of DHA-derived
      epoxides are lower in colon tissues from patients with UC than healthy and
      resolving mucosa. Production of these metabolites by gut endothelium requires
      MFSD2A; endothelial progenitor cells that overexpress MFSD2A reduce colitis in
      mice. This pathway might be induced to resolve intestinal inflammation in
      patients with colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel diseases has been 
      associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF). The intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel 
      diseases has reduced expression of solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3,
      also called DRA). We investigated whether TNF directly affects expression of DRA 
      in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and in the intestines of mice, and
      studied the mechanisms of these effects. METHODS: We performed quantitative
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and
      immunoblot analyses in Caco-2, HT-29, and T-84 cells human IECs cultured in 2 or 
      3 dimensions with or without TNF (50 ng/mL for 6-24 hours). We purified nuclear
      extracts and quantified nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and DNA
      binding. We isolated intestinal crypts from C57BL/6 mice, cultured enteroids,
      incubated these with TNF (50 ng/mL, 24 hours), and quantified messenger RNAs.
      DRA-mediated exchange of Cl(-) for HCO3(-) was measured by uptake of (125)I.
      Expression of the NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha (IkBa) was knocked down in Caco-2
      cells with small interfering RNAs. Activation of NF-kappaB in response to TNF was
      measured by luciferase reporter assays; binding of the NF-kappaB subunit p65 in
      cells was analyzed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. DRA promoter activity
      was measured in a luciferase reporter assay. C57BL/6 mice were injected with TNF 
      (5 mug/mouse for 3-6 hours) or vehicle (control); intestines were collected and
      analyzed by immunofluorescence, or RNA and protein were collected from the
      mucosa. RESULTS: Incubation of IECs with TNF reduced expression of DRA. Knockdown
      of NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha in IECs led to nuclear translocation of the
      NF-kappaB subunit p65 and reduced levels of DRA messenger RNA and protein.
      Expression of a transgene encoding p65 or p50 in IECs led to significant
      reductions in the promoter activity of DRA and its expression. In chromatin
      immunoprecipitation assays, p65 bound directly to the promoter of DRA, at the
      regions of -935 to -629 and -375 to -84. Injection of mice with TNF or incubation
      of crypt-derived enteroids with TNF reduced their expression of DRA messenger RNA
      and protein. CONCLUSIONS: In human IECs and intestinal tissues from mice, we
      found TNF to activate NF-kappaB, which reduced expression of the Cl(-) / HCO3(-) 
      exchanger DRA (SLC26A3), via direct binding to the promoter of DRA. This pathway 
      is an important therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease-associated
      diarrhea.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death
      among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Moderate drinking
      (vs abstinence) is associated with lower risk of CVD in the general population.
      We assessed whether alcohol use is associated with CVD risk in patients with
      NAFLD. METHODS: We analyzed data from participants in the Coronary Artery Risk
      Development in Young Adults longitudinal cohort study of 5115 black and white
      young adults, 18-30 years old, recruited from 4 cities in the United States from 
      1985 through 1986. Participants self-reported alcohol use at study entry and then
      again after 15, 20, and 25 years. At year 25 (2010-2011), participants underwent 
      computed tomography examination of the thorax and abdomen and tissue Doppler
      echocardiography with myocardial strain measured by speckle tracking. Coronary
      artery calcification was defined as an Agatston score above 0. NAFLD was defined 
      as liver attenuation <51 Hounsfield Units after exclusions. Drinkers reported
      1-21 (men) or 1-14 (women) standard drinks/week at years 15, 20, or 25.
      Nondrinkers reported no alcohol use at years 15, 20, and 25. RESULTS: Of the 570 
      participants with NAFLD (mean age, 50 years; 54% black; 46% female), 332 (58%)
      were drinkers; significantly higher proportions of drinkers were white, male, and
      with higher levels of education compared with nondrinkers (P < .05 for all).
      Higher proportions of drinkers had obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome
      compared with nondrinkers (P < .01). There was no difference in liver attenuation
      between groups (P = .12). After multivariable adjustment, there was no
      association between alcohol use and CVD risk factors (diabetes, hypertension,
      hyperlipidemia) or subclinical CVD measures (coronary artery calcification, early
      transmitral velocity/late (atrial) transmitral velocity (E/A) ratio, global
      longitudinal strain). CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based sample of individuals
      with NAFLD in midlife, prospectively assessed alcohol use is not associated with 
      significant differences in risk factors for CVD or markers of subclinical CVD. In
      contrast to general population findings, alcohol use may not reduce the risk of
      CVD in patients with NAFLD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided chemoablation with ethanol 
      lavage followed by infusion of paclitaxel is effective for the treatment of
      mucinous pancreatic cysts. However, complications arise in 3%-10% of patients,
      presumably linked to the inflammatory effects of ethanol. We aimed to determine
      whether alcohol is required for effective pancreatic cyst ablation, if removing
      alcohol from the ablation process would improve complication rates, and whether a
      multi-agent chemotherapeutic cocktail could increase the rate of complete cyst
      resolution compared with findings reported from previous trials using alcohol
      followed by paclitaxel alone. METHODS: Between November 2011 and December 2016,
      we conducted a single-center, prospective, double-blind trial of 39 patients with
      mucinous-type pancreatic cysts. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups 
      that underwent EUS-guided pancreatic cyst lavage with either 80% ethanol
      (control) or normal saline (alcohol-free group). Cysts in both groups were then
      infused with an admixture of paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Primary outcomes were
      the rates of complete ablation 12 months after the procedure, and rates of
      serious and minor adverse events within 30 days of the procedure. RESULTS: At 12 
      months, 67% of patients who underwent alcohol-free EUS-guided cyst chemoablation 
      had complete ablation of cysts compared with 61% of patients in the control
      group. Serious adverse events occurred in 6% of patients in the control group vs 
      none of the patients in the alcohol-free group. Minor adverse events occurred in 
      22% of patients in the control group and none of the patients in the alcohol-free
      group. The overall rate of complete ablation was 64%. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we found that alcohol is not required 
      for effective EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation, and when alcohol is removed
      from the ablation process, there is a significant reduction in associated adverse
      events. A multi-agent chemotherapeutic ablation admixture did not appear to
      significantly improve rates of complete ablation compared with the current
      standard of alcohol lavage followed by paclitaxel alone. ClinicalTrials.gov ID:
      NCT01475331.

      Behavior in Mice With Liver Inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory liver disease commonly develop
      debilitating symptoms, called sickness behaviors, which arise via changes in
      brain function. Monocytes that produce tumor necrosis factor interact with
      cerebral endothelial cells to activate microglial cells and promote sickness
      behavior. Platelets regulate inflammation, and aggregates of monocytes and
      platelets are increased in the circulation of patients with liver disease. We
      investigated the role of platelets in inducing inflammatory features of
      circulating monocytes and promoting sickness behaviors in mice with cholestatic
      liver injury. METHODS: We performed bile-duct ligations or sham surgeries on
      C57BL/6 or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-knockout mice to induce liver
      inflammation. Liver inflammation was also induced in a separate group of mice by 
      administration of concanavalin A. Circulating platelets, aggregates of monocytes 
      and platelets, and activation of microglial cells were measured by flow
      cytometry. To deplete platelets, mice were given anti-thrombocyte serum or normal
      rabbit serum (control) 4 days after surgery. Interactions between monocytes and
      cerebral endothelial cells were analyzed by intravital microscopy. Sickness
      behaviors were quantified based on time spent by adult mice engaging in social
      behaviors toward a juvenile mouse, compared with time spent in nonsocial behavior
      or remaining immobile. RESULTS: Aggregates of monocytes and platelets in
      circulation of mice increased significantly following bile-duct ligation.
      Platelet-monocyte interactions were required for activation of inflammatory
      monocytes and production of tumor necrosis factor. Platelet depletion greatly
      reduced adhesive interactions between inflammatory monocytes and adhesive
      interactions with cerebral endothelial cells and activation of the microglia, as 
      well as development of sickness behavior. Furthermore, TLR4 signaling was
      important for aggregation of monocytes and platelets, and development of sickness
      behavior following bile-duct ligation. These findings were confirmed in mice with
      concanavalin A-induced liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: In mice with liver
      inflammation, we found TLR4 and aggregates of monocytes and platelets to regulate
      microglial activation and development of sickness behavior. These findings might 
      lead to new therapeutic strategies for liver disease-associated symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Effective treatments are needed for hepatic steatosis
      characterized by accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, which leads to
      hepatocellular carcinoma. MicroRNA 122 (MIR122) is expressed only in the liver,
      where it regulates lipid metabolism. We investigated the mechanism by which free 
      fatty acids (FFAs) regulate MIR122 expression and the effect of MIR122 on
      triglyceride synthesis. METHODS: We analyzed MIR122 promoter activity and
      validated its target mRNAs by transfection of Luciferase reporter plasmids into
      Huh7, BNL-1ME, and HEK293 cultured cell lines. We measured levels of microRNAs
      and mRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RNA extracted from plasma,
      liver, muscle, and adipose tissues of C57BL/6 mice given the FFA-inducer
      CL316243. MIR122 was inhibited using an inhibitor of MIR122. Metabolic profiles
      of mice were determined using metabolic chambers and by histologic analyses of
      liver tissues. We performed RNA sequence analyses to identify metabolic pathways 
      involving MIR122. RESULTS: We validated human Agpat1 and Dgat1 mRNAs, involved in
      triglyceride synthesis, as targets of MIR122. FFAs increased MIR122 expression in
      livers of mice by activating the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha, and
      induced secretion of MIR122 from liver to blood. Circulating MIR122 entered
      muscle and adipose tissues of mice, reducing mRNA levels of genes involved in
      triglyceride synthesis. Mice injected with an inhibitor of MIR122 and then given 
      CL316243, accumulated triglycerides in liver and muscle tissues, and had reduced 
      rates of beta-oxidation. There was a positive correlation between level of FFAs
      and level of MIR122 in plasma samples from 6 healthy individuals, collected
      before and during fasting. CONCLUSIONS: In biochemical and histologic studies of 
      plasma, liver, muscle, and adipose tissues from mice, we found that FFAs increase
      hepatic expression and secretion of MIR122, which regulates energy storage vs
      expenditure in liver and peripheral tissues. Strategies to reduce triglyceride
      levels, by increasing MIR122, might be developed for treatment of metabolic
      syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interactions between commensal microbes and the immune system 
      are tightly regulated and maintain intestinal homeostasis, but little is known
      about these interactions in humans. We investigated responses of human CD4(+) T
      cells to the intestinal microbiota. We measured the abundance of T cells in
      circulation and intestinal tissues that respond to intestinal microbes and
      determined their clonal diversity. We also assessed their functional phenotypes
      and effects on intestinal resident cell populations, and studied alterations in
      microbe-reactive T cells in patients with chronic intestinal inflammation.
      METHODS: We collected samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
      intestinal tissues from healthy individuals (controls, n = 13-30) and patients
      with inflammatory bowel diseases (n = 119; 59 with ulcerative colitis and 60 with
      Crohn's disease). We used 2 independent assays (CD154 detection and
      carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution assays) and 9 intestinal
      bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium
      animalis subsp lactis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides vulgatus,
      Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus obeum, Salmonella typhimurium, and
      Clostridium difficile) to quantify, expand, and characterize microbe-reactive
      CD4(+) T cells. We sequenced T-cell receptor Vbeta genes in expanded
      microbe-reactive T-cell lines to determine their clonal diversity. We examined
      the effects of microbe-reactive CD4(+) T cells on intestinal stromal and
      epithelial cell lines. Cytokines, chemokines, and gene expression patterns were
      measured by flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS:
      Circulating and gut-resident CD4(+) T cells from controls responded to bacteria
      at frequencies of 40-4000 per million for each bacterial species tested.
      Microbiota-reactive CD4(+) T cells were mainly of a memory phenotype, present in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal tissue, and had a diverse
      T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire. These cells were functionally heterogeneous,
      produced barrier-protective cytokines, and stimulated intestinal stromal and
      epithelial cells via interleukin 17A, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis
      factor. In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, microbiota-reactive CD4(+) 
      T cells were reduced in the blood compared with intestine; T-cell responses that 
      we detected had an increased frequency of interleukin 17A production compared
      with responses of T cells from blood or intestinal tissues of controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal 
      tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases vs controls, we found that
      reactivity to intestinal bacteria is a normal property of the human CD4(+) T-cell
      repertoire, and does not necessarily indicate disrupted interactions between
      immune cells and the commensal microbiota. T-cell responses to commensals might
      support intestinal homeostasis, by producing barrier-protective cytokines and
      providing a large pool of T cells that react to pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a screen for genes whose expression correlates
      with invasiveness of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. We studied 
      the effects of overexpression and knockdown of these genes in cell lines and
      expression levels in patient samples. METHODS: We selected genes for analysis
      from 11 loci associated with risk of ESCC. We analyzed the effects of knocking
      down expression of 47 of these genes using RNA interference on-chip analysis in
      ESCC cells and HeLa cells. Cells with gene overexpression and knockdown were
      analyzed in migration and invasion assays or injected into nude mice and
      metastasis of xenograft tumors was quantified. We collected ESCC and non-tumor
      esophageal tissues from 94 individuals who underwent surgery in China from 2010
      and 2014; clinical information was collected and survival time was measured from 
      the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death. Levels of messenger
      RNAs (mRNAs) were quantified by RNA sequencing, and levels of proteins were
      determined from immunoblot analyses. Patient survival was compared with mRNA
      levels using Kaplan-Meier methods and hazard ratios were calculated by Cox
      models. RESULTS: We identified 8 genes whose disruption increased migration and
      10 genes whose disruption reduced migration. Knockdown of BRCA1-associated
      protein gene (BRAP) significantly reduced migration of KYSE30, KYSE150, and HeLa 
      cells. In patient tumors, 90% of ESCCs examined had higher levels of BRAP protein
      than paired non-tumor tissues, and 63.8% had gains in BRAP DNA copy number.
      Levels of BRAP mRNA in ESCC tissues correlated with patient survival time, and
      high expression increased risk of death 2.4-fold compared with low expression.
      ESCCs that had metastasized to lymph node had significantly higher levels of BRAP
      mRNA than tumors without metastases. Knockdown of BRAP in ESCC and HeLa cell
      lines significantly reduced migration and invasiveness; these cell lines formed
      less metastases in mice than control cells. Nuclear translocation of the nuclear 
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) P65 subunit and phosphorylation of inhibitor of
      NF-kappaB kinase subunit beta (IKBKB or IKKbeta) increased in cells that
      overexpressed BRAP and decreased in cells with BRAP knockdown. In
      immunoprecipitation assays, BRAP interacted directly with IKKbeta. Expression of 
      matrix metalloproteinase 9 and vascular epithelial growth factor C, which are
      regulated by NF-kappaB, was significantly reduced in cells with knockdown of BRAP
      and significantly increased in cells that overexpressed BRAP. CONCLUSIONS:
      Expression of BRAP is increased in ESCC samples compared with non-tumor
      esophageal tissues; increased expression correlates with reduced patient survival
      time and promotes metastasis of xenograft tumors in mice. BRAP overexpression
      leads to increased activity of NF-kappaB and expression of matrix
      metalloproteinase 9 and vascular epithelial growth factor C.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis affects phenotypes of innate and adaptive
      immune cells. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are enriched in the
      liver as compared with the blood, respond to intra-hepatic cytokines, and (via
      the semi-invariant T-cell receptor) to bacteria translocated from the gut. Little
      is known about the role of MAIT cells in livers of patients with chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and their fate after antiviral therapy.
      METHODS: We collected blood samples from 42 patients with chronic HCV infection
      who achieved a sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of treatment with
      sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood before
      treatment, at weeks 4 and 12 during treatment, and 24 weeks after the end of
      treatment. Liver biopsies were collected from 37 of the patients prior to and at 
      week 4 of treatment. Mononuclear cells from 56 blood donors and 10 livers that
      were not suitable for transplantation were used as controls. Liver samples were
      assessed histologically for inflammation and fibrosis. Mononuclear cells from
      liver and blood were studied by flow cytometry and analyzed for responses to
      cytokine and bacterial stimulation. RESULTS: The frequency of MAIT cells among T 
      cells was significantly lower in blood and liver samples of patients with HCV
      infection than of controls (median, 1.31% vs 2.32% for blood samples, P = .0048; 
      and median, 4.34% vs 13.40% for liver samples, P = .001). There was an inverse
      correlation between the frequency of MAIT cells in the liver and histologically
      determined levels of liver inflammation (r = -.5437, P = .0006) and fibrosis (r =
      -.5829, P = .0002). MAIT cells from the liver had higher levels of activation and
      cytotoxicity than MAIT cells from blood (P < .0001). Production of interferon
      gamma by MAIT cells was dependent on monocyte-derived interleukin 18, and was
      reduced in patients with HCV infection in response to T-cell receptor-mediated
      but not cytokine-mediated stimulation, as compared with controls. Anti-viral
      therapy rapidly decreased liver inflammation and MAIT cell activation and
      cytotoxicity, and increased the MAIT cell frequency among intra-hepatic but not
      blood T cells. The MAIT cell response to T-cell receptor-mediated stimulation did
      not change during the 12 weeks of antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of 
      paired blood and liver samples from patients with chronic HCV infection before,
      during, and after antiviral therapy with sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, we found
      that intrahepatic MAIT cells are activated by monocyte-derived cytokines and
      depleted in HCV-induced liver inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Induction of nonapoptotic cell death could be an approach to
      eliminate apoptosis-resistant tumors. We investigated necroptosis-based therapies
      in mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC). METHODS: We
      screened 273 commercially available kinase inhibitors for cytotoxicity against a 
      human PDAC cell line (PANC1). We evaluated the ability of the aurora kinase
      inhibitor CCT137690 to stimulate necroptosis in PDAC cell lines (PANC1, PANC2.03,
      CFPAC1, MiaPaCa2, BxPc3, and PANC02) and the HEK293 cell line, measuring loss of 
      plasma membrane integrity, gain in cell volume, swollen organelles, and
      cytoplasmic vacuoles. We tested the effects of CCT137690 in colon formation
      assays, and the effects of the necroptosis (necrostatin-1 and necrosulfonamide), 
      apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis inhibitors. We derived cells from tumors
      that developed in Pdx1-Cre;K-Ras(G12D/+);p53(R172H/+) (KPC) mice. Genes encoding 
      proteins in cell death pathways were knocked out, knocked down, or expressed from
      transgenes in PDAC cell lines. Athymic nude or B6 mice were given subcutaneous
      injections of PDAC cells or tail-vein injections of KPC tumor cells. Mice were
      given CCT137690 (80 mg/kg) or vehicle and tumor growth was monitored; tumor
      tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We compared gene
      expression levels between human pancreatic cancer tissues (n = 130) with patient 
      survival times using the online R2 genomics analysis and visualization platform. 
      RESULTS: CCT137690 induced necrosis-like death in PDAC cell lines and reduced
      colony formation; these effects required RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, as well as
      inhibition of aurora kinase A (AURKA). AURKA interacted directly with RIPK1 and
      RIPK3 to reduce necrosome activation. AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen 
      synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) at serine 9 inhibited activation of the RIPK3
      and MLKL necrosome. Mutations in AURKA (D274A) or GSK3beta (S9A), or
      pharmacologic inhibitors of RIPK1 signaling via RIPK3 and MLKL, reduced the
      cytotoxic activity of CCT137690 in PDAC cells. Oral administration of CCT137690
      induced necroptosis and immunogenic cell death in subcutaneous and orthotopic
      tumors in mice, and reduced tumor growth and tumor cell phosphorylation of AURKA 
      and GSK3beta. CCT137690 increased survival times of mice with orthotopic KPC
      PDACs and reduced tumor growth, stroma, and metastasis. Increased expression of
      AURKA and GSK3beta mRNAs associated with shorter survival times of patients with 
      pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the aurora kinase inhibitor
      CCT137690 as an agent that induces necrosis-like death in PDAC cells, via RIPK1, 
      RIPK3, and MLKL. CCT137690 slowed growth of orthotopic tumors from PDAC cells in 
      mice, and expression of AURKA and GSK3beta associate with patient survival times.
      AURKA might be targeted for treatment of pancreatic cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroparesis is a complication of diabetes with few treatment
      options. Relamorelin (also referred to as RM-131) is a selective, prokinetic
      agonist of ghrelin. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of relamorelin on symptoms 
      and gastric emptying (GE) in a 12-week, phase 2B study of diabetic patients with 
      moderate to severe gastroparesis symptoms (DG). METHODS: We performed a study of 
      393 patients with DG (37.7% male; 9.9% with type 1 diabetes; median age, 58.2
      years [range 20-76]; median body mass index, 31.4 kg/m(2) [range, 18.2-60.1];
      HbA1c level, 7.6%, [range, 5.2-11.0]). All participants had (13)C-spirulina GE
      breath test T1/2 values of 79 minutes or more (with 89.8% delayed relative to
      90(th) %ile of normal, 85.75 minutes), recent vomiting, and gastroparesis
      cardinal symptom index-daily diary scores of 2.6 or more. Patients were randomly 
      assigned to groups given placebo (n=104) or relamorelin (10 mug [n=98], 30 mug
      [n=109], or 100 mug [n=82] twice daily) for 12 weeks, following a 2-week,
      single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patient-reported outcomes were determined
      from DG Symptom Severity daily e-diaries, in which patients recorded vomiting
      frequency and symptom scores (nausea, abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, and 
      bloating) on a 0-10 scale. Endpoints were change from baseline in vomiting
      frequency, composite DG Symptom Severity score, GE, and safety. We performed
      longitudinal, mixed-effects model analysis using repeated measures, with baseline
      and baseline-by-week interaction values as covariates. RESULTS: Patients given
      relamorelin had a 75% reduction in vomiting frequency compared with baseline, but
      this difference was not significant compared with the placebo group. All 4
      symptoms of DG (composite or individual symptoms) were significantly reduced over
      the 12-week study period in all 3 relamorelin dose groups compared with the
      placebo group (all P < .05, based on longitudinal analysis over 12 weeks).
      Relamorelin significantly accelerated GE from baseline compared with placebo (by 
      12%, P < .05 for the 10 mug and 30 mug groups; P = .051 for the 100 mug group).
      Dose-related worsening of glycemic control was noted in 14.5% of patients who
      received relamorelin; some required insulin or other diabetes drug dosage
      adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2B randomized trial of patients with
      moderate to severe DG, relamorelin significantly reduced core symptoms of DG and 
      overall composite score compared with placebo, accelerated GE, and was generally 
      safe and well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02357420.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using quantitative fecal
      immunochemical tests (FITs) is rapidly gaining ground worldwide. FITs are
      invariably used in a dichotomous manner using pre-specified cut-off values. To
      optimize FIT-based screening programs, we investigated the association between
      fecal hemoglobin (fHb) concentrations below the FIT cut-off value and later
      development of colorectal advanced neoplasia (AN). METHODS: We analyzed data
      collected from a population-based study of 9561 average-risk subjects (50-74
      years old) in the Netherlands who were offered 4 rounds of FIT screening for CRC 
      from November 2006 through December 2014. We analyzed data from 7663 participants
      screened at least once and found to have a negative FIT result at baseline (below
      the cut-off value of 10 mug Hb/ g feces). Participants were followed for a median
      of 4.7 years (interquartile range, 2.0-6.1 years); CRCs diagnosed outside the
      screening program were identified from the Dutch Comprehensive Cancer Centre
      database. Hazard ratios for AN were determined using Cox proportional hazard
      regression analyses. Logistic regression techniques were used to calculate risks 
      of AN after consecutive fHb concentrations below the cut-off value. RESULTS:
      After 8 years of follow-up, participants with baseline concentrations of 8-10 mug
      fHb/g had a higher cumulative incidence of AN (33%) than participants with 0 mug 
      fHb/g (5%) (P < .001). Multi-variate hazard ratios increased from 1.2 for
      subjects with concentrations of 0-2 mug fHb/g to 8.2 for subjects with
      concentrations of 8-10 mug fHb/g (P < .001). Participants with 2 consecutive fHb 
      concentrations of 8 mug Hb/g had a 14-fold increase in risk of AN compared with
      participants with 2 consecutive fHb concentrations of 0 mug Hb/g (P < .001).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study of average-risk individuals with a FIT
      result below the cut-off value, we associated baseline concentrations of 8-10 mug
      fHb/g with an increased risk of AN compared with baseline concentrations of 0 mug
      fHb/g. Baseline and consecutive fHb concentrations are independent predictors for
      incident AN. This information might be used in designing personalized strategies 
      for population-based CRC screening and reduce unnecessary repeat tests.

      Efficacy in Mice With Colitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists reduce many
      clinical features of inflammatory bowel disease, complete mucosal healing occurs 
      in fewer than 50% of patients. The Fc-region of monoclonal antibodies against TNF
      has immunosuppressive properties via effects on macrophage polarization. We
      examined the interaction between the anti-TNF Fc-region and Fcgamma receptors
      (FcgammaR), and whether the absence of the Fc core fucose (which increases
      binding to FcgammaRIIIa) increases the efficacy of anti-TNF in mice with colitis.
      METHODS: We generated Rag1(-/-) mice that lack all activating FcgammaRs
      (FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIII, and FcgammaRIV; called FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice). We 
      produced hypo-fucosylated antibodies against mouse and human TNF (adalimumab).
      Colitis was induced in mice by transfer of CD4+CD45RB(hi) to
      FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) or Rag1(-/-) littermates; mice were given different
      antibodies against TNF or isotype (control) antibodies and disease activity index
      scores were determined. Colon tissues were collected and analyzed by histology.
      Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood of
      healthy donors. T-cell proliferation and proportions of CD206(+) (immune
      regulatory) macrophages were measured in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Human PBMCs 
      were genotyped for FCGR3A158 (the FcgammaRIIIa-158F allotype displays a lower Fc 
      binding affinity) using the TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotype assay.
      RESULTS: Rag1(-/-) mice with colitis given anti-TNF had near complete mucosal
      healing and Rag1(-/-) mice given an isotype control antibody developed severe
      colitis. In contrast, FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice were refractory to the effects 
      of anti-TNF: their histological colitis scores were as severe as those from
      FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice given a control antibody. Colons from Rag1(-/-) mice 
      that received anti-TNF had an increased number of CD206(+) macrophages compared
      with Rag1(-/-) mice given control antibody; in FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice given 
      anti-TNF these numbers were as low as FcgammaR(-/-)Rag1(-/-) given the control
      antibody. In human PBMCs, anti-TNF increased the number of CD206(+) macrophages: 
      this required expression of FcgammaRIIIa; numbers of these cells were reduced in 
      PBMCs with the low-affinity FcgammaRIIIa-158F genotype. A hypo-fucosylated form
      of adalimumab bound human FcgammaRIIIa with a higher affinity than control
      adalimumab. When hypo-fucosylated adalimumab was added to PBMCs, a larger number 
      of CD206(+) macrophages formed and T-cell proliferation was reduced, compared
      with addition of a control adalimumab. Hypo-fucosylated adalimumab increased the 
      number of CD206(+) macrophages in PMBCs that expressed the low-affinity
      FcgammaRIIIa. In mice with colitis, hypo-fucosylated anti-TNF significantly
      increased the number of CD206(+) macrophages in the colon compared with control
      anti-TNF and was more effective in reducing colitis severity as measured by
      histology. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of
      anti-TNF, we found FcgammaR engagement by anti-TNF to be required for reduction
      of colitis in mice and development of CD206(+) macrophages. A hypo-fucosylated
      form of anti-TNF binds FcgammaRIIIa with higher affinity and induces development 
      of CD206(+) macrophages in human PBMCs, especially PBMCs that express
      low-affinity FcgammaRIIIa. Hypo-fucosylated anti-TNF might be more effective in
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Long-term Risk of Pancreatic Malignancy in Patients With Branch Duct Intraductal 
      Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm in a Referral Center.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the development of branch duct
      intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs). We evaluated long-term
      outcomes of a large cohort of patients with BD-IPMNs to determine risk of
      malignancy and define a subset of low-risk BD-IPMNs. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of data from 577 patients with suspected or presumed
      BD-IPMN under surveillance at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Patients
      underwent cross-sectional imaging analysis at 3 months or later after their
      initial diagnosis. The diagnosis of BD-IPMN was based on the presence of
      unilocular or multilocular cysts of the pancreas and a non-dilated main
      pancreatic duct (<5 mm). We collected demographic, clinical, and pathology data. 
      Cysts were characterized at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up
      period. Follow-up duration was time between initial cyst diagnosis and date of
      last visit or death for patients without development of pancreatic cancer, date
      of surgery for patients with histologically confirmed malignancy, or date of
      first discovery of malignancy by imaging analysis for patients with unresectable 
      tumors or who underwent neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. The primary outcome
      was risk of malignancy, with a focus on patients followed for 5 years or more,
      compared with that of the US population, based on standardized incidence ratio.
      RESULTS: Of the 577 patients studied, 479 (83%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis
      and 363 (63%) underwent endoscopic ultrasound at least once. The median follow-up
      time was 82 months (range, 6-329 months) for the entire study cohort; 363
      patients (63%) underwent surveillance for more than 5 years, and 121 (21%) for
      more than 10 years. Malignancies (high-grade dysplasia or invasive neoplasm)
      developed after 5 years in 20 of 363 patients (5.5%), and invasive cancer
      developed in 16 of 363 patients (4.4%). The standardized incidence ratio for
      patients with BD-IPMNs without worrisome features of malignancy at 5 years was
      18.8 (95% confidence interval, 9.7-32.8; P < .001). One hundred and eight
      patients had cysts </=1.5 cm for more than 5 years of follow-up; only 1 of these 
      patients (0.9%) developed a distinct ductal adenocarcinoma. By contrast, among
      the 255 patients with cysts >1.5 cm, 19 (7.5%) developed malignancy (P = .01).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of patients with BD-IPMNs under
      surveillance, their overall risk of malignancy, almost 8%, lasted for 10 years or
      more, supporting continued surveillance after 5 years. Cysts that remain </=1.5
      cm for more than 5 years might be considered low-risk for progression to
      malignancy.

TI  - Transforming Growth Factor-beta Promotes Liver Tumorigenesis in Mice via
      Up-regulation of Snail.
PG  - 1378-1391.e6

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.07.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) suppresses early
      stages of tumorigenesis, but also contributes to migration and metastasis of
      cancer cells. A large number of human tumors contain mutations that inactivate
      its receptors, or downstream proteins such as Smad transcription factors,
      indicating that the TGF-beta signaling pathway prevents tumor growth. We
      investigated the effects of TGF-beta inhibition on liver tumorigenesis in mice.
      METHODS: C57BL/6 mice received hydrodynamic tail-vein injections of transposons
      encoding HRAS(G12V) and a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to down-regulate p53, or
      those encoding HRAS(G12V) and MYC, or those encoding HRAS(G12V) and TAZ(S89A), to
      induce liver tumor formation; mice were also given injections of transposons
      encoding SMAD7 or shRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, or SNAI1 (Snail), with or
      without ectopic expression of Snail. Survival times were compared, and livers
      were weighted and examined for tumors. Liver tumor tissues were analyzed by
      quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, RNA sequencing, immunoblots, and
      immunohistochemistry. We analyzed gene expression levels in human hepatocellular 
      carcinoma samples deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas. A cell proliferation
      assay was performed using human liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) stably
      expressing Snail or shRNA against Snail. RESULTS: TGF-beta inhibition via
      overexpression of SMAD7 (or knockdown of SMAD2, SMAD3, or SMAD4) consistently
      reduced formation and growth of liver tumors in mice that expressed activated RAS
      plus shRNA against p53, or in mice that expressed activated RAS and TAZ. TGF-beta
      signaling activated transcription of the Snail gene in liver tumors induced by
      HRAS(G12V) and shRNA against p53, and by activated RAS and TAZ. Knockdown of
      Snail reduced liver tumor formation in both tumor models. Ectopic expression of
      Snail restored liver tumorigenesis suppressed by disruption of TGF-beta
      signaling. In human hepatocellular carcinoma, Snail expression correlated with
      TGF-beta activation. Ectopic expression of Snail increased cellular
      proliferation, whereas Snail knockdown led to reduced proliferation in human
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of transgenic mice, we
      found TGF-beta signaling to be required for formation of liver tumors upon
      expression of activated RAS and shRNA down-regulating p53, and upon expression of
      activated RAS and TAZ. Snail is the TGF-beta target that is required for hepatic 
      tumorigenesis in these models.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the causes of heartburn in patients with
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Visible epithelial damage is seldom associated 
      with symptom severity, evidenced by the significant symptom burden in patients
      with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) compared with patients with erosive reflux 
      disease (ERD) or Barrett's esophagus (BE). We studied the distribution of mucosal
      nerve fibers in patients with NERD, ERD, and BE, and compared the results with
      those of healthy subjects. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 13
      patients with NERD, 11 patients with ERD, and 16 patients with BE undergoing
      endoscopic evaluation in the United Kingdom or Greece. Biopsies were obtained
      from the proximal and distal esophageal mucosa of patients with NERD, from the
      distal esophageal mucosa of patients with ERD, and the distal-most squamous
      epithelium of patients with BE. These were examined for the presence and location
      of nerve fibers that reacted with a labeled antibody against calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP), a marker of nociceptive sensory nerves. The results 
      were compared with those from 10 healthy volunteers (controls). RESULTS: The
      distribution of CGRP-positive nerves did not differ significantly between the
      distal esophageal mucosa of controls (median, 25.5 cell layers to surface;
      interquartile range [IQR], 21.4-28.8) vs patients with ERD (median, 23 cell
      layers to surface; IQR, 16-27.5), or patients with BE (median, 21.5 cell layers
      to surface; IQR, 16.1-27.5). However, CGRP-positive nerves were significantly
      more superficial in mucosa from patients with NERD-both distal (median, 9.5 cell 
      layers to surface; IQR, 1.5-13.3; P < .0001 vs ERD, BE, and controls) and
      proximal (median, 5.0 cell layers to surface; IQR, 2.5-9.3 vs median 10.4 cell
      layers to surface; IQR, 8.0-16.9; P = .0098 vs controls). CONCLUSIONS: Proximal
      and distal esophageal mucosa of patients with NERD have more superficial afferent
      nerves compared with controls or patients with ERD or BE. Acid hypersensitivity
      in patients with NERD might be partially explained by the increased proximity of 
      their afferent nerves to the esophageal lumen, and therefore greater exposure to 
      noxious substances in refluxate.

TI  - Effects of All-Oral Anti-Viral Therapy on HVPG and Systemic Hemodynamics in
      Patients With Hepatitis C Virus-Associated Cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with hepatitis C virus-associated cirrhosis and
      clinical significant portal hypertension (CSPH, hepatic venous pressure gradient 
      [HVPG] 10 mmHg or greater), despite achieving sustained virological response
      (SVR) to therapy, remain at risk of liver decompensation. We investigated
      hemodynamic changes following SVR in patients with CSPH and whether liver
      stiffness measurements (LSMs) can rule out the presence of CSPH. METHODS: We
      performed a multicenter prospective study of 226 patients with hepatitis C
      virus-associated cirrhosis and CSPH who had SVR to interferon-free therapy at 6
      Liver Units in Spain. The portal pressure gradient was determined based on HVPG
      at baseline and 24 weeks after therapy; patients also underwent right-heart
      catheterization and LSM at these time points. Primary outcomes were effects of
      SVR on the hepatic, pulmonary, and systemic hemodynamics; factors related to HVPG
      >/=10% reduction and to CSPH persistence; and whether LSMs can rule out the
      presence of CSPH after SVR. RESULTS: Most patients (75%) had esophageal varices, 
      21% were Child-B, and 29% had at least 1 previous episode of liver
      decompensation. Overall, HVPG decreased from 15 (IQR: 12-18) before treatment to 
      13 (10-16) mmHg after SVR (reduction of 2.1 +/- 3.2 mmHg; P < .01). However, CSPH
      persisted in 78% of patients. HVPG decreased by 10% or more from baseline in 140 
      patients (62%). Baseline level of albumin below 3.5 g/dL was the only negative
      factor associated with an HVPG reduction of 10% or more. LSM decreased from 27
      (20-37) kPa before treatment to 18 (14-28) kPa after SVR (P < .05). One third of 
      patients with a reduction in LSM to below 13.6 kPa after SVR still had CSPH. A
      higher baseline HVPG and a lower decrease in LSM after treatment were associated 
      with persistence of CSPH after SVR. Systemic hemodynamics improved after SVR.
      Interestingly, pulmonary hypertension was present in 13 patients at baseline and 
      25 after SVR, although only 3 patients had increased pulmonary resistance.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter prospective study of patients with hepatitis C
      virus-associated cirrhosis, an SVR to all-oral therapy significantly reduced
      HVPG, compared with before treatment. Nevertheless, CSPH persists in most
      patients despite SVR, indicating persistent risk of decompensation. In this
      population, changes in LSM do not correlate with HVPG and cut-off values are not 
      reliable in ruling out CSPH after SVR.

AB  - Behavioral economic approaches could increase uptake for colorectal cancer
      screening. We performed a randomized controlled trial of 2245 employees to
      determine whether an email containing a phone number for scheduling (control), an
      email with the active choice to opt in or opt out (active choice), or the active 
      choice email plus a $100 incentive (financial incentive) increased colonoscopy
      completion within 3 months. Higher proportions of participants in the financial
      incentive group underwent screening (3.7%) than in the control (1.6%) or active
      choice groups (1.5%) (P = .01 and P < .01). We found no difference in uptake of
      screening between the active choice and control groups (P = .88). The $100
      conditional incentive modestly but significantly increased colonoscopy use.

AB  - Cancer from the gastrointestinal tract and its associated excretory organs will
      occur in more than 300,000 Americans in 2017, with colorectal cancer responsible 
      for >40% of that burden; there will be more than 150,000 deaths from this group
      of cancers in the same time period. Disparities among subgroups related to the
      incidence and mortality of these cancers exist. The epidemiology and risk factors
      associated with each cancer bear out differences for racial groups in the United 
      States. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is more frequent in non-Hispanic whites,
      whereas esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with risk factors of tobacco and
      alcohol is more frequent among blacks. Liver cancer has been most frequent among 
      Asian/Pacific Islanders, chiefly due to hepatitis B vertical transmission, but
      other racial groups show increasing rates due to hepatitis C and emergence of
      cirrhosis from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Gastric cancer incidence
      remains highest among Asian/Pacific Islanders likely due to gene-environment
      interaction. In addition to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, cancers of the
      small bowel, pancreas, and colorectum show the highest rates among blacks, where 
      the explanations for the disparity are not as obvious and are likely
      multifactorial, including socioeconomic and health care access, treatment, and
      prevention (vaccination and screening) differences, dietary and composition of
      the gut microbiome, as well as biologic and genetic influences. Cognizance of
      these disparities in gastrointestinal cancer risk, as well as approaches that
      apply precision medicine methods to populations with the increased risk, may
      reduce the observed disparities for digestive cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies have reported associations between proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) use and dementia. However, data are lacking on long-term PPI use 
      and cognitive function. We therefore examined associations between PPI use and
      performance in tests of cognitive function. Because of shared clinical
      indications, we examined associations for H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) as a
      secondary aim. METHODS: We used prospectively collected data on medication use
      and other potential risk factors from 13,864 participants in the Nurses' Health
      Study II who had completed a self-administered computerized neuropsychological
      test battery. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine
      associations between medication use and composite scores of psychomotor speed and
      attention, learning and working memory, and overall cognition. RESULTS: We
      observed a modest association between duration of PPI use and scores for
      psychomotor speed and attention (mean score difference for PPI use of 9-14 years 
      vs never users, -0.06; 95% confidence interval, -0.11 to 0.00; Ptrend = .03).
      After controlling for H2RA use, the magnitude of this score difference was
      attenuated. Among individuals who did not use PPIs regularly, duration of H2RA
      use was associated with poorer cognitive scores, with the strongest association
      apparent for learning and working memory (mean score difference for H2RA users of
      9-14 years vs never users, -0.20; 95% confidence interval, -0.32 to -0.08; Ptrend
      < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study II, we
      did not observe a convincing association between PPI use and cognitive function. 
      Our data do not support the suggestion that PPI use increases dementia risk.
      Because our primary hypothesis related to PPI use, our findings for H2RAs should 
      be interpreted with caution.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adult liver stem cells are usually maintained in a
      quiescent/slow-cycling state. However, a proliferative population, marked by
      leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), was recently 
      identified as an important liver stem cell population. We aimed to investigate
      the dynamics and functions of proliferative and quiescent stem cells in healthy
      and injured livers. METHODS: We studied LGR5-positive stem cells using diphtheria
      toxin receptor and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice. In these mice, 
      LGR5-positive cells specifically coexpress diphtheria toxin receptor and the GFP 
      reporter. Lineage-tracing experiments were performed in mice in which
      LGR5-positive stem cells and their daughter cells expressed a yellow fluorescent 
      protein/mTmG reporter. Slow-cycling stem cells were investigated using GFP-based,
      Tet-on controlled transgenic mice. We studied the dynamics of both stem cell
      populations during liver homeostasis and injury induced by carbon tetrachloride. 
      Stem cells were isolated from mouse liver and organoid formation assays were
      performed. We analyzed hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineage differentiation in
      cultured organoids. RESULTS: We did not detect LGR5-expressing stem cells in
      livers of mice at any stage of a lifespan, but only following liver injury
      induced by carbon tetrachloride. In the liver stem cell niche, where the
      proliferating LGR5(+) cells are located, we identified a quiescent/slow-cycling
      cell population, called label-retaining cells (LRCs). These cells were present in
      the homeostatic liver, capable of retaining the GFP label over 1 year, and
      expressed a panel of progenitor/stem cell markers. Isolated single LRCs were
      capable of forming organoids that could be carried in culture, expanded for
      months, and differentiated into hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineages in vitro,
      demonstrating their bona fide stem cell properties. More interestingly, LRCs
      responded to liver injury and gave rise to LGR5-expressing stem cells, as well as
      other potential progenitor/stem cell populations, including SOX9- and
      CD44-positive cells. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative LGR5 cells are an intermediate
      stem cell population in the liver that emerge only during tissue injury. In
      contrast, LRCs are quiescent stem cells that are present in homeostatic liver,
      respond to tissue injury, and can give rise to LGR5 stem cells, as well as SOX9- 
      and CD44-positive cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Resistance of metastatic human colorectal cancer cells to
      drugs that block epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling could be caused
      by aberrant activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases, activating overlapping
      signaling pathways. One of these receptor tyrosine kinases could be MET, the
      receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We investigated how MET signaling,
      and its interaction with CD44 (a putative MET coreceptor regulated by Wnt
      signaling and highly expressed by intestinal stem cells [ISCs] and adenomas)
      affects intestinal homeostasis, regeneration, and adenoma formation in mini-gut
      organoids and mice. METHODS: We established organoid cultures from ISCs
      stimulated with HGF or EGF and assessed intestinal differentiation by
      immunohistochemistry. Mice with total epithelial disruption of MET
      (Ah(Cre)/Met(fl/fl)/LacZ) or ISC-specific disruption of MET
      (Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(fl/fl)/LacZ) and control mice (Ah(Cre)/Met(+/+)/LacZ,
      Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(+/+)/LacZ) were exposed to 10 Gy total body irradiation;
      intestinal tissues were collected, and homeostasis and regeneration were assessed
      by immunohistochemistry. We investigated adenoma organoid expansion stimulated by
      HGF or EGF using adenomas derived from Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(fl/fl)/Apc(fl/fl) and
      Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(+/+)/Apc(fl/fl) mice. The same mice were evaluated for adenoma 
      prevalence and size. We also quantified adenomas in Ah(Cre)/Met(fl/fl)/Apc(fl/+) 
      mice compared with Ah(Cre)/Met(+/+)/Apc(fl/+) control mice. We studied expansion 
      of organoids generated from crypts and adenomas, stimulated by HGF or EGF, that
      were derived from mice expressing different CD44 splice variants (Cd44(+/+),
      Cd44(-/-), Cd44(s/s), or Cd44(v4-10/v4-10) mice). RESULTS: Crypts incubated with 
      EGF or HGF expanded into self-organizing mini-guts with similar levels of
      efficacy and contained all differentiated cell lineages. MET-deficient mice did
      not have defects in intestinal homeostasis. Total body irradiation reduced
      numbers of proliferating crypts in Ah(Cre)/Met(fl/fl)/LacZ mice.
      Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(fl/fl)/LacZ mice had impaired regeneration of MET-deficient
      ISCs. Adenoma organoids stimulated with EGF or HGF expanded to almost twice the
      size of nonstimulated organoids. MET-deficient adenoma organoids did not respond 
      to HGF stimulation, but did respond to EGF. ISC-specific disruption of Met
      (Lgr5(Creert2)/Met(fl/fl)/Apc(fl/fl) mice) caused a twofold increase in apoptosis
      in microadenomas, resulting in an approximately 50% reduction of microadenoma
      numbers and significantly reduced average adenoma size. Total epithelial
      disruption of Met (Ah(Cre)/Met(fl/fl)/Apc(fl/+) mice) resulted in an approximate 
      50% reduction in (micro)adenoma numbers. Intestinal crypts from Cd44(-/-) mice
      did not expand to the same extent as crypts from Cd44(+/+) mice on stimulation
      with HGF, but had the same response to EGF. The negative effect on HGF-mediated
      growth was overcome by expression of CD44v4-10, but not by CD44s. Similarly,
      HGF-mediated expansion of adenoma organoids required CD44v4-10. CONCLUSIONS: In
      studies of intestinal organoid cultures and mice with inducible deletion of MET, 
      we found HGF receptor signaling to regulate intestinal homeostasis and
      regeneration, as well as adenoma formation. These activities of MET are promoted 
      by the stem cell CD44 isoform CD44v4-10. Our findings provide rationale for
      targeting signaling via MET and CD44 during anti-EGF receptor therapy of patients
      with colorectal cancer or in patients resistant to EGF receptor inhibitors.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Approximately 10% of children on the liver transplant
      wait-list in the United States die every year. We examined deceased donor liver
      offer acceptance patterns and their contribution to pediatric wait-list
      mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of children on the 
      US liver transplant wait-list from 2007 through 2014 using national transplant
      registry databases. We determined the frequency, patterns of acceptance, and
      donor and recipient characteristics associated with deceased donor liver organ
      offers for children who died or were delisted compared with those who underwent
      transplantation. Children who died or were delisted were classified by the number
      of donor liver offers (0 vs 1 or more), limiting analyses to offers of livers
      that were ultimately transplanted into pediatric recipients. The primary outcome 
      was death or delisting on the wait-list. RESULTS: Among 3852 pediatric liver
      transplant candidates, children who died or were delisted received a median 1
      pediatric liver offer (inter-quartile range, 0-2) and waited a median 33 days
      before removal from the wait-list. Of 11,328 donor livers offered to children,
      2533 (12%) were transplanted into children; 1179 of these (47%) were immediately 
      accepted and 1354 (53%) were initially refused and eventually accepted for
      another child. Of 27,831 adults, 1667 (6.0%; median, 55 years) received livers
      from donors younger than 18 years (median, 15 years), most (97%) allocated
      locally or regionally. Of children who died or were delisted, 173 (55%) received 
      an offer of 1 or more liver that was subsequently transplanted into another
      pediatric recipient, and 143 (45%) died or were delisted with no offers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric liver transplant candidates in the US, children who 
      died or were delisted received a median 1 pediatric liver offer and waited a
      median of 33 days. Of livers transplanted into children, 47% were immediately
      accepted and 53% were initially refused and eventually accepted for another
      child. Of children who died or were delisted, 55% received an offer of 1 or more 
      liver that was subsequently transplanted into another pediatric recipient, and
      45% died or were delisted with no offers. Pediatric prioritization in the
      allocation and development of improved risk stratification systems is required to
      reduce wait-list mortality among children.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Duodenoscopes have been implicated in the transmission of
      multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). We compared the frequency of duodenoscope
      contamination with MDRO or any other bacteria after disinfection or sterilization
      by 3 different methods. METHODS: We performed a single-center prospective
      randomized study in which duodenoscopes were randomly reprocessed by standard
      high-level disinfection (sHLD), double high-level disinfection (dHLD), or
      standard high-level disinfection followed by ethylene oxide gas sterilization
      (HLD/ETO). Samples were collected from the elevator mechanism and working channel
      of each duodenoscope and cultured before use. The primary outcome was the
      proportion of duodenoscopes with an elevator mechanism or working channel culture
      showing 1 or more MDRO; secondary outcomes included the frequency of duodenoscope
      contamination with more than 0 and 10 or more colony-forming units (CFU) of
      aerobic bacterial growth on either sampling location. RESULTS: After 3 months of 
      enrollment, the study was closed because of the futility; we did not observe
      sufficient events to evaluate the primary outcome. Among 541 duodenoscope culture
      events, 516 were included in the final analysis. No duodenoscope culture in any
      group was positive for MDRO. Bacterial growth of more than 0 CFU was noted in
      16.1% duodenoscopes in the sHLD group, 16.0% in the dHLD group, and 22.5% in the 
      HLD/ETO group (P = .21). Bacterial growth or 10 or more CFU was noted in 2.3% of 
      duodenoscopes in the sHLD group, 4.1% in the dHLD group, and 4.2% in the HLD/ETO 
      group (P = .36). MRDOs were cultured from 3.2% of pre-procedure rectal swabs and 
      2.5% of duodenal aspirates. CONCLUSIONS: In a comparison of duodenoscopes
      reprocessed by sHLD, dHLD, or HLD/ETO, we found no significant differences
      between groups for MDRO or bacteria contamination. Enhanced disinfection methods 
      (dHLD or HLD/ETO) did not provide additional protection against contamination.
      However, insufficient events occurred to assess our primary study end-point.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: When the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter is
      used to express cellular toxins that eliminate glia in mice, intestinal
      epithelial permeability and proliferation increase; this led to the concept that 
      glia are required for maintenance of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Many
      enteric glia, however, particularly in the mucosa, do not express GFAP. In
      contrast, virtually all enteric glia express proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1). We
      investigated whether elimination of PLP1-expressing cells compromises epithelial 
      maintenance or gastrointestinal motility. METHODS: We generated mice that express
      tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under control of the Plp1 promoter and carry 
      the diptheria toxin subunit A (DTA) transgene in the Rosa26 locus
      (Plp1(CreER);Rosa26(DTA) mice). In these mice, PLP1-expressing glia are
      selectively eliminated without affecting neighboring cells. We measured
      epithelial barrier function and gastrointestinal motility in these mice and
      littermate controls, and analyzed epithelial cell proliferation and
      ultrastructure from their intestinal tissues. To compare our findings with those 
      from previous studies, we also eliminated glia with ganciclovir in Gfap(HSV-TK)
      mice. RESULTS: Expression of DTA in PLP1-expressing cells selectively eliminated 
      enteric glia from the small and large intestines, but caused no defects in
      epithelial proliferation, barrier integrity, or ultrastructure. In contrast,
      administration of ganciclovir to Gfap(HSV-TK) mice eliminated fewer glia but
      caused considerable non-glial toxicity and epithelial cell death. Elimination of 
      PLP1-expressing cells did not reduce survival of neurons in the intestine, but
      altered gastrointestinal motility in female, but not male, mice. CONCLUSIONS:
      Using the Plp1 promoter to selectively eliminate glia in mice, we found that
      enteric glia are not required for maintenance of the intestinal epithelium, but
      are required for regulation of intestinal motility in females. Previous
      observations supporting the concept that maintenance of the intestinal epithelium
      requires enteric glia can be attributed to non-glial toxicity in Gfap(HSV-TK)
      mice and epithelial-cell expression of GFAP. Contrary to widespread notions,
      enteric glia are therefore not required for epithelial homeostasis. However, they
      regulate intestinal motility in a sex-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with intestinal
      dysbiosis and symptoms of IBS develop following gastroenteritis. We aimed to
      study the passage of live bacteria through the colonic epithelium, and determine 
      the role of mast cells (MCs) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in
      barrier regulation in IBS and healthy individuals. METHODS: Colon biopsies from
      32 women with IBS and 15 age-matched healthy women (controls) were mounted in
      Ussing chambers; we measured numbers of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli HS
      and Salmonella typhimurium that passed through from the mucosal side to the
      serosal side of the tissue. Some biopsies were exposed to agents that block the
      VIP receptors (VPAC1 and VPAC2) or MCs. Levels of VIP and tryptase were measured 
      in plasma and biopsy lysates. Number of MCs and MCs that express VIP or VIP
      receptors were quantified by immunofluorescence. Biopsies from an additional 5
      patients with IBS and 4 controls were mounted in chambers and Salmonella were
      added; we studied passage routes through the epithelium by transmission electron 
      microscopy and expression of tight junctions by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In 
      colon biopsies from patients with IBS, larger numbers of E coli HS and S
      typhimurium passed through the epithelium than in biopsies from controls (P <
      .0005). In transmission electron microscopy analyses, bacteria were found to
      cross the epithelium via only the transcellular route. Bacterial passage was
      reduced in biopsies from patients with IBS and controls after addition of
      antibodies against VPACs or ketotifen, which inhibits MCs. Plasma samples from
      patients with IBS had higher levels of VIP than plasma samples from controls.
      Biopsies from patients with IBS had higher levels of tryptase, larger numbers of 
      MCs, and a higher percentage of MCs that express VPAC1 than biopsies from
      controls. In biopsies from patients with IBS, addition of Salmonella
      significantly reduced levels of occludin; subsequent addition of ketotifen
      significantly reversed this effect. CONCLUSIONS: We found that colonic epithelium
      tissues from patients with IBS have increased translocation of commensal and
      pathogenic live bacteria compared with controls. The mechanisms of increased
      translocation include MCs and VIP.

TI  - Influence of Metabolic Risk Factors on Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and
      Liver-Related Death in Men With Chronic Hepatitis B: A Large Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the absolute risk of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) and liver-disease related death, in association with metabolic
      risk factors, for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. METHODS: We
      collected data from 5373 male Taiwanese civil servants who visited Taiwan's
      Government Employees' Central Clinics and received routine free physical
      examinations from 1989 through 1992. We obtained information on liver-related
      morbidity and mortality in HBV carriers, 40-65 years of age (n=1690), with
      different metabolic risk factors. We compared their medical histories with those 
      of study participants without HBV or HCV infection in the same age range
      (n=1289). We used patients' baseline data on obesity, diabetes,
      hypertriglyceridemia, and high blood pressure to assign them to metabolic risk
      categories. We then performed a case-cohort analysis of the effects of hepatitis 
      B viral factors on risk for HCC, based on metabolic factors and insulin
      resistance. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 19 years, 158 of the 1690 
      HBV carriers developed HCC and 126 died from liver-related diseases. Among
      participants without HBV or HCV infection, only 6 developed HCC or died from
      liver-related disease. HBV carriers with different metabolic risk factors had
      significant differences in cumulative incidence of HCC and liver-related death.
      Patients with 3 or more metabolic risk factors had a substantially higher risk
      for HCC (10-year cumulative incidence, 13.60%) than patients with a low metabolic
      risk profile (10-year cumulative incidence, 4.83%; adjusted-hazard ratio, 2.32;
      95% CI, 1.18-4.54). Smoking had a significant effect on this association
      (Pinteraction = .0044). Having 3 or more metabolic risk factors, compared with no
      factors, significantly increased the risk of HCC (adjusted-hazard ratio, 5.06;
      95% CI, 2.23-11.47) and 10-year cumulative incidence of HCC (25.0% in smokers
      with 3 or more metabolic risk factors vs 3.87% in smokers with none; P < .0001)
      in smokers, but did not increase risk of HCC in nonsmokers. Metabolic risk
      factors and insulin resistance had the largest effect on HCC risk in patients
      with levels of HBV-DNA <10,000 copies/mL. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of men with
      chronic HBV infection ages 40-65 years in Taiwan, we associated a high burden of 
      metabolic risk factors with increased risk of HCC; smoking has a significant
      effect on this association.

TI  - Avoidance of Cow's Milk-Based Formula for At-Risk Infants Does Not Reduce
      Development of Celiac Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 961-970.e3
LID - S0016-5085(17)35862-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Feeding during the first months of life might affect risk for 
      celiac disease. Individuals with celiac disease or type 1 diabetes have been
      reported to have high titers of antibodies against cow's milk proteins. Avoidance
      of cow's milk-based formula for infants with genetic susceptibility for type 1
      diabetes reduced the cumulative incidence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies. 
      We performed a randomized controlled trial in the same population to study
      whether weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed formula reduced the risk of celiac
      disease autoimmunity or celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a double-blind
      controlled trial of 230 infants with HLA-defined predisposition to type 1
      diabetes and at least 1 family member with type 1 diabetes. The infants were
      randomly assigned to groups fed a casein hydrolysate formula (n = 113) or a
      conventional formula (control, n = 117) whenever breast milk was not available
      during the first 6-8 months of life. Serum samples were collected over a median
      time period of 10 years and analyzed for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase
      (anti-TG2A) using a radiobinding assay, to endomysium using an immunofluorescence
      assay, and antibodies to a deamidated gliadine peptide using an immunofluorometry
      assay. Duodenal biopsies were collected if levels of anti-TG2A exceeded 20
      relative units. Cow's milk antibodies were measured during the first 2 years of
      life. RESULTS: Of the 189 participants analyzed for anti-TG2A, 25 (13.2%) tested 
      positive. Of the 230 study participants observed, 10 (4.3%) were diagnosed with
      celiac disease. We did not find any significant differences at the cumulative
      incidence of anti-TG2A positivity (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval,
      0.51-2.54) or celiac disease (hazard ratio, 4.13; 95% confidence interval,
      0.81-21.02) between the casein hydrolysate and cow's milk groups. Children who
      developed celiac disease had increased titers of cow's milk antibodies before the
      appearance of anti-TG2A or celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized
      controlled trial of 230 infants with genetic risk factors for celiac disease, we 
      did not find evidence that weaning to a diet of extensively hydrolyzed formula
      compared with cow's milk-based formula would decrease the risk for celiac disease
      later in life. Increased titers of cow's milk antibody before anti-TG2A and
      celiac disease indicates that subjects with celiac disease might have increased
      intestinal permeability in early life. ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT00570102.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ligand binding to inhibitory receptors on immune cells, such
      as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4
      (CTLA4), down-regulates the T-cell-mediated immune response (called immune
      checkpoints). Antibodies that block these receptors increase antitumor immunity
      in patients with melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal cell cancer.
      Tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) have been found to be functionally compromised. We analyzed HCC
      samples from patients to determine if these inhibitory pathways prevent T-cell
      responses in HCCs and to find ways to restore their antitumor functions. METHODS:
      We collected HCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgical resection from
      November 2013 through May 2017, along with tumor-free liver tissues (control
      tissues) and peripheral blood samples. We isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TIL) and intra-hepatic lymphocytes. We used flow cytometry to quantify
      expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 
      2 (TIM3), lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), and CTLA4 on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells 
      from tumor, control tissue, and blood; we studied the effects of antibodies that 
      block these pathways in T-cell activation assays. RESULTS: Expression of PD-1,
      TIM3, LAG3, and CTLA4 was significantly higher on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells
      isolated from HCC tissue than control tissue or blood. Dendritic cells,
      monocytes, and B cells in HCC tumors expressed ligands for these receptors.
      Expression of PD-1, TIM3, and LAG3 was higher on tumor-associated antigen
      (TAA)-specific CD8(+) TIL, compared with other CD8(+) TIL. Compared with TIL that
      did not express these inhibitory receptors, CD8(+) and CD4(+) TIL that did
      express these receptors had higher levels of markers of activation, but similar
      or decreased levels of granzyme B and effector cytokines. Antibodies against
      CD274 (PD-ligand1 [PD-L1]), TIM3, or LAG3 increased proliferation of CD8(+) and
      CD4(+) TIL and cytokine production in response to stimulation with polyclonal
      antigens or TAA. Importantly, combining antibody against PD-L1 with antibodies
      against TIM3, LAG3, or CTLA4 further increased TIL functions. CONCLUSIONS: The
      immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules PD-1, TIM3, and LAG3 are up-regulated on
      TAA-specific T cells isolated from human HCC tissues, compared with T cells from 
      tumor-free liver tissues or blood. Antibodies against PD-L1, TIM3, or LAG3
      restore responses of HCC-derived T cells to tumor antigens, and combinations of
      the antibodies have additive effects. Strategies to block PD-L1, TIM3, and LAG3
      might be developed for treatment of primary liver cancer.

TI  - Treatment of Intestinal Fibrosis in Experimental Inflammatory Bowel Disease by
      the Pleiotropic Actions of a Local Rho Kinase Inhibitor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis resulting in (sub)obstruction is a common
      complication of Crohn's disease (CD). Rho kinases (ROCKs) play multiple roles in 
      TGFbeta-induced myofibroblast activation that could be therapeutic targets.
      Because systemic ROCK inhibition causes cardiovascular side effects, we evaluated
      the effects of a locally acting ROCK inhibitor (AMA0825) on intestinal fibrosis. 
      METHODS: Fibrosis was assessed in mouse models using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
      and adoptive T-cell transfer. The in vitro and ex vivo effects of AMA0825 were
      studied in different cell types and in CD biopsy cultures. RESULTS: ROCK is
      expressed in fibroblastic, epithelial, endothelial, and muscle cells of the human
      intestinal tract and is activated in inflamed and fibrotic tissue. Prophylactic
      treatment with AMA0825 inhibited myofibroblast accumulation, expression of
      pro-fibrotic factors, and accumulation of fibrotic tissue without affecting
      clinical disease activity and histologic inflammation in 2 models of fibrosis.
      ROCK inhibition reversed established fibrosis in a chronic DSS model and impeded 
      ex vivo pro-fibrotic protein secretion from stenotic CD biopsies. AMA0825 reduced
      TGFbeta1-induced activation of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) and 
      p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), down-regulating matrix
      metalloproteinases, collagen, and IL6 secretion from fibroblasts. In these cells,
      ROCK inhibition potentiated autophagy, which was required for the observed
      reduction in collagen and IL6 production. AMA0825 did not affect pro-inflammatory
      cytokine secretion from other ROCK-positive cell types, corroborating the
      selective in vivo effect on fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Local ROCK inhibition prevents
      and reverses intestinal fibrosis by diminishing MRTF and p38 MAPK activation and 
      increasing autophagy in fibroblasts. Overall, our results show that local ROCK
      inhibition is promising for counteracting fibrosis as an add-on therapy for CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) after sustained
      virological response (SVR) with direct-acting antivirals (DAA) is unclear. Our
      aim was to examine the risk and determinants of HCC in patients cured with DAA.
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hepatitis C virus patients 
      who were treated with DAA in any of the 129 Veterans Health Administration
      hospitals between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. We calculated the annual
      incidence rates of HCC by SVR. We used Cox regression models to compare the risk 
      of HCC in patients with vs those without SVR and to identify factors associated
      with incident HCC among patients with SVR. We reviewed a sample of HCC patients
      for tumor size and stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 22,500 patients treated
      with DAA (19,518 with SVR; 2982 without SVR), the mean (standard deviation) age
      was 61.6 (6.1) years, and 39.0% had cirrhosis. There were 271 new cases of HCC,
      including 183 in patients with SVR. Compared with patients without SVR, those
      with SVR had a significantly reduced risk of HCC (0.90 vs 3.45 HCC/100
      person-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.28, 95% CI=0.22-0.36). Patients with
      cirrhosis had the highest annual incidence of HCC after SVR (1.82 vs 0.34/100
      person-years in patients without cirrhosis; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.73. 95% CI, 
      3.34-6.68). Most (>44.8%) HCC were classified as stage I. Maximum size of the
      largest lesion was </=5 cm in over 75% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients
      treated with DAA, SVR was associated with a considerable reduction in the risk of
      HCC. We did not find any evidence to suggest that DAAs promote HCC. However, in
      patients with SVR, the absolute risk of HCC remained high in patients with
      established cirrhosis. These patients should be considered for ongoing HCC
      surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sjogren's syndrome and autoimmune pancreatitis are disorders
      with decreased function of salivary, lacrimal glands, and the exocrine pancreas. 
      Nonobese diabetic/ShiLTJ mice and mice transduced with the cytokine BMP6 develop 
      Sjogren's syndrome and chronic pancreatitis and MRL/Mp mice are models of
      autoimmune pancreatitis. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) is a ductal Cl(-) channel essential for ductal fluid and HCO3(-)
      secretion. We used these models to ask the following questions: is CFTR
      expression altered in these diseases, does correction of CFTR correct gland
      function, and most notably, does correcting ductal function correct acinar
      function? METHODS: We treated the mice models with the CFTR corrector C18 and the
      potentiator VX770. Glandular, ductal, and acinar cells damage, infiltration,
      immune cells and function were measured in vivo and in isolated duct/acini.
      RESULTS: In the disease models, CFTR expression is markedly reduced. The salivary
      glands and pancreas are inflamed with increased fibrosis and tissue damage.
      Treatment with VX770 and, in particular, C18 restored salivation, rescued CFTR
      expression and localization, and nearly eliminated the inflammation and tissue
      damage. Transgenic overexpression of CFTR exclusively in the duct had similar
      effects. Most notably, the markedly reduced acinar cell Ca(2+) signaling, Orai1, 
      inositol triphosphate receptors, Aquaporin 5 expression, and fluid secretion were
      restored by rescuing ductal CFTR. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that
      correcting ductal function is sufficient to rescue acinar cell function and
      suggests that CFTR correctors are strong candidates for the treatment of
      Sjogren's syndrome and pancreatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Low activity of natural killer (NK) cells has been associated 
      with increased risk of cancer and has been reported in patients with colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Activity of NK cells can be measured in a small volume of whole
      blood by a commercially available test. We investigated whether this test could
      be used to identify patients with CRC, using findings from colonoscopy as a
      reference standard. METHODS: We performed an open-label, prospective,
      cross-sectional study of 872 high-risk subjects (more than 40 years old) screened
      for CRC by colonoscopy at a university hospital in Montreal, Canada from October 
      2014 through January 2016. Blood samples were collected on the day of
      colonoscopy, prior to the procedure. The test involves stimulation of whole blood
      with cytokine that induces NK cells to secrete interferon gamma (IFNG), which is 
      quantified by an ELISA. Tissue samples were taken from lesions during the
      colonoscopy and analyzed histologically; subjects were classified as having no
      evidence of disease, adenomatous polyps of less than 10 mm, of 10 mm or more, or 
      CRC. We used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare NK cell activity
      between subjects with no evidence of CRC and subjects found to have CRC. Receiver
      operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the
      test to identify individuals with CRC. The primary objective was to determine the
      difference in NK cell activity between subjects with vs without CRC. The
      secondary objective was the test performance, based on receiver operating
      characteristic analysis, and cut-off value that most accurately identified
      individuals with CRC. RESULTS: We found a significant difference in NK cell
      activity between the 23 subjects with CRC (based on pathology analysis) and the
      849 subjects without CRC: subjects found to have CRC by colonoscopy had a median 
      level of 86.0 pg IFNG/mL (inter-quartile range, 43.3-151.0 pg IFNG/mL), whereas
      subjects without CRC had a median level of 298.1 pg IFNG/mL (inter-quartile
      range, 100.4-920.2 pg IFNG/mL) (P = .0002). The cut-off value that most
      accurately identified subjects with CRC was 181 pg/mL. The NK cell activity test 
      identified subjects with CRC with 87.0% sensitivity, 60.8% specificity, a
      positive predictive value of 5.7%, and a negative predictive value of 99.4%. The 
      odds ratio for detection of CRC in subjects with low NK cell activity vs subjects
      with higher NK cell activity was 10.3 (95% CI, 3.03-34.9). CONCLUSIONS: Using
      colonoscopy as the reference standard, a test for NK cell activity in whole blood
      samples identified patients with CRC with 87.0% sensitivity and a negative
      predictive value of 99.4%. Subjects with low NK cell activity had a 10-fold
      higher risk of CRC compared with subjects with high NK cell activity. This test
      might be used in clinical practice to assess patients for risk of CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Proteomics holds promise for individualizing cancer
      treatment. We analyzed to what extent the proteomic landscape of human colorectal
      cancer (CRC) is maintained in established CRC cell lines and the utility of
      proteomics for predicting therapeutic responses. METHODS: Proteomic and
      transcriptomic analyses were performed on 44 CRC cell lines, compared against
      primary CRCs (n=95) and normal tissues (n=60), and integrated with genomic and
      drug sensitivity data. RESULTS: Cell lines mirrored the proteomic aberrations of 
      primary tumors, in particular for intrinsic programs. Tumor relationships of
      protein expression with DNA copy number aberrations and signatures of
      post-transcriptional regulation were recapitulated in cell lines. The 5 proteomic
      subtypes previously identified in tumors were represented among cell lines.
      Nonetheless, systematic differences between cell line and tumor proteomes were
      apparent, attributable to stroma, extrinsic signaling, and growth conditions.
      Contribution of tumor stroma obscured signatures of DNA mismatch repair
      identified in cell lines with a hypermutation phenotype. Global proteomic data
      showed improved utility for predicting both known drug-target relationships and
      overall drug sensitivity as compared with genomic or transcriptomic measurements.
      Inhibition of targetable proteins associated with drug responses further
      identified corresponding synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations. Our data 
      provide evidence for CRC proteomic subtype-specific drug responses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Proteomes of established CRC cell line are representative of primary tumors.
      Proteomic data tend to exhibit improved prediction of drug sensitivity as
      compared with genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Our integrative proteogenomic 
      analysis highlights the potential of proteome profiling to inform personalized
      cancer medicine.

TI  - A Diet Low in FODMAPs Reduces Symptoms in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
      and A Probiotic Restores Bifidobacterium Species: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates (a low FODMAP
      diet) has been reported to reduce symptoms in some patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study to determine 
      its effects on symptoms and the fecal microbiota in patients with IBS. METHODS:
      We performed a 2x2 factorial trial of 104 patients with IBS (18-65 years old),
      based on the Rome III criteria, at 2 hospitals in the United Kingdom. Patients
      were randomly assigned (blinded) to groups given counselling to follow a sham
      diet or diet low in FODMAPs for 4 weeks, along with a placebo or multistrain
      probiotic formulation, resulting in 4 groups (27 receiving sham diet/placebo, 26 
      receiving sham diet/probiotic, 24 receiving low FODMAP diet /placebo, and 27
      receiving low FODMAP diet/probiotic). The sham diet restricted a similar number
      of staple and non-staple foods as the low FODMAP diet; the diets had similar
      degrees of difficulty to follow. Dietary counselling was given to patients in all
      groups and data on foods eaten and compliance were collected. The incidence and
      severity of 15 gastrointestinal symptoms and overall symptoms were measured daily
      for 7 days before the study period; along with stool frequency and consistency.
      At baseline, global and individual symptoms were measured, along with generic and
      disease-specific health-related quality of life, using standard scoring systems. 
      All data were collected again at 4 weeks, and patients answered questions about
      adequate symptom relief. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and after 4
      weeks and analyzed by quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. The co-primary
      endpoints were adequate relief of symptoms and stool Bifidobacterium species
      abundance at 4 weeks. RESULTS: There was no significant interaction between the
      interventions in adequate relief of symptoms (P = .52) or Bifidobacterium species
      (P = .68). In the intention-to-treat analysis, a higher proportion of patients in
      the low FODMAP diet had adequate symptom relief (57%) than in the sham diet group
      (38%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P = .051). In
      the per-protocol analysis, a significantly higher proportion of patients on the
      low FODMAP diet had adequate symptom relief (61%) than in the sham diet group
      (39%) (P = .042). Total mean IBS-Severity Scoring System score was significantly 
      lower for patients on the low FODMAP diet (173 +/- 95) than the sham diet (224
      +/- 89) (P = .001), but not different between those given probiotic (207 +/- 98) 
      or placebo (192 +/- 93) (P = .721) Abundance of Bifidobacterium species was lower
      in fecal samples from patients on the low FODMAP diet (8.8 rRNA genes/g) than
      patients on the sham diet (9.2 rRNA genes/g) (P = .008), but higher in patients
      given probiotic (9.1 rRNA genes/g) than patients given placebo (8.8 rRNA genes/g)
      (P = .019). There was no effect of the low FODMAP diet on microbiota diversity in
      fecal samples. CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled study of patients with IBS, a
      low FODMAP diet associates with adequate symptom relief and significantly reduced
      symptom scores compared with placebo. It is not clear whether changes resulted
      from collective FODMAP restriction or removal of a single component, such as
      lactose. Co-administration of the multistrain probiotic increased numbers of
      Bifidobacterium species, compared with placebo, and might be given to restore
      these bacteria to patients on a low FODMAP diet. Trial registration no:

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of
      liver enzyme level. We aimed to identify CpG sites at which DNA methylation
      levels are associated with blood levels of liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis.
      METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study in whole blood for
      liver enzyme levels, including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), among a discovery
      set of 731 participants of the Rotterdam Study and sought replication in a
      non-overlapping sample of 719 individuals. Significant DNA methylation changes
      were further analyzed to evaluate their relation with hepatic steatosis.
      Expression levels of the top identified gene were measured in 9 human liver cell 
      lines and compared with expression profiles of its potential targets associated
      with lipid traits. The candidate gene was subsequently knocked down in human
      hepatoma cells using lentiviral vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs. RESULTS:
      Eight probes annotated to SLC7A11, SLC1A5, SLC43A1, PHGDH, PSORS1C1, SREBF1,
      ANKS3 were associated with GGT and 1 probe annotated to SLC7A11 was associated
      with ALT after Bonferroni correction (1.0 x 10(-7)). No probe was identified for 
      AST levels. Four probes for GGT levels including cg06690548 (SLC7A11), cg11376147
      (SLC43A1), cg22304262 (SLC1A5), and cg14476101 (PHGDH), and 1 for ALT cg06690548 
      (SLC7A11) were replicated. DNA methylation at SLC7A11 was associated with reduced
      risk of hepatic steatosis in participants (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI= 0.55-0.93; P
      value: 2.7 x 10(-3)). In functional experiments, SLC7A11 was highly expressed in 
      human liver cells; its expression is positively correlated with expression of a
      panel of lipid-associated genes, indicating a role of SLC7A11 in lipid
      metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insights into epigenetic
      mechanisms associated with markers of liver function and hepatic steatosis,
      laying the groundwork for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The guidelines of the European Society of Pediatric
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition allow for diagnosis of celiac disease
      without biopsies in children with symptoms and levels of immunoglobulin A against
      tissue-transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) 10-fold or more the upper limit of normal
      (ULN), confirmed by detection of endomysium antibodies (EMA) and positivity for
      HLA-DQ2/DQ8. We performed a large, international prospective study to validate
      this approach. METHODS: We collected data from consecutive pediatric patients (18
      years or younger) on a gluten-containing diet who tested positive for TGA-IgA
      from November 2011 through May 2014, seen at 33 pediatric gastroenterology units 
      in 21 countries. Local centers recorded symptoms; measurements of total IgA, TGA,
      and EMA; and histopathology findings from duodenal biopsies. Children were
      considered to have malabsorption if they had chronic diarrhea, weight loss (or
      insufficient gain), growth failure, or anemia. We directly compared central
      findings from 16 antibody tests (8 for TGA-IgA, 1 for TGA-IgG, 6 for IgG against 
      deamidated gliadin peptides, and 1 for EMA, from 5 different manufacturers), 2
      HLA-DQ2/DQ8 tests from 2 manufacturers, and histopathology findings from the
      reference pathologist. Final diagnoses were based on local and central results.
      If all local and central results were concordant for celiac disease, cases were
      classified as proven celiac disease. Patients with only a low level of TGA-IgA
      (threefold or less the ULN) but no other results indicating celiac disease were
      classified as no celiac disease. Central histo-morphometry analyses were
      performed on all other biopsies and cases were carefully reviewed in a blinded
      manner. Inconclusive cases were regarded as not having celiac disease for
      calculation of diagnostic accuracy. The primary aim was to determine whether the 
      nonbiopsy approach identifies children with celiac disease with a positive
      predictive value (PPV) above 99% in clinical practice. Secondary aims included
      comparing performance of different serological tests and to determine whether the
      suggested criteria can be simplified. RESULTS: Of 803 children recruited for the 
      study, 96 were excluded due to incomplete data, low level of IgA, or poor-quality
      biopsies. In the remaining 707 children (65.1% girls; median age, 6.2 years), 645
      were diagnosed with celiac disease, 46 were found not to have celiac disease, and
      16 had inconclusive results. Findings from local laboratories of TGA-IgA 10-fold 
      or more the ULN, a positive result from the test for EMA, and any symptom
      identified children with celiac disease (n = 399) with a PPV of 99.75 (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 98.61-99.99); the PPV was 100.00 (95% CI, 98.68-100.00)
      when only malabsorption symptoms were used instead of any symptom (n = 278).
      Inclusion of HLA analyses did not increase accuracy. Findings from central
      laboratories differed greatly for patients with lower levels of antibodies, but
      when levels of TGA-IgA were 10-fold or more the ULN, PPVs ranged from 99.63 (95% 
      CI, 98.67-99.96) to 100.00 (95% CI, 99.23-100.00). CONCLUSIONS: Children can be
      accurately diagnosed with celiac disease without biopsy analysis. Diagnosis based
      on level of TGA-IgA 10-fold or more the ULN, a positive result from the EMA tests
      in a second blood sample, and the presence of at least 1 symptom could avoid
      risks and costs of endoscopy for more than half the children with celiac disease 
      worldwide. HLA analysis is not required for accurate diagnosis. Clinical Trial

TI  - Intestinal Fungal Dysbiosis Is Associated With Visceral Hypersensitivity in
      Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Rats.
PG  - 1026-1039
LID - S0016-5085(17)35738-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.06.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Visceral hypersensitivity is one feature of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). Bacterial dysbiosis might be involved in the activation of
      nociceptive sensory pathways, but there have been few studies of the role of the 
      mycobiome (the fungal microbiome) in the development of IBS. We analyzed
      intestinal mycobiomes of patients with IBS and a rat model of visceral
      hypersensitivity. METHODS: We used internal transcribed spacer 1-based
      metabarcoding to compare fecal mycobiomes of 18 healthy volunteers with those of 
      39 patients with IBS (with visceral hypersensitivity or normal levels of
      sensitivity). We also compared the mycobiomes of Long-Evans rats separated from
      their mothers (hypersensitive) with non-handled (normally sensitive) rats. We
      investigated whether fungi can cause visceral hypersensitivity using rats exposed
      to fungicide (fluconazole and nystatin). The functional relevance of the gut
      mycobiome was confirmed in fecal transplantation experiments: adult maternally
      separated rats were subjected to water avoidance stress (to induce visceral
      hypersensitivity), then given fungicide and donor cecum content via oral gavage. 
      Other rats subjected to water avoidance stress were given soluble beta-glucans,
      which antagonize C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A or DECTIN1)
      signaling via spleen-associated tyrosine kinase (SYK), a SYK inhibitor to reduce 
      visceral hypersensitivity, or vehicle (control). The sensitivity of mast cells to
      fungi was tested with mesenteric windows (ex vivo) and the human mast cell line
      HMC-1. RESULTS: alpha diversity (Shannon index) and mycobiome signature
      (stability selection) of both groups of IBS patients differed from healthy
      volunteers, and the mycobiome signature of hypersensitive patients differed from 
      that of normally sensitive patients. We observed mycobiome dysbiosis in rats that
      had been separated from their mothers compared with non-handled rats.
      Administration of fungicide to hypersensitive rats reduced their visceral
      hypersensitivity to normal levels of sensitivity. Administration of cecal
      mycobiomes from rats that had been separated from their mothers (but not
      non-handled mycobiome) restored hypersensitivity to distension. Administration of
      soluble beta-glucans or a SYK inhibitor reduced visceral hypersensitivity,
      compared with controls. Particulate beta-glucan (a DECTIN-1 agonist) induced mast
      cell degranulation in mesenteric windows and HMC-1 cells responded to fungal
      antigens by release of histamine. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of patients with
      IBS and controls, we associated fungal dysbiosis with IBS. In studies of rats, we
      found fungi to promote visceral hypersensitivity, which could be reduced by
      administration of fungicides, soluble beta-glucans, or a SYK inhibitor. The
      intestinal fungi might therefore be manipulated for treatment of IBS-related
      visceral hypersensitivity.

TI  - MAN2A1-FER Fusion Gene Is Expressed by Human Liver and Other Tumor Types and Has

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Human tumors and liver cancer cell lines express the product
      of a fusion between the first 13 exons in the mannosidase alpha class 2A member 1
      gene (MAN2A1) and the last 6 exons in the FER tyrosine kinase gene (FER), called 
      MAN2A1-FER. We investigated whether MAN2A1-FER is expressed by human liver tumors
      and its role in liver carcinogenesis. METHODS: We performed reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction analyses of 102 non-small cell lung tumors, 61 ovarian 
      tumors, 70 liver tumors, 156 glioblastoma multiform samples, 27 esophageal
      adenocarcinomas, and 269 prostate cancer samples, as well as 10 nontumor liver
      tissues and 20 nontumor prostate tissues, collected at the University of
      Pittsburgh. We also measured expression by 15 human cancer cell lines. We
      expressed a tagged form of MAN2A1-FER in NIH3T3 and HEP3B (liver cancer) cells;
      Golgi were isolated for analysis. MAN2A1-FER was also overexpressed in PC3 or
      DU145 (prostate cancer), NIH3T3 (fibroblast), H23 (lung cancer), and A-172
      (glioblastoma multiforme) cell lines and knocked out in HUH7 (liver cancer)
      cells. Cells were analyzed for proliferation and in invasion assays, and/or
      injected into flanks of severe combined immunodeficient mice; xenograft tumor
      growth and metastasis were assessed. Mice with hepatic deletion of PTEN were
      given tail-vein injections of MAN2A1-FER. RESULTS: We detected MAN2A1-FER
      messenger RNA and fusion protein (114 kD) in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell
      line HUH7, as well as in liver tumors, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma
      multiforme, prostate tumors, non-small cell lung tumors, and ovarian tumors, but 
      not nontumor prostate or liver tissues. MAN2A1-FER protein retained the signal
      peptide for Golgi localization from MAN2A1 and translocated from the cytoplasm to
      Golgi in cancer cell lines. MAN2A1-FER had tyrosine kinase activity almost 4-fold
      higher than that of wild-type FER, and phosphorylated the epidermal growth factor
      receptor at tyrosine 88 in its N-terminus. Expression of MAN2A1-FER in 4 cell
      lines led to epidermal growth factor receptor activation of BRAF, MEK, and AKT;
      HUH7 cells with MAN2A1-FER knockout had significant decreases in phosphorylation 
      of these proteins. Cell lines that expressed MAN2A1-FER had increased
      proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness and formed larger (>2-fold)
      xenograft tumors in mice, with more metastases, than cells not expressing the
      fusion protein. HUH7 cells with MAN2A1-FER knockout formed smaller xenograft
      tumors, with fewer metastases, than control HUH7 cells. HUH7, A-172, and PC3
      cells that expressed MAN2A1-FER were about 2-fold more sensitive to the FER
      kinase inhibitor crizotinib and the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase
      inhibitor canertinib; these drugs slowed growth of xenograft tumors from
      MAN2A1-FER cells and prevented their metastasis in mice. Hydrodynamic tail-vein
      injection of MAN2A1-FER resulted in rapid development of liver cancer in mice
      with hepatic disruption of Pten. CONCLUSIONS: Many human tumor types and cancer
      cell lines express the MAN2A1-FER fusion, which increases proliferation and
      invasiveness of cancer cell lines and has liver oncogenic activity in mice.

AB  - This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal
      (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been
      retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and Deputy Editor-in-Chief
      following an investigation into the data that were presented in several figures
      within the article. A number of images used in this article are believed to be
      duplicated images. The authors stated that they inadvertently inserted images of 
      the wrong blots in several of the figures, resulting in the duplications;
      however, they did not address all of the concerns raised. Because the editors
      were no longer confident in the conclusions of the article based on these
      incorrect data, a decision was made to retract the paper. All authors have been
      notified of this decision. The University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in Sao Paulo,
      Brazil was contacted regarding these concerns, but to date the journal has
      received no response.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which involves measurement of drug or active
      metabolite levels and anti-drug antibodies, is a promising strategy that can be
      used to optimize inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. It is based on the
      premise that there is a relationship between drug exposure and outcomes, and that
      considerable inter-individual variability exists in how patients metabolize the
      drug (pharmacokinetics) and the magnitude and duration of response to therapy
      (pharmacodynamics). Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association has
      prioritized clinical guidelines on the role of TDM in the management of
      inflammatory bowel disease. To inform these clinical guidelines, this technical
      review was developed in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
      Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework for interventional and
      prognostic studies, and focused on the application of TDM for biologic therapy,
      specifically anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents, and for thiopurines.
      Focused questions address the benefits and risks of a strategy of reactive TDM
      (in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease) to guide treatment changes
      compared with empiric treatment changes, and the benefits and risks of a strategy
      of routine proactive TDM (during routine clinical care in patients with quiescent
      disease) compared with no routine TDM. Additionally, the review addresses the
      benefits and risks of routine measurement of thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme 
      activity or genotype before starting thiopurine therapy compared with empiric
      weight-based dosing and explores the performance of different trough drug
      concentrations for anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and thiopurines to inform
      clinical decision making when applying TDM in a reactive setting. Due to a
      paucity of data, this review does not address the role of TDM for more recently
      approved biologic agents, such as vedolizumab or ustekinumab.

AB  - We have recently gained unprecedented insight into genetic factors that determine
      risk for Barrett's esophagus (BE) and progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma
      (EA). Next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to identify somatic
      mutations that initiate BE and track genetic changes during development of tumors
      and invasive cancer. These technologies led to identification of mechanisms of
      tumorigenesis that challenge the current multistep model of progression to EA.
      Newer, cost-effective technologies create opportunities to rapidly translate the 
      analysis of DNA into tools that can identify patients with BE at high risk for
      cancer, detect dysplastic lesions more reliably, and uncover mechanisms of
      carcinogenesis.

AB  - Phlebotomy constitutes the established treatment for HFE-related hemochromatosis.
      Retrospective studies have suggested proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce the
      need for phlebotomy in this population. We conducted a randomized controlled
      trial to prove this. Thirty p.C282Y homozygous patients were randomly allocated
      to PPI (pantoprazole 40 mg/day) or placebo for 12 months. Phlebotomies were
      performed when serum ferritin was > 100 mug/L. Phlebotomy need turned out to be
      significantly lower in patients taking PPI (P = .0052). PPI treatment
      significantly reduces the need for phlebotomies in p.C282Y homozygous patients.
      In view of the known long-term safety profile of PPI, they can be a valuable
      addition to standard therapy. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01524757.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Agents that induce an immune response against tumors by
      altering T-cell regulation have increased survival times of patients with
      advanced-stage tumors, such as melanoma or lung cancer. We aimed to characterize 
      molecular features of immune cells that infiltrate hepatocellular carcinomas
      (HCCs) to determine whether these types of agents might be effective against
      liver tumors. METHODS: We analyzed HCC samples from 956 patients. We separated
      gene expression profiles from tumor, stromal, and immune cells using a
      non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. We then analyzed the gene expression
      pattern of inflammatory cells in HCC tumor samples. We correlated expression
      patterns with the presence of immune cell infiltrates and immune regulatory
      molecules, determined by pathology and immunohistochemical analyses, in a
      training set of 228 HCC samples. We validated the correlation in a validation set
      of 728 tumor samples. Using data from 190 tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas, we
      correlated immune cell gene expression profiles with numbers of chromosomal
      aberrations (based on single-nucleotide polymorphism array) and mutations (exome 
      sequence data). RESULTS: We found approximately 25% of HCCs to have markers of an
      inflammatory response, with high expression levels of the CD274 molecule
      (programmed death-ligand 1) and programmed cell death 1, markers of cytolytic
      activity, and fewer chromosomal aberrations. We called this group of tumors the
      Immune class. It contained 2 subtypes, characterized by markers of an adaptive
      T-cell response or exhausted immune response. The exhausted immune response
      subclass expressed many genes regulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 that
      mediate immunosuppression. We did not observe any differences in numbers of
      mutations or expression of tumor antigens between the immune-specific class and
      other HCCs. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of HCC samples from 956 patients, we
      found almost 25% to express markers of an inflammatory response. We identified 2 
      subclasses, characterized by adaptive or exhausted immune responses. These
      findings indicate that some HCCs might be susceptible to therapeutic agents
      designed to block the regulatory pathways in T cells, such as programmed
      death-ligand 1, programmed cell death 1, or transforming growth factor beta 1
      inhibitors.

TI  - Agreement Between Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction
      Measurements and Pathologist-Assigned Steatosis Grades of Liver Biopsies From
      Adults With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We assessed the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) proton density fat fraction (PDFF) in grading hepatic steatosis and
      change in hepatic steatosis in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in
      a multi-center study, using central histology as reference. METHODS: We collected
      data from 113 adults with NASH participating in a multi-center, randomized,
      double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial to compare the efficacy
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally of obeticholic acid vs placebo. Hepatic
      steatosis was assessed at baseline and after 72 weeks of obeticholic acid or
      placebo by liver biopsy and MRI (scanners from different manufacturers, at 1.5T
      or 3T). We compared steatosis estimates by PDFF vs histology. Histologic
      steatosis grade was scored in consensus by a pathology committee. Cross-validated
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. RESULTS: At
      baseline, 34% of subjects had steatosis grade 0 or 1, 39% had steatosis grade 2, 
      and 27% had steatosis grade 3; corresponding mean PDFF values were 9.8%+/-3.7%,
      18.1%+/-4.3%, and 30.1%+/-8.1%. PDFF classified steatosis grade 0-1 vs 2-3 with
      an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98), and grade 0-2 vs
      grade 3 steatosis with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). PDFF cut-off values 
      at 90% specificity were 16.3% for grades 2-3 and 21.7% for grade 3, with
      corresponding sensitivities of 83% and 84%. After 72 weeks' of obeticholic vs
      placebo, 42% of subjects had a reduced steatosis grade (mean reduction in PDFF
      from baseline of 7.4%+/-8.7%), 49% had no change in steatosis grade (mean
      increase in PDFF from baseline of 0.3%+/-6.3%), and 9% had an increased steatosis
      grade (mean increase in PDFF from baseline of 7.7%+/-6.0%). PDFF change
      identified subjects with reduced steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI,
      0.71-0.91) and increased steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI,
      0.63-0.99). A PDFF reduction of 5.15% identified subjects with reduced steatosis 
      grade with 90% specificity and 58% sensitivity, whereas a PDFF increase of 5.6%
      identified those with increased steatosis grade with 90% specificity and 57%
      sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data from a phase 2 randomized controlled
      trial of adults with NASH, PDFF estimated by MRI scanners of different field
      strength and at different sites, accurately classifies grades and changes in
      hepatic steatosis when histologic analysis of biopsies is used as a reference.

TI  - Impaired Intestinal Permeability Contributes to Ongoing Bowel Symptoms in
      Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Mucosal Healing.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have
      ongoing bowel symptoms of diarrhea or abdominal pain despite mucosal healing. We 
      investigated whether impaired intestinal permeability contributes to these
      symptoms. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of intestinal permeability,
      measured by endoscopic confocal laser endomicroscopy in 110 consecutive subjects 
      (31 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 57 with Crohn's disease [CD], and 22 healthy
      individuals [controls]) in Sydney, Australia from May 2009 and September 2015.
      Symptomatic CD was defined by a CD Activity Index score of 150 or more and
      symptomatic UC by a partial Mayo score of 2 or more. Mucosal healing was defined 
      as CD Endoscopic Index of Severity of 0 in CD or Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0-1
      for patients with UC. Intestinal permeability was quantified by the Confocal Leak
      Score (CLS; range: 0=no impaired permeability to 100=complete loss of barrier
      function). The primary endpoint was intestinal permeability in patients with
      symptomatic IBD in mucosal healing vs patients with asymptomatic IBD in mucosal
      healing. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of CLS in determining
      symptoms based on receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Ongoing
      bowel symptoms were present in 16.3% of patients with IBD and mucosal healing
      (15.4% of patients with CD, 17.4% with UC). Patients with symptomatic IBD had a
      significantly higher median CLS (19.0) than patients with asymptomatic IBD (7.3; 
      P < .001) or controls (5.9, P < .001). There were no significant differences
      between patients with IBD in remission vs controls (P = .261). Median CLS was
      significantly higher in patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic CD (17.7 vs
      8.1; P = .009) and patients with symptomatic than asymptomatic UC (22.2 vs 6.9; P
      = .021). A CLS of 13.1 or more identified ongoing bowel symptoms in patients with
      IBD and mucosal healing with 95.2% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity; the
      receiver operating characteristic area under curve value was 0.88. Based on this 
      cutoff, 36.2% of patients with IBD in mucosal healing have increased intestinal
      permeability. On regression analysis, every increase in CLS of 1.9 correlated
      with an additional diarrheal motion per day (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      prospective study of intestinal permeability in patients with IBD and mucosal
      healing, we associated impaired intestinal permeability with ongoing bowel
      symptoms; increases in permeability correlated with increased severity of
      diarrhea. Resolution of mucosal permeability beyond mucosal healing might improve
      outcomes of patients with IDB (ANZCTR.org.au: ACTRN12613001248752).

TI  - Prebiotics Reduce Body Fat and Alter Intestinal Microbiota in Children Who Are
      Overweight or With Obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It might be possible to manipulate the intestinal microbiota
      with prebiotics or other agents to prevent or treat obesity. However, little is
      known about the ability of prebiotics to specifically modify gut microbiota in
      children with overweight/obesity or reduce body weight. We performed a randomized
      controlled trial to study the effects of prebiotics on body composition, markers 
      of inflammation, bile acids in fecal samples, and composition of the intestinal
      microbiota in children with overweight or obesity. METHODS: We performed a
      single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2 separate cohorts
      (March 2014 and August 2014) at the University of Calgary in Canada. Participants
      included children, 7-12 years old, with overweight or obesity (>85th percentile
      of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to
      groups given either oligofructose-enriched inulin (OI; 8 g/day; n=22) or
      maltodextrin placebo (isocaloric dose, controls; n=20) once daily for 16 weeks.
      Fat mass and lean mass were measured using dual-energy-x-ray absorptiometry.
      Height, weight, and waist circumference were measured at baseline and every 4
      weeks thereafter. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 16 weeks, and
      analyzed for lipids, cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and insulin. Fecal samples
      were collected at baseline and 16 weeks; bile acids were profiled using
      high-performance liquid chromatography and the composition of the microbiota was 
      analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The
      primary outcome was change in percent body fat from baseline to 16 weeks.
      RESULTS: After 16 weeks, children who consumed OI had significant decreases in
      body weight z-score (decrease of 3.1%), percent body fat (decrease of 2.4%), and 
      percent trunk fat (decrease of 3.8%) compared with children given placebo
      (increase of 0.5%, increase of 0.05%, and decrease of 0.3%, respectively).
      Children who consumed OI also had a significant reduction in level of interleukin
      6 from baseline (decrease of 15%) compared with the placebo group (increase of
      25%). There was a significant decrease in serum triglycerides (decrease of 19%)
      in the OI group. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed a significant
      increase in Bifidobacterium spp. in the OI group compared with controls. 16S rRNA
      sequencing revealed significant increases in species of the genus Bifidobacterium
      and decreases in Bacteroides vulgatus within the group who consumed OI. In fecal 
      samples, levels of primary bile acids increased in the placebo group but not in
      the OI group over the 16-week study period. CONCLUSIONS: In a placebo-controlled,
      randomized trial, we found a prebiotic (OI) to selectively alter the intestinal
      microbiota and significantly reduce body weight z-score, percent body fat,
      percent trunk fat, and serum level of interleukin 6 in children with overweight
      or obesity (Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02125955).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been associated with acute
      kidney injury and recent studies suggest that they may be associated with the
      risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      analysis using the Stockholm creatinine measurements database, which contains
      information on diagnoses, dispensation claims, and laboratory test results for
      all citizens in the Stockholm region from 2007 through 2010. We identified new
      users of PPIs (n = 105,305) and new users of H2 blockers (H2B; n = 9578); data on
      renal outcomes were collected for a median 2.7 years. The primary outcome was
      progression CKD, defined as doubling of creatinine or decrease in estimated
      glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more. Secondary outcomes were end-stage
      renal disease and acute kidney injury. Complete collection of repeated PPI and
      H2B dispensations at pharmacies in Sweden allowed modeling the time-dependent
      risk associated with cumulative PPI exposure. RESULTS: Users of PPIs, compared
      with users of H2Bs, had an increased risk for doubled levels of creatinine (1985 
      events; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51) and decrease in
      estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more (11,045 events; 1.26; 95% CI,
      1.16-1.36). PPI use also associated with development of end-stage renal disease
      (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.76-7.58) and acute kidney injury (HR, 1.30; 95% CI,
      1.00-1.69). There was a graded association between cumulative exposure to PPIs
      and risk of CKD progression. This was not the case for cumulative H2B use.
      CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of PPI therapy and cumulative PPI exposure is associate
      with increased risk of CKD progression in a large, North European healthcare
      system. Although consistent, the association was modest in magnitude, and cannot 
      exclude residual confounding.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Among patients with large colorectal sessile polyps or
      laterally spreading lesions, it is important to identify those at risk for
      submucosal invasive cancer (SMIC). Lesions with overt endoscopic evidence of SMIC
      are referred for surgery, although those without these features might still
      contain SMIC that is not visible on endoscopic inspection (covert SMIC). Lesions 
      with a high covert SMIC risk might be better suited for endoscopic submucosal
      dissection than for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We analyzed a group of
      patients with large colon lesions to identify factors associated with SMIC, and
      examined lesions without overt endoscopic high-risk signs to determine factors
      associated with covert SMIC. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 
      consecutive patients referred for EMR of large sessile or flat colorectal polyps 
      or laterally spreading lesions (>/=20 mm) at academic hospitals in Australia from
      September 2008 through September 2016. We collected data on patient and lesion
      characteristics, outcomes of procedures, and histology findings. We excluded
      serrated lesions from the analysis of covert SMIC due to their distinct phenotype
      and biologic features. RESULTS: We analyzed 2277 lesions (mean size, 36.9 mm)
      from 2106 patients (mean age, 67.7 years; 53.2% male). SMIC was evident in 171
      lesions (7.6%). Factors associated with SMIC included Kudo pit pattern V, a
      depressed component (0-IIc), rectosigmoid location, 0-Is or 0-IIa+Is Paris
      classification, non-granular surface morphology, and increasing size. After
      exclusion of lesions that were obviously SMIC or serrated, factors associated
      with covert SMIC were rectosigmoid location (odds ratio, 1.87; P = .01), combined
      Paris classification, surface morphology (odds ratios, 3.96-22.5), and increasing
      size (odds ratio, 1.16/10 mm; P = .012). CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of
      2106 patients who underwent EMR for large sessile or flat colorectal polyps or
      laterally spreading lesions, we associated rectosigmoid location, combined Paris 
      classification and surface morphology, and increasing size with increased risk
      for covert malignancy. Rectosigmoid 0-Is and 0-IIa+Is non-granular lesions have a
      high risk for malignancy, whereas proximally located 0-Is or 0-IIa granular
      lesions have a low risk. These findings can be used to inform decisions on which 
      patients should undergo endoscopic submucosal dissection, EMR, or surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with Down syndrome have a low risk for many solid 
      tumors, prompting the search for tumor suppressor genes on human chromosome 21
      (HSA21). We aimed to identify and explore potential mechanisms of tumor
      suppressors on HSA21 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We compared
      expression of HSA21 genes in 14 pairs of primary HCC and adjacent noncancer liver
      tissues using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
      CA). HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues were collected from 108
      patients at a hospital in China for real-time polymerase chain reaction and
      immunohistochemical analyses; expression levels of regulator of calcineurin 1
      (RCAN1) isoform 4 (RCAN1.4) were associated with clinical features. We
      overexpressed RCAN1.4 from lentiviral vectors in MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells and
      knocked expression down using small interfering RNAs in SMMC7721 and Huh7 cells. 
      Cells were analyzed in proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. HCC cells
      that overexpressed RCAN1.4 or with RCAN1.4 knockdown were injected into livers or
      tail veins of nude mice; tumor growth and numbers of lung metastases were
      quantified. We performed bisulfite pyrosequencing and methylation-specific
      polymerase chain reaction analyses to analyze CpG island methylation. We measured
      phosphatase activity of calcineurin in HCC cells. RESULTS: RCAN1.4 mRNA and
      protein levels were significantly decreased in primary HCC compared with adjacent
      noncancer liver tissues. Reduced levels of RCAN1.4 mRNA were significantly
      associated with advanced tumor stages, poor differentiation, larger tumor size,
      and vascular invasion. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with
      HCCs with lower levels of RCAN1.4 mRNA had shorter time of overall survival and
      time to recurrence than patients whose tumors had high levels of RCAN1.4 mRNA. In
      HCC cell lines, expression of RCAN1.4 significantly reduced proliferation,
      migration, and invasive activity. HCC cells that overexpressed RCAN1.4 formed
      smaller xenograft tumors, with fewer metastases and blood vessels, than control
      HCC cells. In HCC cells, RCAN1.4 inhibited expression of insulin-like growth
      factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor A by reducing calcineurin
      activity and blocking nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T
      cells (NFAT1). HCC cells incubated with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A
      had decreased nuclear level of NFAT1. HCC cells had hypermethylation of a CpG
      island in the 5' regulatory region of RCAN1.4, which reduced its expression.
      CONCLUSIONS: RCAN1.4 is down-regulated in HCC tissues, compared with non-tumor
      liver tissues. RCAN1.4 prevents cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in
      vitro; overexpressed RCAN1.4 in HCC cells prevents growth, angiogenesis, and
      metastases of xenograft tumors by inhibiting calcineurin activity and nuclear
      translocation of NFAT1.

      Cholangiopancreatography for Patients With Choledocholithiasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cholecystectomy (CCY) after an episode of choledocholithiasis 
      requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone
      extraction reduces recurrent biliary events compared to expectant management. We 
      studied practice patterns for performance of CCY after ERCP for
      choledocholithiasis using data from 3 large states and evaluated the effects of
      delaying CCY. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the
      ambulatory surgery, inpatient, and emergency department databases from the states
      of California (years 2009-2011), New York (2011-2013), and Florida (2012-2014).
      We collected data from 4516 patients hospitalized with choledocholithiasis who
      underwent ERCP. We compared outcomes of patients who underwent CCY at index
      admission (early CCY), elective CCY within 60 days of discharge (delayed CCY), or
      did not undergo CCY (no CCY), calculating rate of recurrent biliary events
      (defined as an emergency department visit or unplanned hospitalization due to
      symptomatic cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or
      biliary pancreatitis), mortality, and cost by CCY cohort. We also evaluated risk 
      factors for not undergoing CCY. The primary outcome measure was the rate of
      recurrent biliary events in the 365 days after discharge from index admission.
      RESULTS: Of the patients who underwent ERCP for choledocholithiasis, 41.2%
      underwent early CCY, 10.9% underwent delayed CCY, and 48.0% underwent no CCY.
      Early CCY reduced relative risk of recurrent biliary events within 60 days by
      92%, compared with delayed or no CCY (P < .001). After 60 days following
      discharge from index admission, patients with early CCY had an 87% lower risk of 
      recurrent biliary events than patients with no CCY (P < .001) and patients with
      delayed CCY had an 88% lower risk of recurrent biliary events than patients with 
      no CCY (P < .001). A strategy of delayed CCY performed on an outpatient basis was
      least costly. Performance of early CCY was inversely associated with low facility
      volume. Hispanic race, Asian race, Medicaid insurance, and no insurance
      associated inversely with performance of delayed CCY. CONCLUSIONS: In a
      retrospective analysis of >4500 patients hospitalized with choledocholithiasis,
      we found that CCY was not performed after ERCP for almost half of the cases.
      Although early and delayed CCY equally reduce the risk of subsequent recurrent
      biliary events, patients are at 10-fold higher risk of recurrent biliary event
      while waiting for a delayed CCY compared with patients who underwent early CCY.
      Delayed CCY is a cost-effective strategy that must be balanced against the risk
      of loss to follow-up, particularly among patients who are ethnic minorities or
      have little or no health insurance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with
      dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM). The long-term 
      durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration
      of surveillance are unclear. We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis
      of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the
      randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia
      (AIM) trial. METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) 
      were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of 
      non-nodular dysplastic BE </=8 cm in length. Subjects (n = 127) were randomly
      assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated
      circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group
      were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5
      years. We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in
      the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved
      CEIM. We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival
      analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without
      dysplastic recurrence. RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119
      received RFA and met inclusion criteria. Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM.
      Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8
      years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) 
      had dysplasia recurrence. The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100
      person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients 
      with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100
      person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7).
      The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall
      (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade
      dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with
      baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5). Neither BE nor dysplasia
      recurred at a constant rate. There was a greater probability of recurrence in the
      first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined. CONCLUSIONS: In
      this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found
      BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline
      dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM.
      However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had 
      a low risk of BE recurrence. Studies are needed to determine when surveillance
      can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia 
      recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Consumption of sugar is associated with obesity, type 2
      diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. 
      The conversion of fructose to fat in liver (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]) may be a
      modifiable pathogenetic pathway. We determined the effect of 9 days of isocaloric
      fructose restriction on DNL, liver fat, visceral fat (VAT), subcutaneous fat, and
      insulin kinetics in obese Latino and African American children with habitual high
      sugar consumption (fructose intake >50 g/d). METHODS: Children (9-18 years old; n
      = 41) had all meals provided for 9 days with the same energy and macronutrient
      composition as their standard diet, but with starch substituted for sugar,
      yielding a final fructose content of 4% of total kilocalories. Metabolic
      assessments were performed before and after fructose restriction. Liver fat, VAT,
      and subcutaneous fat were determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
      imaging. The fractional DNL area under the curve value was measured using stable 
      isotope tracers and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Insulin kinetics were
      calculated from oral glucose tolerance tests. Paired analyses compared change
      from day 0 to day 10 within each child. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, on day
      10, liver fat decreased from a median of 7.2% (interquartile range [IQR],
      2.5%-14.8%) to 3.8% (IQR, 1.7%-15.5%) (P < .001) and VAT decreased from 123 cm(3)
      (IQR, 85-145 cm(3)) to 110 cm(3) (IQR, 84-134 cm(3)) (P < .001). The DNL area
      under the curve decreased from 68% (IQR, 46%-83%) to 26% (IQR, 16%-37%) (P <
      .001). Insulin kinetics improved (P < .001). These changes occurred irrespective 
      of baseline liver fat. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term (9 days) isocaloric fructose
      restriction decreased liver fat, VAT, and DNL, and improved insulin kinetics in
      children with obesity. These findings support efforts to reduce sugar
      consumption. ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT01200043.

TI  - Intestinal Epithelial Sirtuin 1 Regulates Intestinal Inflammation During Aging in
      Mice by Altering the Intestinal Microbiota.
PG  - 772-786

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal epithelial homeostasis is maintained by complex
      interactions among epithelial cells, commensal gut microorganisms, and immune
      cells. Disruption of this homeostasis is associated with disorders such as
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms of this process are not
      clear. We investigated how Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a conserved mammalian
      NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, senses environmental stress to alter
      intestinal integrity. METHODS: We performed studies of mice with disruption of
      Sirt1 specifically in the intestinal epithelium (SIRT1 iKO, villin-Cre+,
      Sirt1(flox/flox) mice) and control mice (villin-Cre-, Sirt1(flox/flox)) on a
      C57BL/6 background. Acute colitis was induced in some mice by addition of 2.5%
      dextran sodium sulfate to drinking water for 5-9 consecutive days. Some mice were
      given antibiotics via their drinking water for 4 weeks to deplete their
      microbiota. Some mice were fed with a cholestyramine-containing diet for 7 days
      to sequester their bile acids. Feces were collected and proportions of microbiota
      were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. Intestines
      were collected from mice and gene expression profiles were compared by microarray
      and quantitative PCR analyses. We compared levels of specific mRNAs between colon
      tissues from age-matched patients with ulcerative colitis (n=10) vs without IBD
      (n=8, controls). RESULTS: Mice with intestinal deletion of SIRT1 (SIRT1 iKO) had 
      abnormal activation of Paneth cells starting at the age of 5-8 months, with
      increased activation of NF-kappaB, stress pathways, and spontaneous inflammation 
      at 22-24 months of age, compared with control mice. SIRT1 iKO mice also had
      altered fecal microbiota starting at 4-6 months of age compared with control
      mice, in part because of altered bile acid metabolism. Moreover, SIRT1 iKO mice
      with defective gut microbiota developed more severe colitis than control mice.
      Intestinal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis expressed significantly 
      lower levels of SIRT1 mRNA than controls. Intestinal tissues from SIRT1 iKO mice 
      given antibiotics, however, did not have signs of inflammation at 22-24 months of
      age, and did not develop more severe colitis than control mice at 4-6 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: In analyses of intestinal tissues, colitis induction, and gut
      microbiota in mice with intestinal epithelial disruption of SIRT1, we found this 
      protein to prevent intestinal inflammation by regulating the gut microbiota.
      SIRT1 might therefore be an important mediator of host-microbiome interactions.
      Agents designed to activate SIRT1 might be developed as treatments for IBDs.

AB  - The intestinal epithelium is a repetitive sheet of crypt and villus units with
      stem cells at the bottom of the crypts. During postnatal development, crypts
      multiply via fission, generating 2 daughter crypts from 1 parental crypt. In the 
      adult intestine, crypt fission is observed at a low frequency. Using intravital
      microscopy in Lgr5(EGFP-Ires-CreERT2) mice, we monitored individual crypt
      dynamics over multiple days with single-cell resolution. We discovered the
      existence of crypt fusion, an almost exact reverse phenomenon of crypt fission,
      in which 2 crypts fuse into 1 daughter crypt. Examining 819 crypts in 4 mice, we 
      found that 3.5% +/- 0.6% of all crypts were in the process of fission, whereas
      4.1 +/- 0.9% of all crypts were undergoing crypt fusion. As counteracting
      processes, crypt fission and fusion could regulate crypt numbers during the
      lifetime of a mouse. Identifying the mechanisms that regulate rates of crypt
      fission and fusion could provide insights into intestinal adaptation to altered
      environmental conditions and disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Tests for Serum Transglutaminase and Endomysial Antibodies Do Not Detect Most
      Patients With Celiac Disease and Persistent Villous Atrophy on Gluten-free Diets:
      a Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tests to measure serum endomysial antibodies (EMA) and
      antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were developed to screen for celiac
      disease in patients consuming gluten. However, they are commonly used to monitor 
      patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the 
      sensitivity and specificity of tTG IgA and EMA IgA assays in identifying patients
      with celiac disease who have persistent villous atrophy despite a GFD. METHODS:
      We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, BIOSIS, SCOPUS, clinicaltrials.gov, Science Citation 
      Index, and Cochrane Library databases through November 2016. Inclusion criteria
      were studies of subjects with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, follow-up
      biopsies, and measurement of serum antibodies on a GFD, biopsy performed on
      subjects regardless of symptoms, or antibody test results. Our analysis excluded 
      subjects with refractory celiac disease, undergoing gluten challenge, or
      consuming a prescribed oats-containing GFD. Tests were considered to have
      positive or negative findings based on manufacturer cut-off values. Villous
      atrophy was defined as a Marsh 3 lesion or villous height:crypt depth ratio below
      3.0. We constructed forest plots to determine the sensitivity and specificity of 
      detection for individual studies. For the meta-analysis, a bivariate random
      effects model was used to jointly model sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Our
      search identified 5408 unique citations. Following review of abstracts, 442
      articles were reviewed in detail. Only 26 studies (6 of tTG assays, 15 of EMA
      assays, and 5 of tTG and EMA assays) met our inclusion criteria. The most common 
      reason studies were excluded from our analysis was inability to cross-tabulate
      histologic and serologic findings. The serum assays identified patients with
      persistent villous atrophy with high levels of specificity: 0.83 for the tTG IgA 
      assay (95% CI, 0.79-0.87) and 0.91 for the EMA IgA assay (95% CI, 0.87-0.94).
      However, they detected villous atrophy with low levels of sensitivity: 0.50 for
      the tTG IgA assay (95% CI, 0.41-0.60) and 0.45 for the EMA IgA assay (95% CI,
      0.34-0.57). The tests had similar levels of performance in pediatric and adult
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a meta-analysis of patients with biopsy-confirmed
      celiac disease undergoing follow-up biopsy on a GFD, we found that tests for
      serum tTG IgA and EMA IgA levels had low sensitivity (below 50%) in detection of 
      persistent villous atrophy. We need more-accurate non-invasive markers of mucosal
      damage in children and adults with celiac disease who are following a GFD.

TI  - Similar Responses of Intestinal T Cells From Untreated Children and Adults With
      Celiac Disease to Deamidated Gluten Epitopes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a chronic small intestinal inflammatory
      disorder mediated by an immune response to gluten peptides in genetically
      susceptible individuals. Celiac disease is often diagnosed in early childhood,
      but some patients receive a diagnosis late in life. It is uncertain whether
      pediatric celiac disease is distinct from adult celiac disease. It has been
      proposed that gluten-reactive T cells in children recognize deamidated and native
      gluten epitopes, whereas T cells from adults only recognize deamidated gluten
      peptides. We studied the repertoire of gluten epitopes recognized by T cells from
      children and adults. METHODS: We examined T-cell responses against gluten by
      generating T-cell lines and T-cell clones from intestinal biopsies of adults and 
      children and tested proliferative response to various gluten peptides. We
      analyzed T cells from 14 children (2-5 years old) at high risk for celiac disease
      who were followed for celiac disease development. We also analyzed T cells from 6
      adults (26-55 years old) with untreated celiac disease. All children and adults
      were positive for HLA-DQ2.5. Biopsies were incubated with gluten digested with
      chymotrypsin (modified or unmodified by the enzyme transglutaminase 2) or the
      peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin (in native and deamidated forms) before T-cell
      collection. RESULTS: Levels of T-cell responses were higher to deamidated gluten 
      than to native gluten in children and adults. T cells from children and adults
      each reacted to multiple gluten epitopes. Several T-cell clones were
      cross-reactive, especially clones that recognized epitopes from gamma-and
      omega-gliadin. About half of the generated T-cell clones from children and adults
      reacted to unknown epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: T-cell responses to different gluten
      peptides appear to be similar between adults and children at the time of
      diagnosis of celiac disease.

TI  - Sporadic Early-Onset Diffuse Gastric Cancers Have High Frequency of Somatic CDH1 
      Alterations, but Low Frequency of Somatic RHOA Mutations Compared With Late-Onset
      Cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early-onset gastric cancer, which develops in patients younger
      than most gastric cancers, is usually detected at advanced stages, has diffuse
      histologic features, and occurs more frequently in women. We investigated somatic
      genomic alterations associated with the unique characteristics of sporadic
      diffuse gastric cancers (DGCs) from younger patients. METHODS: We conducted whole
      exome and RNA sequence analyses of 80 resected DGC samples from patients 45 years
      old or younger in Korea. Patients with pathogenic germline mutations in CDH1,
      TP53, and ATM were excluded from the onset of this analysis, given our focus on
      somatic alterations. We used MutSig2CV to evaluate the significance of mutated
      genes. We recruited 29 additional early-onset Korean DGC samples and performed
      SNP6.0 array and targeted sequencing analyses of these 109 early-onset DGC
      samples (54.1% female, median age, 38 years). We compared the SNP6.0 array and
      targeted sequencing data of the 109 early-onset DGC samples with those from
      diffuse-type stomach tumor samples collected from 115 patients in Korea who were 
      46 years or older (late onset) at the time of diagnosis (controls; 29.6% female, 
      median age, 67 years). We compared patient survival times among tumors from
      different subgroups and with different somatic mutations. We performed gene
      silencing of RHOA or CDH1 in DGC cells with small interfering RNAs for cell-based
      assays. RESULTS: We identified somatic mutations in the following genes in a
      significant number of early-onset DGCs: the cadherin 1 gene (CDH1), TP53, ARID1A,
      KRAS, PIK3CA, ERBB3, TGFBR1, FBXW7, RHOA, and MAP2K1. None of 109 early-onset DGC
      cases had pathogenic germline CDH1 mutations. A higher proportion of early-onset 
      DGCs had mutations in CDH1 (42.2%) or TGFBR1 (7.3%) compared with control DGCs
      (17.4% and 0.9%, respectively) (P < .001 and P = .014 for CDH1 and TGFBR1,
      respectively). In contrast, a smaller proportion of early-onset DGCs contained
      mutations in RHOA (9.2%) than control DGCs (19.1%) (P = .033). Late-onset DGCs in
      The Cancer Genome Atlas also contained less frequent mutations in CDH1 and TGFBR1
      and more frequent RHOA mutations, compared with early-onset DGCs. Early-onset
      DGCs from women contained significantly more mutations in CDH1 or TGFBR1 than
      early-onset DGCs from men. CDH1 alterations, but not RHOA mutations, were
      associated with shorter survival times in patients with early-onset DGCs (hazard 
      ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-7.7). RHOA activity was reduced by an
      R5W substitution-the RHOA mutation most frequently detected in early-onset DGCs. 
      Silencing of CDH1, but not RHOA, increased migratory activity of DGC cells.
      CONCLUSIONS: In an integrative genomic analysis, we found higher proportions of
      early-onset DGCs to contain somatic mutations in CDH1 or TGFBR1 compared with
      late-onset DGCs. However, a smaller proportion of early-onset DGCs contained
      somatic mutations in RHOA than late-onset DGCs. CDH1 alterations, but not RHOA
      mutations, were associated with shorter survival times of patients, which might
      account for the aggressive clinical course of early-onset gastric cancer. Female 
      predominance in early-onset gastric cancer may be related to relatively high
      rates of somatic CDH1 and TGFBR1 mutations in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Statin use has been associated with a reduced incidence of
      colorectal cancer and might also affect survival of patients diagnosed with colon
      cancer. Statins are believed to inhibit Ras signaling and may also activate the
      bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells. We
      investigated the effects of statins on overall survival of patients with a
      diagnosis of colon cancer, and whether their effects were associated with changes
      in KRAS or the BMP signaling pathways. METHODS: Data were derived from the PHARMO
      database network (Netherlands) and linked to patients diagnosed with colon cancer
      from 2002 through 2007, listed in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry. We obtained
      information on causes of death from statistics Netherlands. We constructed a
      tissue microarray of 999 colon cancer specimens from patients who underwent
      surgical resection from 2002 through 2008. Survival was analyzed with statin user
      status after diagnosis as a time-dependent covariate. Multivariable Poisson
      regression survival models and Cox analyses were used to study the effect of
      statins on survival. Tumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for
      levels of SMAD4, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, and BMPR2 proteins. Tumor tissues were
      considered to have intact BMP signaling if they contained SMAD4 plus BMPR1A,
      BMPR1B, or BMPR2. DNA was isolated from tumor tissues and analyzed by
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect mutations in KRAS. The primary
      outcome measures were overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS:
      In this cohort, 21.0% of the patients (210/999) were defined as statin users
      after diagnosis of colon cancer. Statin use after diagnosis was significantly
      associated with reduced risk of death from any cause (adjusted relative risk
      [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; P = .003) and death from
      cancer (adjusted RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.89; P = .007). Statin use after
      diagnosis was associated with reduced risk of death from any cause or from cancer
      for patients whose tumors had intact BMP signaling (adjusted RR, 0.39; 95% CI,
      0.22-0.68; P = .001), but not for patients whose tumors did not have BMP
      signaling (adjusted RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.55-1.21; P = .106; P < .0001 for the
      interaction). Statin use after diagnosis was not associated with reduced risk of 
      death from any cause or from cancer for patients whose tumors did not contain
      KRAS mutations (adjusted RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56-1.18; P = .273) or whose tumors
      did have KRAS mutations (adjusted RR, 0.59; 95% CI 0.35-1.03; P = .062; P = .90
      for the interaction). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 999 patients with a
      diagnosis of colon cancer, we associated statin with reduced risk of death from
      any cause or from cancer. The benefit of statin use is greater for patients whose
      tumors have intact BMP signaling, independent of KRAS mutation status. Randomized
      controlled trials are required to confirm these results.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of tobacco smoke in the etiology of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We investigated interactions between genes and
      smoking (gene-smoking interactions) that affect risk for Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC) in a case-only study of patients and in mouse models of
      IBD. METHODS: We used 55 Immunochip-wide datasets that included 19,735 IBD cases 
      (10,856 CD cases and 8879 UC cases) of known smoking status. We performed 3
      meta-analyses each for CD, UC, and IBD (CD and UC combined), comparing data for
      never vs ever smokers, never vs current smokers, and never vs former smokers. We 
      studied the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in Il10(-/-) and Nod2(-/-)
      mice, as well as in Balb/c mice without disruption of these genes (wild-type
      mice). Mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 cigarettes per day, 5 days a week, for
      8 weeks, in a ventilated smoking chamber, or ambient air (controls). Intestines
      were collected and analyzed histologically and by reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We identified 64 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) for which the association between the SNP and IBD were
      modified by smoking behavior (meta-analysis Wald test P < 5.0 x 10(-5);
      heterogeneity Cochrane Q test P > .05). Twenty of these variants were located
      within the HLA region at 6p21. Analysis of classical HLA alleles (imputed from
      SNP genotypes) revealed an interaction with smoking. We replicated the
      interaction of a variant in NOD2 with current smoking in relation to the risk for
      CD (frameshift variant fs1007insC; rs5743293). We identified 2 variants in the
      same genomic region (rs2270368 and rs17221417) that interact with smoking in
      relation to CD risk. Approximately 45% of the SNPs that interact with smoking
      were in close vicinity (</=1 Mb) to SNPs previously associated with IBD; many
      were located near or within genes that regulate mucosal barrier function and
      immune tolerance. Smoking modified the disease risk of some variants in opposite 
      directions for CD vs UC. Exposure of Interleukin 10 (il10)-deficient mice to
      cigarette smoke accelerated development of colitis and increased expression of
      interferon gamma in the small intestine compared to wild-type mice exposed to
      smoke. NOD2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke developed ileitis,
      characterized by increased expression of interferon gamma, compared to wild-type 
      mice exposed to smoke. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 55 Immunochip-wide
      datasets, we identified 64 SNPs whose association with risk for IBD is modified
      by tobacco smoking. Gene-smoking interactions were confirmed in mice with
      disruption of Il10 and Nod2-variants of these genes have been associated with
      risk for IBD. Our findings from mice and humans revealed that the effects of
      smoking on risk for IBD depend on genetic variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is commonly used to detect
      upper gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasms. However, there is little evidence that
      longer examination time increases rate of detection of upper GI neoplasia. We
      investigated the association between length of time spent performing a normal
      screening EGD and rate of neoplasm detection. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of data from 111,962 subjects who underwent EGD as part of
      a comprehensive health-screening program from January 2009 to December 2015 in
      Korea. Endoscopy findings were extracted from reports prepared by 14
      board-certified endoscopists. Endoscopists were classified as fast or slow based 
      on their mean examination time for a normal EGD without biopsy during their first
      year of the study. All endoscopists used the same endoscopy unit. We obtained
      findings from histologic analyses of GI biopsies from patient records; positive
      findings were defined as the detection of neoplasms (esophageal, gastric, or
      duodenal lesions). We examined the association between examination time and
      proportions of neoplasms detected. The primary outcome measure was the rate of
      neoplasm detection for each endoscopist (total number of neoplastic lesions
      detected divided by the number of subjects screened) and as the proportion of
      subjects with at least 1 neoplastic lesion. RESULTS: The mean examination time
      was 2 minutes 53 seconds. Using 3 minutes as a cutoff, we classified 8
      endoscopists as fast (mean duration, 2:38 +/- 0:21 minutes) and 6 endoscopists as
      slow (mean duration, 3:25 +/- 0:19 minutes). Each endoscopist's mean examination 
      time correlated with their rate of neoplasm detection (R(2) = 0.54; P = .046).
      Fast endoscopists identified neoplasms in the upper GI tract in 0.20% of
      patients, whereas slow endoscopists identified these in 0.28% of patients (P =
      .0054). The frequency of endoscopic biopsy varied among endoscopists (range,
      6.9%-27.8%) and correlated with rate of neoplasm detection (R(2) = 0.76; P =
      .0015). On multivariable analysis, slow endoscopists were more likely to detect
      gastric adenomas or carcinomas than fast endoscopists (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 
      1.17-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of data from more than
      100,000 subjects who underwent EGD in a screening program, we found slow
      endoscopists detected a higher proportion of neoplasms than fast endoscopists.
      Examination time is therefore a useful indicator of quality for EGD.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotics can reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), but little is known about their effects on psychiatric comorbidities. We
      performed a prospective study to evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium longum
      NCC3001 (BL) on anxiety and depression in patients with IBS. METHODS: We
      performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 44 adults with 
      IBS and diarrhea or a mixed-stool pattern (based on Rome III criteria) and mild
      to moderate anxiety and/or depression (based on the Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression scale) at McMaster University in Canada, from March 2011 to May 2014. 
      At the screening visit, clinical history and symptoms were assessed and blood
      samples were collected. Patients were then randomly assigned to groups and given 
      daily BL (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22) for 6 weeks. At weeks 0, 6, and 10, we
      determined patients' levels of anxiety and depression, IBS symptoms, quality of
      life, and somatization using validated questionnaires. At weeks 0 and 6, stool,
      urine and blood samples were collected, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) test was performed. We assessed brain activation patterns, fecal
      microbiota, urine metabolome profiles, serum markers of inflammation,
      neurotransmitters, and neurotrophin levels. RESULTS: At week 6, 14 of 22 patients
      in the BL group had reduction in depression scores of 2 points or more on the
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, vs 7 of 22 patients in the placebo group
      (P = .04). BL had no significant effect on anxiety or IBS symptoms. Patients in
      the BL group had a mean increase in quality of life score compared with the
      placebo group. The fMRI analysis showed that BL reduced responses to negative
      emotional stimuli in multiple brain areas, including amygdala and fronto-limbic
      regions, compared with placebo. The groups had similar fecal microbiota profiles,
      serum markers of inflammation, and levels of neurotrophins and neurotransmitters,
      but the BL group had reduced urine levels of methylamines and aromatic amino
      acids metabolites. At week 10, depression scores were reduced in patients given
      BL vs placebo. CONCLUSION: In a placebo-controlled trial, we found that the
      probiotic BL reduces depression but not anxiety scores and increases quality of
      life in patients with IBS. These improvements were associated with changes in
      brain activation patterns that indicate that this probiotic reduces limbic
      reactivity. ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT01276626.

      Fecal Immunochemical Testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Among subjects screened for colorectal cancer (CRC) by the
      guaiac fecal occult blood test, interval cancers develop in 48% to 55% of the
      subjects. Data are limited on how many persons screened by fecal immunochemical
      tests (FIT), over multiple rounds, develop interval cancers. In the Netherlands, 
      a pilot FIT-based biennial CRC screening program was conducted between 2006 and
      2014. We collected and analyzed data from the program on CRCs detected during
      screening (SD-CRC) and CRCs not detected within the screening program
      (non-SD-CRC; such as FIT interval cancers, colonoscopy interval cancers, and
      cancer in nonparticipants). METHODS: Screenees with a negative FIT result
      received a letter explaining that no blood had been detected in the stool sample 
      and were re-invited, if eligible, for screening biennially. Screenees with a
      positive FIT result (hemoglobin concentration of 10 mug Hb/g feces) were invited 
      for consultation and scheduled for colonoscopy; results were collected. After the
      fourth round of FIT screening, the cohort was linked to the Netherlands Cancer
      Registry, through March 31, 2015; participant characteristics, data on tumor
      stage, location (at time of resection), and survival status were collected for
      all identified CRC cases. A reference group comprised all persons with CRC
      diagnosed in the Netherlands general population during the same period, in the
      same age range (50-76 years), who had not been offered CRC screening. The median 
      time between invitations (2.37 years) was used as a cutoff to categorize
      participants within the FIT interval cancer category. We compared participant
      characteristics, tumor characteristics, and mortality among subjects with SD-CRC 
      and with non-SD-CRC. RESULTS: A total of 27,304 eligible individuals were invited
      for FIT screening, of whom 18,716 (69%) participated at least once. Of these,
      3005 (16%) had a positive result from the FIT in 1 of the 4 screening rounds. In 
      total, CRC was detected in 261 participants: 116 SD-CRCs and 145 non-SD-CRCs (27 
      FIT interval cancers, 9 colonoscopy interval cancers, and 109 CRCs in
      nonparticipants). The FIT interval cancer proportion after 3 completed screening 
      rounds was 23%. Participants with SD-CRC had more early-stage tumors than
      participants with non-SD-CRCs (P < .001). Of persons with SD-CRC and FIT interval
      cancers, significantly higher proportions survived (89% and 81%, respectively)
      compared with persons with colonoscopy interval cancers (44% survival) and
      nonparticipants with CRC (60% survival) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis
      of data from a pilot FIT-based biennial screening program, we found that among
      persons screened by FIT, 23% developed FIT interval cancer. FIT therefore detects
      CRC with 77% sensitivity. The proportion of FIT interval cancers in FIT screening
      appears to be lower than that with guaiac fecal occult blood testing. Clinical
      trial registry: yes, www.trialregister.nl, trial number: NTR5385.

TI  - Effects of Anticoagulants in Patients With Cirrhosis and Portal Vein Thrombosis: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver cirrhosis is complicated by bleeding from portal
      hypertension but also by portal vein thrombosis (PVT). PVT occurs in
      approximately 20% to 50% of patients with cirrhosis, and is a warning sign for
      poor outcome. It is a challenge to treat patients with cirrhosis using
      anticoagulants, because of the perception that the coexistent coagulopathy could 
      promote bleeding. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine
      the effects of anticoagulant therapy in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. METHODS:
      We searched the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases
      through February 14, 2017, for studies that assessed the effect of anticoagulant 
      therapy vs no treatment in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. We performed a
      meta-analysis to estimate the effect of anticoagulant treatment vs no therapy on 
      recanalization and progression of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. We also
      assessed variceal and nonvariceal bleeding. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 8
      studies, comprising 353 patients, that assessed the effects of anticoagulant
      therapy (low-weight heparin or warfarin vs no therapy) in patients with cirrhosis
      and PVT; these studies reported rates of complete and partial recanalization. A
      significantly higher proportion of patients treated with anticoagulants underwent
      PVT recanalization than patients who did not receive anticoagulants (71% vs 42%, 
      respectively; P < .0001). From 6 studies (comprising 217 patients), 53% of
      patients treated with anticoagulants vs 33% of patients who did not receive
      anticoagulants had complete PVT recanalization (P = .002). From 6 studies
      (comprising 225 patients), PVT progressed in 9% of patients treated with
      anticoagulants vs 33% of patients who did not receive these drugs (P < .0001).
      Six studies (257 patients) reported rates of any bleeding; there was no
      difference in the proportions of patients with major or minor bleeding between
      groups that did vs did not receive anticoagulants (11% for both groups). Four
      studies (comprising 158 patients) reported rates of spontaneous variceal
      bleeding, which occurred in a significantly lower proportion of patients who
      received anticoagulants vs those who did not (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on a
      systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with cirrhosis and PVT who receive 
      anticoagulant therapy have increased recanalization and reduced progression of
      thrombosis, compared with patients who do not receive anticoagulants, with no
      excess of major and minor bleedings and less incidence of variceal bleeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) among
      individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have used data from single
      centers or CDI administrative data codes of limited diagnostic accuracy. We
      determined the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes after CDI in a
      population-based cohort of patients with IBD and laboratory confirmation
      diagnoses of CDI. METHODS: We searched the University of Manitoba IBD
      Epidemiology Database and Manitoba Health CDI databases to identify individuals
      with CDI, with or without IBD, from July 1, 2005 through March 31, 2014. Time
      trends of incidence were assessed using joinpoint regression. Multivariable Cox
      regression analyses were performed to assess differences in CDI incidence rates
      and mortality after CDI between individuals with and without IBD. Conditional
      logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of CDI among
      individuals with IBD. RESULTS: Individuals with IBD had a 4.8-fold increase in
      risk of CDI than individuals without IBD; we found no difference between
      individuals with ulcerative colitis vs Crohn's disease. There was no increase in 
      CDI incidence over the study time period in either group. Among individuals with 
      IBD, exposure to corticosteroids, infliximab or adalimumab, metronidazole,
      hospitalizations, higher ambulatory care visits, shorter duration of IBD, and
      higher comorbidities were associated with an increased risk of CDI. Although CDI 
      increased mortality among individuals with and without IBD, there was lower
      mortality after CDI among individuals with IBD than without IBD (hazard ratio,
      0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: CDI incidence is no
      longer increasing among individuals with IBD. We identified unique risk factors
      for CDI in patients with IBD. CDI is associated with a greater increase in
      mortality among individuals without IBD than with IBD.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.04.043 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Algorithms for diagnosis of malignant common bile duct (CBD)
      stenoses are complex and lack accuracy. Malignant tumors secrete large numbers of
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) into surrounding fluids; EVs might therefore serve
      as biomarkers for diagnosis. We investigated whether concentrations of EVs in
      bile could discriminate malignant from nonmalignant CBD stenoses. METHODS: We
      collected bile and blood samples from 50 patients undergoing therapeutic
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at university hospitals in Europe 
      for CBD stenosis of malignant (pancreatic cancer, n = 20 or cholangiocarcinoma, n
      = 5) or nonmalignant (chronic pancreatitis [CP], n = 15) origin. Ten patients
      with CBD obstruction due to biliary stones were included as controls. EV
      concentrations in samples were determined by nanoparticle tracking analyses. The 
      discovery cohort comprised the first 10 patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic
      cancer, based on tissue analysis, and 10 consecutive controls. Using samples from
      these subjects, we identified a threshold concentration of bile EVs that could
      best discriminate between patients with pancreatic cancer from controls. We
      verified the diagnostic performance of bile EV concentration by analyzing samples
      from the 30 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of malignant (pancreatic cancer
      or cholangiocarcinoma, n = 15) or nonmalignant (CP, n = 15) CBD stenosis. Samples
      were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and nonparametric Spearman correlation 
      analysis. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was used to
      determine diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: In both cohorts, the median concentration
      of EVs was significantly higher in bile samples from patients with malignant CBD 
      stenoses than controls or nonmalignant CBD stenoses (2.41 x 10(15) vs 1.60 x
      10(14) nanoparticles/L in the discovery cohort; P < .0001 and 4.00 x 10(15) vs
      1.26 x 10(14) nanoparticles/L in the verification cohort; P < .0001). A threshold
      of 9.46 x 10(14) nanoparticles/L in bile best distinguished patients with
      malignant CBD from controls in the discovery cohort. In the verification cohort, 
      this threshold discriminated malignant from nonmalignant CBD stenoses with 100%
      accuracy. Serum concentration of EVs distinguished patients with malignant vs
      patients with nonmalignant CBD stenoses with 63.3% diagnostic accuracy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Concentration of EVs in bile samples discriminates between patients 
      with malignant vs nonmalignant CBD stenosis with 100% accuracy. Further studies
      are needed to confirm these findings. Clinical Trial registration no:

TI  - Validation of Antibody-Based Strategies for Diagnosis of Pediatric Celiac Disease
      Without Biopsy.
PG  - 410-419.e17
LID - S0016-5085(17)35532-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.04.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diagnosis of celiac disease is made based on clinical,
      genetic, serologic, and duodenal morphology features. Recent pediatric
      guidelines, based largely on retrospective data, propose omitting biopsy analysis
      for patients with concentrations of IgA against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TTG)
      >10-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) and if further criteria are met. A
      retrospective study concluded that measurements of IgA-TTG and total IgA, or
      IgA-TTG and IgG against deamidated gliadin (IgG-DGL) could identify patients with
      and without celiac disease. Patients were assigned to categories of no celiac
      disease, celiac disease, or biopsy required, based entirely on antibody assays.
      We aimed to validate the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of
      these diagnostic procedures. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 898
      children undergoing duodenal biopsy analysis to confirm or rule out celiac
      disease at 13 centers in Europe. We compared findings from serologic analysis
      with findings from biopsy analyses, follow-up data, and diagnoses made by the
      pediatric gastroenterologists (celiac disease, no celiac disease, or no final
      diagnosis). Assays to measure IgA-TTG, IgG-DGL, and endomysium antibodies were
      performed by blinded researchers, and tissue sections were analyzed by local and 
      blinded reference pathologists. We validated 2 procedures for diagnosis:
      total-IgA and IgA-TTG (the TTG-IgA procedure), as well as IgG-DGL with IgA-TTG
      (TTG-DGL procedure). Patients were assigned to categories of no celiac disease if
      all assays found antibody concentrations <1-fold the ULN, or celiac disease if at
      least 1 assay measured antibody concentrations >10-fold the ULN. All other cases 
      were considered to require biopsy analysis. ULN values were calculated using the 
      cutoff levels suggested by the test kit manufacturers. HLA typing was performed
      for 449 participants. We used models that considered how specificity values
      change with prevalence to extrapolate the PPV and NPV to populations with lower
      prevalence of celiac disease. RESULTS: Of the participants, 592 were found to
      have celiac disease, 345 were found not to have celiac disease, and 24 had no
      final diagnosis. The TTG-IgA procedure identified patients with celiac disease
      with a PPV of 0.988 and an NPV of 0.934; the TTG-DGL procedure identified
      patients with celiac disease with a PPV of 0.988 and an NPV of 0.958. Based on
      our extrapolation model, we estimated that the PPV and NPV would remain >0.95
      even at a disease prevalence as low as 4%. Tests for endomysium antibodies and
      HLA type did not increase the PPV of samples with levels of IgA-TTG >/=10-fold
      the ULN. Notably, 4.2% of pathologists disagreed in their analyses of duodenal
      morphology-a rate comparable to the error rate for serologic assays. CONCLUSIONS:
      In a prospective study, we validated the TTG-IgA procedure and the TTG-DGL
      procedure in identification of pediatric patients with or without celiac disease,
      without biopsy. German Clinical Trials Registry no.: DRKS00003854.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine
      expressed by human fetal liver cells (HFLCs) after infection with cell
      culture-derived hepatitis C virus (HCV). TNF has been reported to increase entry 
      of HCV pseudoparticles into hepatoma cells and inhibit signaling by interferon
      alpha (IFNalpha), but have no effect on HCV-RNA replication. We investigated the 
      effects of TNF on HCV infection of and spread among Huh-7 hepatoma cells and
      primary HFLCs. METHODS: Human hepatoma (Huh-7 and Huh-7.5) and primary HFLCs were
      incubated with TNF and/or recombinant IFNA2A, IFNB, IFNL1, and IFNL2 before or
      during HCV infection. We used 2 fully infectious HCV chimeric viruses of genotype
      2A in these studies: J6/JFH (clone 2) and Jc1(p7-nsGluc2A) (Jc1G), which encodes 
      a secreted luciferase reporter. We measured HCV replication, entry, spread,
      production, and release in hepatoma cells and HFLCs. RESULTS: TNF inhibited
      completion of the HCV infectious cycle in hepatoma cells and HFLCs in a
      dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. This inhibition required TNF binding to
      its receptor. Inhibition was independent of IFNalpha, IFNbeta, IFNL1, IFNL2, or
      Janus kinase signaling via signal transducer and activator of transcription. TNF 
      reduced production of infectious viral particles by Huh-7 and HFLC, and thereby
      reduced the number of infected cells and focus size. TNF had little effect on HCV
      replicons and increased entry of HCV pseudoparticles. When cells were incubated
      with TNF before infection, the subsequent antiviral effects of IFNs were
      increased. CONCLUSIONS: In a cell culture system, we found TNF to have antiviral 
      effects independently of, as well as in combination with, IFNs. TNF inhibits HCV 
      infection despite increased HCV envelope glycoprotein-mediated infection of liver
      cells. These findings contradict those from other studies, which have reported
      that TNF blocks signal transduction in response to IFNs. The destructive
      inflammatory effects of TNF must be considered along with its antiviral effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection has changed 
      with improvements in sanitation and methods of eradication. We performed a
      systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate changes in the global prevalence 
      of H pylori infection. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE
      and EMBASE databases for studies of the prevalence of H pylori infection
      published from January 1, 1970 through January 1, 2016. We analyzed data based on
      United Nations geoscheme regions and individual countries. We used a random
      effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs), weighted by study size. We extrapolated 2015 prevalence
      estimates to obtain the estimated number of individuals with H pylori infection. 
      RESULTS: Among 14,006 reports screened, we identified 263 full-text articles on
      the prevalence of H pylori infection; 184 were included in the final analysis,
      comprising data from 62 countries. Africa had the highest pooled prevalence of H 
      pylori infection (70.1%; 95% CI, 62.6-77.7), whereas Oceania had the lowest
      prevalence (24.4%; 95% CI, 18.5-30.4). Among individual countries, the prevalence
      of H pylori infection varied from as low as 18.9% in Switzerland (95% CI,
      13.1-24.7) to 87.7% in Nigeria (95% CI, 83.1-92.2). Based on regional prevalence 
      estimates, there were approximately 4.4 billion individuals with H pylori
      infection worldwide in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and
      meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of H pylori infection worldwide, we
      observed large amounts of variation among regions-more than half the world's
      population is infected. These data can be used in development of customized
      strategies for the global eradication.

TI  - Inhibiting Cholesterol Absorption During Lactation Programs Future Intestinal
      Absorption of Cholesterol in Adult Mice.

AB  - In nematodes, the intestine senses and integrates early life dietary cues that
      lead to lifelong epigenetic adaptations to a perceived nutritional environment-it
      is not clear whether this process occurs in mammals. We aimed to establish a
      mouse model of reduced dietary cholesterol availability from maternal milk and
      investigate the consequences of decreased milk cholesterol availability, early in
      life, on the metabolism of cholesterol in adult mice. We blocked intestinal
      absorption of cholesterol in milk fed to newborn mice by supplementing the food
      of dams (for 3 weeks between birth and weaning) with ezetimibe, which is secreted
      into milk. Ezetimibe interacts with the intestinal cholesterol absorption
      transporter NPC1l1 to block cholesterol uptake into enterocytes. Characterization
      of these offspring at 24 weeks of age showed a 27% decrease in cholesterol
      absorption (P < .001) and reduced levels of Npc1l1 messenger RNA and protein, but
      not other cholesterol transporters, in the proximal small intestine. We observed 
      increased histone H3K9me3 methylation at positions -423 to -607 of the proximal
      Npc1l1 promoter in small intestine tissues from 24-week-old offspring fed
      ezetimibe during lactation, compared with controls. These findings show that the 
      early postnatal mammalian intestine functions as an environmental sensor of
      nutritional conditions, responding to conditions such as low cholesterol levels
      by epigenetic modifications of genes. Further studies are needed to determine how
      decreased sterol absorption for a defined period might activate epigenetic
      regulators; the findings of our study might have implications for human infant
      nutrition and understanding and preventing cardiometabolic disease.

TI  - Hyperglycemia Increases Interstitial Cells of Cajal via MAPK1 and MAPK3 Signaling
      to ETV1 and KIT, Leading to Rapid Gastric Emptying.
PG  - 521-535.e20
LID - S0016-5085(17)35523-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.04.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Depletion of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) is common in
      diabetic gastroparesis. However, in approximately 20% of patients with diabetes, 
      gastric emptying (GE) is accelerated. GE also occurs faster in obese individuals,
      and is associated with increased blood levels of glucose in patients with type 2 
      diabetes. To understand the fate of ICCs in hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic
      states characterized by rapid GE, we studied mice with mutation of the leptin
      receptor (Lepr(db/db)), which in our colony had accelerated GE. We also
      investigated hyperglycemia-induced signaling in the ICC lineage and ICC
      dependence on glucose oxidative metabolism in mice with disruption of the
      succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit C gene (Sdhc). METHODS: Mice were given 
      breath tests to analyze GE of solids. ICCs were studied by flow cytometry,
      intracellular electrophysiology, isometric contractility measurement,
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot,
      immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and metabolite assays; 
      cells and tissues were manipulated pharmacologically and by RNA interference.
      Viable cell counts, proliferation, and apoptosis were determined by
      methyltetrazolium, Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, bromodeoxyuridine, 
      and caspase-Glo 3/7 assays. Sdhc was disrupted in 2 different strains of mice via
      cre recombinase. RESULTS: In obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic female
      Lepr(db/db) mice, GE was accelerated and gastric ICC and phasic cholinergic
      responses were increased. Female Kit(K641E/+) mice, which have genetically
      induced hyperplasia of ICCs, also had accelerated GE. In isolated cells of the
      ICC lineage and gastric organotypic cultures, hyperglycemia stimulated
      proliferation by mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1)- and MAPK3-dependent 
      stabilization of ets variant 1-a master transcription factor for ICCs-and
      consequent up-regulation of v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene
      homolog (KIT) receptor tyrosine kinase. Opposite changes occurred in mice with
      disruption of Sdhc. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia increases ICCs via oxidative
      metabolism-dependent, MAPK1- and MAPK3-mediated stabilization of ets variant 1
      and increased expression of KIT, causing rapid GE. Increases in ICCs might
      contribute to the acceleration in GE observed in some patients with diabetes.

TI  - Antagonistic Effects of p53 and HIF1A on microRNA-34a Regulation of PPP1R11 and
      STAT3 and Hypoxia-induced Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Colorectal
      Cancer Cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In colorectal tumors, hypoxia causes resistance to therapy and
      promotes metastasis. Loss of the tumor suppressor p53 (encoded by TP53) provides 
      cancer cells with a selective advantage under conditions of hypoxia, but little
      is known about the mediators of this effect. METHODS: Isogenic colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) cell lines with different TP53 genotypes were placed under conditions of
      hypoxia. We examined the effects on levels and activity of microRNA-34a (MIR34A) 
      in CRC cells. We determined the expression and localization of protein
      phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 11 (PPP1R11, also called INH3, HCGV,
      IPP3, HCGV, TCTE5, TCTEX5, or CFAP255) in 82 human colon cancers. We analyzed
      data on human colorectal carcinomas from the Cancer Genome Atlas collection to
      determine whether expression of PPP1R11 was affected by altered level or activity
      of p53, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or MIR34A or was
      associated with metastasis. We determined the effects of disruption Mir34a,
      Mir34b, and Mir34c in ApcMin/+ mice. DLD-1 cells were transfected with small
      inhibitor RNAs against PPP1R1, injected into the tail veins of immune-compromised
      mice, and followed by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: The hypoxia
      inducible factor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A) directly repressed the MIR34A gene in
      p53-defective CRC cells, whereas expression of MIR34A was induced in
      p53-proficient CRC cells exposed to hypoxia. Down-regulation of MIR34A was
      required for hypoxia-induced EMT, invasion and migration, and activation of STAT3
      in CRC cells. We identified PPP1R11, whose product inhibits PP1, as a target of
      MIR34A. PPP1R11 mediates phosphorylation (activation) of STAT3, so expression of 
      MIR34A reduced activation of STAT3 in p53-deficient CRC cells. Ectopic expression
      of PPP1R11 in CRC cells induced EMT, invasion, and migration, which all required 
      STAT3. Increased expression of PPP1R11 in p53-deficient CRC cells was required
      for hypoxia-induced EMT, invasion, migration, and resistance to 5-fluorouracil,
      as well as metastasis of xenograft tumors to lungs of mice. Adenomas and derived 
      tumoroids of ApcMin/+ mice with disruption of Mir34a, Mir34b, and Mir34c had
      increased levels of PPP1R11. Colorectal tumors from patients had increased levels
      of PPP1R11 at areas of invasion, compared with other areas of the tumor;
      increased level PPP1R11 associated with TP53 mutations and metastasis to the
      liver. CONCLUSIONS: HIF1A represses, whereas p53 increases, expression of MIR34A 
      in CRC cells. MIR34A reduces expression of PPP1R11 to prevent activation of STAT3
      and inhibit the EMT and metastasis. Strategies to target this pathway might be
      developed to inhibit CRC metastasis and overcome resistance to therapy associated
      with hypoxia.

TI  - Safety of Adding Oats to a Gluten-Free Diet for Patients With Celiac Disease:
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Clinical and Observational Studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with celiac disease should maintain a gluten-free
      diet (GFD), excluding wheat, rye, and barley. Oats might increase the nutritional
      value of a GFD, but their inclusion is controversial. We performed a systematic
      review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of oats as part of a GFD in
      patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register 
      of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases for clinical trials and
      observational studies of the effects of including oats in GFD of patients with
      celiac disease. The studies reported patients' symptoms, results from serology
      tests, and findings from histologic analyses. We used the GRADE approach to
      assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 433 studies; 28 were
      eligible for analysis. Of these, 6 were randomized and 2 were not randomized
      controlled trials comprising a total of 661 patients-the remaining studies were
      observational. All randomized controlled trials used pure/uncontaminated oats.
      Oat consumption for 12 months did not affect symptoms (standardized mean
      difference: reduction in symptom scores in patients who did and did not consume
      oats, -0.22; 95% CI, -0.56 to 0.13; P = .22), histologic scores (relative risk
      for histologic findings in patients who consumed oats, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01-4.8; P 
      = .35), intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (standardized mean difference, 0.21;
      95% CI, reduction of 1.44 to increase in 1.86), or results from serologic tests. 
      Subgroup analyses of adults vs children did not reveal differences. The overall
      quality of evidence was low. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and
      meta-analysis, we found no evidence that addition of oats to a GFD affects
      symptoms, histology, immunity, or serologic features of patients with celiac
      disease. However, there were few studies for many endpoints, as well as limited
      geographic distribution and low quality of evidence. Rigorous double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials, using commonly available oats
      sourced from different regions, are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aflatoxin, which causes hepatocellular carcinoma, may also
      cause gallbladder cancer. We investigated whether patients with gallbladder
      cancer have higher exposure to aflatoxin than patients with gallstones. METHODS: 
      We measured aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-lysine adducts in plasma samples from the
      Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer case-control study, conducted from 1997 through
      2001. We calculated age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) and the population-attributable fraction for 209 patients with
      gallbladder cancer and gallstones vs 250 patients with gallstones without cancer 
      (controls). In 54 patients with gallbladder cancer, tumor tissue was examined for
      the R249S mutation in TP53, associated with aflatoxin exposure, through targeted 
      sequencing. RESULTS: The AFB1-lysine adduct was detected in 67 (32%) of 209
      patients with gallbladder cancer and 37 (15%) of the 250 controls (chi(2) P <
      .0001), almost threefold more patients with gallbladder cancer than controls (OR,
      2.71; 95% CI, 1.70-4.33). Among participants with detectable levels of
      AFB1-lysine, the median level of AFB1-lysine was 5.4 pg/mg in those with
      gallbladder cancer, compared with 1.2 pg/mg in controls. For patients in the
      fourth quartile of AFB1-lysine level vs the first quartile, the OR for
      gallbladder cancer was 7.61 (95% CI, 2.01-28.84). None of the 54 gallbladder
      tumors sequenced were found to have the R249S mutation in TP53. The
      population-attributable fraction for cancer related to aflatoxin was 20% (95% CI,
      15%-25%). CONCLUSIONS: In a case-control study of patients with gallbladder
      cancer and gallstones vs patients with gallstones without cancer, we associated
      exposure to aflatoxin (based on plasma level of AFB1-lysine) with gallbladder
      cancer. Gallbladder cancer does not appear associate with the R249S mutation in
      TP53. If aflatoxin is a cause of gallbladder cancer, it may have accounted for up
      to 20% of the gallbladder cancers in Shanghai, China, during the study period,
      and could account for an even higher proportion in high-risk areas. If our
      findings are verified, reducing aflatoxin exposure might reduce the incidence of 
      gallbladder cancer.

TI  - High-Quality Diets Associate With Reduced Risk of Colorectal Cancer: Analyses of 
      Diet Quality Indexes in the Multiethnic Cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Healthy eating patterns assessed by diet quality indexes
      (DQIs) have been related to lower risk of colorectal cancer-mostly among whites. 
      We investigated the associations between 4 DQI scores (the Healthy Eating Index
      2010 [HEI-2010], the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 [AHEI-2010], the
      alternate Mediterranean diet score [aMED], and the Dietary Approaches to Stop
      Hypertension score) and colorectal cancer risk in the Multiethnic Cohort.
      METHODS: We analyzed data from 190,949 African American, Native Hawaiian,
      Japanese American, Latino, and white individuals, 45 to 75 years old, who entered
      the Multiethnic Cohort study from 1993 through 1996. During an average 16 years
      of follow-up, 4770 invasive colorectal cancer cases were identified. RESULTS:
      Scores from all 4 DQIs associated inversely with colorectal cancer risk; higher
      scores associated with decreasing colorectal cancer risk (all P's for trend </=
      .003). Associations were not significant for AHEI-2010 and aMED scores in women
      after adjustment for covariates: for the highest vs lowest quintiles, the hazard 
      ratio for the HEI-2010 score in men was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.59-0.80) and in women was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.96); for the AHEI-2010 score the
      hazard ratio in men was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65-0.85) and in women was 0.90 (95% CI,
      0.78-1.04); for the aMED score the hazard ratio in men was 0.84 (95% CI,
      0.73-0.97) and in women was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.82-1.13); for the Dietary Approaches 
      to Stop Hypertension score the hazard ratio in men was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66-0.86)
      and in women was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-1.00). Associations were limited to the left 
      colon and rectum for all indexes. The inverse associations were less strong in
      African American individuals than in the other 4 racial/ethnic groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on an analysis of data from the Multiethnic Cohort Study,
      high-quality diets are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in most 
      racial/ethnic subgroups.

TI  - Colorectal Cancer Screening: Recommendations for Physicians and Patients From the
      U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of
      the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents
      the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological
      Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC
      screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and
      practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years and
      annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as
      the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, in a 
      sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be offered to 
      patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as tests of
      choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A risk-stratified
      approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations with an estimated
      low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening in high prevalence
      populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography every 5 years, the
      FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years.
      These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has disadvantages relative 
      to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and current obstacles to use,
      capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier test. We suggest that the
      Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not be used for screening.
      Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk persons, except in African
      Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening at 45 years. CRC incidence 
      is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough diagnostic evaluation of young
      persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is recommended. Discontinuation of
      screening should be considered when persons up to date with screening, who have
      prior negative screening (particularly colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have <10
      years of life expectancy. Persons without prior screening should be considered
      for screening up to age 85, depending on age and comorbidities. Persons with a
      family history of CRC or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative
      age <60 years or 2 first-degree relatives with these findings at any age are
      recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years
      before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40,
      whichever is earlier. Persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at
      >/=60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma can be offered average-risk screening
      options beginning at age 40 years.

AB  - For many years, only a small fraction of the human genome was believed to
      regulate cell function and development. This protein-coding portion composed only
      1% to 2% of 3 billion human DNA base pairs-the remaining sequence was classified 
      as junk DNA. Subsequent research has revealed that most of the genome is
      transcribed into a broad array of noncoding RNAs, ranging in size from microRNA
      (20-23 nucleotides) to long noncoding RNA (lncRNA, more than 200 nucleotides).
      These noncoding RNA classes have been shown to use diverse molecular mechanisms
      to control gene expression and organ system development. As anticipated,
      alterations in this large control system can contribute to disease pathogenesis
      and carcinogenesis. We review the involvement of noncoding RNAs, lncRNAs in
      particular, in development of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal carcinoma.

AB  - Safety issues associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently
      attracted widespread media and lay attention. Gastroenterologists are frequently 
      asked about the appropriateness of PPI therapy for specific patients.
      Furthermore, some patients may have had PPI therapy discontinued abruptly or
      inappropriately due to safety concerns. Faced with such a wide variety of
      potentially serious adverse consequences, prescribers need to evaluate the
      evidence objectively to discern the likelihood that any reported association
      might actually be causal. Here, we review many of the proposed adverse
      consequences of PPI therapy and apply established criteria for the determination 
      of causation. We also consider the potential contribution of residual confounding
      in many of the reported studies. Evidence is inadequate to establish causal
      relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations. Residual
      confounding related to study design and the overextrapolation of quantitatively
      small estimates of effect size have probably led to much of the current
      controversy about PPI safety. In turn, this has caused unnecessary concern among 
      patients and prescribers. The benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications
      need to be considered, along with the likelihood of the proposed risks. Patients 
      with a proven indication for a PPI should continue to receive it in the lowest
      effective dose. PPI dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in those
      unresponsive to initial empiric therapy is discouraged.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The quality of endoscopists' colonoscopy performance is
      measured by adenoma detection rate (ADR). Although ADR is associated inversely
      with interval colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer death, the effects of an
      increasing ADR have not been shown. We investigated whether increasing ADRs from 
      individual endoscopists is associated with reduced risks of interval colorectal
      cancer and subsequent death. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 
      individuals who underwent a screening colonoscopy within the National Colorectal 
      Cancer Screening Program in Poland, from January 1, 2004, through December 31,
      2008. We collected data from 146,860 colonoscopies performed by 294 endoscopists,
      with each endoscopist having participated at least twice in annual editions of
      primary colonoscopy screening. We used annual feedback and quality benchmark
      indicators to improve colonoscopy performance. We used ADR quintiles in the whole
      data set to categorize the annual ADRs for each endoscopist. An increased ADR was
      defined as an increase by at least 1 quintile category, or the maintenance of the
      highest category in subsequent screening years. Multivariate frailty models were 
      used to evaluate the effects of increased ADR on the risk of interval colorectal 
      cancer and death. RESULTS: Throughout the enrollment period, 219 endoscopists
      (74.5%) increased their annual ADR category. During 895,916 person-years of
      follow-up evaluation through the National Cancer Registry, we identified 168
      interval colorectal cancers and 44 interval cancer deaths. An increased ADR was
      associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for interval colorectal cancer of 0.63
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.88; P = .006), and for cancer death of 0.50
      (95% CI, 0.27-0.95; P = .035). Compared with no increase in ADR, reaching or
      maintaining the highest quintile ADR category (such as an ADR > 24.56%) decreased
      the adjusted hazard ratios for interval colorectal cancer to 0.27 (95% CI,
      0.12-0.63; P = .003), and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56; P = .003), respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of individuals who underwent screening
      colonoscopy within a National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program, we associated 
      increased ADR with a reduced risk of interval colorectal cancer and death.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Variants in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15
      gene (TNFSF15, also called TL1A) have been associated with risk for inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD). TL1A affects expression of multiple cytokines to promote
      mucosal inflammation. Little is known about the TL1A-response pathways that
      regulate cytokine expression. We investigated T-cell gene expression patterns to 
      determine the mechanisms by which TL1A regulates cytokine production, and whether
      these associate with outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS:
      Peripheral T cells isolated from normal donors were cultured with TL1A. We
      performed gene expression profile analysis by RNA sequencing of subsets of
      interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing and non-producing cells purified by flow
      cytometry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify
      gene expression differences between these subsets. Ribonuclease T2 gene (RNASET2)
      expression and methylation were assessed by quantitative trait loci analyses.
      Clinical characteristics of patients (complications, resistance to therapy, and
      recurrence time) were associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in RNASET2.
      We performed motif screening to identify polymorphisms that disrupt transcription
      factor binding sites. Levels of RNASET2 were knocked down with small interfering 
      RNA in CD4(+) T cells and the effect on protein expression was determined by
      proteomic analysis and cytokine production. Cell aggregation was measured by flow
      cytometry. RESULTS: We identified 764 genes with at least a 2-fold difference in 
      TL1A-mediated expression between IFNG-secreting and non-secreting T cells (P < 1 
      x 10(-5)). Many of these genes were located near IBD susceptibility variants.
      RNASET2 was the only IBD risk-associated gene with >5-fold down-regulation in the
      IFNG-secreting subset. RNASET2 disease risk variants were associated with
      decreased expression in peripheral and mucosal tissues and DNA hypermethylation
      in CD patients requiring surgical intervention. RNASET2 disease risk variants
      were associated in CD patients with more complicated disease or resistance to
      therapy, defined in part by failed response to treatment, increased length of
      intestinal resection, shorter time to repeat surgery, and high Rutgeerts score
      (>2) in postoperative endoscopy. The RNASET2 variant rs2149092 was predicted to
      disrupt a consensus binding site for the transcription factor ETS within an
      enhancer region. Expression of RNASET2 correlated with expression of ETS. RNASET2
      knockdown in T cells increased expression of IFNG and intercellular adhesion
      molecule 1 (ICAM1) and induced T-cell aggregation. A blocking antibody against
      (ILFA1), disrupting the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-intercellular
      adhesion molecule 1 interaction, reduced T-cell production of IFNG. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We identified decreased expression of RNASET2 as a component of TL1A-mediated
      increase in production of IFNG and as a potential biomarker for patients with
      severe CD. Further study of the role of RNASET2 in regulating mucosal
      inflammation may lead to development of novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - EGFR in Tumor-Associated Myeloid Cells Promotes Development of Colorectal Cancer 
      in Mice and Associates With Outcomes of Patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are 
      the first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal tumors without RAS
      mutations. However, EGFR inhibitors are ineffective in these patients, and tumor 
      level of EGFR does not associate with response to therapy. We screened human
      colorectal tumors for EGFR-positive myeloid cells and investigated their
      association with patient outcome. We also performed studies in mice to evaluate
      how EGFR expression in tumor cells and myeloid cells contributes to development
      of colitis-associated cancer and Apc(Min)-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis.
      METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses of 116
      colorectal tumor biopsies to determine levels of EGFR in tumor and stroma; we
      also collected information on tumor stage and patient features and outcomes. We
      used the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests to correlate tumor levels of
      EGFR with tumor stage, and the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate patients' median
      survival time. We performed experiments in mice lacking EGFR in intestinal
      epithelial cells (Villin-Cre; Egfr(f/f) and Villin-CreER(T2); Egfr(f/f) mice) or 
      myeloid cells (LysM-Cre; Egfr(f/f) mice) on a mixed background. These mice were
      bred with Apc(Min/+) mice; colitis-associated cancer and colitis were induced by 
      administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), with or without azoxymethane
      (AOM), respectively. Villin-CreER(T2) was activated in developed tumors by
      administration of tamoxifen to mice. Littermates that expressed full-length EGFR 
      were used as controls. Intestinal tissues were collected; severity of colitis,
      numbers and size of tumors, and intestinal barrier integrity were assessed by
      histologic, immunohistochemical, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction, and flow cytometry analyses. RESULTS: We detected EGFR in myeloid
      cells in the stroma of human colorectal tumors; myeloid cell expression of EGFR
      associated with tumor metastasis and shorter patient survival time. Mice with
      deletion of EGFR from myeloid cells formed significantly fewer and smaller tumors
      than the respective EGFR-expressing controls in an Apc(Min/+) background as well 
      as after administration of AOM and DSS. Deletion of EGFR from intestinal
      epithelial cells did not affect tumor growth. Furthermore, tamoxifen-induced
      deletion of EGFR from epithelial cells of established intestinal tumors in mice
      given AOM and DSS did not reduce tumor size. EGFR signaling in myeloid cells
      promoted activation of STAT3 and expression of survivin in intestinal tumor
      cells. Mice with deletion of EGFR from myeloid cells developed more severe
      colitis after DSS administration, characterized by increased intestinal
      inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption, than control mice or mice with
      deletion of EGFR from intestinal epithelial cells. EGFR-deficient myeloid cells
      in the colon of DSS-treated LysM-Cre; Egfr(f/f) mice had reduced expression of
      interleukin 6 (IL6), and epithelial STAT3 activation was reduced compared with
      controls. Administration of recombinant IL6 to LysM-Cre; Egfr(f/f) mice given DSS
      protected them from weight loss and restored epithelial proliferation and STAT3
      activation, compared with administration of DSS alone to these mice. CONCLUSIONS:
      Increased expression of EGFR in myeloid cells from the colorectal tumor stroma
      associates with tumor progression and reduced survival time of patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Deletion of EGFR from myeloid cells, but not
      intestinal epithelial cells, protects mice from colitis-induced intestinal cancer
      and ApcMin-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis. Myeloid cell expression of EGFR
      increases activation of STAT3 and expression of survivin in intestinal epithelial
      cells and expression of IL6 in colon tissues. These findings indicate that
      expression of EGFR by myeloid cells of the colorectal tumor stroma, rather than
      the cancer cells themselves, contributes to tumor development.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated whether patients with multiple serrated
      polyps, but not meeting the World Health Organization criteria for serrated
      polyposis syndrome, and their relatives have similar risks for colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) as those diagnosed with serrated polyposis. METHODS: We collected data from
      patients with more than 10 colonic polyps, recruited in 2008-2009 from 24
      hospitals in Spain for a study of causes of multiple colonic polyps. We analyzed 
      data from 53 patients who met the criteria for serrated polyposis and 145
      patients who did not meet these criteria, but who had more than 10 polyps
      throughout the colon, of which more than 50% were serrated. We calculated age-
      and sex-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for CRC in both groups, as 
      well as in their first-degree relatives. RESULTS: The prevalence of CRC was
      similar between patients with confirmed serrated polyposis and multiple serrated 
      polyps (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-2.82; P = .40). The 
      SIR for CRC in patients with serrated polyposis (0.51; 95% CI, 0.01-2.82) did not
      differ significantly from the SIR for CRC in patients with multiple serrated
      polyps (0.74; 95% CI, 0.20-1.90; P = .70). The SIR for CRC also did not differ
      significantly between first-degree relatives of these groups (serrated polyposis:
      3.28, 95% CI, 2.16-4.77; multiple serrated polyps: 2.79, 95% CI, 2.10-3.63; P =
      .50). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no differences in the incidence of CRC between
      groups during the follow-up period (log-rank, 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CRC 
      in patients with multiple serrated polyps who do not meet the criteria for
      serrated polyposis, and in their first-degree relatives, is similar to that of
      patients diagnosed with serrated polyposis.

AB  - In patients with Crohn's disease, perianal fistulas recur frequently, causing
      substantial morbidity. We performed a 12-patient, 6-month, phase 1 trial to
      determine whether autologous mesenchymal stem cells, applied in a bioabsorbable
      matrix, can heal the fistula. Fistula repair was not associated with any serious 
      adverse events related to mesenchymal stem cells or plug placement. At 6 months, 
      10 of 12 patients (83%) had complete clinical healing and radiographic markers of
      response. We found placement of mesenchymal stem cell-coated matrix fistula plugs
      in 12 patients with chronic perianal fistulas to be safe and lead to clinical
      healing and radiographic response in 10 patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Supplementation of Diet With Galacto-oligosaccharides Increases Bifidobacteria,
      but Not Insulin Sensitivity, in Obese Prediabetic Individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The gut microbiota affects host lipid and glucose metabolism, 
      satiety, and chronic low-grade inflammation to contribute to obesity and type 2
      diabetes. Fermentation end products, in particular the short-chain fatty acid
      (SCFA) acetate, are believed to be involved in these processes. We investigated
      the long-term effects of supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), an 
      acetogenic fiber, on the composition of the human gut microbiota and human
      metabolism. METHODS: We performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel 
      intervention study of 44 overweight or obese (body mass index, 28-40 kg/m(2))
      prediabetic men and women (ages, 45-70 y) from October 2014 through October 2015 
      in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The participants were assigned randomly to groups
      who ingested 15 g GOS or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin) daily with their
      regular meals for 12 weeks. Before and after this period, we collected data on
      peripheral and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition, 
      plasma and fecal SCFA, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation, body
      composition, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. The primary outcome was the
      effect of GOS on peripheral insulin sensitivity, measured by the
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method. RESULTS: Supplementation of diets with 
      GOS, but not placebo, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium species in feces
      by 5-fold (P = .009; q = 0.144). Microbial richness or diversity in fecal samples
      were not affected. We did not observe any differences in fecal or fasting plasma 
      SCFA concentrations or in systemic concentrations of gut-derived hormones,
      incretins, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, or other markers of inflammation. 
      In addition, no significant alterations in peripheral and adipose tissue insulin 
      sensitivity, body composition, and energy and substrate metabolism were found.
      CONCLUSIONS: Twelve-week supplementation of GOS selectively increased fecal
      Bifidobacterium species abundance, but this did not produce significant changes
      in insulin sensitivity or related substrate and energy metabolism in overweight
      or obese prediabetic men and women. ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT02271776.

TI  - Efficacy of 8 Weeks of Sofosbuvir, Velpatasvir, and Voxilaprevir in Patients With
      Chronic HCV Infection: 2 Phase 3 Randomized Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have
      high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of treatment with
      the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with the NS5A inhibitor
      velpatasvir. We assessed the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir and
      velpatasvir plus the pangenotypic NS3/4A protease inhibitor voxilaprevir
      (sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir). METHODS: In 2 phase 3, open-label trials, 
      patients with HCV infection who had not been treated previously with a
      direct-acting antiviral agent were assigned randomly to groups given
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 
      weeks. POLARIS-2, which enrolled patients infected with all HCV genotypes with or
      without cirrhosis, except patients with genotype 3 and cirrhosis, was designed to
      test the noninferiority of 8 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir to 12
      weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir using a noninferiority margin of 5%. POLARIS-3,
      which enrolled patients infected with HCV genotype 3 who had cirrhosis, compared 
      rates of SVR in both groups with a performance goal of 83%. RESULTS: In
      POLARIS-2, 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93%-97%) of patients had an SVR to 
      8 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir; this did not meet the criterion
      to establish noninferiority to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, which produced
      an SVR in 98% of patients (95% CI, 96%-99%; difference in the stratum-adjusted
      Mantel-Haenszel proportions of -3.2%; 95% CI, -6.0% to -0.4%). The difference in 
      the efficacy was owing primarily to a lower rate of SVR (92%) among patients with
      HCV genotype 1a infection receiving 8 weeks of
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir. In POLARIS-3, 96% of patients (95% CI,
      91%-99%) achieved an SVR in both treatment groups, which was significantly
      superior to the performance goal. Overall, the most common adverse events were
      headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea; diarrhea and nausea were reported more
      frequently by patients receiving voxilaprevir. In both trials, the proportion of 
      patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was low (range,
      0%-1%). CONCLUSIONS: In phase 3 trials of patients with HCV infection, we did not
      establish that sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir for 8 weeks was noninferior to
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for 12 weeks, but the 2 regimens had similar rates of SVR 
      in patients with HCV genotype 3 and cirrhosis. Mild gastrointestinal adverse
      events were associated with treatment regimens that included voxilaprevir.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Small nucleolar noncoding RNAs (snoRNAs) regulate function of 
      ribosomes, and specific snoRNAs are dysregulated in some cancer cells. We
      investigated dysregulation of snoRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
      cells. METHODS: We investigated snoRNA expression in PDAC cell lines by
      complementary DNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction. In PDAC (n = 133), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n =
      16), mucinous cystic neoplasm-associated PDAC (n = 1), and non-tumor pancreas (n 
      = 8) and liver (n = 3) tissues from subjects who underwent surgical resection,
      levels of snoRNA were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction and compared with clinicopathologic parameters and survival times 
      determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. To examine snoRNA function, PDAC cells were 
      transfected with snoRNA-antisense oligonucleotides flanked with amido-bridged
      nucleic acids, or snoRNA-expression plasmids, and analyzed in proliferation,
      colony formation, spheroid formation, and invasion assays. To identify
      snoRNA-related factors, cells were analyzed by gene expression and proteomic
      profiling and immunoblot assays. Mice were given intrasplenic injections of MIA
      PaCa2- or Suit2-HLMC cells; tumor-bearing nude mice were then given 3 weekly
      injections of an antisense oligonucleotides against SNORA23, a H/ACA-box type
      snoRNA, and tumor growth and metastasis to liver, blood, and pancreas were
      analyzed. RESULTS: Levels of SNORA23 increased and accumulated at the nucleolus
      in highly metastatic MIA PaCa2- or Suit2-HLMC cells compared with their parental 
      cells. We detected SNORA23 in human PDAC specimens but not in non-tumor
      pancreatic tissue. PDAC level of SNORA23 correlated with invasion grade and
      correlated inversely with disease-free survival time of patients. Expression of
      SNORA23 in PDAC cells increased their invasive activity and colony formation, and
      spheroid formation was inhibited by SNORA23 knockdown. In gene expression and
      proteomic profile analyses, we found SNORA23 to increase expression of spectrin
      repeat-containing nuclear envelope 2 (SYNE2) messenger RNA and protein. Knockdown
      of SYNE2 in PDAC cells reduced their invasive activities and anchor-independent
      survival. Administration of SNORA23 antisense oligonucleotides to mice slowed
      growth of xenograft tumors, tumor expression of SYNE2, tumor cell dissemination, 
      and metastasis to liver. CONCLUSIONS: We found expression of the snoRNA SNORA23, 
      which mediates sequence-specific pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNAs, to be
      increased in human PDAC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues, and levels to
      correlate with tumor invasion grade and patient survival time. SNORA23 increases 
      expression of SYNE2, possibly through modulation of ribosome biogenesis, to
      promote PDAC cell survival and invasion, and growth and metastasis of xenograft
      tumors in mice.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of MEDI2070, an Antibody Against Interleukin 23, in Patients 
      With Moderate to Severe Crohn's Disease: A Phase 2a Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: MEDI2070 is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively
      inhibits interleukin 23 (IL23), a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of
      Crohn's disease (CD). We analyzed its safety and efficacy in treatment of CD in a
      phase 2a study. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      119 adults with moderate to severe CD failed by treatment with tumor necrosis
      factor antagonists. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given
      MEDI2070 (700 mg) or placebo intravenously at weeks 0 and 4. Patients received
      open-label MEDI2070 (210 mg) subcutaneously every 4 weeks from weeks 12 to 112.
      The CD Activity Index was used to measure disease activity. RESULTS: The primary 
      outcome, clinical response (either a 100-point decrease in CD Activity Index
      score from baseline or clinical remission, defined as CD Activity Index score
      <150) at week 8 occurred in 49.2% of patients receiving MEDI2070 (n = 59)
      compared with 26.7% receiving placebo (n = 60; absolute difference, 22.5%; 95%
      confidence interval, 5.6%-39.5%; P = .010). Clinical response at week 24 occurred
      in 53.8% of patients who continued to receive open-label MEDI2070 and in 57.7% of
      patients who had received placebo during the double-blind period and open-label
      MEDI2070 thereafter. The most common adverse events were headache and
      nasopharyngitis. Higher baseline serum concentrations of IL22, a cytokine whose
      expression is induced by IL23, were associated with greater likelihood of
      response to MEDI2070 compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2a trial of
      patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who had failed treatment with
      tumor necrosis factor antagonists, 8 and 24 weeks of treatment with MEDI2070 were
      associated with clinical improvement. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01714726.

      Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Increases Their Motility, via Expression of

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fibroblasts that interact with cancer cells are called
      cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote progression of different
      tumor types. We investigated the characteristics and functions of CAFs in
      diffuse-type gastric cancers (DGCs) by analyzing features of their genome and
      gene expression patterns. METHODS: We isolated CAFs and adjacent non-cancer
      fibroblasts (NFs) from 110 gastric cancer (GC) tissues from patients who
      underwent gastrectomy in Japan from 2008 through 2016. Cells were identified
      using specific markers of various cell types by immunoblot and flow cytometry. We
      selected pairs of CAFs and NFs for whole-exome and RNA sequencing analyses, and
      compared expression of specific genes using quantitative reverse transcription
      PCR. Protein levels and phosphorylation were compared by immunoblot and
      immunofluorescence analyses. Rhomboid 5 homolog 2 (RHBDF2) was overexpressed from
      a transgene in fibroblasts or knocked down using small interfering RNAs. Motility
      and invasiveness of isolated fibroblasts and GC cell lines (AGS, KATOIII, MKN45, 
      NUGC3, NUGC4, OCUM-2MD3 and OCUM-12 cell lines) were quantified by real-time
      imaging analyses. We analyzed 7 independent sets of DNA microarray data from
      patients with GC and associated expression levels of specific genes with patient 
      survival times. Nude mice were given injections of OCUM-2MD3 in the stomach wall;
      tumors and metastases were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
      RESULTS: Many of the genes with increased expression in CAFs compared with NFs
      were associated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) activity. When
      CAFs were cultured in extracellular matrix, they became more motile than NFs; DGC
      cells incubated with CAFs were also more motile and invasive in vitro than DGC
      cells not incubated with CAFs. When injected into nude mice, CAF-incubated DGC
      cells invaded a greater number of lymphatic vessels than NF-incubated DGC cells. 
      We identified RHBDF2 as a gene overexpressed in CAFs compared with NFs. Knockdown
      of RHBDF2 in CAFs reduced their elongation and motility in response to TGFB1,
      whereas overexpression of RHBDF2 in NFs increased their motility in extracellular
      matrix. RHBDF2 appeared to regulate oncogenic and non-canonical TGFB1 signaling. 
      Knockdown of RHBDF2 in CAFs reduced cleavage of the TGFB receptor 1 (TGFBR1) by
      ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17 or TACE) and reduced expression of genes 
      that regulate motility. Incubation of NFs with in interleukin 1 alpha (IL1A),
      IL1B or tumor necrosis factor, secreted by DGCs, increased fibroblast expression 
      of RHBDF2. Simultaneous high expression of these cytokines in GC samples was
      associated with shorter survival times of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In CAFs isolated
      from human DGCs, we observed increased expression of RHBDF2, which regulates
      TGFB1 signaling. Expression of RHBDF2 in fibroblasts is induced by inflammatory
      cytokines (such as IL1A, IL1B, and tumor necrosis factor) secreted by DGCs.
      RHBDF2 promotes cleavage of TGFBR1 by activating TACE and motility of CAFs in
      response to TGFB1. These highly motile CAFs induce DGCs to invade extracellular
      matrix and lymphatic vessels in nude mice.

TI  - SPDEF Induces Quiescence of Colorectal Cancer Cells by Changing the
      Transcriptional Targets of beta-catenin.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway activates the
      transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. This pathway is often activated in
      colorectal cancer cells, but strategies to block it in tumors have not been
      effective. The SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF)
      suppresses formation of colon tumors by unclear mechanisms. We investigated these
      mechanisms and the effects of SPDEF on beta-catenin activity in mouse models of
      colorectal cancer (CRC), CRC cell lines, and mouse and human normal and cancer
      colonoids. METHODS: We performed studies of Lgr5(CreERT2); beta-catenin(exon3);
      Rosa26(LSL-rtta-ires-EGFP); TRE-Spdef mice, which express an oncogenic form of
      beta-catenin in Lgr5-positive ISCs upon administration of tamoxifen and SPDEF
      upon administration of tetracycline. CRC lines (HCT116 and SW480) were engineered
      to express inducible tagged SPDEF or vector (control) and subcutaneously injected
      into immunodeficient NSG mice. We generated SPDEF-inducible human colonoids,
      including a line derived from normal rectal mucosa (control) and an
      adenocarcinoma line derived from a patient with germline MUTYH mutation.
      Full-length and truncated forms of SPDEF were expressed in CRC cells; cells were 
      assayed for beta-catenin activity and studied in immunoprecipitation and
      chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: Expression of SPDEF was sufficient
      to inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis by activated beta-catenin, block tumor cell
      proliferation, and restrict growth of established tumors. In tumor cells with
      activated beta -catenin, expression of SPDEF induced a quiescent state, which was
      reversed when SPDEF expression was stopped. In mouse and human normal and
      tumor-derived enteroids/colonoids, those that expressed SPDEF for 3 days were
      significantly smaller. SPDEF inhibited the transcriptional activity of
      beta-catenin via a protein-protein interaction, independent of SPDEF DNA binding 
      capacity. SPDEF disrupted beta-catenin binding to TCF1 and TCF3, displacing
      beta-catenin from enhancer regions of genes that regulate the cell cycle but not 
      genes that regulate stem cell activities. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of mice and
      human CRC, we found that SPDEF induces a quiescent state in CRC cells by
      disrupting binding of beta-catenin to TCF1 and TCF3 and regulation of genes that 
      control the cell cycle. In this model, beta-catenin activity determines the
      proliferation or quiescence of CRC cells based on the absence or presence of
      SPDEF.

AB  - We investigated how many patients with a diagnosis of nonceliac wheat sensitivity
      (NCWS) still experienced wheat sensitivity after a median follow-up time of 99
      months. We collected data from 200 participants from a previous study of NCWS,
      performed between July and December 2016 in Italy; 148 of these individuals were 
      still on a strict wheat-free diet. In total, 175 patients (88%) improved (had
      fewer symptoms) after a diagnosis of NCWS; 145 of 148 patients who adhered
      strictly to a gluten-free diet (98%) had reduced symptoms, compared with 30 of 52
      patients who did not adhere to a gluten-free diet (58%) (P < .0001). Of the 22
      patients who repeated the double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge, 20 reacted 
      to wheat. We conclude that NCWS is a persistent condition. Clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common
      subtype of esophageal cancer. Little is known about the genetic changes that
      occur in esophageal cells during the development of ESCC. We performed
      next-generation sequence analyses of esophageal nontumor, intraepithelial
      neoplasia (IEN), and ESCC tissues from the same patients to track genetic changes
      during tumor development. METHODS: We performed whole-genome, whole-exome, or
      targeted sequence analyses of 227 esophageal tissue samples from 70 patients with
      ESCC undergoing resection at Shantou University Medical College in China from
      2012 through 2015 (no patients had received chemotherapy or radiation therapy);
      we analyzed normal tissues, tissues with simple hyperplasia, dysplastic tissues
      (IEN), and ESCC tissues collected from different regions of the esophagus at the 
      same time. We also obtained 1191 nontumor esophageal biopsy specimens from the
      Chaoshan region (a high-risk region for ESCC) of China (a high-risk region for
      ESCC) and performed immunohistochemical and histologic analyses to detect
      inflammation. RESULTS: IEN and ESCC tissues had similar mutations and copy number
      alterations, at similar frequencies; these differed from mutations detected in
      tissues with simple hyperplasia. IEN tissues had mutations associated with
      apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme, catalytic
      polypeptide-like-mediated mutagenesis (a DNA damage mutational signature).
      Genetic analyses indicated that most ESCCs were formed from early stage IEN
      clones. Trunk mutations (mutations shared by >10% of paired IEN and ESCC tissues)
      were in genes that regulate DNA repair and cell apoptosis, proliferation and
      adhesion. Mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A and copy number alterations in 11q
      (contains CCND1), 3q (contains SOX2), 2q (contains NFE2L2), and 9p (contains
      CDKN2A) were considered to be trunk variants; these were dominant mutations
      detected at high frequencies in clones of paired IEN and ESCC samples. In the
      esophageal biopsy samples from high-risk individuals (residing in the Chaoshan
      region), 68.9% had an evidence of chronic inflammation; the level of inflammation
      was correlated with atypical cell structures and markers of DNA damage.
      CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed mutations and gene copy number changes in nontumor, IEN,
      and ESCC samples, collected from 70 patients. IEN and ESCCs each had similar
      mutations and markers of genomic instability, including apolipoprotein B
      messenger RNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like. Genomic changes
      observed in precancerous lesions might be used to identify patients at risk for
      ESCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary exposure to aflatoxin is an important risk factor for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the genomic
      features and mutations of aflatoxin-associated HCCs compared with HCCs not
      associated with aflatoxin exposure. We investigated the genetic features of
      aflatoxin-associated HCC that can be used to differentiate them from HCCs not
      associated with this carcinogen. METHODS: We obtained HCC tumor tissues and
      matched non-tumor liver tissues from 49 patients, collected from 1990 through
      2016, at the Qidong Liver Cancer Hospital Institute in China-a high-risk region
      for aflatoxin exposure (38.2% of food samples test positive for aflatoxin
      contamination). Somatic variants were identified using GATK Best Practices
      Pipeline. We validated part of the mutations from whole-genome sequencing and
      whole-exome sequencing by Sanger sequencing. We also analyzed genomes of 1072
      HCCs, obtained from 5 datasets from China, the United States, France, and Japan. 
      Mutations in 49 aflatoxin-associated HCCs and 1072 HCCs from other regions were
      analyzed using the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute mutational signatures
      framework with non-negative matrix factorization. The mutation landscape and
      mutational signatures from the aflatoxin-associated HCC and HCC samples from
      general population were compared. We identified genetic features of
      aflatoxin-associated HCC, and used these to identify aflatoxin-associated HCCs in
      datasets from other regions. Tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry 
      to determine microvessel density and levels of CD34 and CD274 (PD-L1). RESULTS:
      Aflatoxin-associated HCCs frequently contained C>A transversions, the sequence
      motif GCN, and strand bias. In addition to previously reported mutations in TP53,
      we found frequent mutations in the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B1 gene
      (ADGRB1), which were associated with increased capillary density of tumor tissue.
      Aflatoxin-associated HCC tissues contained high-level potential
      mutation-associated neoantigens, and many infiltrating lymphocytes and tumors
      cells that expressed PD-L1, compared to HCCs not associated with aflatoxin. Of
      the HCCs from China, 9.8% contained the aflatoxin-associated genetic features,
      whereas 0.4%-3.5% of HCCs from other regions contained these genetic features.
      CONCLUSIONS: We identified specific genetic and mutation features of HCCs
      associated with aflatoxin exposure, including mutations in ADGRB1, compared to
      HCCs from general populations. We associated these mutations with increased
      vascularization and expression of PD-L1 in HCC tissues. These findings might be
      used to identify patients with HCC due to aflatoxin exposure, and select
      therapies.

      Reduce Fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is growing interest in the use of bone marrow cells to
      treat liver fibrosis, however, little is known about their antifibrotic efficacy 
      or the identity of their effector cell(s). Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) mediates
      egress of immune cells from the lymphoid organs into the lymphatic vessels; we
      investigated its role in the response of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to liver
      fibrosis in mice. METHODS: Purified (c-kit+/sca1+/lin-) HSCs were infused
      repeatedly into mice undergoing fibrotic liver injury. Chronic liver injury was
      induced in BoyJ mice by injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or placement on 
      a methionine-choline-deficient diet. Some mice were irradiated and given
      transplants of bone marrow cells from C57BL6 mice, with or without the S1P
      antagonist FTY720; we then studied HSC mobilization and localization. Migration
      of HSC lines was quantified in Transwell assays. Levels of S1P in liver, bone
      marrow, and lymph fluid were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
      Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemical quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction and sphingosine kinase activity assays. We performed
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of the expression of sphingosine 
      kinase 1 and 2, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, and sphingosine-1-phosphate
      phosphatase 1 in normal human liver and cirrhotic liver from patients with
      alcohol-related liver disease (n = 6). RESULTS: Infusions of HSCs into mice with 
      liver injury reduced liver scarring based on picrosirius red staining (49.7%
      reduction in mice given HSCs vs control mice; P < .001), and hepatic
      hydroxyproline content (328 mg/g in mice given HSCs vs 428 mg/g in control mice; 
      P < .01). HSC infusion also reduced hepatic expression of alpha-smooth muscle
      actin (0.19 +/- 0.007-fold compared with controls; P < .0001) and collagen type I
      alpha 1 chain (0.29 +/- 0.17-fold compared with controls; P < .0001). These
      antifibrotic effects were maintained with infusion of lymphoid progenitors that
      lack myeloid potential and were associated with increased numbers of recipient
      neutrophils and macrophages in liver. In studies of HSC cell lines, we found HSCs
      to recruit monocytes, and this process to require C-C motif chemokine receptor 2.
      In fibrotic liver tissue from mice and patients, hepatic S1P levels increased
      owing to increased hepatic sphingosine kinase-1 expression, which contributed to 
      a reduced liver:lymph S1P gradient and limited HSC egress from the liver. Mice
      given the S1P antagonist (FTY720) with HSCs had increased hepatic retention of
      HSCs (1697 +/- 247 cells in mice given FTY720 vs 982 +/- 110 cells in controls; P
      < .05), and further reductions in fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of mice with 
      chronic liver injury, we showed the antifibrotic effects of repeated infusions of
      purified HSCs. We found that HSCs promote recruitment of endogenous macrophages
      and neutrophils. Strategies to reduce SIP signaling and increase retention of
      HSCs in the liver could increase their antifibrotic activities and be developed
      for treatment of patients with liver fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with acute liver failure (ALF) have defects in innate
      immune responses to microbes (immune paresis) and are susceptible to sepsis.
      Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), which interacts with the
      membrane receptor B7 (also called CD80 and CD86), is a negative regulator of
      T-cell activation. We collected T cells from patients with ALF and investigated
      whether inhibitory signals down-regulate adaptive immune responses in patients
      with ALF. METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients 
      with ALF and controls from September 2013 through September 2015 (45 patients
      with ALF, 20 patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, 15 patients with
      cirrhosis with no evidence of acute decompensation, 20 patients with septic shock
      but no cirrhosis or liver disease, and 20 healthy individuals). Circulating
      CD4(+) T cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4(+) T cells were 
      incubated with antigen, or agonist to CD3 and dendritic cells, with or without
      antibody against CTLA4; T-cell proliferation and protein expression were
      quantified. We measured levels of soluble B7 molecules in supernatants of
      isolated primary hepatocytes, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, and biliary
      epithelial cells from healthy or diseased liver tissues. We also measured levels 
      of soluble B7 serum samples from patients and controls, and mice with
      acetaminophen-induced liver injury using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
      RESULTS: Peripheral blood samples from patients with ALF had a higher proportion 
      of CD4(+) CTLA4(+) T cells than controls; patients with infections had the
      highest proportions. CD4(+) T cells from patients with ALF had a reduced
      proliferative response to antigen or CD3 stimulation compared to cells from
      controls; incubation of CD4(+) T cells from patients with ALF with an antibody
      against CTLA4 increased their proliferative response to antigen and to CD3
      stimulation, to the same levels as cells from controls. CD4(+) T cells from
      controls up-regulated expression of CTLA4 after 24-48 hours culture with sera
      from patients with ALF; these sera were found to have increased concentrations of
      soluble B7 compared to sera from controls. Necrotic human primary hepatocytes
      exposed to acetaminophen, but not hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and
      biliary epithelial cells from patients with ALF, secreted high levels of soluble 
      B7. Sera from mice with acetaminophen-induced liver injury contained high levels 
      of soluble B7 compared to sera from mice without liver injury. Plasma exchange
      reduced circulating levels of soluble B7 in patients with ALF and expression of
      CTLA4 on T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral CD4(+) T cells from patients with ALF
      have increased expression of CTLA4 compared to individuals without ALF; these
      cells have a reduced response to antigen and CD3 stimulation. We found sera of
      patients with ALF and from mice with liver injury to have high concentrations of 
      soluble B7, which up-regulates CTLA4 expression by T cells and reduces their
      response to antigen. Plasma exchange reduces levels of B7 in sera from patients
      with ALF and might be used to restore antimicrobial responses to patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Neural stem and progenitor cells from the enteric nervous
      system (ENS) might serve as a source of cells for treatment of
      neurogastrointestinal disorders. Before we can use these cells, we must increase 
      our understanding of the signaling mechanisms that regulate proliferation and
      differentiation. We systematically evaluated the effects of canonical Wnt
      signaling on proliferation and differentiation of cultured ENS progenitor cells
      from neonatal mice and humans. METHODS: We isolated ENS progenitors from tunica
      muscularis of the small intestine of newborn (postnatal day 0) wild-type C57BL/6 
      mice as well as from Wnt1-Cre2 reporter mice. We also obtained intestinal tissue 
      samples from infants (2 and 7 months old) undergoing surgery for imperforate anus
      or focal intestinal perforation and isolated ENS cells. ENS cells were cultured
      under proliferation conditions leading to formation of 3-dimensional spheres,
      which we activated with Wnt3a and SB216763 in order to activate the
      beta-catenin-dependent canonical Wnt pathway. We used immunoblot and quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the molecular response to Wnt stimuli and
      immunohistochemistry, proliferation, and cell death assays to identify new
      neurons. RESULTS: In proliferating enterospheres derived from ENS progenitor
      cells, we verified the expression of Wnt receptors frizzled 1-10 and the
      co-receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6.
      Pharmacologic stimulation with Wnt agonists led to intracellular accumulation of 
      Wnt-dependent beta-catenin and up-regulated expression of known Wnt target genes 
      axin2, lef1, and lgr5. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway promoted growth of
      ENS cell spheres during cell expansion and increased the number of newborn
      neurons derived from mouse and human progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of
      human and mouse ENS progenitors, we found activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
      to promote neurogenesis of the ENS in vitro. The neurogenic effect of Wnt
      agonists on ENS progenitors supports their use in generation of cell pools for
      autologous cell replacement therapies.

TI  - Correction of Hirschsprung-Associated Mutations in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem
      Cells Via Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas9,
      Restores Neural Crest Cell Function.
PG  - 139-153.e8

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hirschsprung disease is caused by failure of enteric neural
      crest cells (ENCCs) to fully colonize the bowel, leading to bowel obstruction and
      megacolon. Heterozygous mutations in the coding region of the RET gene cause a
      severe form of Hirschsprung disease (total colonic aganglionosis). However, 80%
      of HSCR patients have short-segment Hirschsprung disease (S-HSCR), which has not 
      been associated with genetic factors. We sought to identify mutations associated 
      with S-HSCR, and used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
      repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing system to determine how mutations affect ENCC 
      function. METHODS: We created induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 1
      patient with total colonic aganglionosis (with the G731del mutation in RET) and
      from 2 patients with S-HSCR (without a RET mutation), as well as RET(+/-) and
      RET(-/-) iPSCs. IMR90-iPSC cells were used as the control cell line. Migration
      and differentiation capacities of iPSC-derived ENCCs were analyzed in
      differentiation and migration assays. We searched for mutation(s) associated with
      S-HSCR by combining genetic and transcriptome data from patient blood- and
      iPSC-derived ENCCs, respectively. Mutations in the iPSCs were corrected using the
      CRISPR/Cas9 system. RESULTS: ENCCs derived from all iPSC lines, but not control
      iPSCs, had defects in migration and neuronal lineage differentiation. RET
      mutations were associated with differentiation and migration defects of ENCCs in 
      vitro. Genetic and transcriptome analyses associated a mutation in the vinculin
      gene (VCL M209L) with S-HSCR. CRISPR/Cas9 correction of the RET G731del and VCL
      M209L mutations in iPSCs restored the differentiation and migration capacities of
      ENCCs. CONCLUSIONS: We identified mutations in VCL associated with S-HSCR.
      Correction of this mutation in iPSC using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, as well as the RET
      G731del mutation that causes Hirschsprung disease with total colonic
      aganglionosis, restored ENCC function. Our study demonstrates how human iPSCs can
      be used to identify disease-associated mutations and determine how they affect
      cell functions and contribute to pathogenesis.

TI  - Activation of Epithelial Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 by
      Interleukin 28 Controls Mucosal Healing in Mice With Colitis and Is Increased in 
      Mucosa of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the roles of interleukin 28A (also called
      IL28A or interferon lambda2) in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) activation,
      studying its effects in mouse models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and
      intestinal mucosal healing. METHODS: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6JCrl mice
      (controls), mice with IEC-specific disruption of Stat1 (Stat1IEC-KO), mice with
      disruption of the interferon lambda receptor 1 gene (Il28ra(-/-)), and mice with 
      disruption of the interferon regulatory factor 3 gene (Irf3(-/-)), with or
      without disruption of Irf7 (Irf7(-/-)). We used high-resolution mini-endoscopy
      and in vivo imaging methods to assess colitis progression. We used 3-dimensional 
      small intestine and colon organoids, along with RNA-Seq and gene ontology
      methods, to characterize the effects of IL28 on primary IECs. We studied the
      effects of IL28 on the human intestinal cancer cell line Caco-2 in a
      wound-healing assay, and in mice colon wounds. Colonic biopsies and resected
      tissue from patients with IBD (n = 62) and patients without colon inflammation
      (controls, n = 23) were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain rection to
      measure expression of IL28A, IL28RA, and other related cytokines; biopsy samples 
      were also analyzed by immunofluorescence to identify sources of IL28 production. 
      IECs were isolated from patient tissues and incubated with IL28; signal
      transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation was measured 
      by immunoblots and confocal imaging. RESULTS: Lamina propria cells in colon
      tissues of patients with IBD, and mice with colitis, had increased expression of 
      IL28 compared with controls; levels of IL28R were increased in the colonic
      epithelium of patients with IBD and mice with colitis. Administration of IL28
      induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in primary human and mouse IECs, increasing with
      dose. Il28ra(-/-), Irf3(-/-), Irf3(-/-)Irf7(-/-), as well as Stat1IEC-KO mice,
      developed more severe colitis after administration of dextran sulfate sodium than
      control mice, with reduced epithelial restitution. Il28ra(-/-) and Stat1IEC-KO
      mice also developed more severe colitis in response to oxazolone than control
      mice. We found IL28 to induce phosphorylation (activation) of STAT1 in epithelial
      cells, leading to their proliferation in organoid culture. Administration of IL28
      to mice with induced colonic wounds promoted mucosal healing. CONCLUSIONS: IL28
      controls proliferation of IECs in mice with colitis and accelerates mucosal
      healing by activating STAT1. IL28 might be developed as a therapeutic agent for
      patients with IBD.

TI  - Increased Serotonin Signaling Contributes to the Warburg Effect in Pancreatic
      Tumor Cells Under Metabolic Stress and Promotes Growth of Pancreatic Tumors in
      Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Desmoplasia and poor vascularity cause severe metabolic stress
      in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Serotonin (5-HT) is a
      neuromodulator with neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine functions that
      contributes to tumorigenesis. We investigated the role of 5-HT signaling in the
      growth of pancreatic tumors. METHODS: We measured the levels of proteins that
      regulate 5-HT synthesis, packaging, and degradation in pancreata from
      Kras(G12D/+)/Trp53(R172H/+)/Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice, which develop pancreatic tumors,
      as well as in PDAC cell lines and a tissue microarray containing 81 human PDAC
      samples. We also analyzed expression levels of proteins involved in 5-HT
      synthesis and degradation by immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray 
      containing 311 PDAC specimens, and associated expression levels with patient
      survival times. 5-HT level in 14 matched PDAC tumor and non-tumor tissues were
      analyzed by ELISA. PDAC cell lines were incubated with 5-HT and cell survival and
      apoptosis were measured. We analyzed expression of the 5-HT receptor HTR2B in
      PDAC cells and effects of receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as HTR2B
      knockdown with small hairpin RNAs. We determined the effects of 5-HT stimulation 
      on gene expression profiles of BxPC-3 cells. Regulation of glycolysis by 5-HT
      signaling via HTR2B was assessed by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation
      analyses, as well as by determination of the extracellular acid ratio, glucose
      consumption, and lactate production. Primary PDACs, with or without exposure to
      SB204741 (a selective antagonist of HTR2B), were grown as xenograft tumors in
      mice, and SB204741 was administered to tumor-bearing KPC mice; tumor growth and
      metabolism were measured by imaging analyses. RESULTS: In immunohistochemical
      analysis of a tissue microarray of PDAC specimens, increased levels of TPH1 and
      decreased level of MAOA, which regulate 5-HT synthesis and degradation,
      correlated with stage and size of PDACs and shorter patient survival time. We
      found levels of 5-HT to be increased in human PDAC tissues compared with
      non-tumor pancreatic tissues, and PDAC cell lines compared with non-transformed
      pancreatic cells. Incubation of PDAC cell lines with 5-HT increased proliferation
      and prevented apoptosis. Agonists of HTR2B, but not other 5-HT receptors,
      promoted proliferation and prevented apoptosis of PDAC cells. Knockdown of HTR2B 
      in PDAC cells, or incubation of cells with HTR2B inhibitors, reduced their growth
      as xenograft tumors in mice. We observed a correlation between 5-HT and
      glycolytic flux in PDAC cells; levels of metabolic enzymes involved in
      glycolysis, the phosphate pentose pathway, and hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
      increased significantly in PDAC cells following 5-HT stimulation. 5-HT
      stimulation led to formation of the HTR2B-LYN-p85 complex, which increased
      PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the Warburg effect by increasing protein levels of
      MYC and HIF1A. Administration of SB204741 to KPC mice slowed growth and
      metabolism of established pancreatic tumors and prolonged survival of the mice.
      CONCLUSIONS: Human PDACs have increased levels of 5-HT, and PDAC cells increase
      expression of its receptor, HTR2B. These increases allow for tumor glycolysis
      under metabolic stress and promote growth of pancreatic tumors and PDAC xenograft
      tumors in mice.

AB  - Circulating mixed cryoglobulins are detected in 40%-60% of patients with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and overt cryoglobulinemia vasculitis
      (CryoVas) develops in approximately 15% of patients. Remission of vasculitis has 
      been associated with viral clearance, but few studies have reported the
      effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral drugs in these patients. We performed an
      open-label, prospective, multicenter study of the effectiveness and tolerance of 
      an all-oral, interferon- and ribavirin-free regimen of sofosbuvir plus
      daclatasvir in patients with HCV-associated CryoVas. Forty-one consecutive
      patients with active HCV-associated CryoVas (median age, 56 y; 53.6% women) were 
      recruited from hospitals in Paris, France, from 2014 through 2016. They received 
      sofosbuvir (400 mg/day) plus daclatasvir (60 mg/day) for 12 weeks (n = 32) or 24 
      weeks (n = 9), and were evaluated every 4 weeks until week 24 and at week 36.
      Blood samples were analyzed for complete blood count, serum chemistry profile,
      level of alanine aminotransferase, rheumatoid factor activity, C4 fraction of
      complement, and cryoglobulin; peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
      for flow cytometry analysis. Thirty-seven patients (90.2%) had a complete
      clinical response (defined by improvement of all the affected organs involved at 
      baseline and no clinical relapse) after a median time of 12 weeks of therapy; all
      had a sustained virologic response (no detectable serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after
      the end of antiviral therapy). Patients' mean cryoglobulin level decreased from
      0.56 +/- 0.18 at baseline to 0.21 +/- 0.14 g/L at week 36, and no cryoglobulin
      was detected in 50% of patients at this time point. After antiviral therapy,
      patients had increased numbers of T-regulatory cells, IgM+CD21-/low-memory B
      cells, CD4+CXCR5+ interleukin 21+ cells, and T-helper 17 cells, compared with
      before therapy. After a median follow-up period of 26 months (interquartile
      range, 20-30 mo), no patients had a serious adverse event or relapse of
      vasculitis.

TI  - Using a 3% Proton Density Fat Fraction as a Cut-Off Value Increases Sensitivity
      of Detection of Hepatic Steatosis, Based on Results From Histopathology Analysis.

AB  - It is possible to estimate hepatic triglyceride content by calculating the proton
      density fat fraction (PDFF), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      ((1)H-MRS), instead of collecting and analyzing liver biopsy specimens to detect 
      steatosis. However, the current PDFF cut-off value (5%) used to define steatosis 
      by magnetic resonance was derived from studies that did not use histopathology as
      the reference standard. We performed a prospective study to determine the
      accuracy of (1)H-MRS PDFF in the measurement of steatosis using histopathology
      analysis as the standard. We collected clinical, serologic, (1)H-MRS PDFF, and
      liver biopsy data from 94 adult patients with increased levels of liver enzymes
      (>/=6 mo) referred to the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at
      Linkoping University Hospital in Sweden from 2007 through 2014. Steatosis was
      graded using the conventional histopathology method and fat content was
      quantified in biopsy samples using stereologic point counts (SPCs). We correlated
      the (1)H-MRS PDFF findings with SPCs (r = 0.92; P < .001). (1)H-MRS PDFF results 
      correlated with histopathology results (rho = 0.87; P < .001), and SPCs
      correlated with histopathology results (rho = 0.88; P < .001). All 25 subjects
      with PDFF values of 5.0% or more had steatosis based on histopathology findings
      (100% specificity for PDFF). However, of 69 subjects with PDFF values less than
      5.0% (negative result), 22 were determined to have steatosis based on
      histopathology findings (53% sensitivity for PDFF). Reducing the PDFF cut-off
      value to 3.0% identified patients with steatosis with 100% specificity and 79%
      sensitivity; a PDFF cut-off value of 2.0% identified patients with steatosis with
      94% specificity and 87% sensitivity. These findings might be used to improve
      noninvasive detection of steatosis.

TI  - Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells and Xenograft Tumors Exposed to Erb-b2 Receptor
      Tyrosine Kinase 2 and 3 Inhibitors Activate Transforming Growth Factor Beta
      Signaling, Which Induces Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition.
PG  - 63-76.e14

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Drugs that inhibit the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2
      (ERBB2 or HER2) are the standard treatment of patients with different types of
      cancer, including HER2-overexpressing gastroesophageal tumors. Unfortunately,
      cancer cells become resistant to these drugs, so overall these drugs provide
      little benefit to patients with these tumors. We investigated mechanisms that
      mediate resistance of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cells and patient-derived
      xenograft tumors to ERBB inhibitors. METHODS: We cultured primary tumor cells,
      isolated from EAC patient samples, and OE19 and OE33 EAC cell lines with
      trastuzumab (an inhibitor of HER2), with or without pertuzumab (which inhibits
      dimerization of HER2 with HER3) or a specific antibody against HER3 (anti-HER3). 
      HER2 was knocked down by expression of small hairpin RNAs. In addition, cells
      were incubated with NRG1-beta, a mediator of HER2-HER3 signaling, or A83-01, an
      inhibitor of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling. Cells were
      analyzed for markers of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) using flow
      cytometry, immunofluorescence, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction. We performed limiting dilution, transwell, and cell viability
      assays to study the functional effects of HER2 and HER3 inhibition and
      reactivation. We analyzed publicly available EAC gene expression datasets to
      correlate expression of ERBB genes with genes encoding epithelial and mesenchymal
      proteins. NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) mice were given subcutaneous 
      injections of AMC-EAC-007B cells and also given injections of single or combined 
      inhibitors; growth of these patient-derived xenograft tumors was quantified.
      RESULTS: EAC cells incubated with trastuzumab decreased expression of epithelial 
      markers (CD24, CD29, and CDH1) and increased expression of mesenchymal markers
      (CXCR4, VIM, ZEB1, SNAI2, and CDH2), compared with cells not exposed to
      trastuzumab, indicating induction of EMT. Addition of NRG1-beta to these cells
      restored their epithelial phenotype. Incubation of EAC cells with trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab accelerated the expression of EMT markers, compared with cells
      incubated with trastuzumab alone. EAC cells cultured for 2 months with a
      combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab became resistant to chemotherapeutic
      agents (5-fluoruracil, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, and paclitaxel), based
      on their continued viability, which was accompanied with an enhanced migratory
      capacity in transwell assays and clonogenicity in limiting dilution analyses. In 
      comparisons of EAC gene expression patterns, we associated high expression of
      ERBB3 with an epithelial gene expression signature; expression of TGFbeta
      correlated with expression of EMT-related genes, and we found an inverse
      correlation between expression of TGFB1 and ERBB3. EAC cells incubated with ERBB 
      inhibitors began to secrete ligands for the TGFbeta receptor and underwent EMT.
      Incubation of EAC cells with trastuzumab, followed by 10 days of incubation with 
      the TGFbeta receptor inhibitor in the presence of trastuzumab, caused cells to
      regain an epithelial phenotype. EAC patient-derived xenograft tumors grew more
      slowly in mice given the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and the TGFbeta 
      inhibitor than in mice given single agents or a combination of trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab. Tumors exposed to trastuzumab and pertuzumab expressed EMT markers
      and were poorly differentiated, whereas tumors exposed to the combination of
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and the TGFbeta inhibitor expressed epithelial markers
      and were more differentiated. CONCLUSIONS: EAC cells become resistant to
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab by activating TGFbeta signaling, which induces EMT.
      Agents that block TGFbeta signaling can increase the anti-tumor efficacies of
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

AB  - Specificity proteins (SPs) and Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) belong to the family
      of transcription factors that contain conserved zinc finger domains involved in
      binding to target DNA sequences. Many of these proteins are expressed in
      different tissues and have distinct tissue-specific activities and functions.
      Studies have shown that SPs and KLFs regulate not only physiological processes
      such as growth, development, differentiation, proliferation, and embryogenesis,
      but pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer and inflammatory disorders.
      Consistently, these proteins have been shown to regulate normal functions and
      pathobiology in the digestive system. We review recent findings on the tissue-
      and organ-specific functions of SPs and KLFs in the digestive system including
      the oral cavity, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, and
      liver. We provide a list of agents under development to target these proteins.

TI  - Computational Discovery of Niclosamide Ethanolamine, a Repurposed Drug Candidate 
      That Reduces Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells In Vitro and in Mice by
      Inhibiting Cell Division Cycle 37 Signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Drug repositioning offers a shorter approval process than new 
      drug development. We therefore searched large public datasets of drug-induced
      gene expression signatures to identify agents that might be effective against
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We searched public databases of
      messenger RNA expression patterns reported from HCC specimens from patients, HCC 
      cell lines, and cells exposed to various drugs. We identified drugs that might
      specifically increase expression of genes that are down-regulated in HCCs and
      reduce expression of genes up-regulated in HCCs using a nonparametric, rank-based
      pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We evaluated
      the anti-tumor activity of niclosamide and its ethanolamine salt (NEN) in HCC
      cell lines (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B, Hep40, and PLC/PRF/5), primary human hepatocytes,
      and 2 mouse models of HCC. In one model of HCC, liver tumor development was
      induced by hydrodynamic delivery of a sleeping beauty transposon expressing an
      activated form of Ras (v12) and truncated beta-catenin (N90). In another mouse
      model, patient-derived xenografts were established by implanting HCC cells from
      patients into livers of immunocompromised mice. Tumor growth was monitored by
      bioluminescence imaging. Tumor-bearing mice were fed a regular chow diet or a
      chow diet containing niclosamide or NEN. In a separate experiment using
      patient-derived xenografts, tumor-bearing mice were given sorafenib (the standard
      of care for patients with advanced HCC), NEN, or niclosamide alone; a combination
      of sorafenib and NEN; or a combination sorafenib and niclosamide in their
      drinking water, or regular water (control), and tumor growth was monitored.
      RESULTS: Based on gene expression signatures, we identified 3 anthelmintics that 
      significantly altered the expression of genes that are up- or down-regulated in
      HCCs. Niclosamide and NEN specifically reduced the viability of HCC cells: the
      agents were at least 7-fold more cytotoxic to HCCs than primary hepatocytes. Oral
      administration of NEN to mice significantly slowed growth of genetically induced 
      liver tumors and patient-derived xenografts, whereas niclosamide did not,
      coinciding with the observed greater bioavailability of NEN compared with
      niclosamide. The combination of NEN and sorafenib was more effective at slowing
      growth of patient-derived xenografts than either agent alone. In HepG2 cells and 
      in patient-derived xenografts, administration of niclosamide or NEN increased
      expression of 20 genes down-regulated in HCC and reduced expression of 29 genes
      up-regulated in the 274-gene HCC signature. Administration of NEN to mice with
      patient-derived xenografts reduced expression of proteins in the
      Wnt-beta-catenin, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3,
      AKT-mechanistic target of rapamycin, epidermal growth factor receptor-Ras-Raf
      signaling pathways. Using immunoprecipitation assays, we found NEN to bind cell
      division cycle 37 protein and disrupt its interaction with heat shock protein 90.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a bioinformatics search for agents that alter the HCC-specific
      gene expression pattern, we identified the anthelmintic niclosamide as a
      potential anti-tumor agent. Its ethanolamine salt, with greater bioavailability, 
      was more effective than niclosamide at slowing the growth of genetically induced 
      liver tumors and patient-derived xenografts in mice. Both agents disrupted
      interaction between cell division cycle 37 and heat shock protein 90 in HCC
      cells, with concomitant inhibition of their downstream signaling pathways. NEN
      might be effective for treatment of patients with HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about provider and health system factors that 
      affect receipt of active therapy and outcomes of patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). We investigated patient, provider, and health system factors
      associated with receipt of active HCC therapy and overall survival. METHODS: We
      performed a national, retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with
      HCC from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 (n = 3988) and followed
      through December 31 2014 who received care through the Veterans Administration
      (128 centers). Outcomes were receipt of active HCC therapy (liver
      transplantation, resection, local ablation, transarterial therapy, or sorafenib) 
      and overall survival. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, receiving care at an
      academically affiliated Veterans Administration hospital (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 
      95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-2.41) or a multi-specialist evaluation (OR,
      1.60; 95% CI, 1.15-2.21), but not review by a multidisciplinary tumor board (OR, 
      1.19; 95% CI, 0.98-1.46), was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving
      active HCC therapy. In time-varying Cox proportional hazards models, liver
      transplantation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.16-0.31), liver resection
      (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.28-0.52), ablative therapy (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.76),
      and transarterial therapy (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) were associated with
      reduced mortality. Subspecialist care by hepatologists (HR, 0.70; 95% CI,
      0.63-0.78), medical oncologists (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.91), or surgeons (HR,
      0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.89) within 30 days of HCC diagnosis, and review by a
      multidisciplinary tumor board (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90), were associated with
      reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort study of almost 4000
      patients with HCC cared for at VA centers, geographic, provider, and system
      differences in receipt of active HCC therapy are associated with patient
      survival. Multidisciplinary methods of care delivery for HCC should be
      prospectively evaluated and standardized to improve access to HCC therapy and
      optimize outcomes.

TI  - Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy Restores Immune Tolerance to Patients With
      Hepatitis C Virus-Induced Cryoglobulinemia Vasculitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are
      effective in patients with hepatitis C virus-induced cryoglobulinemia vasculitis 
      (HCV-CV). We analyzed blood samples from patients with HCV-CV before and after
      DAA therapy to determine mechanisms of these drugs and their effects on cellular 
      immunity. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 27 consecutive patients
      with HCV-CV (median age, 59 y) treated with DAA therapy (21 patients received
      sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 24 weeks, 4 patients received sofosbuvir plus
      daclatasvir for 12 weeks, and 2 patients received sofosbuvir plus simeprevir for 
      12 weeks) in Paris, France. Blood samples were collected from these patients
      before and after DAA therapy, and also from 12 healthy donors and 12 individuals 
      with HCV infection without CV. HCV load, cryoglobulins, and cytokines were
      quantified by flow cytometry, cytokine multiplex assays, and enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (88.9%) had a complete
      clinical response of CV to DAA therapy at week 24, defined by improvement of all 
      the affected organs and the absence of relapse. Compared with healthy donors and 
      patients with HCV infection without CV, patients with HCV-CV, before DAA therapy,
      had a lower percentage of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ regulatory T cells (P < .01), but
      higher proportions of IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells (P < .05), CD4+IFNgamma+ cells
      (P < .01), CD4+IL17A+ cells (P < .01), and CD4+CXCR5+interleukin 21+ follicular
      T-helper (Tfh) cells (P < .01). In patients with HCV-CV, there was a negative
      correlation between numbers of IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells and T-regulatory
      cells (P = .03), and positive correlations with numbers of Tfh cells (P = .03)
      and serum levels of cryoglobulin (P = .01). DAA therapy increased patients'
      numbers of T-regulatory cells (1.5% +/- 0.18% before therapy vs 2.1% +/- 0.18%
      after therapy), decreased percentages of IgM+CD21-/low memory B cells (35.7% +/- 
      6.1% before therapy vs 14.9% +/- 3.8% after therapy), and decreased numbers of
      Tfh cells (12% +/- 1.3% before therapy vs 8% +/- 0.9% after therapy). Expression 
      levels of B lymphocyte stimulator receptor 3 and programmed cell death 1 on B
      cells increased in patients with HCV-CV after DAA-based therapy (mean
      fluorescence units, 37 +/- 2.4 before therapy vs 47 +/- 2.6 after therapy, P <
      .01; and 29 +/- 7.3 before therapy vs 48 +/- 9.3 after therapy, P < .05,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective clinical trial of patients with
      HCV-CV, DAA-based therapy restored disturbances in peripheral B- and T-cell
      homeostasis.

      of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an orphan
      hepatobiliary disorder associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed
      to estimate the risk of disease progression based on distinct clinical phenotypes
      in a large international cohort of patients with PSC. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective outcome analysis of patients diagnosed with PSC from 1980 through
      2010 at 37 centers in Europe, North America, and Australia. For each patient, we 
      collected data on sex, clinician-reported age at and date of PSC and IBD
      diagnoses, phenotypes of IBD and PSC, and date and indication of IBD-related
      surgeries. The primary and secondary endpoints were liver transplantation or
      death (LTD) and hepatopancreatobiliary malignancy, respectively. Cox proportional
      hazards models were applied to determine the effects of individual covariates on 
      rates of clinical events, with time-to-event analysis ascertained through
      Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Of the 7121 patients in the cohort, 2616 met the
      primary endpoint (median time to event of 14.5 years) and 721 developed
      hepatopancreatobiliary malignancy. The most common malignancy was
      cholangiocarcinoma (n = 594); patients of advanced age at diagnosis had an
      increased incidence compared with younger patients (incidence rate: 1.2 per 100
      patient-years for patients younger than 20 years old, 6.0 per 100 patient-years
      for patients 21-30 years old, 9.0 per 100 patient-years for patients 31-40 years 
      old, 14.0 per 100 patient-years for patients 41-50 years old, 15.2 per 100
      patient-years for patients 51-60 years old, and 21.0 per 100 patient-years for
      patients older than 60 years). Of all patients with PSC studied, 65.5% were men, 
      89.8% had classical or large-duct disease, and 70.0% developed IBD at some point.
      Assessing the development of IBD as a time-dependent covariate, Crohn's disease
      and no IBD (both vs ulcerative colitis) were associated with a lower risk of LTD 
      (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; P < .001 and HR, 0.90; P = .03,
      respectively) and malignancy (HR, 0.68; P = .008 and HR, 0.77; P = .004,
      respectively). Small-duct PSC was associated with a lower risk of LTD or
      malignancy compared with classic PSC (HR, 0.30 and HR, 0.15, respectively; both P
      < .001). Female sex was also associated with a lower risk of LTD or malignancy
      (HR, 0.88; P = .002 and HR, 0.68; P < .001, respectively). In multivariable
      analyses assessing the primary endpoint, small-duct PSC characterized a low-risk 
      phenotype in both sexes (adjusted HR for men, 0.23; P < .001 and adjusted HR for 
      women, 0.48; P = .003). Conversely, patients with ulcerative colitis had an
      increased risk of liver disease progression compared with patients with Crohn's
      disease (HR, 1.56; P < .001) or no IBD (HR, 1.15; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: In an
      analysis of data from individual patients with PSC worldwide, we found
      significant variation in clinical course associated with age at diagnosis, sex,
      and ductal and IBD subtypes. The survival estimates provided might be used to
      estimate risk levels for patients with PSC and select patients for clinical
      trials.

      by Impairing Esophageal Clearance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Central obesity promotes gastroesophageal reflux, which may be
      related to increased intra-abdominal pressure. We investigated the effect of
      increasing abdominal pressure by waist belt on reflux in patients with reflux
      disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of patients with esophagitis
      (n = 8) or Barrett's esophagus (n = 6); median age was 56 years and median body
      mass index was 26.8. Proton pump inhibitors were stopped at least 7 days before
      the study and H2 receptor antagonists were stopped for at least 24 hours before. 
      The severity of upper GI symptoms was assessed and measurements of height,
      weight, and waist and hip circumference taken. Combined high-resolution pH
      measurement and manometry were performed in fasted state for 20 minutes and for
      90 minutes following a standardized meal. The squamocolumnar junction was marked 
      by endoscopically placed radiopaque clips. The procedures were performed with and
      without a waist belt (a weight-lifter belt applied tightly and inflated to a
      constant cuff pressure of 50 mmHg). We compared variables between groups using
      the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and tested for correlations using Spearman Rho
      bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Without the belt, intragastric pressure correlated
      with waist circumference (r = 0.682; P = .008), with the range in pressure
      between smallest and largest waist circumference being 15 mmHg. The belt
      increased intragastric pressure by a median of 6.9 mmHg during fasting (P = .002)
      and by 9.0 mmHg after the meal (P = .001). Gastroesophageal acid reflux at each
      of the pH sensors extending 5.5 cm proximal to the peak lower esophageal
      sphincter pressure point was increased by approximately 8-fold by the belt (all P
      < .05). Following the meal, the mean number of reflux events with the belt was 4,
      vs 2 without (P = .008). Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations were
      not increased by the belt, but those associated with reflux were increased (2 vs 
      3.5; P = .04). The most marked effect of the belt was impaired esophageal
      clearance of refluxed acid (median values of 23.0 seconds without belt vs 81.1
      seconds with belt) (P = .008). The pattern of impaired clearance was that of
      rapid re-reflux after peristaltic clearance. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study 
      of patients with esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, we found belt compression
      increased acid reflux following a meal. The intragastric pressure rise inducing
      this effect is well within the range associated with differing waist
      circumference and likely to be relevant to the association between obesity and
      reflux disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many different types of cancer cells have chromosome
      instability. The hippo pathway leads to phosphorylation of the transcriptional
      activator yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1, YAP), which regulates proliferation and
      has been associated with the development of liver cancer. We investigated the
      effects of hippo signaling via YAP on chromosome stability and
      hepatocarcinogenesis in humans and mice. METHODS: We analyzed transcriptome data 
      from 242 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to search for gene
      signatures associated with chromosomal instability (CIN); we investigated
      associations with overall survival time and cancer recurrence using Kaplan-Meier 
      curves. We analyzed changes in expression of these signature genes, at mRNA and
      protein levels, after small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of YAP in Sk-Hep1,
      SNU182, HepG2, or pancreatic cancer cells, as well as incubation with
      thiostrepton (an inhibitor of forkhead box M1 [FOXM1]) or verteporfin (inhibitor 
      of the interaction between YAP and TEA domain transcription factor 4 [TEAD4]). We
      performed co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments.
      We collected liver tissues from mice that express a constitutively active form of
      YAP (YAP(S127A)) and analyzed gene expression signatures and histomorphologic
      parameters associated with chromosomal instability. Mice were given injections of
      thiostrepton and livers were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting,
      immunohistochemistry, histology, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We
      performed immunohistochemical analyses on tissue microarrays of 105 HCCs and 7
      nontumor liver tissues. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns associated with
      chromosome instability, called CIN25 and CIN70, were detected in HCCs from
      patients with shorter survival time or early cancer recurrence. TEAD4 and YAP
      were required for CIN25 and CIN70 signature expression via induction and binding 
      of FOXM1. Disrupting the interaction between YAP and TEAD4 with verteporfin, or
      inhibiting FOXM1 with thiostrepton, reduced the chromosome instability gene
      expression patterns. Hyperplastic livers and tumors from YAP(S127A) mice had
      increased CIN25 and CIN70 gene expression patterns, aneuploidy, and defects in
      mitosis. Injection of YAP(S127A) mice with thiostrepton reduced liver overgrowth 
      and signs of chromosomal instability. In human HCC tissues, high levels of
      nuclear YAP correlated with increased chromosome instability gene expression
      patterns and aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing cell lines, genetically
      modified mice, and HCC tissues, we found that YAP cooperates with FOXM1 to
      contribute to chromosome instability. Agents that disrupt this pathway might be
      developed as treatments for liver cancer. Transcriptome data are available in the
      Gene Expression Omnibus public database (accession numbers: GSE32597 and
      GSE73396).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Western and prudent dietary patterns have been associated with
      higher and lower risks of colorectal cancer (CRC), respectively. However, little 
      is known about the associations between dietary patterns and specific anatomic
      subsites or molecular subtypes of CRC. METHODS: We used multivariable Cox
      proportional hazards models to examine the associations between Western and
      prudent dietary patterns and CRC risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
      and Nurses' Health Study. RESULTS: After up to 32 years of follow-up of 137,217
      men and women, we documented 3260 cases of CRC. Among individuals from whom
      subsite data were available, we observed 1264 proximal colon, 866 distal colon,
      and 670 rectal tumors. Western diet was associated with an increased incidence of
      CRC (Ptrend < .0001), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.15-1.48,
      comparing the highest to lowest quartile). The association of Western diet with
      CRC was evident for tumors of the distal colon (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.96;
      Ptrend = .0004) and rectum (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03-1.77; Ptrend = .01) but not
      proximal colon (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.91-1.35; Ptrend = .51) when we comparing
      extreme quartiles. In contrast, for the prudent pattern, we observed a RR of 0.86
      for overall CRC (95% CI, 0.77-0.95; Ptrend = .01), with similar trends at
      anatomic subsites. However, the trend appeared stronger among men than women.
      Among 1285 cases (39%) with tissue available for molecular profiling, Western
      diet appeared to be more strongly associated with some CRC molecular subtypes (no
      mutations in KRAS [KRAS wildtype] or BRAF [BRAF wildtype], no or a low CpG island
      methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability), although formal tests for
      heterogeneity did not produce statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS:
      Western dietary patterns are associated with an increased risk of CRC,
      particularly distal colon and rectal tumors. Western dietary patterns also appear
      more strongly associated with tumors that are KRAS wildtype, BRAF wildtype, have 
      no or a low CpG island methylator phenotype, and microsatellite stability. In
      contrast, prudent dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of CRC that
      does not vary according to anatomic subsite or molecular subtype.

TI  - Gut-Specific Delivery of T-Helper 17 Cells Reduces Obesity and Insulin Resistance
      in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity and metabolic syndrome have been associated with
      alterations to the intestinal microbiota. However, few studies examined the
      effects of obesity on the intestinal immune system. We investigated changes in
      subsets of intestinal CD4(+) T-helper (TH) cells with obesity and the effects of 
      gut-tropic TH17 cells in mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: We isolated
      immune cells from small intestine and adipose tissue of C57BL/6 mice fed a normal
      chow diet or a HFD for 10 weeks and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry. Mice
      fed a vitamin A-deficient HFD were compared with mice fed a vitamin A-sufficient 
      HFD. Obese RAG1-deficient mice were given injections of only regulatory T cells
      or a combination of regulatory T cells and TH17 cells (wild type or deficient in 
      integrin beta7 subunit or interleukin 17 [IL17]). Mice were examined for weight
      gain, fat mass, fatty liver, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Fecal
      samples were collected before and after T cell transfer and analyzed for
      microbiota composition by metagenomic DNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction. RESULTS: Mice placed on a HFD became obese, which affected the
      distribution of small intestinal CD4(+) TH cells. Intestinal tissues from obese
      mice had significant reductions in the proportion of TH17 cells but increased
      proportion of TH1 cells, compared with intestinal tissues from nonobese mice.
      Depletion of vitamin A in obese mice further reduced the proportion of TH17 cells
      in small intestine; this reduction correlated with more weight gain and worsening
      of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Adoptive transfer of in
      vitro-differentiated gut-tropic TH17 cells to obese mice reduced these metabolic 
      defects, which required the integrin beta7 subunit and IL17. Delivery of TH17
      cells to intestines of mice led to expansion of commensal microbes associated
      with leanness. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, intestinal TH17 cells contribute to
      development of a microbiota that maintains metabolic homeostasis, via IL17.
      Gut-homing TH17 cells might be used to reduce metabolic disorders in obese
      individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several genetic variants have been associated with gastric
      cancer risk, although these account for only a fraction of cases of gastric
      cancer. We aimed to identify low-frequency and other genetic variants that
      determine gastric cancer susceptibility. METHODS: We performed exome array
      analysis of DNA in blood samples from 1113 patients with gastric cancer,
      collected at hospitals from 2006 to 2010 in China, and 1848 individuals without
      cancer (controls) undergoing physical examinations. Among 71,290 variants
      analyzed (including 25,784 common variants), 24 variants were selected and
      replicated in an analysis of DNA in blood samples from 4687 additional cases of
      gastric cancer and 5780 controls. We compared expression of candidate genes in
      tumor vs normal gastric tissues using data from TCGA and performed functional
      annotation analyses. An immortalized human gastric epithelial cell line (GES1)
      and 7 human gastric cancer lines were used to express transgenes, knock down gene
      expression (with small interfering RNAs), disrupt genes (using the CRISPR/Cas9
      system), or assess expression of reporter constructs. We measured cell
      proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration, and assessed growth of 
      xenograft tumors in nude mice. RESULTS: A low-frequency missense variant
      rs112754928 in the SPOC domain containing 1 gene (SPOCD1; encoding p.Arg71Trp),
      at 1p35.2, was reproducibly associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer (odds 
      ratio, 0.56; P = 3.48 x 10(-8)). SPOCD1 was overexpressed in gastric tumors, and 
      knockout of SPOCD1 reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation, invasive activity, 
      and migration, as well as growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. We also
      associated the variant rs1679709 at 6p22.1 with reduced risk for gastric cancer
      (odds ratio, 0.80; P = 1.17 x 10(-13)). The protective allele rs1679709-A
      correlated with the surrounding haplotype rs2799077-T-rs2799079-C, which reduced 
      the enhancer activity of this site to decrease expression of the butyrophilin
      subfamily 3 member A2 gene (BTN3A2). BTN3A2 is overexpressed in gastric tumors,
      and deletion of BTN3A2 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of
      gastric cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have associated variants at 1p35.2 and
      6p22.1 with gastric cancer risk, indicating a role for SPOCD1 and BTN3A2 in
      gastric carcinogenesis.

      Duplication of GREM1 and Implications for Screening and Surveillance.

AB  - Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome is a rare colon cancer predisposition
      syndrome caused by a duplication of a noncoding sequence near the gremlin 1, DAN 
      family BMP antagonist gene (GREM1) originally described in Ashkenazi Jews. Few
      families with GREM1 duplications have been described, so there are many questions
      about detection and management. We report 4 extended families with the
      duplication near GREM1 previously found in Ashkenazi Jews; 3 families were
      identified at cancer genetic clinics in Israel and 1 family was identified in a
      cohort of patients with familial colorectal cancer. Their clinical features
      include extracolonic tumors, onset of polyps in adolescence, and rapid
      progression of some polyps to advanced adenomas. One family met diagnostic
      criteria for Lynch syndrome. Expansion of the hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome
      phenotype can inform surveillance strategies for carriers of GREM1 duplications.

TI  - Lower Prevalence of Celiac Disease and Gluten-Related Disorders in Persons Living
      in Southern vs Northern Latitudes of the United States.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association between prevalence of celiac disease and
      geographic region is incompletely understood, but the occurrence of several
      autoimmune disorders has been found to vary along a North-South gradient. We
      examined geographic, demographic, and clinical factors associated with prevalence
      of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in the United States. METHODS: In a
      population-based study, we analyzed data on gluten-related conditions from the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2009 through 2014, on
      22,277 participants 6 years and older. We identified persons with celiac disease 
      based on results of serum tests for IgA against tissue transglutaminase and
      endomysium or on both a health care provider diagnosis and adherence to a
      gluten-free diet. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was defined as
      adherence to a gluten-free diet without a diagnosis of celiac disease. We
      compared mean serum levels of biochemical and nutritional markers based on status
      of gluten-related conditions. RESULTS: We found 0.7% of participants to have
      celiac disease and 1.1% of participants to avoid gluten without celiac disease.
      Celiac disease was more common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 35
      degrees -39 degrees North (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.1) or 
      at latitudes of 40 degrees North or more (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.6-11.3) than
      individuals who lived at latitudes below 35 degrees North, independent of race or
      ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and body mass index. Gluten avoidance without
      celiac disease was more common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 40
      degrees North or more, independent of demographic factors and body mass index.
      Participants with undiagnosed celiac disease (identified by positive results from
      serologic tests) had lower mean levels of vitamin B-12 and folate (data collected
      from 2009 through 2012) than persons without celiac disease. Participants with a 
      health care provider diagnosis of celiac disease had a lower mean level of
      hemoglobin than persons without celiac disease. Mean levels of albumin, calcium, 
      iron, ferritin, cholesterol, vitamin B-6, and vitamin D (data collected from 2009
      through 2010) did not differ between participants with gluten-related conditions 
      and those without. CONCLUSIONS: In the US population, a higher proportion of
      persons living at latitudes of 35 degrees North or greater have celiac disease or
      avoid gluten than persons living south of this latitude, independent of race or
      ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or body mass index. Mean levels of vitamin B-12 
      and folate are lower in individuals with undiagnosed celiac disease, and levels
      of hemoglobin are lower in participants with a diagnosis of celiac disease,
      compared with individuals without celiac disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Knowledge of temporal associations between screen-detected
      gallstone disease and specific cancers is limited. The objective of this study
      was to determine if screen-detected gallstones or cholecystectomy are associated 
      with occurrence of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal cancers. METHODS: We 
      performed a cohort study of 3 randomly selected groups from the general
      population of Copenhagen. Participants (N = 5928) were examined from 1982 through
      1992 and underwent abdominal ultrasound examination to detect gallstone disease, 
      but were not informed of their gallstone status. Participants were followed for
      the occurrence of cancers through national registers until December 2014. We
      performed multivariable Cox regression analyses to identify factors associated
      with development of cancer. RESULTS: Gallstone disease was identified in 10% of
      participants (591 of 5928); of these, 6.8% had gallstones and 3.2% had
      cholecystectomy at baseline. The population was followed for a median of 24.7
      years (interquartile range, 18.9-32.4 years) with 1% lost. Pooled
      gastrointestinal cancers were associated with gallstone disease (11.2% of
      patients with gallstone disease vs 6.64% without; hazard ratio, 1.50; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.12-2.01). Right-side colon cancer was also associated with
      gallstone disease (2.57% of patients with gallstone disease vs 0.96% without;
      hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.78). Pancreatic, esophageal, 
      gastric, pooled colorectal, left-side colon, sigmoid colon, and rectal cancers
      were not associated with gallstone disease. Breast cancer had a weak association 
      with gallstone disease depending on other factors (10.6% of patients with
      gallstone disease vs 7.41% without; hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.99-2.11). Pooled nongastrointestinal and prostate cancers were not associated
      with gallstone disease. CONCLUSIONS: Screen-detected gallstone disease in the
      general population is associated with pooled gastrointestinal and right-side
      colon cancers. These associations are not due to detection bias or
      cholecystectomy. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of this
      association.

      every 5-10 years for colorectal cancer; many recommend shorter surveillance
      intervals for these individuals. We aimed to identify the reasons that
      endoscopists recommend shorter surveillance intervals for some individuals with
      LRAs and determine whether timing affects outcomes at follow-up examinations.
      METHODS: We collected data from 1560 individuals (45-75 years old) who
      participated in a prospective chemoprevention trial (of vitamin D and calcium)
      from 2004 through 2008. Participants in the trial had at least 1 adenoma,
      detected at their index colonoscopy, and were recommended to receive follow-up
      colonoscopy examinations at 3 or 5 years after adenoma identification, as
      recommended by the endoscopist. For this analysis we collected data from only
      participants with LRAs. These data included characteristics of participants and
      endoscopists and findings from index and follow-up colonoscopies. Primary
      endpoints were frequency of recommending shorter (3-year) vs longer (5-year)
      surveillance intervals, factors associated with these recommendations, and effect
      on outcome, determined at the follow-up colonoscopy. RESULTS: A 3-year
      surveillance interval was recommended for 594 of the subjects (38.1%). Factors
      most significantly associated with recommendation of 3-year vs a 5-year
      surveillance interval included African American race (relative risk [RR] to
      white, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.75), Asian/Pacific Islander
      ethnicity (RR to white, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.22-2.43), detection of 2 adenomas at the
      index examination (RR vs 1 adenoma, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.71), more than 3
      serrated polyps at the index examination (RR=2.16, 95% CI, 1.59-2.93), or index
      examination with fair or poor quality bowel preparation (RR vs excellent quality,
      2.16; 95% CI, 1.66-2.83). Other factors that had a significant association with
      recommendation for a 3-year surveillance interval included family history of
      colorectal cancer and detection of 1-2 serrated polyps at the index examination. 
      In comparisons of outcomes, we found no significant differences between the
      3-year vs 5-year recommendation groups in proportions of subjects found to have 1
      or more adenomas (38.8% vs 41.7% respectively; P = .27), advanced adenomas (7.7% 
      vs 8.2%; P = .73) or clinically significant serrated polyps (10.0% vs 10.3%; P = 
      .82) at the follow-up colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Possibly influenced by patients' 
      family history, race, quality of bowel preparation, or number or size of polyps, 
      endoscopists frequently recommend 3-year surveillance intervals instead of
      guideline-recommended intervals of 5 years or longer for individuals with LRAs.
      However, at the follow-up colonoscopy, similar proportions of participants have 1
      or more adenomas, advanced adenomas, or serrated polyps. These findings support
      the current guideline recommendations of performing follow-up examinations of
      individuals with LRAs at least 5 years after the index colonoscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A common variant in the solute carrier family 39 member 6 gene
      (SLC39A6) has been associated with survival times of patients with esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We investigated the function of SLC39A6 and ways 
      in which this variant affects tumor progression by studying ESCC samples and cell
      lines. METHODS: SLC39A6 was expressed or knocked down by expression of short
      hairpin RNAs in ESCC cells (KYSE30 and KYSE450) and HeLa cells using lentiviral
      vectors; we analyzed effects on proliferation, colony formation, migration, and
      invasion in vitro. Cells were grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice and tumor
      volume and metastases were quantified; tumors were collected and analyzed
      histologically. Cells were also analyzed for levels of intracellular zinc and
      messenger RNA (mRNA) expression patterns. We obtained ESCC and adjacent normal
      esophageal tissues from 94 patients who underwent esophagectomy in China from
      2010 through 2014. Survival times of patients were measured from the date of
      diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death. We sequenced mRNAs and compared
      levels between tumor and non-tumor tissues using the Wilcox rank-sum test. Total 
      proteins in cell lines or tissue samples were measured by immunoblotting. We
      searched publicly available databases for variants of SLC39A6 in human tumor and 
      non-tumor tissues. RESULTS: Knockdown of SLC39A6 reduced proliferation of ESCC
      cells in culture and metastasis of xenograft tumors in mice. Cells that
      overexpressed SLC39A6 had significant increases in intracellular levels of zinc
      and were more invasive in assays, activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      signaling to AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase
      1. Cells that overexpressed SLC39A6 had increased expression of mRNAs and
      proteins associated with metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1,
      MMP3, MYC, and snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2 or SLUG). Levels
      of MMP1, MMP3, MYC, and SLUG mRNAs correlated with levels of SLC39A6 mRNA in ESCC
      samples from patients. ESCC tissues had increased levels of SLC39A6 mRNA compared
      with non-tumor tissues; the increase correlated with tumor metastasis to lymph
      node and reduced patient survival time. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of ESCC
      samples and cell lines, we associated increased expression of SLC39A6 with tumor 
      invasiveness, intracellular level of zinc, and patient survival time. ESCC cell
      lines that overexpress SLC39A6 up-regulate expression MMP1, MMP3, MYC, and SLUG
      and form metastatic xenograft tumors in mice. Up-regulation of SLC39A6 might be
      used to determine prognoses of patients with ESCC or as a therapeutic target.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Low estrogen levels can contribute to development of fecal
      incontinence (FI) in women after menopause by altering neuromuscular continence
      mechanisms. However, studies have produced conflicting results on the association
      between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and risk of FI. METHODS: We studied the 
      association between MHT and risk of FI among 55,828 postmenopausal women (mean
      age, 73 years) who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, were enrolled since 
      2008, and with no report of FI. We defined incident FI as a report of at least 1 
      liquid or solid FI episode per month during 4 years of follow-up from
      self-administered, biennial questionnaires administered in 2010 and 2012. We used
      Cox proportional hazard models to calculate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for FI risk in women receiving MHT, adjusting 
      for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: During more than 185,000 person-years
      of follow-up, there were 6834 cases of incident FI. Compared with women who never
      used MHT, the multivariate hazard ratio for FI was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.18-1.34) for
      past users of MHT and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.45) for current users. The risk of FI 
      increased with longer duration of MHT use (P trend </= .0001) and decreased with 
      time since discontinuation. There was an increased risk of FI among women
      receiving MHT that contained a combination of estrogen and progestin (hazard
      ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.70) compared with estrogen monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current or past use of MHT was associated with a modestly increased risk of FI
      among postmenopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study. These results support a
      potential role for exogenous estrogens in the impairment of the fecal continence 
      mechanism.

TI  - Infliximab Is Not Associated With Increased Risk of Malignancy or Hemophagocytic 
      Lymphohistiocytosis in Pediatric Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) in pediatric patients is thought to increase the risk of malignancy and
      lymphoproliferative disorders, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
      (HLH). We compared unadjusted incidence rates of malignancy and HLH in pediatric 
      patients with IBD exposed to infliximab (IFX) with patients not exposed to
      biologics and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). METHODS: We
      collected and analyzed data from 5766 participants in a prospective study of
      long-term outcomes of pediatric patients with IBD (NCT00606346), from May 31,
      2007 through June 30, 2016. Patients were 17 years old or younger and had Crohn's
      disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD-unclassified with 24,543.0 patient-years of
      follow-up. We estimated incidence rates for malignancy and HLH as events/1000
      patient-years of follow-up. We calculated age-, sex-, and race-adjusted SIRs,
      with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
      End Results Program (SEER) database. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 15 patients who
      developed a malignancy and all 5 of the patients who developed HLH had been
      exposed to thiopurines; 10 patients with malignancy had also been exposed to a
      biologic agent. Unadjusted incidence rates showed no increased risk of malignancy
      (0.46/1000 patient-years) or HLH (0.0/1000 patient-years) in patients exposed to 
      IFX as the only biologic vs those unexposed to biologics (malignancy: 1.12/1000
      patient-years; HLH: 0.56/1000 patient-years). SIRs did not demonstrate an
      increased risk of malignancy among patients exposed to IFX (SIR, 1.69; 95% CI,
      0.46-4.32) vs patients not exposed to a biologic agent (SIR, 2.17; 95% CI,
      0.59-5.56), even when patients were stratified by thiopurine exposure.
      CONCLUSIONS: In determination of age-, sex-, and race-adjusted SIRs using data
      from a large clinical study and the SEER database, we found that IFX exposure did
      not associate with increased risk of malignancy or HLH in pediatric patients with
      IBD. Thiopurine exposure is an important precedent event for the development of
      malignancy or HLH in pediatric patients with IBD.

TI  - Timely Use of Probiotics in Hospitalized Adults Prevents Clostridium difficile
      Infection: A Systematic Review With Meta-Regression Analysis.

LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.02.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Systematic reviews have provided evidence for the efficacy of 
      probiotics in preventing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), but guidelines do
      not recommend probiotic use for prevention of CDI. We performed an updated
      systematic review to help guide clinical practice. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, International Journal of Probiotics and Prebiotics, and The Cochrane
      Library databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating use of probiotics
      and CDI in hospitalized adults taking antibiotics. Two reviewers independently
      extracted data and assessed risk of bias and overall quality of the evidence.
      Primary and secondary outcomes were incidence of CDI and adverse events,
      respectively. Secondary analyses examined the effects of probiotic species, dose,
      timing, formulation, duration, and study quality. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 
      19 published studies, comprising 6261 subjects. The incidence of CDI in the
      probiotic cohort, 1.6% (54 of 3277), was lower than of controls, 3.9% (115 of
      2984) (P < .001). The pooled relative risk of CDI in probiotic users was 0.42
      (95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.57; I(2) = 0.0%). Meta-regression analysis
      demonstrated that probiotics were significantly more effective if given closer to
      the first antibiotic dose, with a decrement in efficacy for every day of delay in
      starting probiotics (P = .04); probiotics given within 2 days of antibiotic
      initiation produced a greater reduction of risk for CDI (relative risk, 0.32; 95%
      confidence interval, 0.22-0.48; I(2) = 0%) than later administration (relative
      risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.23; I(2) = 0%) (P = .02). There was
      no increased risk for adverse events among patients given probiotics. The overall
      quality of the evidence was high. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review with
      meta-regression analysis, we found evidence that administration of probiotics
      closer to the first dose of antibiotic reduces the risk of CDI by >50% in
      hospitalized adults. Future research should focus on optimal probiotic dose,
      species, and formulation. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO

AB  - Chronic liver diseases (CLDs), due to chronic hepatitis C; hepatitis B;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD); and alcoholic liver disease, are a
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Early identification of
      patients with cirrhosis at high risk of progression to liver-related
      complications may facilitate timely care and improve outcomes. With risks and
      misclassification associated with invasive tests, such as liver biopsy,
      noninvasive imaging modalities for liver fibrosis assessment have gained
      popularity. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized
      clinical guidelines on the role of elastography in CLDs, focusing on
      vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and magnetic resonance
      elastography (MRE). To inform these clinical guidelines, the current technical
      review was developed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for diagnostic accuracy 
      studies. This technical review addresses focused questions related to: (1)
      comparative diagnostic performance of VCTE and MRE relative to nonproprietary,
      serum-based fibrosis markers for detection of cirrhosis in patients with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), NAFLD, and alcoholic liver
      diseases; (2) performance of specific VCTE-defined liver stiffness cutoffs as a
      test replacement strategy (to replace liver biopsy) in making key decisions in
      the management of patients with CLDs; and (3) performance of specific
      VCTE-defined liver stiffness cutoffs as a triage test to identify patients with
      low likelihood of harboring high-risk esophageal varices (EVs) or having
      clinically significant portal hypertension (for presurgical risk stratification).
      This technical review does not address performance of other noninvasive
      modalities for assessing fibrosis (eg, acoustic radiation force pulse imaging or 
      shear wave elastography) or steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter or
      magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction).

TI  - Recommendations on Surveillance and Management of Biallelic Mismatch Repair
      Deficiency (BMMRD) Syndrome: A Consensus Statement by the US Multi-Society Task
      Force on Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - The US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, with invited experts,
      developed a consensus statement and recommendations to assist health care
      providers with appropriate management of patients with biallelic mismatch repair 
      deficiency (BMMRD) syndrome, also called constitutional mismatch repair
      deficiency syndrome. This position paper outlines what is known about BMMRD, the 
      unique genetic and clinical aspects of the disease, and reviews the current
      management approaches to this disorder. This article represents a starting point 
      from which diagnostic and management decisions can undergo rigorous testing for
      efficacy. There is a lack of strong evidence and a requirement for further
      research. Nevertheless, providers need direction on how to recognize and care for
      BMMRD patients today. In addition to identifying areas of research, this article 
      provides guidance for surveillance and management. The major challenge is that
      BMMRD is rare, limiting the ability to accumulate unbiased data and develop
      controlled prospective trials. The formation of effective international consortia
      that collaborate and share data is proposed to accelerate our understanding of
      this disease.

      Response After Antiviral Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is well-recognized as a common blood-borne
      infection with global public health impact affecting 3 to 5 million persons in
      the United States and more than 170 million persons worldwide. Chronic hepatitis 
      C virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to
      complications of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies 
      with all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents are associated with high rates of
      sustained virologic response (SVR), generally exceeding 90%. SVR is associated
      with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, need for liver
      transplantation, and both liver-related and all-cause mortality. However, a
      subset of patients who achieve SVR will remain at long-term risk for progression 
      to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related
      mortality. Limited evidence is available to guide clinicians on which post-SVR
      patients should be monitored vs discharged, how to monitor and with which tests, 
      how frequently should monitoring occur, and for how long. In this clinical
      practice update, available evidence and expert opinion are used to generate best 
      practice recommendations on the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus
      who have achieved SVR.

AB  - Hepatitis B reactivation associated with immune-suppressive and biological
      therapies is emerging to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients with current or prior exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The
      population at risk for HBV reactivation includes those who either currently are
      infected with HBV or have had past exposure to HBV. Because curative and
      eradicative therapy for HBV is not currently available, there is a large
      reservoir of individuals at risk for HBV reactivation in the general population. 
      HBV reactivation with its potential consequences is particularly a concern when
      these people are exposed to either cancer chemotherapy, immunosuppressive or
      biologic therapies for the management of rheumatologic conditions, malignancies, 
      inflammatory bowel disease, dermatologic conditions, or solid-organ or bone
      marrow transplantation. With the advent of newer and emerging forms of targeted
      biologic therapies, it has become important to understand the mechanisms whereby 
      certain therapies are more prone to HBV reactivation. This review provides a
      comprehensive update on the current concepts, risk factors, molecular mechanisms,
      prevention, and management of hepatitis B reactivation. In addition, we provide
      recommendations for future research in this area.

AB  - Obesity is a heritable trait that contributes to substantial global morbidity and
      mortality. Here, we summarize findings from the past decade of genetic and
      epigenetic research focused on unravelling the underpinnings of adiposity. More
      than 140 genetic regions now are known to influence adiposity traits. The
      genetics of general adiposity, as measured by body mass index, and that of
      abdominal obesity, as measured by waist-to-hip ratio, have distinct biological
      backgrounds. Gene expression associated with general adiposity is enriched in the
      nervous system. In contrast, genes associated with abdominal adiposity function
      in adipose tissue. Recent population-based epigenetic analyses have highlighted
      additional distinct loci. We discuss how associated genetic variants can lead to 
      understanding causal mechanisms, and to disentangling reverse causation in
      epigenetic analyses. Discoveries emerging from population genomics are
      identifying new disease markers and potential novel drug targets to better define
      and combat obesity and related diseases.

AB  - Individuals can lose body weight and improve health status on a wide range of
      energy (calorie)-restricted dietary interventions. In this paper, we have
      reviewed the effectiveness of the most commonly utilized diets, including
      low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and Mediterranean approaches, in addition to
      commercial slimming programs, meal replacements, and newly popularized
      intermittent fasting diets. We also consider the role of artificial sweeteners in
      weight management. Low-fat diets tend to improve low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol the most, while lower-carbohydrate diets may preferentially improve
      triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, differences
      between diets are marginal. Weight loss improves almost all obesity-related
      co-morbidities and metabolic markers, regardless of the macronutrient composition
      of the diet, but individuals do vary in preferences and ability to adhere to
      different diets. Optimizing adherence is the most important factor for weight
      loss success, and this is enhanced by regular professional contact and supportive
      behavioral change programs. Maintaining weight losses in the long term remains
      the biggest challenge, and is undermined by an "obesogenic" environment and
      biological adaptations that accompany weight loss.

AB  - Bile acids are signaling molecules that coordinately regulate metabolism and
      inflammation via the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the Takeda G
      protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). These receptors activate transcriptional
      networks and signaling cascades controlling the expression and activity of genes 
      involved in bile acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, energy expenditure, and
      inflammation by acting predominantly in enterohepatic tissues, but also in
      peripheral organs. In this review, we discuss the most recent findings on the
      inter-organ signaling and interplay with the gut microbiota of bile acids and
      their receptors in meta-inflammation, with a focus on their pathophysiologic
      roles in obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis, and their potential therapeutic applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at risk of 
      progressive liver disease, cirrhosis, and decompensation. We analyzed the effects
      of the direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir in patients with
      HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis, combining data from 6 clinical trials.
      METHODS: We performed an integrated analysis of 402 patients with HCV genotype 1,
      4, or 6 infection and Child-Pugh A compensated cirrhosis enrolled in 6 clinical
      trials. All patients received elbasvir/grazoprevir 50 mg/100 mg once daily, with 
      or without ribavirin, for 12-18 weeks. The primary end point was sustained
      virologic response 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12), defined as a
      level of HCV RNA <15 IU/mL. RESULTS: Among treatment-naive and
      treatment-experienced patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks, 97.8%
      (135 of 138) and 88.9% (48 of 54) achieved SVR12, respectively. Among patients
      receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks, addition of ribavirin did not
      increase the proportion of treatment-naive patients (90.3%, 28 of 31) or
      treatment-experienced patients who achieved an SVR12 (91.4%, 74 of 81). All (49
      of 49) treatment-experienced patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir with
      ribavirin for 16 or 18 weeks, and 93.9% (46 of 49) of patients receiving
      elbasvir/grazoprevir without ribavirin for 16 or 18 weeks achieved SVR12.
      Virologic failure was higher among patients with HCV genotype 1a infections
      compared with patients with genotype 1b or 4 infections, particularly in patients
      who had not responded to previous interferon therapy. Baseline tests for
      resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) led to an individualized approach for 
      selecting treatment duration and established a need for ribavirin for patients
      with HCV genotype 1a infection and RASs, regardless of treatment history. Among
      patients with HCV genotype 1a infection with and without baseline RASs in HCV
      nonstructural protein 5A who received elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks, 73% (8
      of 11) and 98% (96 of 98) achieved SVR12, respectively. Both patients with HCV
      genotype 1a infection with baseline RASs who received 16 or 18 weeks of
      elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin achieved SVR12. Grade 3 or 4 increases in
      levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, which did not 
      cause symptoms, were reported in 2.3% (6 of 264) of patients receiving
      elbasvir/grazoprevir. Serious adverse events were reported in 3% (8 of 264)
      patients and no patient had a decompensation-related event. CONCLUSIONS: In an
      analysis of data from 6 clinical trials, rates of SVR12 ranged from 89% to 100%
      in patients with HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 infections and compensated cirrhosis
      treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin. Addition of
      ribavirin to a 12-week regimen of elbasvir/grazoprevir had little effect on the
      proportion of treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients who achieved an
      SVR12. However, virologic failure did not occur in any treatment-experienced
      patients when the duration of elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin therapy was
      extended to 16 or 18 weeks. Baseline analysis of RASs (or in the absence of this 
      test, a history of nonresponse to interferon) can be used to determine treatment 
      duration and the need for ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1a infection.

AB  - Weight changes are accompanied by imbalances between calorie intake and
      expenditure. This fact is often misinterpreted to suggest that obesity is caused 
      by gluttony and sloth and can be treated by simply advising people to eat less
      and move more. Rather various components of energy balance are dynamically
      interrelated and weight loss is resisted by counterbalancing physiological
      processes. While low-carbohydrate diets have been suggested to partially subvert 
      these processes by increasing energy expenditure and promoting fat loss, our
      meta-analysis of 32 controlled feeding studies with isocaloric substitution of
      carbohydrate for fat found that both energy expenditure (26 kcal/d; P <.0001) and
      fat loss (16 g/d; P <.0001) were greater with lower fat diets. We review the
      components of energy balance and the mechanisms acting to resist weight loss in
      the context of static, settling point, and set-point models of body weight
      regulation, with the set-point model being most commensurate with current data.

AB  - Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) leads to weight loss in obese individuals
      and reduces comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. MBS is superior to medical
      therapy in reducing hyperglycemia in persons with type 2 diabetes, and has been
      associated with reduced mortality and incidences of cardiovascular events and
      cancer in obese individuals. New guidelines have been proposed for the use of MBS
      in persons with type 2 diabetes. We review the use of MBS as a treatment for
      obesity and obesity-related conditions and, based on recent evidence, propose
      that health care systems make the appropriate changes to increase accessibility
      for eligible patients.

      Development by Inhibiting BTG1.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer have increased expression of microRNA-301a
      (MIR301A) compared with tissues from patients without IBD. We studied the
      mechanisms of MIR301A in the progression of IBD in human tissues and mice.
      METHODS: We isolated intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from biopsy samples of
      the colon from 153 patients with different stages of IBD activity, 6 patients
      with colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and 35 healthy individuals (controls),
      enrolled in the study in Shanghai, China. We measured expression of MIR301A and
      BTG anti-proliferation factor 1 (BTG1) by IECs using quantitative
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Human colon cancer cell lines
      (HCT-116 and SW480) were transfected with a lentivirus that expresses MIR301A;
      expression of cytokines and tight junction proteins were measured by quantitative
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and
      immunofluorescence staining. We generated mice with disruption of the
      microRNA-301A gene (MIR301A-knockout mice), and also studied mice that express a 
      transgene-encoding BTG1. Colitis was induced in knockout, transgenic, and control
      (C57BL/B6) mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), and mice were 
      given azoxymethane to induce colorectal carcinogenesis. Colons were collected and
      analyzed histologically and by immunohistochemistry; tumor nodules were counted
      and tumor size was measured. SW480 cells expressing the MIR301A transgene were
      grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice. RESULTS: Expression of MIR301A increased 
      in IECs from patients with IBD and CAC compared with controls. MIR301A-knockout
      mice were resistant to the development of colitis following administration of
      DSS; their colon tissues expressed lower levels of interleukin 1beta (IL1beta),
      IL6, IL8, and tumor necrosis factor than colons of control mice. Colon tissues
      from MIR301A-knockout mice had increased epithelial barrier integrity and formed 
      fewer tumors following administration of azoxymethane than control mice. Human
      IECs expressing transgenic MIR301A down-regulated expression of cadherin 1 (also 
      called E-cadherin or CDH1). We identified BTG1 mRNA as a target of MIR301A;
      levels of BTG1 mRNA were reduced in inflamed mucosa from patients with active IBD
      compared with controls. There was an inverse correlation between levels of BTG1
      mRNA and levels of MIR301A in inflamed mucosal tissues from patients with active 
      IBD. Human colon cancer cell lines that expressed a MIR301A transgene increased
      proliferation; they had increased permeability and decreased expression of CDH1
      compared with cells transfected with a control vector, indicating reduced
      intestinal barrier function. BTG1 transgenic mice developed less severe colitis
      than control mice following administration of DSS. SW480 cells expressing
      anti-MIR301A formed fewer xenograft tumors in nude mice than cells expressing a
      control vector. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of MIR301A are increased in IECs from
      patients with active IBD. MIR301A reduces expression of BTG1 to reduce epithelial
      integrity and promote inflammation in mouse colon and promotes tumorigenesis.
      Strategies to decrease levels of MIR301A in colon tissues might be developed to
      treat patients with IBD and CAC.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract, the key interface between ingested nutrients and the 
      body, plays a critical role in regulating energy homeostasis. Gut-derived signals
      convey information regarding incoming nutrients to the brain, initiating changes 
      in eating behavior and energy expenditure, to maintain energy balance. Here we
      review hormonal, neural, and nutrient signals emanating from the gastrointestinal
      tract and evidence for their role in controlling feeding behavior. Mechanistic
      studies that have utilized pharmacologic and/or transgenic approaches targeting
      an individual hormone/mediator have yielded somewhat disappointing body weight
      changes, often leading to the hormone/mediator in question being dismissed as a
      potential obesity therapy. However, the recent finding of sustained weight
      reduction in response to systemic administration of a long-acting analog of the
      gut-hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 highlights the therapeutic potential of
      gut-derived signals acting via nonphysiologic mechanisms. Thus, we also review
      therapeutics strategies being utilized or developed to leverage gastrointestinal 
      signals in order to treat obesity.

AB  - The prospect of a significant increase in global health-related costs associated 
      with high cardiometabolic complications of obesity in Asians has encouraged more 
      attention to be focused on the problem of growing obesity prevalence in these
      populations. Although these studies have shown that cardiometabolic complications
      occur more frequently and at a lower body mass index (BMI) in Asians than in
      European populations, the mechanisms involved have yet to be discovered.
      Ethnic/racial differences in body composition and fat distribution have been
      studied extensively. Although these studies have shown that increasing BMI is
      associated with larger increases in body fat content in Asians, growing evidence 
      points to factors other than body fat content and fat distribution in determining
      a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic complications in these populations. Here, 
      we provide support to our view that earlier onset of adipocyte maturation
      arrest/insulin resistance during weight gain could be a major factor in
      increasing the cardiometabolic risk of Asian populations at a lower BMI.

AB  - Using the Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults as a 
      framework, this article reviews intensive lifestyle interventions for weight
      loss. The Guidelines recommend a minimum of 6 months of high-intensity,
      comprehensive lifestyle intervention, consisting of a reduced-calorie diet,
      increased physical activity, and behavior therapy. Persons with obesity typically
      lose approximately 8 kg (approximately 8% of initial weight) with this approach, 
      accompanied by improvements in health and quality of life. To prevent weight
      regain, the Guidelines recommend a 1-year weight loss maintenance program that
      includes at least monthly counseling with a trained interventionist. Lifestyle
      interventions usually are delivered in-person; however, treatment increasingly is
      being disseminated through community- and commercial-based programs, as well as
      delivered by telephone, Internet, and smartphone platforms. These latter
      modalities expand treatment reach but usually produce smaller weight losses than 
      in-person interventions. The review concludes with an examination of challenges
      in weight management.

AB  - Obesity usually is associated with morbidity related to diabetes mellitus and
      cardiovascular diseases. However, there are many gastrointestinal and hepatic
      diseases for which obesity is the direct cause (eg, nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease) or is a significant risk factor, such as reflux esophagitis and
      gallstones. When obesity is a risk factor, it may interact with other mechanisms 
      and result in earlier presentation or complicated diseases. There are increased
      odds ratios or relative risks of several gastrointestinal complications of
      obesity: gastroesophageal reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's
      esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, erosive gastritis, gastric cancer,
      diarrhea, colonic diverticular disease, polyps, cancer, liver disease including
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma,
      gallstones, acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. Gastroenterologists are
      uniquely poised to participate in the multidisciplinary management of obesity as 
      physicians caring for people with obesity-related diseases, in addition to their 
      expertise in nutrition and endoscopic interventions.

AB  - The brain plays a key role in the controls of energy intake and expenditure, and 
      many genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system.
      Technological and conceptual advances in both basic and clinical neurosciences
      have expanded the traditional view of homeostatic regulation of body weight by
      mainly the hypothalamus to include hedonic controls of appetite by cortical and
      subcortical brain areas processing external sensory information, reward,
      cognition, and executive functions. Hedonic controls interact with homeostatic
      controls to regulate body weight in a flexible and adaptive manner that takes
      environmental conditions into account. This new conceptual framework has several 
      important implications for the treatment of obesity. Because much of this
      interactive neural processing is outside awareness, cognitive restraint in a
      world of plenty is made difficult and prevention and treatment of obesity should 
      be more rationally directed to the complex and often redundant mechanisms
      underlying this interaction.

AB  - As a consequence of the global rise in the prevalence of adolescent obesity, an
      unprecedented phenomenon of type 2 diabetes has emerged in pediatrics. At the
      heart of the development of type 2 diabetes lies a key metabolic derangement:
      insulin resistance (IR). Despite the widespread occurrence of IR affecting an
      unmeasurable number of youths worldwide, its pathogenesis remains elusive. IR in 
      obese youth is a complex phenomenon that defies explanation by a single pathway. 
      In this review we first describe recent data on the prevalence, severity, and
      racial/ethnic differences in pediatric obesity. We follow by elucidating the
      initiating events associated with the onset of IR, and describe a distinct
      "endophenotype" in obese adolescents characterized by a thin superficial layer of
      abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, increased visceral adipose tissue, marked 
      IR, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Further, we provide evidence for the cellular 
      and molecular mechanisms associated with this peculiar endophenotype and its
      relations to IR in the obese adolescent.

AB  - Obesity management requires a multidisciplinary approach, as there are many
      factors that contribute to the development of obesity, as well as the
      preservation of excess weight once it has been gained. Diet, exercise, and
      behavior modification are key components of treatment. In addition to lifestyle
      changes, weight gain secondary to medications is an important modifiable risk
      factor. Even after appropriate lifestyle modification, and medication adjustments
      (where possible) to avoid agents that can contribute to weight gain, many
      patients are still unable to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss.
      Pharmacotherapy for obesity management can fill an important role for these
      patients. This article will review medications that can lead to weight gain and
      potential alternatives, currently approved anti-obesity medications and best
      practices to individualize the selection process, and the use of testosterone in 
      men with hypogonadism and obesity.

AB  - Endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies (EBMT) are a new addition to the
      treatment arsenal for obesity. These include devices that are placed or removed
      via flexible endoscopy, and procedures that utilize instruments that require
      flexible endoscopy for the indications of weight loss or treatment of glucose
      intolerance (from pre-diabetes to diabetes). The EBMTs are generally divided into
      gastric and small bowel categories, and although individual EBMTs may have unique
      mechanisms of action, similar themes in proposed mechanism of action are seen in 
      the gastric and small bowel EBMTs, respectively. In this review we will describe 
      the therapies approved for use in the United States or currently in the process
      of obtaining approval for use in the United States. We will discuss potential
      mechanisms of action and examine safety and efficacy data.

AB  - The potential role of intestinal microbiota in the etiology of various human
      diseases has attracted massive attention in the last decade. As such, the
      intestinal microbiota has been advanced as an important contributor in the
      development of obesity and obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions, amongst
      others. Experiments in animal models have produced evidence for a causal role of 
      intestinal microbiota in the etiology of obesity and insulin resistance. However,
      with a few exceptions, such causal relation is lacking for humans and most
      publications merely report associations between intestinal microbial composition 
      and metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, the reciprocal
      relationship between the bacteria and these metabolic disorders remains a matter 
      of debate. The main objective of this review is to critically assess the driving 
      role of intestinal microbe composition in the etiology, prevention, and treatment
      of obesity and obesity-related metabolic dysfunction, including type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Association Between High-Avidity T-Cell Receptors, Induced by
      alpha-Fetoprotein-Derived Peptides, and Anti-Tumor Effects in Patients With
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are measured for
      surveillance and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a
      phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AFP-derived peptides as an
      anti-tumor vaccine for patients with advanced HCC, and characterized induction of
      AFP-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs). METHODS: We performed a prospective study
      of 15 patients with HCC seen at Kanazawa University Hospital in Japan from March 
      2010 through March 2012. Each patient was given a subcutaneous injection of 3 mg 
      AFP-derived peptides (AFP357 and AFP403) in an emulsion with incomplete Freund's 
      adjuvant every other week for at least 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated every 8
      weeks by radiologic imaging; adverse events and toxicities were categorized and
      graded using the common terminology criteria for adverse events. Criteria for
      discontinuation included unacceptable toxicities and disease progression defined 
      as progressive disease using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      criteria. Patients' immune responses were monitored using an interferon-gamma
      enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Peptide-specific TCRs were assessed using a rapid
      TCR cloning and evaluation system. The observation period was 730 days. A
      complete response was defined as the disappearance of all tumors; stable disease 
      was defined as tumors whose total diameter remained between >70% and <120% of the
      baseline measurement, without new lesions. RESULTS: We did not observe any
      serious adverse reactions to the peptides, which were well tolerated. Of the 15
      patients who received at least 3 injections, 5 (33%) had an immune response to
      the peptides. One of the 15 patients had a complete response and disease
      stabilized in 8 patients. In 4 of the 15 patients, we detected AFP357-specific
      CD8 T cells; we cloned 14 different TCRs with different avidities for the
      peptide. A TCR with the highest avidity was observed in the patient who achieved 
      a complete response for more than 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 1 trial,
      administration of AFP-derived peptides to 15 patients with HCC did not cause
      adverse events and produced T cells with receptors that reacted to the peptides; 
      1 patient had a complete response and tumor growth slowed in 8 patients. T cells 
      from the patient with a complete response expressed a highly functional TCR
      induced by the peptide vaccines. UMIN-CTR no: UMIN000003514.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the incidence of celiac disease in the
      general population of children in the United States. We aimed to estimate the
      cumulative incidence of celiac disease in adolescents born in the Denver
      metropolitan area. METHODS: We collected data on HLA-DR, DQ genotypes of 31,766
      infants, born from 1993 through 2004 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, from the
      Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young. Subjects with susceptibility genotypes 
      for celiac disease and type 1 diabetes were followed up for up to 20 years for
      development of tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA). Outcomes were the
      development of celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA) or celiac disease. CDA was
      defined as persistence of tTGA for at least 3 months or development of celiac
      disease. Celiac disease was defined based on detection of Marsh 2 or greater
      lesions in biopsy specimens or persistent high levels of tTGA. For each genotype,
      the cumulative incidence of CDA and celiac disease were determined. To estimate
      the cumulative incidence in the Denver general population, outcomes by each
      genotype were weighted according to the frequency of each of these genotypes in
      the general population. RESULTS: Of 1339 subjects followed up, 66 developed CDA
      and met criteria for celiac disease and 46 developed only CDA. Seropositivity for
      tTGA resolved spontaneously, without treatment, in 21 of the 46 subjects with
      only CDA (46%). The estimated cumulative incidence for CDA in the Denver general 
      population at 5, 10, and 15 years of age was 2.4%, 4.3%, and 5.1%, respectively, 
      and incidence values for celiac disease were 1.6%, 2.8%, and 3.1%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a 20-year prospective study of 1339 children with genetic risk
      factors for celiac disease, we found the cumulative incidence of CDA and celiac
      disease to be high within the first 10 years. Although more than 5% of children
      may experience a period of CDA, not all children develop celiac disease or
      require gluten-free diets.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ability of exocrine pancreatic cells to change the
      cellular phenotype is required for tissue regeneration upon injury, but also
      contributes to their malignant transformation and tumor progression. We
      investigated context-dependent signaling and transcription mechanisms that
      determine pancreatic cell fate decisions toward regeneration and malignancy. In
      particular, we studied the function and regulation of the inflammatory
      transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC1) in pancreatic
      cell plasticity and tissue adaptation. METHODS: We analyzed cell plasticity
      during pancreatic regeneration and transformation in mice with pancreas-specific 
      expression of a constitutively active form of NFATC1, or depletion of enhancer of
      zeste 2 homologue 2 (EZH2), in the context of wild-type or constitutively
      activate Kras, respectively. Acute and chronic pancreatitis were induced by
      intraperitoneal injection of caerulein. EZH2-dependent regulation of NFATC1
      expression was studied in mouse in human pancreatic tissue and cells by
      immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction. We used genetic and pharmacologic approaches of EZH2
      and NFATC1 inhibition to study the consequences of pathway disruption on
      pancreatic morphology and function. Epigenetic modifications on the NFATC1 gene
      were investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: NFATC1 was
      rapidly and transiently induced in early adaptation to acinar cell injury in
      human samples and in mice, where it promoted acinar cell transdifferentiation and
      blocked proliferation of metaplastic pancreatic cells. However, in late stages of
      regeneration, Nfatc1 was epigenetically silenced by EZH2-dependent histone
      methylation, to enable acinar cell redifferentiation and prevent organ atrophy
      and exocrine insufficiency. In contrast, oncogenic activation of KRAS signaling
      in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells reversed the EZH2-dependent effects on 
      the NFATC1 gene and was required for EZH2-mediated transcriptional activation of 
      NFATC1. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of human and mouse pancreatic cells and tissue,
      we identified context-specific epigenetic regulation of NFATc1 activity as an
      important mechanism of pancreatic cell plasticity. Inhibitors of EZH2 might
      therefore interfere with oncogenic activity of NFATC1 and be used in treatment of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: For 4 decades, stigmata of recent hemorrhage in patients with 
      nonvariceal lesions have been used for risk stratification and endoscopic
      hemostasis. The arterial blood flow that underlies the stigmata rarely is
      monitored, but can be used to determine risk for rebleeding. We performed a
      randomized controlled trial to determine whether Doppler endoscopic probe
      monitoring of blood flow improves risk stratification and outcomes in patients
      with severe nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. METHODS: In a
      single-blind study performed at 2 referral centers we assigned 148 patients with 
      severe nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (125 with ulcers, 19 with
      Dieulafoy's lesions, and 4 with Mallory Weiss tears) to groups that underwent
      standard, visually guided endoscopic hemostasis (control, n = 76), or endoscopic 
      hemostasis assisted by Doppler monitoring of blood flow under the stigmata (n =
      72). The primary outcome was the rate of rebleeding after 30 days; secondary
      outcomes were complications, death, and need for transfusions, surgery, or
      angiography. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the rates of lesion
      rebleeding within 30 days of endoscopic hemostasis in the control group (26.3%)
      vs the Doppler group (11.1%) (P = .0214). The odds ratio for rebleeding with
      Doppler monitoring was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.143-0.8565) and the
      number needed to treat was 7. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized controlled trial of
      patients with severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from ulcers or other
      lesions, Doppler probe guided endoscopic hemostasis significantly reduced 30-day 
      rates of rebleeding compared with standard, visually guided hemostasis.
      Guidelines for nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding should incorporate these
      results. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00732212 (CLIN-013-07F).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is still a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      development after eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with antiviral
      agents. We investigated genetic factors associated with the development of HCC in
      patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment for chronic HCV
      infection. METHODS: We obtained genomic DNA from 457 patients in Japan with a SVR
      to interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV infection from 2007 through 2015.
      We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a replication
      analysis of 79 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent
      set of 486 patients in Japan. The study end point was HCC diagnosis or
      confirmation of lack of HCC (at follow-up examinations until December 2014 in the
      GWAS cohort, and until January 2016 in the replication cohort). We collected
      clinical and laboratory data from all patients. We analyzed expression levels of 
      candidate gene variants in human hepatic stellate cells, rats with
      steatohepatitis caused by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet, and a
      mouse model of liver injury caused by administration of carbon tetrachloride. We 
      also analyzed expression levels in liver tissues of patients with chronic HCV
      infection with different stages of fibrosis or tumors vs patients without HCV
      infection (controls). RESULTS: We found a strong association between the SNP
      rs17047200, located within the intron of the tolloid like 1 gene (TLL1) on
      chromosome 4, and development of HCC; there was a genome-wide level of
      significance when the results of the GWAS and replication study were combined
      (odds ratio, 2.37; P = 2.66 x 10(-8)). Multivariate analysis showed rs17047200
      AT/TT to be an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 1.78; P = .008),
      along with male sex, older age, lower level of albumin, advanced stage of hepatic
      fibrosis, presence of diabetes, and higher post-treatment level of
      alpha-fetoprotein. Combining the rs17047200 genotype with other factors, we
      developed prediction models for HCC development in patients with mild or advanced
      hepatic fibrosis. Levels of TLL1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human hepatic stellate
      cells increased with activation. Levels of Tll1 mRNA increased in liver tissues
      of rodents with hepatic fibrogenesis compared with controls. Levels of TLL1 mRNA 
      increased in liver tissues of patients with progression of fibrosis. Gene
      expression levels of TLL1 short variants, including isoform 2, were higher in
      patients with rs17047200 AT/TT. CONCLUSIONS: In a GWAS, we identified the
      association between the SNP rs17047200, within the intron of TLL1, and
      development of HCC in patients who achieved an SVR to treatment for chronic HCV
      infection. We found levels of Tll1/TLL1 mRNA to be increased in rodent models of 
      liver injury and liver tissues of patients with fibrosis, compared with controls.
      We propose that this SNP might affect splicing of TLL1 mRNA, yielding short
      variants with high catalytic activity that accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis and
      carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine how rs17047200 affects
      TLL1 mRNA levels, splicing, and translation, as well as the prevalence of this
      variant among other patients with HCC. Tests for the TLL1 SNP might be used to
      identify patients at risk for HCC after an SVR to treatment of HCV infection.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Korean National Cancer Screening Program in Reducing Gastric
      Cancer Mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear whether screening for gastric cancer by upper 
      endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series examinations (looking at the
      upper and middle sections of the gastrointestinal tract by imaging techniques)
      reduces mortality. Nevertheless, the Korean National Cancer Screening Program for
      gastric cancer was launched in 1999 to screen individuals 40 years and older for 
      gastric cancer using these techniques. We evaluated the effectiveness of these
      techniques in gastric cancer detection and compared their effects on mortality in
      the Korean population. METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study using
      data from the Korean National Cancer Screening Program for gastric cancer since
      2002. A total of 16,584,283 Korean men and women, aged 40 years and older,
      comprised the cancer-free cohort. Case subjects (n = 54,418) were defined as
      individuals newly diagnosed with gastric cancer from January 2004 through
      December 2009 and who died before December 2012. Cases were matched with controls
      (subjects who were alive on the date of death of the corresponding case subject, 
      n = 217,672) for year of entry into the study cohort, age, sex, and socioeconomic
      status. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained via
      conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Compared with subjects who had
      never been screened, the overall OR for dying from gastric cancer among
      ever-screened subjects was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77-0.81). According to screening
      modality, the ORs of death from gastric cancer were 0.53 (95% CI, 0.51-0.56) for 
      upper endoscopy and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-1.01) for UGI series. As the number of
      endoscopic screening tests performed per subject increased, the ORs of death from
      gastric cancer decreased: 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.63), 0.32 (95% CI, 0.28-0.37), and
      0.19 (95% CI, 0.14-0.26) for once, twice, and 3 or more times, respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Within the Korean National Cancer Screening Program, patients who
      received an upper endoscopy were less likely to die from gastric cancer; no
      associations were found for UGI series.

TI  - Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase Promotes Liver Fibrosis and Tumor Development in Mice via
      a Wnt Positive-Signaling Loop by Stabilization of Low-Density
      Lipoprotein-Receptor-Related Proteins 5 and 6.
PG  - 1477-1491
LID - S0016-5085(17)30081-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) synthesizes monounsaturated
      fatty acids (MUFAs) and has been associated with the development of metabolic
      syndrome, tumorigenesis, and stem cell characteristics. We investigated whether
      and how SCD promotes liver fibrosis and tumor development in mice. METHODS:
      Rodent primary hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), mouse liver tumor-initiating stem
      cell-like cells (TICs), and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines were 
      exposed to Wnt signaling inhibitors and changes in gene expression patterns were 
      analyzed. We assessed the functions of SCD by pharmacologic and conditional
      genetic manipulation in mice with hepatotoxic or cholestatic induction of liver
      fibrosis, orthotopic transplants of TICs, or liver tumors induced by
      administration of diethyl nitrosamine. We performed bioinformatic analyses of SCD
      expression in HCC vs nontumor liver samples collected from patients, and
      correlated levels with HCC stage and patient mortality. We performed nano-bead
      pull-down assays, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, computational
      modeling, and ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analyses to identify
      MUFA-interacting proteins. We examined the effects of SCD inhibition on Wnt
      signaling, including the expression and stability of low-density
      lipoprotein-receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5 and LRP6), by immunoblot and 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. RESULTS: SCD was overexpressed
      in activated HSC and HCC cells from patients; levels of SCD messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      correlated with HCC stage and patient survival time. In rodent HSCs and TICs, the
      Wnt effector beta-catenin increased sterol regulatory element binding protein
      1-dependent transcription of Scd, and beta-catenin in return was stabilized by
      MUFAs generated by SCD. This loop required MUFA inhibition of binding of
      Ras-related nuclear protein 1 (Ran1) to transportin 1 and reduced nuclear import 
      of elav-like protein 1 (HuR), increasing cytosolic levels of HuR and HuR-mediated
      stabilization of mRNAs encoding LRP5 and LRP6. Genetic disruption of Scd and
      pharmacologic inhibitors of SCD reduced HSC activation and TIC self-renewal and
      attenuated liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis in mice. Conditional disruption of
      Scd2 in activated HSCs prevented growth of tumors from TICs and reduced the
      formation of diethyl nitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. CONCLUSIONS: In
      rodent HSCs and TICs, we found SCD expression to be regulated by Wnt-beta-catenin
      signaling, and MUFAs produced by SCD provided a forward loop to amplify Wnt
      signaling via stabilization of Lrp5 and Lrp6 mRNAs, contributing to liver
      fibrosis and tumor growth. SCD expressed by HSCs promoted liver tumor development
      in mice. Components of the identified loop linking HSCs and TICs might be
      therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis and tumors.

TI  - Efficacy of Ledipasvir Plus Sofosbuvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in Patients With
      Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 2 Infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 have 
      high rates of response to treatment with sofosbuvir and ribavirin. However,
      ribavirin is associated with hemolytic events and is poorly tolerated by some
      patients. We evaluated the effectiveness of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in
      treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2, comparing
      12 versus 8 weeks of treatment. METHODS: This Phase 2, open-label study included 
      2 cohorts in New Zealand. The first received a fixed-dose combination tablet of
      ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (90/400 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. If this cohort had a
      90% rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) 4 weeks after treatment, a second 
      cohort receiving 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir was to be enrolled. The primary
      endpoint in both cohorts was the percentage of patients with HCV RNA <15 IU/mL 12
      weeks after therapy (SVR12). RESULTS: SVR12 rates were 96% (25/26; 95% CI,
      80%-100%) for 12 weeks and 74% (20/27; 95% CI, 54%-89%) for 8 weeks of
      ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. The single patient receiving 12 weeks of
      ledipasvir-sofosbuvir who did not reach SVR12 did not complete treatment because 
      of withdrawing consent after receiving 1 dose of study drug. Six of the 7
      patients who did not reach SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment experienced virologic
      relapse after stopping therapy. The most common adverse events were headache (26%
      of patients), fatigue (21%), and nausea (17%). No patients discontinued treatment
      because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: For treatment-naive and -experienced
      patients, ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 12 weeks is highly effective for the
      treatment of HCV genotype 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02202980).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a consequence of
      defects in diverse metabolic pathways that involve hepatic accumulation of
      triglycerides. Features of these aberrations might determine whether NAFLD
      progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We investigated whether the
      diverse defects observed in patients with NAFLD are caused by different NAFLD
      subtypes with specific serum metabolomic profiles, and whether these can
      distinguish patients with NASH from patients with simple steatosis. METHODS: We
      collected liver and serum from methionine adenosyltransferase 1a knockout
      (MAT1A-KO) mice, which have chronically low levels of hepatic
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and spontaneously develop steatohepatitis, as well as
      C57Bl/6 mice (controls); the metabolomes of all samples were determined. We also 
      analyzed serum metabolomes of 535 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (353 with
      simple steatosis and 182 with NASH) and compared them with serum metabolomes of
      mice. MAT1A-KO mice were also given SAMe (30 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks); liver
      samples were collected and analyzed histologically for steatohepatitis. RESULTS: 
      Livers of MAT1A-KO mice were characterized by high levels of triglycerides,
      diglycerides, fatty acids, ceramides, and oxidized fatty acids, as well as low
      levels of SAMe and downstream metabolites. There was a correlation between liver 
      and serum metabolomes. We identified a serum metabolomic signature associated
      with MAT1A-KO mice that also was present in 49% of the patients; based on this
      signature, we identified 2 NAFLD subtypes. We identified specific panels of
      markers that could distinguish patients with NASH from patients with simple
      steatosis for each subtype of NAFLD. Administration of SAMe reduced features of
      steatohepatitis in MAT1A-KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of serum
      metabolomes of patients with NAFLD and MAT1A-KO mice with steatohepatitis, we
      identified 2 major subtypes of NAFLD and markers that differentiate steatosis
      from NASH in each subtype. These might be used to monitor disease progression and
      identify therapeutic targets for patients.

TI  - Mucosal Expression of Type 2 and Type 17 Immune Response Genes Distinguishes
      Ulcerative Colitis From Colon-Only Crohn's Disease in Treatment-Naive Pediatric
      Patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy regarding the role of the type 2 immune
      response in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC)-few data are available
      from treatment-naive patients. We investigated whether genes associated with a
      type 2 immune response in the intestinal mucosa are up-regulated in
      treatment-naive pediatric patients with UC compared with patients with Crohn's
      disease (CD)-associated colitis or without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 
      whether expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: We used
      a real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction array to
      analyze messenger RNA (mRNA) expression patterns in rectal mucosal samples from
      138 treatment-naive pediatric patients with IBD and macroscopic rectal disease,
      as well as those from 49 children without IBD (controls), enrolled in a
      multicenter prospective observational study from 2008 to 2012. Results were
      validated in real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction analyses of rectal RNA from an independent cohort of 34 pediatric
      patients with IBD and macroscopic rectal disease and 17 controls from Cincinnati 
      Children's Hospital Medical Center. RESULTS: We measured significant increases in
      mRNAs associated with a type 2 immune response (interleukin [IL]5 gene, IL13, and
      IL13RA2) and a type 17 immune response (IL17A and IL23) in mucosal samples from
      patients with UC compared with patients with colon-only CD. In a regression
      model, increased expression of IL5 and IL17A mRNAs distinguished patients with UC
      from patients with colon-only CD (P = .001; area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve, 0.72). We identified a gene expression pattern in rectal
      tissues of patients with UC, characterized by detection of IL13 mRNA, that
      predicted clinical response to therapy after 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 6.469;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 1.553-26.94), clinical response after 12 months
      (OR, 6.125; 95% CI, 1.330-28.22), and remission after 12 months (OR, 5.333; 95%
      CI, 1.132-25.12). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of rectal tissues from
      treatment-naive pediatric patients with IBD, we observed activation of a type 2
      immune response during the early course of UC. We were able to distinguish
      patients with UC from those with colon-only CD based on increased mucosal
      expression of genes that mediate type 2 and type 17 immune responses. Increased
      expression at diagnosis of genes that mediate a type 2 immune response is
      associated with response to therapy and remission in pediatric patients with UC.

TI  - Farnesoid X Receptor Activation Promotes Hepatic Amino Acid Catabolism and
      Ammonium Clearance in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4 (NR1H4 or
      farnesoid X receptor [FXR]) regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and
      catabolism. FXR also regulates postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism. We
      performed quantitative proteomic analyses of liver tissues from mice to evaluate 
      these functions and investigate whether FXR regulates amino acid metabolism.
      METHODS: To study the role of FXR in mouse liver, we used mice with a disruption 
      of Nr1h4 (FXR-knockout mice) and compared them with floxed control mice. Mice
      were gavaged with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid or vehicle for 11 days.
      Proteome analyses, as well as targeted metabolomics and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation, were performed on the livers of these mice. Primary rat
      hepatocytes were used to validate the role of FXR in amino acid catabolism by
      gene expression and metabolomics studies. Finally, control mice and mice with
      liver-specific disruption of Nr1h4 (liver FXR-knockout mice) were re-fed with a
      high-protein diet after 6 hours fasting and gavaged a (15)NH4Cl tracer. Gene
      expression and the metabolome were studied in the livers and plasma from these
      mice. RESULTS: In livers of control mice and primary rat hepatocytes, activation 
      of FXR with obeticholic acid increased expression of proteins that regulate amino
      acid degradation, ureagenesis, and glutamine synthesis. We found FXR to bind to
      regulatory sites of genes encoding these proteins in control livers. Liver
      tissues from FXR-knockout mice had reduced expression of urea cycle proteins, and
      accumulated precursors of ureagenesis, compared with control mice. In liver
      FXR-knockout mice on a high-protein diet, the plasma concentration of newly
      formed urea was significantly decreased compared with controls. In addition,
      liver FXR-knockout mice had reduced hepatic expression of enzymes that regulate
      ammonium detoxification compared with controls. In contrast, obeticholic acid
      increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in ureagenesis compared
      with vehicle in C57Bl/6 mice. CONCLUSIONS: In livers of mice, FXR regulates amino
      acid catabolism and detoxification of ammonium via ureagenesis and glutamine
      synthesis. Failure of the urea cycle and hyperammonemia are common in patients
      with acute and chronic liver diseases; compounds that activate FXR might promote 
      ammonium clearance in these patients.

TI  - Timing Affects Measurement of Portal Pressure Gradient After Placement of
      Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts in Patients With Portal
      Hypertension.
PG  - 1358-1365
LID - S0016-5085(17)30051-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A reduction in portal pressure gradient (PPG) to <12 mm Hg
      after placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
      correlates with the absence of further bleeding or ascites at follow-up
      examinations of patients with cirrhosis. The PPG is usually measured immediately 
      after placement of the TIPS, when different circumstances can affect PPG values, 
      which could affect determination of risk for decompensation. We investigated
      variations in PPG measurements collected at different time points after TIPS,
      aiming to identify a time point after which PPG values were best maintained.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 155 consecutive patients with
      severe complications of portal hypertension who received placement of TIPS from
      January 2008 through October 2015; patients were followed until March 2016. We
      compared PPG values measured at different time points and under different
      conditions: immediately after placement of TIPS (immediate PPG); at least 24
      hours after placement to TIPS into hemodynamically stable patients, without
      sedation (early PPG); and again 1 month after TIPS placement (late PPG). RESULTS:
      The immediate PPG differed significantly from the early PPG, regardless of
      whether the TIPS was placed using general anesthesia (8.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg vs 10 +/-
      3.5 mm Hg; P = .015) or deep sedation (12 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 10.5 +/- 4 mm Hg; P
      <.001). In considering the 12 mm Hg threshold, concordance between immediate PPG 
      and early PPG values was poor. However, there was no significant difference
      between mean early PPG and late PPG values (8.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg vs 8 +/- 3 mm Hg), 
      or between proportions of patients with early PPG vs late PPG values <12 mm Hg
      threshold. Maintenance of a PPG value <12 mm Hg during the follow-up period was
      associated with a lower risk of recurrent or de novo variceal bleeding or ascites
      (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 0.27; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In a retrospective study of patients with PPG values measured at different time
      points after TIPS placement, we found measurements of PPG in awake,
      hemodynamically stable patients at least 24 hours after TIPS to be the best
      maintained values. Our findings support the concept that PPG value <12 mm Hg
      after TIPS placement is associated with reduced risk of bleeding and ascites.

TI  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Induces Intracellular Cholesterol Biosynthesis in
      Colon Cells to Induce Proliferation and Causes Dysplasia in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stool samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have 
      a higher abundance of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius than stool from individuals
      without CRC, based on metagenome sequencing. We investigated whether P anaerobius
      contributes to colon tumor formation in mice and its possible mechanisms of
      carcinogenesis. METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction
      analyses to measure P anaerobius in 112 stool samples and 255 colon biopsies from
      patients with CRC or advanced adenoma and from healthy individuals (controls)
      undergoing colonoscopy examination at hospitals in Hong Kong and Beijing. C57BL/6
      mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by a single dose of
      azoxymethane, to induce colon tumor formation. Three days later, mice were given 
      P anaerobius or Esherichia coli MG1655 (control bacteria), via gavage, for 6
      weeks. Some mice were also given the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
      oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Intestine tissues were collected and analyzed
      histologically. The colon epithelial cell line NCM460 and colon cancer cell lines
      HT-29 and Caco-2 were exposed to P anaerobius or control bacteria; cells were
      analyzed by immunoblot, proliferation, and bacterial attachment analyses and
      compared in gene expression profiling studies. Gene expression was knocked down
      in these cell lines with small interfering RNAs. RESULTS: P anaerobius was
      significantly enriched in stool samples from patients with CRC and in biopsies
      from patients with colorectal adenoma or CRC compared with controls. Mice
      depleted of bacteria and exposed to azoxymethane and P anaerobius had a higher
      incidence of intestinal dysplasia (63%) compared with mice not given the bacteria
      (8.3%; P < .01). P anaerobius mainly colonized the colon compared with the rest
      of the intestine. Colon cells exposed to P anaerobius had significantly higher
      levels of proliferation than control cells. We found genes that regulate
      cholesterol biosynthesis, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and AMP-activated
      protein kinase signaling to be significantly up-regulated in cells exposed to P
      anaerobius. Total cholesterol levels were significantly increased in colon cell
      lines exposed to P anaerobius via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding
      protein 2. P anaerobius interacted with TLR2 and TLR4 to increase intracellular
      levels of reactive oxidative species, which promoted cholesterol synthesis and
      cell proliferation. Depletion of reactive oxidative species by knockdown of TLR2 
      or TLR4, or incubation of cells with an antioxidant, prevented P anaerobius from 
      inducing cholesterol biosynthesis and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of P
      anaerobius are increased in human colon tumor tissues and adenomas compared with 
      non-tumor tissues; this bacteria increases colon dysplasia in a mouse model of
      CRC. P anaerobius interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 on colon cells to increase levels 
      of reactive oxidative species, which promotes cholesterol synthesis and cell
      proliferation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) increase the risk of
      colorectal cancer. Surveillance colonoscopy with chromoendoscopy is recommended, 
      but conventional forward-viewing colonoscopy (FVC) detects dysplasia with low
      levels of sensitivity. Full-spectrum endoscopy (FUSE) incorporates 2 additional
      lateral cameras to the forward camera of the colonoscope, allowing endoscopists
      to view behind folds and in blind spots, which might increase dysplasia
      detection. We compared FUSE vs FVC in the detection of dysplasia in patients with
      IBDs. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, cross-over, tandem
      colonoscopy study comparing FVC vs FUSE in 52 subjects with IBD undergoing
      surveillance for neoplasia in Australia (23 with Crohn's colitis, 29 with
      ulcerative colitis; median age, 45.0 y; 60% male; mean IBD duration, 16.4 y). All
      subjects met national IBD surveillance inclusion criteria; 27 were assigned
      randomly to groups that underwent FVC followed by FUSE, and 25 were assigned to
      groups that underwent FUSE followed by FVC. All procedures were performed from
      February 2014 through December 2015. Random biopsy specimens were collected and
      visible lesions were collected; all were analyzed histologically. The primary end
      point was dysplasia missed by the first colonoscopy detected by the second
      colonoscopy. Dysplasia was diagnosed by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist
      blinded to the colonoscope allocation in consensus with a second expert
      pathologist. RESULTS: FVC missed 71.4% of dysplastic lesions per lesion whereas
      FUSE missed 25.0% per lesion (P = .0001); FVC missed 75.0% of dysplastic lesions 
      per subject and FUSE missed 25.0% per subject (P = .046). FUSE identified a mean 
      of 0.37 dysplastic lesions and FVC identified a mean of 0.13 dysplastic lesions
      (P = .044). The total colonoscopy times were similar (21.2 min for FUSE vs 19.1
      min for FVC; P = .32), but withdrawal time was significantly longer for FUSE
      (15.8 min) than for FVC (12.0 min) (P = .03). Correcting for per-unit withdrawal 
      time, the mean dysplasia miss rate per subject was significantly lower for FUSE
      (0.19) than for FVC (0.83; P < .0001). Targeted tissue acquisition identified
      significantly more dysplastic lesions than random biopsies (P < .0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective cross-over study of IBD patients undergoing
      surveillance colonoscopy, we found panoramic views obtained by full-spectrum
      endoscopy increased the number of dysplastic lesions detected, compared with
      conventional forward-viewing colonoscopy. Trial no: ACTRN12616000047493.

TI  - Autophagy Is Required for Activation of Pancreatic Stellate Cells, Associated
      With Pancreatic Cancer Progression and Promotes Growth of Pancreatic Tumors in
      Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) change from a quiescent to
      activated state in the tumor environment and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM)
      molecules and cytokines to increase the aggressiveness of tumors. However, it is 
      not clear how PSCs are activated to produce these factors, or whether this
      process can be inhibited. PSCs have morphologic and functional similarities to
      hepatic stellate cells, which undergo autophagy to promote fibrosis and tumor
      growth. We investigated whether autophagy activates PSCs, which promotes
      development of the tumor stroma and growth of pancreatic tumors in mice. METHODS:
      We used immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry to analyze
      pancreatic tumor specimens from 133 patients who underwent pancreatectomy in
      Japan from 2000 to 2009. PSCs were cultured from pancreatic tumor tissues or
      tissues of patients with chronic pancreatitis; these were analyzed by
      immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblots, quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction, and in assays for invasiveness, proliferation, and
      lipid droplets. Autophagy was inhibited in PSCs by administration of chloroquine 
      or transfection with small interfering RNAs. Proteins were knocked down in
      immortalized PSCs by expression of small hairpin RNAs. Cells were transplanted
      into pancreatic tails of nude mice, and tumor growth and metastasis were
      quantified. RESULTS: Based on immunohistochemical analyses, autophagy was
      significantly associated with tumor T category (P = .018), histologic grade (P = 
      .001), lymph node metastases (P < .001), stage (P = .009), perilymphatic invasion
      (P = .001), and perivascular invasion (P = .003). Autophagy of PSCs was
      associated with shorter survival times of patients with pancreatic cancer. PSC
      expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, a marker of
      autophagosomes, was associated with poor outcomes (shorter survival time, disease
      recurrence) for patients with pancreatic cancer (relative risk of shorter
      survival time, 1.56). Immunoblots showed that PSCs from pancreatic tumor samples 
      expressed higher levels of markers of autophagy than PSCs from chronic
      pancreatitis samples. Inhibitors of autophagy increased the number of lipid
      droplets of PSCs, indicating a quiescent state of PSCs, and reduced their
      production of ECM molecules and interleukin 6, as well as their proliferation and
      invasiveness in culture. PSCs exposed to autophagy inhibitors formed smaller
      tumors in nude mice (P = .001) and fewer liver metastases (P = .018) with less
      peritoneal dissemination (P = .018) compared to PSCs not exposed to autophagy
      inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagic PSCs produce ECM molecules and interleukin 6 
      and are associated with shorter survival times and disease recurrence in patients
      with pancreatic cancer. Inhibitors of PSC autophagy might reduce pancreatic tumor
      invasiveness by altering the tumor stroma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cell therapy offers the potential to treat gastrointestinal
      motility disorders caused by diseased or absent enteric neurons. We examined
      whether neurons generated from transplanted enteric neural cells provide a
      functional innervation of bowel smooth muscle in mice. METHODS: Enteric neural
      cells expressing the light-sensitive ion channel, channelrhodopsin, were isolated
      from the fetal or postnatal mouse bowel and transplanted into the distal colon of
      3- to 4-week-old wild-type recipient mice. Intracellular electrophysiological
      recordings of responses to light stimulation of the transplanted cells were made 
      from colonic smooth muscle cells in recipient mice. Electrical stimulation of
      endogenous enteric neurons was used as a control. RESULTS: The axons of
      graft-derived neurons formed a plexus in the circular muscle layer. Selective
      stimulation of graft-derived cells by light resulted in excitatory and inhibitory
      junction potentials, the electrical events underlying contraction and relaxation,
      respectively, in colonic muscle cells. Graft-derived excitatory and inhibitory
      motor neurons released the same neurotransmitters as endogenous motor
      neurons-acetylcholine and a combination of adenosine triphosphate and nitric
      oxide, respectively. Graft-derived neurons also included interneurons that
      provided synaptic inputs to motor neurons, but the pharmacologic properties of
      interneurons varied with the age of the donors from which enteric neural cells
      were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric neural cells transplanted into the bowel give
      rise to multiple functional types of neurons that integrate and provide a
      functional innervation of the smooth muscle of the bowel wall. Circuits composed 
      of both motor neurons and interneurons were established, but the age at which
      cells are isolated influences the neurotransmitter phenotype of interneurons that
      are generated.

TI  - Activation of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1alpha Subunit Pathway in Steatotic
      Liver Contributes to Formation of Cholesterol Gallstones.
PG  - 1521-1535.e8

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha subunit (HIF1A) is a
      transcription factor that controls the cellular response to hypoxia and is
      activated in hepatocytes of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD). NAFLD increases the risk for cholesterol gallstone disease by unclear
      mechanisms. We studied the relationship between HIF1A and gallstone formation
      associated with liver steatosis. METHODS: We performed studies with mice with
      inducible disruption of Hif1a in hepatocytes via a Cre adenoviral vector
      (inducible hepatocyte-selective HIF1A knockout [iH-HIFKO] mice), and mice without
      disruption of Hif1a (control mice). Mice were fed a diet rich in cholesterol and 
      cholate for 1 or 2 weeks; gallbladders were collected and the number of
      gallstones was determined. Livers and biliary tissues were analyzed by histology,
      quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction,
      immunohistochemistry, and immunoblots. We measured concentrations of bile acid,
      cholesterol, and phospholipid in bile and rates of bile flow. Primary hepatocytes
      and cholangiocytes were isolated and analyzed. HIF1A was knocked down in Hepa1-6 
      cells with small interfering RNAs. Liver biopsy samples from patients with NAFLD,
      with or without gallstones, were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Control mice fed a diet rich in cholesterol
      and cholate developed liver steatosis with hypoxia; levels of HIF1A protein were 
      increased in hepatocytes around central veins and 90% of mice developed
      cholesterol gallstones. Only 20% of the iH-HIFKO mice developed cholesterol
      gallstones. In iH-HIFKO mice, the biliary lipid concentration was reduced by 36%,
      compared with control mice, and bile flow was increased by 35%. We observed
      increased water secretion from hepatocytes into bile canaliculi to mediate these 
      effects, resulting in suppression of cholelithogenesis. Hepatic expression of
      aquaporin 8 (AQP8) protein was 1.5-fold higher in iH-HIFKO mice than in control
      mice. Under hypoxic conditions, cultured hepatocytes increased expression of
      Hif1a, Hmox1, and Vegfa messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and down-regulated expression of 
      AQP8 mRNA and protein; AQP8 down-regulation was not observed in cells with
      knockdown of HIF1A. iH-HIFKO mice had reduced inflammation and mucin deposition
      in the gallbladder compared with control mice. Liver tissues from patients with
      NAFLD with gallstones had increased levels of HIF1A, HMOX1, and VEGFA mRNAs,
      compared with livers from patients with NAFLD without gallstones. CONCLUSIONS: In
      steatotic livers of mice, hypoxia up-regulates expression of HIF1A, which reduces
      expression of AQP8 and concentrates biliary lipids via suppression of water
      secretion from hepatocytes. This promotes cholesterol gallstone formation. Livers
      from patients with NAFLD and gallstones express higher levels of HIF1A than
      livers from patients with NAFLD without gallstones.

AB  - Health care is changing rapidly, so we must change with the times to develop more
      efficient, practical, cost-effective, and, importantly, high-quality methods to
      care for patients. We teach medical students that optimal patient care requires
      face-to-face interaction to collect information on the patient's history and
      perform the physical examination. However, management of many patients-especially
      those with chronic diseases-does not always require physical examination.
      Telemedicine offers an opportunity to take advantage of technology while
      leveraging the progressive push toward efficiency and value but also requires the
      belief that excellent patient care is not always provided in person. Telemedicine
      can include a variety of aspects of patient care adapted to be performed
      remotely, such as telemonitoring, tele-education, teleconsultation, and telecare.
      All of these have been evaluated in gastroenterology practice and have
      demonstrated feasibility and patient preference but have produced mixed results
      regarding patient outcomes. By combining telemedicine tools and new care models, 
      we can redesign chronic disease management to include fewer in-person visits when
      patients are well yet increase access for patients who need to be seen. This
      change could lead to higher-value care by improving the experience of care,
      decreasing costs, and improving the health of the population. Barriers include
      reimbursement, licensing, and fear of litigation. However, if we hope to meet the
      needs of patients within our changing health care system, telemedicine should be 
      incorporated into our strategy.

AB  - Mesenchymal cells in the intestine comprise a variety of cell types of diverse
      origins, functions, and molecular markers. They provide mechanical and structural
      support and have important functions during intestinal organogenesis,
      morphogenesis, and homeostasis. Recent studies of the human transcriptome have
      revealed their importance in the development of colorectal cancer, and studies
      from animal models have provided evidence for their roles in the pathogenesis of 
      colitis-associated cancer and sporadic colorectal cancer. Mesenchymal cells in
      tumors, called cancer-associated fibroblasts, arise via activation of resident
      mesenchymal cell populations and the recruitment of bone marrow-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells and fibrocytes. Cancer-associated fibroblasts have a
      variety of activities that promote colon tumor development and progression; these
      include regulation of intestinal inflammation, epithelial proliferation, stem
      cell maintenance, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastasis. 
      We review the intestinal mesenchymal cell-specific pathways that regulate these
      processes, with a focus on their roles in mediating interactions between
      inflammation and carcinogenesis. We also discuss how increasing our understanding
      of intestinal mesenchymal cell biology and function could lead to new strategies 
      to identify and treat colitis-associated cancers.

TI  - Steatorrhea and Hyperoxaluria in Severely Obese Patients Before and After
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.
PG  - 1055-1067.e3
LID - S0016-5085(17)30015-X [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hyperoxaluria after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is
      generally attributed to fat malabsorption. If hyperoxaluria is indeed caused by
      fat malabsorption, magnitudes of hyperoxaluria and steatorrhea should correlate. 
      Severely obese patients, prior to bypass, ingest excess dietary fat that can
      produce hyperphagic steatorrhea. The primary objective of the study was to
      determine whether urine oxalate excretion correlates with elements of fat balance
      in severely obese patients before and after RYGB. METHODS: Fat balance and urine 
      oxalate excretion were measured simultaneously in 26 severely obese patients
      before and 1 year after RYGB, while patients consumed their usual diet. At these 
      time points, stool and urine samples were collected. Steatorrhea and
      hyperoxaluria were defined as fecal fat >7 g/day and urine oxalate >40 mg/day.
      Differences were evaluated using paired 2-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Prior to RYGB,
      12 of 26 patients had mild to moderate steatorrhea. Average urine oxalate
      excretion was 61 mg/day; there was no correlation between fecal fat and urine
      oxalate excretion. After RYGB, 24 of 26 patients had steatorrhea and urine
      oxalate excretion averaged 69 mg/day, with a positive correlation between fecal
      fat and urine oxalate excretions (r = 0.71, P < .001). For each 10 g/day increase
      in fecal fat output, fecal water excretion increased only 46 mL/day. CONCLUSIONS:
      Steatorrhea and hyperoxaluria were common in obese patients before bypass, but
      hyperoxaluria was not caused by excess unabsorbed fatty acids. Hyperphagia,
      obesity, or metabolic syndrome could have produced this previously unrecognized
      hyperoxaluric state by stimulating absorption or endogenous synthesis of oxalate.
      Hyperoxaluria after RYGB correlated with steatorrhea and was presumably caused by
      excess fatty acids in the intestinal lumen. Because post-bypass steatorrhea
      caused little increase in fecal water excretion, most patients with steatorrhea
      did not consider themselves to have diarrhea. Before and after RYGB, high oxalate
      intake contributed to the severity of hyperoxaluria.

TI  - Changes in the Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Infection, Nonalcoholic
      Steatohepatitis, and Alcoholic Liver Disease Among Patients With Cirrhosis or
      Liver Failure on the Waitlist for Liver Transplantation.
PG  - 1090-1099.e1

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Concurrent to development of more effective drugs for
      treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, there has been an increase in the
      incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Data indicate that liver
      transplantation prolongs survival times of patient with acute hepatitis
      associated with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We compared data on disease
      prevalence in the population with data from liver transplantation waitlists to
      evaluate changes in the burden of liver disease in the United States. METHODS: We
      collected data on the prevalence of HCV from the 2010 and 2013-2014 cycles of the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We also collected data from the
      HealthCore Integrated Research Database on patients with cirrhosis and chronic
      liver failure (CLF) from 2006 through 2014, and data on patients who received
      transplants from the United Network for Organ Sharing from 2003 through 2015. We 
      determined percentages of new waitlist members and transplant recipients with HCV
      infection, stratified by indication for transplantation, modeling each calendar
      year as a continuous variable using the Spearman rank correlation, nonparametric 
      test of trends, and linear regression models. RESULTS: In an analysis of data
      from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2014), we found
      that the proportion of patients with a positive HCV antibody who had a positive
      HCV RNA was 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.55); this value was
      significantly lower than in 2010 (0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.73) (P = 
      .03). Data from the HealthCore database revealed significant changes (P < .05 for
      all) over time in percentages of patients with compensated cirrhosis (decreases
      in percentages of patients with cirrhosis from HCV or ALD, but increase in
      percentages of patients with cirrhosis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]),
      CLF (decreases in percentages of patients with CLF from HCV or ALD, with an
      almost 3-fold increase in percentage of patients with CLF from NASH), and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (decreases in percentages of patients with HCC
      from HCV or ALD and a small increase in HCC among persons with NASH). Data from
      the United Network for Organ Sharing revealed that among patients new to the
      liver transplant waitlist, or undergoing liver transplantation, for CLF, there
      was a significant decrease in the percentage with HCV infection and increases in 
      percentages of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or ALD. Among
      patients new to the liver transplant waitlist or undergoing liver transplantation
      for HCC, proportions of those with HCV infection, nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease, or ALD did not change between 2003 and 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis
      of 3 different databases (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
      HealthCore, and United Network for Organ Sharing), we found the proportion of
      patients on the liver transplant waitlist or undergoing liver transplantation for
      chronic HCV infection to be decreasing and fewer patients to have cirrhosis or
      CLF. However, the percentages of patients on the waitlist or receiving liver
      transplants for NASH or ALD are increasing, despite different relative burdens of
      disease among the entire population of patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is a challenge to deliver nucleic acids to gastrointestinal
      (GI) tissues due to their size and need for intracellular delivery. They are also
      extremely susceptible to degradation by nucleases, which are ubiquitous in the GI
      tract. We investigated whether ultrasound, which can permeabilize tissue through 
      a phenomenon known as transient cavitation, can be used to deliver RNA to the
      colonic mucosa of living mice. METHODS: We investigated delivery of fluorescently
      labeled permeants to colon tissues of Yorkshire pigs ex vivo and mice in vivo.
      Colon tissues were collected and fluorescence was measured by confocal
      microscopy. We then evaluated whether ultrasound is effective in delivering small
      interfering (si)RNA to C57BL/6 mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. 
      Some mice were given siRNA against tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) mRNA for 6 days;
      colon tissues were collected and analyzed histologically and TNF protein levels
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Feces were collected and assessed 
      for consistency and occult bleeding. We delivered mRNA encoding firefly
      luciferase to colons of healthy C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Exposure of ex vivo pig
      colon tissues to 20 kHz ultrasound for 1 minute increased the level of delivery
      of 3 kDa dextran 7-fold compared with passive diffusion (P = .037); 40 kHz
      ultrasound application for 0.5 seconds increased the delivery 3.3-fold in living 
      mice (P = .041). Confocal microscopy analyses of colon tissues from pigs revealed
      regions of punctuated fluorescent dextran signal, indicating intracellular
      delivery of macromolecules. In mice with colitis, ultrasound delivery of
      unencapsulated siRNA against Tnf mRNA reduced protein levels of TNF in colon
      tissues, compared with mice with colitis given siRNA against Tnf mRNA without
      ultrasound (P </= .014), and reduced features of inflammation (P </= 4.1 x
      10(-5)). Separately, colons of mice administered an mRNA encoding firefly
      luciferase with ultrasound and the D-luciferin substrate had levels of
      bioluminescence 11-fold greater than colons of mice given the mRNA alone (P =
      .0025). Ultrasound exposures of 40 kHz ultrasound for 0.5 seconds were well
      tolerated, even in mice with acute colitis. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound can be used
      to deliver mRNAs and siRNAs to the colonic mucosa of mice and knock down
      expression of target mRNAs.

      Responses During Regeneration of Mouse Liver.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) increases
      the protein folding burden at the endoplasmic reticulum of remnant hepatocytes,
      resulting in induction of the unfolded protein response. We investigated the role
      of the core unfolded protein response transcription factor X-box binding protein 
      1 (XBP1) in liver regeneration using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation
      analysis. METHODS: We performed studies with C57Bl6-J (control) and interleukin
      6-knockout mice. Mice underwent PH or sham surgeries. In some mice, hepatic
      expression of XBP1 was knocked down by injection of adenoviral vectors encoding
      small hairpin RNAs against Xbp1 messenger RNA. Liver tissues were collected
      before surgery and at 6 and 48 hours after surgery and analyzed by chromatin
      immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. We also performed functional analyses
      of HepG2 cells. RESULTS: Expression of XBP1 by hepatocytes increased immediately 
      after PH (priming phase of liver regeneration) in control mice, but this effect
      was delayed in interleukin 6-deficient mice. In mice with knockdown of XBP1, we
      observed of liver tissue persistent endoplasmic reticulum stress, defects in
      acute-phase response, and increased hepatocellular damage, compared with control 
      mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of liver tissue showed that at 6
      hours after PH, liver XBP1 became bound to a large set of genes implicated in
      proteostasis, the acute-phase response, metabolism, and the DNA damage response
      (DDR). At this time point, XBP1 bound the promoter of the signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 gene (Stat3). Livers of XBP1-knockdown mice showed
      reduced expression of STAT3 and had lower levels of STAT3 phosphorylation at
      Ser727, a modification that promotes cell proliferation and the DDR. Regenerating
      livers from XBP1-knockdown mice expressed high levels of a marker of DNA
      double-strand breaks, phosphorylated histone 2A, member X (H2AX), compared with
      control mice. The inhibition of XBP1 expression caused a reduced up-regulation of
      DDR messenger RNAs in regenerating hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: In livers of mice, we
      found that PH induces expression of XBP1, and that this activity requires
      interleukin 6. XBP1 expression regulates the unfolded protein response,
      acute-phase response, and DDR in hepatocytes. In regenerating livers, XBP1
      deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Foodborne illness affects 15% of the US population each year, 
      and is a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated risk of,
      risk factors for, and outcomes of IBS after infectious enteritis. METHODS: We
      performed a systematic review of electronic databases from 1994 through August
      31, 2015 to identify cohort studies of the prevalence of IBS 3 months or more
      after infectious enteritis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the
      summary point prevalence of IBS after infectious enteritis, as well as relative
      risk (compared with individuals without infectious enteritis) and host- and
      enteritis-related risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 45 studies, comprising
      21,421 individuals with enteritis, followed for 3 months to 10 years for
      development of IBS. The pooled prevalence of IBS at 12 months after infectious
      enteritis was 10.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.2-14.1) and at more than 12 
      months after infectious enteritis was 14.5% (95% CI, 7.7-25.5). Risk of IBS was
      4.2-fold higher in patients who had infectious enteritis in the past 12 months
      than in those who had not (95% CI, 3.1-5.7); risk of IBS was 2.3-fold higher in
      individuals who had infectious enteritis more than 12 months ago than in
      individuals who had not (95% CI, 1.8-3.0). Of patients with enteritis caused by
      protozoa or parasites, 41.9% developed IBS, and of patients with enteritis caused
      by bacterial infection, 13.8% developed IBS. Risk of IBS was significantly
      increased in women (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1) and individuals with
      antibiotic exposure (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), anxiety (OR, 2; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9),
      depression (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9), somatization (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.7-6.0),
      neuroticism (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6-6.5), and clinical indicators of enteritis
      severity. There was a considerable level of heterogeneity among studies.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found >10% of patients 
      with infectious enteritis develop IBS later; risk of IBS was 4-fold higher than
      in individuals who did not have infectious enteritis, although there was
      heterogeneity among studies analyzed. Women-particularly those with severe
      enteritis-are at increased risk for developing IBS, as are individuals with
      psychological distress and users of antibiotics during the enteritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) catalyzes conversion of choline to
      phosphocholine and can contribute to carcinogenesis. Little is known about the
      role of CHKA in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We
      performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequence analyses of 9 paired HCC and
      non-tumor-adjacent tissues. We performed tissue chip analyses of 120 primary HCC 
      and non-tumor-adjacent tissues from patients who received surgery in Shanghai,
      China from January 2006 through December 2009; 48 sets of specimens (HCC and
      non-tumor-adjacent tissues) were also analyzed. CHKA gene copy number was
      quantified and findings were validated by quantitative reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction analysis. CHKA messenger RNA and protein levels were
      determined by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical, and immunoblot
      analyses. CHKA was examined in 2 hepatocyte cell lines and 7 HCC-derived cell
      lines, and knocked down with small interfering RNAs in 3 HCC cell lines. Cells
      were analyzed in proliferation, wound healing, migration, and invasion assays.
      Cells were injected into tail veins of mice and tumor growth and metastasis were 
      quantified. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to
      determine interactions between CHKA and the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. RESULTS: Levels of CHKA
      messenger RNA were frequently increased in HCC tissues compared with nontumor
      tissues; increased expression was associated with amplification at the CHKA loci.
      Tumors that expressed high levels of CHKA had more aggressive phenotypes, and
      patients with these tumors had shorter survival times after surgery compared to
      patients whose tumors expressed low levels of CHKA. HCC cell lines that stably
      overexpressed CHKA had higher levels of migration and invasion than control HCC
      cells, and formed larger xenograft tumors with more metastases in mice compared
      to HCC cells that did not overexpress CHKA. CHKA was required for physical
      interaction between EGFR and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2. This
      complex was required for HCC cells to form metastatic xenograft tumors in mice
      and to become resistant to EGFR inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: We found levels of CHKA 
      to be increased in human HCCs compared to nontumor tissues, and increased
      expression to be associated with tumor aggressiveness and reduced survival times 
      of patients. Overexpression of CHKA in HCC cell lines increased their
      invasiveness, resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and ability to form metastatic
      tumors in mice by promoting interaction of EGFR with mechanistic target of
      rapamycin complex 2.

TI  - Western Dietary Pattern Increases, and Prudent Dietary Pattern Decreases, Risk of
      Incident Diverticulitis in a Prospective Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dietary fiber is implicated as a risk factor for
      diverticulitis. Analyses of dietary patterns may provide information on risk
      beyond those of individual foods or nutrients. We examined whether major dietary 
      patterns are associated with risk of incident diverticulitis. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective cohort study of 46,295 men who were free of
      diverticulitis and known diverticulosis in 1986 (baseline) using data from the
      Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Each study participant completed a detailed
      medical and dietary questionnaire at baseline. We sent supplemental
      questionnaires to men reporting incident diverticulitis on biennial follow-up
      questionnaires. We assessed diet every 4 years using a validated food frequency
      questionnaire. Western (high in red meat, refined grains, and high-fat dairy) and
      prudent (high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) dietary patterns were
      identified using principal component analysis. Follow-up time accrued from the
      date of return of the baseline questionnaire in 1986 until a diagnosis of
      diverticulitis, diverticulosis or diverticular bleeding; death; or December 31,
      2012. The primary end point was incident diverticulitis. RESULTS: During 894,468 
      person years of follow-up, we identified 1063 incident cases of diverticulitis.
      After adjustment for other risk factors, men in the highest quintile of Western
      dietary pattern score had a multivariate hazard ratio of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.20-1.99)
      for diverticulitis compared to men in the lowest quintile. High vs low prudent
      scores were associated with decreased risk of diverticulitis (multivariate hazard
      ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91). The association between dietary patterns and
      diverticulitis was predominantly attributable to intake of fiber and red meat.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective cohort study of 46,295 men, a Western dietary
      pattern was associated with increased risk of diverticulitis, and a prudent
      pattern was associated with decreased risk. These data can guide dietary
      interventions for the prevention of diverticulitis.

TI  - Intestinal Farnesoid X Receptor Controls Transintestinal Cholesterol Excretion in
      Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of the intestine in the maintenance of cholesterol
      homeostasis increasingly is recognized. Fecal excretion of cholesterol is the
      last step in the atheroprotective reverse cholesterol transport pathway, to which
      biliary and transintestinal cholesterol excretion (TICE) contribute. The
      mechanisms controlling the flux of cholesterol through the TICE pathway, however,
      are poorly understood. We aimed to identify mechanisms that regulate and
      stimulate TICE. METHODS: We performed studies with C57Bl/6J mice, as well as with
      mice with intestine-specific knockout of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), mice
      that express an FXR transgene specifically in the intestine, and ABCG8-knockout
      mice. Mice were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with the FXR agonist
      PX20606, with or without the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe. Some
      mice with intestine-specific knockout of FXR were given daily injections of
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19. To determine fractional cholesterol absorption,
      mice were given intravenous injections of cholesterol D5 and oral cholesterol D7.
      Mice were given (13)C-acetate in drinking water for measurement of cholesterol
      synthesis. Bile cannulations were performed and biliary cholesterol secretion
      rates were assessed. In a separate set of experiments, bile ducts of male Wistar 
      rats were exteriorized, allowing replacement of endogenous bile by a model bile. 
      RESULTS: In mice, we found TICE to be regulated by intestinal FXR via induction
      of its target gene Fgf15 (FGF19 in rats and human beings). Stimulation of this
      pathway caused mice to excrete up to 60% of their total cholesterol content each 
      day. PX20606 and FGF19 each increased the ratio of muricholate:cholate in bile,
      inducing a more hydrophilic bile salt pool. The altered bile salt pool stimulated
      robust secretion of cholesterol into the intestinal lumen via the
      sterol-exporting heterodimer adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily G 
      member 5/8 (ABCG5/G8). Of note, the increase in TICE induced by PX20606 was
      independent of changes in cholesterol absorption. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrophilicity of 
      the bile salt pool, controlled by FXR and FGF15/19, is an important determinant
      of cholesterol removal via TICE. Strategies that alter bile salt pool composition
      might be developed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Transcript

TI  - Differentiation of Mouse Enteric Nervous System Progenitor Cells Is Controlled by
      Endothelin 3 and Requires Regulation of Ednrb by SOX10 and ZEB2.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Maintenance and differentiation of progenitor cells in the
      developing enteric nervous system are controlled by molecules such as the
      signaling protein endothelin 3 (EDN3), its receptor (the endothelin receptor type
      B [EDNRB]), and the transcription factors SRY-box 10 (SOX10) and zinc finger
      E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2). We used enteric progenitor cell (EPC) cultures
      and mice to study the roles of these proteins in enteric neurogenesis and their
      cross regulation. METHODS: We performed studies in mice with a Zeb2
      loss-of-function mutation (Zeb2(Delta)) and mice carrying a spontaneous recessive
      mutation that prevents conversion of EDN3 to its active form (Edn3(ls)). EPC
      cultures issued from embryos that expressed only wild-type Zeb2 (Zeb2(+/+) EPCs) 
      or were heterozygous for the mutation (Zeb2(Delta/+) EPCs) were exposed to EDN3; 
      we analyzed the effects on cell differentiation using immunocytochemistry. In
      parallel, Edn3(ls) mice were crossed with Zeb2(Delta/+)mice; intestinal tissues
      were collected from embryos for immunohistochemical analyses. We investigated
      regulation of the EDNRB gene in transactivation and chromatin immunoprecipitation
      assays; results were validated in functional rescue experiments using transgenes 
      expression in EPCs from retroviral vectors. RESULTS: Zeb2(Delta/+) EPCs had
      increased neuronal differentiation compared to Zeb2(+/+) cells. When exposed to
      EDN3, Zeb2(+/+) EPCs continued expression of ZEB2 but did not undergo any
      neuronal differentiation. Incubation of Zeb2(Delta/+) EPCs with EDN3, on the
      other hand, resulted in only partial inhibition of neuronal differentiation. This
      indicated that 2 copies of Zeb2 are required for EDN3 to prevent neuronal
      differentiation. Mice with combined mutations in Zeb2 and Edn3 (double mutants)
      had more severe enteric anomalies and increased neuronal differentiation compared
      to mice with mutations in either gene alone. The transcription factors SOX10 and 
      ZEB2 directly activated the EDNRB promoter. Overexpression of EDNRB in
      Zeb2(Delta/+) EPCs restored inhibition of neuronal differentiation, similar to
      incubation of Zeb2(+/+) EPCs with EDN3. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of cultured EPCs 
      and mice, we found that control of differentiation of mouse enteric nervous
      system progenitor cells by EDN3 requires regulation of Ednrb expression by SOX10 
      and ZEB2.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nosocomial infections with Clostridium difficile present a
      considerable problem despite numerous attempts by health care workers to reduce
      risk of transmission. Asymptomatic carriers of C difficile can spread their
      infection to other patients. We investigated the effects of asymptomatic carriers
      on nosocomial C difficile infections. METHODS: We performed a population-based
      prospective cohort study at 2 university hospitals in Denmark, screening all
      patients for toxigenic C difficile in the intestine upon admittance, from October
      1, 2012, to January 31, 2013. Screening results were blinded to patients, staff, 
      and researchers. Patients were followed during their hospital stay by daily
      registration of wards and patient rooms. The primary outcomes were rate of C
      difficile infection in exposed and unexposed patients and factors associated with
      transmission. RESULTS: C difficile infection was detected in 2.6% of patients not
      exposed to carriers and in 4.6% of patients exposed to asymptomatic carriers at
      the ward level (odds ratio for infection if exposed to carrier, 1.79; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.16-2.76). Amount of exposure correlated with risk of C
      difficile infection, from 2.2% in the lowest quartile to 4.2% in the highest
      quartile of exposed patients (P = .026). Combining the load of exposure to
      carriers and length of stay seemed to have an additive effect on the risk of
      contracting C difficile. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based prospective cohort
      study in Denmark, we found that asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic C difficile in
      hospitals increase risk of infection in other patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agents increase the risk of
      gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. We investigated which DOAC had the most favorable
      GI safety profile and compared differences among these drugs in age-related risk 
      of GI bleeding. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, propensity-matched study
      using administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse of privately
      insured individuals and Medicare Advantage enrollees. We created 3
      propensity-matched cohorts of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with
      incident exposure to dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban from October 1, 2010
      through February 28, 2015. We compared data on rivaroxaban vs dabigatran for
      31,574 patients, data on apixaban vs dabigatran for 13,084 patients, and data on 
      apixaban vs rivaroxaban for 13,130 patients. Cox proportional hazards models,
      stratified by age, were used to estimate rates of total GI bleeding. RESULTS:
      Baseline characteristics were well balanced among sub-cohorts. GI bleeding
      occurred more frequently in patients given rivaroxaban than dabigatran (hazard
      ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.45). Apixaban was
      associated with a lower risk of GI bleeding than dabigatran (HR, 0.39; 95% CI,
      0.27-0.58; P < .001) or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.49; P < .001).
      Rates of events for all DOACs increased among patients 75 years or older.
      Apixaban had a lower risk of association with GI bleeding in the very elderly
      than dabigatran (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.71) or rivaroxaban (HR, 0.39; 95% CI,
      0.25-0.61). Median times to GI bleeding were <90 days for apixaban and
      rivaroxaban and <120 days for dabigatran. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based
      study of patients receiving DOAC agents, we found apixaban had the most favorable
      GI safety profile and rivaroxaban the least favorable profile. GI bleeding events
      among patient aged 75 years or older taking DOACs increased with age; the risk
      was greatest among persons 75 years. Apixaban had the most favorable GI safety
      profile among all age groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G stimulatory protein 
      (Gsa), encoded by the guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha-stimulating gene 
      (Gnas, in mice), is expressed ubiquitously and mediates receptor-stimulated
      production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and activation of the protein kinase
      A signaling pathway. We investigated the roles of Gsa in vivo in smooth muscle
      cells of mice. METHODS: We performed studies of mice with Cre
      recombinase-mediated disruption of Gnas in smooth muscle cells (Gsa(SMKO) and
      SM22-CreER(T2), induced in adult mice by tamoxifen). Intestinal tissues were
      collected for histologic, biochemical, molecular, cell biology, and physiology
      analyses. Intestinal function was assessed in mice using the whole-gut transit
      time test. We compared gene expression patterns of intestinal smooth muscle from 
      mice with vs without disruption of Gnas. Biopsy specimens from ileum of patients 
      with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and age-matched control biopsies were 
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Disruption of Gnas in smooth muscle of
      mice reduced intestinal motility and led to death within 4 weeks.
      Tamoxifen-induced disruption of Gnas in adult mice impaired contraction of
      intestinal smooth muscle and peristalsis. More than 80% of these died within 3
      months of tamoxifen exposure, with features of intestinal pseudo-obstruction
      characterized by chronic intestinal dilation and dysmotility. Gsa deficiency
      reduced intestinal levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and transcriptional
      activity of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein 1
      (CREB1); this resulted in decreased expression of the forkhead box F1 gene
      (Foxf1) and protein, and contractile proteins, such as myosin heavy chain 11;
      actin, alpha2, smooth muscle, aorta; calponin 1; and myosin light chain kinase.
      We found decreased levels of Gsa, FOXF1, CREB1, and phosphorylated CREB1 proteins
      in intestinal muscle layers of patients with chronic intestinal
      pseudo-obstruction, compared with tissues from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Gsa is
      required for intestinal smooth muscle contraction in mice, and its levels are
      reduced in ileum biopsies of patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
      Mice with disruption of Gnas might be used to study human chronic intestinal
      pseudo-obstruction.

      Polymorphisms in HLA and Other Genes in a Genome-Wide Association Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to
      identify genetic risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from licensed 
      drugs without previously reported genetic risk factors. METHODS: We performed a
      GWAS of 862 persons with DILI and 10,588 population-matched controls. The first
      set of cases was recruited before May 2009 in Europe (n = 137) and the United
      States (n = 274). The second set of cases were identified from May 2009 through
      May 2013 from international collaborative studies performed in Europe, the United
      States, and South America. For the GWAS, we included only cases with patients of 
      European ancestry associated with a particular drug (but not flucloxacillin or
      amoxicillin-clavulanate). We used DNA samples from all subjects to analyze HLA
      genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms. After the discovery analysis was
      concluded, we validated our findings using data from 283 European patients with
      diagnosis of DILI associated with various drugs. RESULTS: We associated DILI with
      rs114577328 (a proxy for A*33:01 a HLA class I allele; odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.8; P = 2.4 x 10(-8)) and with rs72631567 on
      chromosome 2 (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6-2.5; P = 9.7 x 10(-9)). The association with
      A*33:01 was mediated by large effects for terbinafine-, fenofibrate-, and
      ticlopidine-related DILI. The variant on chromosome 2 was associated with DILI
      from a variety of drugs. Further phenotypic analysis indicated that the
      association between DILI and A*33:01 was significant genome wide for cholestatic 
      and mixed DILI, but not for hepatocellular DILI; the polymorphism on chromosome 2
      was associated with cholestatic and mixed DILI as well as hepatocellular DILI. We
      identified an association between rs28521457 (within the
      lipopolysaccharide-responsive vesicle trafficking, beach and anchor containing
      gene) and only hepatocellular DILI (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7; P = 4.8 x 10(-9)). 
      We did not associate any specific drug classes with genetic polymorphisms, except
      for statin-associated DILI, which was associated with rs116561224 on chromosome
      18 (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.0-9.5; P = 7.1 x 10(-9)). We validated the association
      between A*33:01 terbinafine- and sertraline-induced DILI. We could not validate
      the association between DILI and rs72631567, rs28521457, or rs116561224.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a GWAS of persons of European descent with DILI, we associated
      HLA-A*33:01 with DILI due to terbinafine and possibly fenofibrate and
      ticlopidine. We identified polymorphisms that appear to be associated with DILI
      from statins, as well as 2 non-drug-specific risk factors.

TI  - In Patients With Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis, Prednisolone Increases
      Susceptibility to Infection and Infection-Related Mortality, and Is Associated
      With High Circulating Levels of Bacterial DNA.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infections are common in patients with severe alcoholic
      hepatitis (SAH), but little information is available on how to predict their
      development or their effects on patients. Prednisolone is advocated for treatment
      of SAH, but can increase susceptibility to infection. We compared the effects of 
      infection on clinical outcomes of patients treated with and without prednisolone,
      and identified risk factors for development of infection in SAH. METHODS: We
      analyzed data from 1092 patients enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with prednisolone (40 mg daily) or
      pentoxifylline (400 mg 3 times each day) in patients with SAH. The 2 x 2
      factorial design led to 547 patients receiving prednisolone; 546 were treated
      with pentoxifylline. The trial was conducted in the United Kingdom from January
      2011 through February 2014. Data on development of infection were collected at
      evaluations performed at screening, baseline, weekly during admission, on
      discharge, and after 90 days. Patients were diagnosed with infection based on
      published clinical and microbiologic criteria. Risk factors for development of
      infection and effects on 90-day mortality were evaluated separately in patients
      treated with prednisolone (n = 547) and patients not treated with prednisolone (n
      = 545) using logistic regression. Pretreatment blood levels of bacterial DNA
      (bDNA) were measured in 731 patients. RESULTS: Of the 1092 patients in the study,
      135 had an infection at baseline, 251 developed infections during treatment, and 
      89 patients developed an infection after treatment. There was no association
      between pentoxifylline therapy and the risk of serious infection (P = .084),
      infection during treatment (P = .20), or infection after treatment (P = .27).
      Infections classified as serious were more frequent in patients treated with
      prednisolone (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-2.92; P =
      .002). There was no association between prednisolone therapy and infection during
      treatment (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.78-1.37; P = .80). However, a higher proportion
      (10%) of patients receiving prednisolone developed an infection after treatment
      than of patients not given prednisolone (6%) (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.07-2.69; P =
      .024). Development of infection was associated with increased 90-day mortality in
      patients with SAH treated with prednisolone, independent of model for end-stage
      liver disease or Lille score (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.41-4.30; P = .002). High
      circulating bDNA predicted infection that developed within 7 days of prednisolone
      therapy, independent of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and white blood cell
      count (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.80-12.17; P = .001). In patients who did not receive
      prednisolone, infection was not independently associated with 90-day mortality
      (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.54-1.62; P = .82) or levels of bDNA (OR, 0.83; 95% CI,
      0.39-1.75; P = .62). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAH given prednisolone are at
      greater risk for developing serious infections and infections after treatment
      than patients not given prednisolone, which may offset its therapeutic benefit.
      Level of circulating bDNA before treatment could identify patients at high risk
      of infection if given prednisolone; these data could be used to select therapies 
      for patients with SAH. EudraCT no: 2009-013897-42; Current Controlled Trials no:

AB  - Up to 10% of cases of gastric cancer are familial, but so far, only mutations in 
      CDH1 have been associated with gastric cancer risk. To identify genetic variants 
      that affect risk for gastric cancer, we collected blood samples from 28 patients 
      with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) not associated with mutations in
      CDH1 and performed whole-exome sequence analysis. We then analyzed sequences of
      candidate genes in 333 independent HDGC and non-HDGC cases. We identified 11
      cases with mutations in PALB2, BRCA1, or RAD51C genes, which regulate homologous 
      DNA recombination. We found these mutations in 2 of 31 patients with HDGC (6.5%) 
      and 9 of 331 patients with sporadic gastric cancer (2.8%). Most of these
      mutations had been previously associated with other types of tumors and partially
      co-segregated with gastric cancer in our study. Tumors that developed in patients
      with these mutations had a mutation signature associated with somatic homologous 
      recombination deficiency. Our findings indicate that defects in homologous
      recombination increase risk for gastric cancer.

      Are at Increased Risk for Progression to Neoplasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: For patients with Barrett's esophagus, the diagnosis of
      low-grade dysplasia (LGD) is subjective, and reported outcomes vary. We analyzed 
      data from a multicenter study of endoscopic therapy to identify factors
      associated with progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal
      adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with LGD of the esophagus. METHODS: We performed
      a retrospective analysis of data from 255 patients with a primary diagnosis of
      LGD (78% men; mean age, 63 years) who participated in a randomized controlled
      trial of surveillance vs radiofrequency ablation in Europe. Three expert
      pathologists independently reviewed baseline and subsequent LGD specimens. The
      presence and degree of dysplasia was separately recorded for each biopsy and
      classified according to the Vienna Classification system. The primary end point
      was development of HGD or EAC. We performed univariate logistic regression
      analyses to assess the association between outcomes and factors such as number of
      pathologists confirming LGD, multifocality of LGD, and persistence of LGD over
      time. RESULTS: Of the 255 patients, 45 (18%) developed HGD or EAC during a median
      42-month follow-up period (interquartile range, 25-61 months); patients were
      examined by a median 4 endoscopies (interquartile range, 3-6 endoscopies). The
      number of pathologists confirming LGD was strongly associated with progression to
      neoplasia; risk for progression increased greatly when all 3 pathologists agreed 
      on LGD (odds ratio, 47.14; 95% confidence interval, 13.10-169.70). When LGD was
      detected at baseline and confirmed by a subsequent endoscopy, the odds for
      progression to neoplasia also increased greatly (odds ratio, 9.28; 95% confidence
      interval, 4.39-19.64). Multifocal LGD was not significantly associated with
      progression to neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The number of pathologists confirming LGD 
      and persistence of LGD over time increase risk for development of HGD or EAC in
      patients with Barrett's esophagus and LGD. These simple, readily available
      variables can help stratify risk and select patients for prophylactic ablation
      therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many cancers in the proximal colon develop via from sessile
      serrated adenomas (SSAs), which have flat, subtle features that are difficult to 
      detect with conventional white-light colonoscopy. Many SSA cells have the V600E
      mutation in BRAF. We investigated whether this feature could be used with imaging
      methods to detect SSAs in patients. METHODS: We used phage display to identify a 
      peptide that binds specifically to SSAs, using subtractive hybridization with
      HT29 colorectal cancer cells containing the V600E mutation in BRAF and
      Hs738.St/Int cells as a control. Binding of fluorescently labeled peptide to
      colorectal cancer cells was evaluated with confocal fluorescence microscopy. Rats
      received intra-colonic 0.0086 mg/kg, 0.026 mg/kg, or 0.86 mg/kg peptide or
      vehicle and morbidity, mortality, and injury were monitored twice daily to assess
      toxicity. In the clinical safety study, fluorescently labeled peptide was
      topically administered, using a spray catheter, to the proximal colon of 25
      subjects undergoing routine outpatient colonoscopies (3 subjects were given 2.25 
      mumol/L and 22 patients were given 76.4 mumol/L). We performed blood cell count, 
      chemistry, liver function, and urine analyses approximately 24 hours after
      peptide administration. In the clinical imaging study, 38 subjects undergoing
      routine outpatient colonoscopies, at high risk for colorectal cancer, or with a
      suspected unresected proximal colonic polyp, were first evaluated by white-light 
      endoscopy to identify suspicious regions. The fluorescently labeled peptide (76.4
      mumol/L) was administered topically to proximal colon, unbound peptide was washed
      away, and white-light, reflectance, and fluorescence videos were recorded
      digitally. Fluorescence intensities of SSAs were compared with those of normal
      colonic mucosa. Endoscopists resected identified lesions, which were analyzed
      histologically by gastrointestinal pathologists (reference standard). We also
      analyzed the ability of the peptide to identify SSAs vs adenomas, hyperplastic
      polyps, and normal colonic mucosa in specimens obtained from the tissue bank at
      the University of Michigan. RESULTS: We identified the peptide sequence KCCFPAQ
      and measured an apparent dissociation constant of Kd = 72 nM and an apparent
      association time constant of K = 0.174 min(-1) (5.76 minutes). During
      fluorescence imaging of patients during endoscopy, regions of SSA had 2.43-fold
      higher mean fluorescence intensity than that for normal colonic mucosa.
      Fluorescence labeling distinguished SSAs from normal colonic mucosa with 89%
      sensitivity and 92% specificity. The peptide had no observed toxic effects in
      animals or patients. In the analysis of ex vivo specimens, peptide bound to SSAs 
      had significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity than to hyperplastic polyps.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a fluorescently labeled peptide that has no
      observed toxic effects in animals or humans and can be used for wide-field
      imaging of lesions in the proximal colon. It distinguishes SSAs from normal
      colonic mucosa with 89% sensitivity and 92% specificity. This targeted imaging
      method might be used in early detection of premalignant serrated lesions during
      routine colonoscopies. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02156557.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota might contribute to enteropathy associated with use of 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but there have been few human
      studies of this association. We performed a placebo-controlled study to determine
      whether a delayed-release antibiotic formulation (rifaximin-extended intestinal
      release [EIR]) prevents the development of intestinal lesions in subjects taking 
      daily NSAIDs. Sixty healthy volunteers (median age, 26 y; 42% female) were given 
      the NSAID diclofenac (75 mg twice daily) plus omeprazole (20 mg once daily), and 
      either rifaximin-EIR (400 mg) or placebo, twice daily for 14 days. Subjects were 
      assessed by videocapsule endoscopy at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment.
      The primary end point was the proportion of subjects developing at least 1
      small-bowel mucosal break at week 2. Secondary end points were the change in the 
      mean number of mucosal lesions and the number of subjects with large erosions
      and/or ulcers after 14 days of exposure. We detected mucosal breaks in 20% of
      subjects given rifaximin and in 43% of subjects given placebo (P = .05 in the
      post hoc sensitivity analysis). None of the subjects in the rifaximin group
      developed large lesions, compared with 9 subjects in the placebo group (P <
      .001). Our findings indicate that intestinal bacteria contribute to the
      development of NSAID-associated enteropathy in human beings. Clinical trial no:

TI  - Nutritional Wheat Amylase-Trypsin Inhibitors Promote Intestinal Inflammation via 
      Activation of Myeloid Cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) are nutritional
      activators of innate immunity, via activation of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
      on myeloid cells. We aimed to characterize the biologic activity of ATIs in
      various foods and their effect on intestinal inflammation. METHODS: We selected
      38 different gluten-containing and gluten-free products, either unprocessed (such
      as wheat, rye, barley, quinoa, amaranth, soya, lentils, and rice) or processed
      (such as pizza, pasta, bread, and biscuits). ATIs were extracted and their
      biological activities determined in TLR4-responsive mouse and human cell lines.
      Effects of oral ATIs on intestinal inflammation were determined in healthy
      C57BL/6 mice on a gluten-free or ATI-free diet and in mice given low-level
      polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid or dextran sodium sulfate to induce colitis.
      Parameters of innate and adaptive immune activation were determined in duodenum, 
      ileum, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. RESULTS: Modern gluten-containing
      staples had levels of TLR4-activating ATIs that were as much as 100-fold higher
      than in most gluten-free foods. Processed or baked foods retained ATI
      bioactivity. Most older wheat variants (such as Emmer or Einkorn) had lower
      bioactivity than modern (hexaploid) wheat. ATI species CM3 and 0.19 were the most
      prevalent activators of TLR4 in modern wheat and were highly resistant to
      intestinal proteolysis. Their ingestion induced modest intestinal myeloid cell
      infiltration and activation, and release of inflammatory mediators-mostly in the 
      colon, then in the ileum, and then in the duodenum. Dendritic cells became
      prominently activated in mesenteric lymph nodes. Concentrations of ATIs found in 
      a normal daily gluten-containing diet increased low-level intestinal
      inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Gluten-containing cereals have by far the highest
      concentrations of ATIs that activate TLR4. Orally ingested ATIs are largely
      resistant to proteases and heat, and increase intestinal inflammation by
      activating gut and mesenteric lymph node myeloid cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many patients with a < 1 cm segment of columnar metaplasia in 
      the distal esophagus, also called an irregular Z line, are encountered. These
      patients, often referred to as patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), are
      enrolled in surveillance programs. However, little is known about their risk of
      high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). We aimed to
      determine the incidence of HGD and EAC in patients with irregular Z line with
      intestinal metaplasia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter cohort
      study of patients who underwent endoscopic examination for BE at tertiary care
      referral centers in the United States and Europe. We analyzed data from 1791
      patients (mean age, 56 +/- 17 years) found to have non-dysplastic BE at the index
      endoscopy and after 1 year or more of follow-up. Patients were followed for a
      median of 5.9 years (interquartile range, 3.1-8.3 years). We calculated rates of 
      progression to HGD or EAC between groups of patients with irregular Z line (n =
      167) and those with BE of >/= 1 cm (n = 1624). RESULTS: A higher proportion of
      patients in the irregular Z-line group were female (26.3%) than in the BE group
      (14.8% female BE) (P <.001). A lower proportion of patients in the irregular
      Z-line group were smokers (33.5%) than in the BE group (52.6% smokers). None of
      the patients with irregular Z line developed HGD or EAC during a median follow-up
      period of 4.8 years (interquartile range, 3.2-8.3 years). All 71 incident cases
      of HGD or EAC developed in patients with BE of >/=1 cm in length. On multivariate
      analysis, patients with irregular Z line and patients with BE of >/= 1 cm did not
      differ significantly in age, race, or duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In a
      prospective, multicenter cohort study, we found that patients with irregular Z
      line do not develop HGD or esophageal cancer within 5 years after index
      endoscopy.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mediate tissue repair and might 
      be used to prevent or reduce liver fibrosis. However, little is known about the
      anti-fibrotic factors secreted from MSCs or their mechanisms. METHODS: Umbilical 
      cord-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) were differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells
      (hpUCMSCs), medium was collected, and secretome proteins were identified and
      quantified using nanochip-liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry. Liver fibrosis was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of 
      thioacetamide or CCl4; some mice were then given injections of secretomes or
      proteins. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology or polymerase
      chain reaction array to analyze changes in gene expression patterns. We analyzed 
      the effects of MSC secretomes and potential anti-fibrotic proteins on
      transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1)-mediated activation of human hepatic
      stellate cell (HSC) lines (hTert-HSC and LX2) and human primary HSCs. Liver
      tissues were collected from 16 patients with liver cirrhosis and 16 individuals
      without cirrhosis (controls) in Korea and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and
      immunoblots. RESULTS: In mice with fibrosis, accumulation of extracellular matrix
      proteins was significantly reduced 3 days after injecting secretomes from UCMSCs,
      and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs; numbers of activated HSCs that expressed
      the myogenic marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA, encoded by ACTA2
      [actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle]) were also reduced. Secretomes from UCMSCs, and
      to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs, reduced liver expression of multiple fibrotic 
      factors, collagens, metalloproteinases, TGFbeta, and Smad proteins in the TGFbeta
      signaling pathways. In HSC cell lines and primary HSCs, TGFbeta1-stimulated
      upregulation of alpha-SMA was significantly inhibited (and SMAD2 phosphorylation 
      reduced) by secretomes from UCMSCs, and to a greater extent from hpUCMSCs. We
      identified 32 proteins in secretomes of UCMSCs that were more highly concentrated
      in secretomes from hpUCMSCs and inhibited TGFbeta-mediated activation of HSCs.
      One of these, milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGE8), was a strong inhibitor of
      activation of human primary HSCs. We found MFGE8 to down-regulate expression of
      TGFbeta type I receptor by binding to alphavbeta3 integrin on HSCs and to be
      secreted by MSCs from umbilical cord, teeth, and bone marrow. In mice, injection 
      of recombinant human MFGE8 had anti-fibrotic effects comparable to those of the
      hpUCMSC secretome, reducing extracellular matrix deposition and HSC activation.
      Co-injection of an antibody against MFGE8 reduced the anti-fibrotic effects of
      the hpUCMSC secretome in mice. Levels of MFGE8 were reduced in cirrhotic liver
      tissue from patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: MFGE8 is an
      anti-fibrotic protein in MSC secretomes that strongly inhibits TGFbeta signaling 
      and reduces extracellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It has been a challenge to identify liver tumor suppressors or
      oncogenes due to the genetic heterogeneity of these tumors. We performed a
      genome-wide screen to identify suppressors of liver tumor formation in mice,
      using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide
      CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout screen of P53-null mouse embryonic liver progenitor
      cells that overexpressed MYC. We infected p53(-/-);Myc;Cas9 hepatocytes with the 
      mGeCKOa lentiviral library of 67,000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), targeting 20,611
      mouse genes, and transplanted the transduced cells subcutaneously into nude mice.
      Within 1 month, all the mice that received the sgRNA library developed
      subcutaneous tumors. We performed high-throughput sequencing of tumor DNA and
      identified sgRNAs increased at least 8-fold compared to the initial cell pool. To
      validate the top 10 candidate tumor suppressors from this screen, we collected
      data from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using the Cancer Genome
      Atlas and COSMIC databases. We used CRISPR to inactivate candidate tumor
      suppressor genes in p53(-/-);Myc;Cas9 cells and transplanted them subcutaneously 
      into nude mice; tumor formation was monitored and tumors were analyzed by
      histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice with liver-specific disruption of p53
      were given hydrodynamic tail-vein injections of plasmids encoding Myc and
      sgRNA/Cas9 designed to disrupt candidate tumor suppressors; growth of tumors and 
      metastases was monitored. We compared gene expression profiles of liver cells
      with vs without tumor suppressor gene disrupted by sgRNA/Cas9. Genes found to be 
      up-regulated after tumor suppressor loss were examined in liver cancer cell
      lines; their expression was knocked down using small hairpin RNAs, and tumor
      growth was examined in nude mice. Effects of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, U0126,
      and trametinib, or the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, were examined in human
      and mouse HCC cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 4 candidate liver tumor
      suppressor genes not previously associated with liver cancer (Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2,
      and B9d1). CRISPR-mediated knockout of Nf1, a negative regulator of RAS,
      accelerated liver tumor formation in mice. Loss of Nf1 or activation of RAS
      up-regulated the liver progenitor cell markers HMGA2 and SOX9. RAS pathway
      inhibitors suppressed the activation of the Hmga2 and Sox9 genes that resulted
      from loss of Nf1 or oncogenic activation of RAS. Knockdown of HMGA2 delayed
      formation of xenograft tumors from cells that expressed oncogenic RAS. In human
      HCCs, low levels of NF1 messenger RNA or high levels of HMGA2 messenger RNA were 
      associated with shorter patient survival time. Liver cancer cells with
      inactivation of Plxnb1, Flrt2, and B9d1 formed more tumors in mice and had
      increased levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using a CRISPR-based strategy, we identified Nf1, Plxnb1, Flrt2, and
      B9d1 as suppressors of liver tumor formation. We validated the observation that
      RAS signaling, via mitogen-activated protein kinase, contributes to formation of 
      liver tumors in mice. We associated decreased levels of NF1 and increased levels 
      of its downstream protein HMGA2 with survival times of patients with HCC.
      Strategies to inhibit or reduce HMGA2 might be developed to treat patients with
      liver cancer.

AB  - The use of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for colorectal cancer (CRC)
      screening is supported by randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness in cancer
      prevention and widely recommended by guidelines for this purpose. The fecal
      immunochemical test (FIT), as a direct measure of human hemoglobin in stool has a
      number of advantages relative to conventional FOBT and is increasingly used
      relative to that test. This review summarizes current evidence for FIT in
      colorectal neoplasia detection and the comparative effectiveness of FIT relative 
      to other commonly used CRC screening modalities. Based on evidence, guidance
      statements on FIT application were developed and quality metrics for program
      implementation proposed.

TI  - The Risks and Benefits of Long-term Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors: Expert Review 
      and Best Practice Advice From the American Gastroenterological Association.
PG  - 706-715
LID - S0016-5085(17)30091-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2017.01.031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated
      with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), focusing on long-term use of
      PPIs for three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),
      Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
      bleeding prophylaxis. METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this review are
      based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the
      Cochrane library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we
      queried clinicaltrials.gov. To assess the quality of evidence, we used a modified
      approach based on the GRADE Working Group. The Clinical Practice Updates
      Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association has reviewed these
      recommendations. Best Practice Advice 1: Patients with GERD and acid-related
      complications (ie, erosive esophagitis or peptic stricture) should take a PPI for
      short-term healing, maintenance of healing, and long-term symptom control. Best
      Practice Advice 2: Patients with uncomplicated GERD who respond to short-term
      PPIs should subsequently attempt to stop or reduce them. Patients who cannot
      reduce PPIs should consider ambulatory esophageal pH/impedance monitoring before 
      committing to lifelong PPIs to help distinguish GERD from a functional syndrome. 
      The best candidates for this strategy may be patients with predominantly atypical
      symptoms or those who lack an obvious predisposition to GERD (eg, central
      obesity, large hiatal hernia). Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with Barrett's
      esophagus and symptomatic GERD should take a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 
      4: Asymptomatic patients with Barrett's esophagus should consider a long-term
      PPI. Best Practice Advice 5: Patients at high risk for ulcer-related bleeding
      from NSAIDs should take a PPI if they continue to take NSAIDs. Best Practice
      Advice 6: The dose of long-term PPIs should be periodically reevaluated so that
      the lowest effective PPI dose can be prescribed to manage the condition. Best
      Practice Advice 7: Long-term PPI users should not routinely use probiotics to
      prevent infection. Best Practice Advice 8: Long-term PPI users should not
      routinely raise their intake of calcium, vitamin B12, or magnesium beyond the
      Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Best Practice Advice 9: Long-term PPI users 
      should not routinely screen or monitor bone mineral density, serum creatinine,
      magnesium, or vitamin B12. Best Practice Advice 10: Specific PPI formulations
      should not be selected based on potential risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multiple endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) currently are
      being evaluated or are in clinical use in the United States. EBTs are well
      positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic
      disease. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists on
      these therapies and provide practice advice on how to incorporate them into
      clinical practice. METHODS: The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation 
      of comprehensive search of several English-language databases and a manual review
      of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting abstracts).
      Best Practice Advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who
      have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle
      interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe
      obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They also can be used as a 
      bridge to allow unrelated interventions that are unable to be performed because
      of weight limits (ie, orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation). Best Practice
      Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program 
      that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, 
      in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best
      Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a
      comprehensive evaluation for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial 
      or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling
      patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5:
      Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should follow up
      patients prospectively to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and
      weight-related comorbidities, and all related adverse outcomes. Poor responders
      should be identified and offered a detailed evaluation and alternative therapy.
      Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians embarking on incorporating EBTs into their
      clinical practice should have a comprehensive knowledge of the indications,
      contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a
      practical knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies for
      obesity. Best Practice Advice 7: Institutions should establish specific
      guidelines that are applied consistently across disciplines for granting
      privileges in EBTs that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill a
      clinician must achieve before being granted privileges to perform these
      procedures.

AB  - Primary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death
      worldwide and therefore a major public health challenge. We review hypotheses of 
      the cell of origin of liver tumorigenesis and clarify the classes of liver cancer
      based on molecular features and how they affect patient prognosis. Primary liver 
      cancer comprises hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
      (iCCA), and other rare tumors, notably fibrolamellar carcinoma and
      hepatoblastoma. The molecular and clinical features of HCC versus iCCA are
      distinct, but these conditions have overlapping risk factors and pathways of
      oncogenesis. A better understanding of the cell types originating liver cancer
      can aid in exploring molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and therapeutic
      options. Molecular studies have identified adult hepatocytes as the cell of
      origin. These cells have been proposed to transform directly into HCC cells (via 
      a sequence of genetic alterations), to dedifferentiate into hepatocyte precursor 
      cells (which then become HCC cells that express progenitor cell markers), or to
      transdifferentiate into biliary-like cells (which give rise to iCCA).
      Alternatively, progenitor cells also give rise to HCCs and iCCAs with markers of 
      progenitor cells. Advances in genome profiling and next-generation sequencing
      have led to the classification of HCCs based on molecular features and assigned
      them to categories such as proliferation-progenitor, proliferation-transforming
      growth factor beta, and Wnt-catenin beta1. iCCAs have been assigned to categories
      of proliferation and inflammation. Overall, proliferation subclasses are
      associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor outcome of patients,
      although more specific signatures have refined our prognostic abilities. Analyses
      of genetic alterations have identified those that might be targeted
      therapeutically, such as fusions in the FGFR2 gene and mutations in genes
      encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases (in approximately 60% of iCCAs) or
      amplifications at 11q13 and 6p21 (in approximately 15% of HCCs). Further studies 
      of these alterations are needed before they can be used as biomarkers in clinical
      decision making.

AB  - Although the gastrointestinal tract contains intrinsic neural plexuses that allow
      a significant degree of independent control over gastrointestinal functions, the 
      central nervous system provides extrinsic neural inputs that modulate, regulate, 
      and integrate these functions. In particular, the vagus nerve provides the
      parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract, coordinating the
      complex interactions between central and peripheral neural control mechanisms.
      This review discusses the physiological roles of the afferent (sensory) and motor
      (efferent) vagus in regulation of appetite, mood, and the immune system, as well 
      as the pathophysiological outcomes of vagus nerve dysfunction resulting in
      obesity, mood disorders, and inflammation. The therapeutic potential of vagus
      nerve modulation to attenuate or reverse these pathophysiological outcomes and
      restore autonomic homeostasis is also discussed.

TI  - Molecular Classification of Hepatocellular Adenoma Associates With Risk Factors, 
      Bleeding, and Malignant Transformation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors that
      can be assigned to molecular subtypes based on inactivating mutations in
      hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A, activating mutations in beta-catenin, or activation
      of inflammatory signaling pathways. We aimed to update the classification system 
      for HCA and associate the subtypes with disease risk factors and complications.
      METHODS: We analyzed expression levels of 20 genes and sequenced exon regions of 
      8 genes (HNF1A, IL6ST, CTNNB1, FRK, STAT3, GNAS, JAK1, and TERT) in 607 samples
      of 533 HCAs from 411 patients, collected from 28 centers mainly in France from
      2000 and 2014. We performed gene expression profile, RNA sequence, whole-exome
      and genome sequence, and immunohistochemical analyses of select samples.
      Molecular data were associated with risk factors, histopathology, bleeding, and
      malignant transformation. RESULTS: Symptomatic bleeding occurred in 14% of the
      patients (85% of cases were female, median age, 38 years); 7% of the nodules were
      borderline between HCA and hepatocellular carcinoma, and 3% of patients developed
      hepatocellular carcinoma from HCA. Based on molecular features, we classified HCA
      into 8 subgroups. One new subgroup, composed of previously unclassified HCA,
      represented 4% of HCAs overall and was associated with obesity and bleeding.
      These tumors were characterized by activation of sonic hedgehog signaling, due to
      focal deletions that fuse the promoter of INHBE with GLI1. Analysis of genetic
      heterogeneity among multiple HCAs, from different patients, revealed a molecular 
      subtype field effect; multiple tumors had different mutations that deregulated
      similar pathways. Specific molecular subtypes of HCA associated with various HCA 
      risk factors, including imbalances in estrogen or androgen hormones. Specific
      molecular subgroup of HCA with beta-catenin and sonic hedgehog activation
      associated with malignant transformation and bleeding, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Using sequencing and gene expression analyses, we identified a subgroup of HCA
      characterized by fusion of the INHBE and GLI1 genes and activation of sonic
      hedgehog pathway. Molecular subtypes of HCAs associated with different patients' 
      risk factors for HCA, disease progression, and pathology features of tumors. This
      classification system might be used to select treatment strategies for patients
      with HCA.

AB  - Parietal cell atrophy is considered to cause metaplasia in the stomach. We
      developed mice that express the diphtheria toxin receptor specifically in
      parietal cells to induce their death, and found this to increase proliferation in
      the normal stem cell zone and neck but not to cause metaplastic reprogramming of 
      chief cells. Furthermore, the metaplasia-inducing agents tamoxifen or DMP-777
      still induced metaplasia even after previous destruction of parietal cells by
      diphtheria toxin. Atrophy of parietal cells alone therefore is not sufficient to 
      induce metaplasia: completion of metaplastic reprogramming of chief cells
      requires mechanisms beyond parietal cell injury or death.

TI  - Daclatasvir Prevents Hepatitis C Virus Infectivity by Blocking Transfer of the
      Viral Genome to Assembly Sites.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent and potent
      inhibitor of NS5A, which is involved in replication of the hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) genome, presumably via membranous web shaping, and assembly of new virions,
      likely via transfer of the HCV RNA genome to viral particle assembly sites.
      Daclatasvir inhibits the formation of new membranous web structures and,
      ultimately, of replication complex vesicles, but also inhibits an early assembly 
      step. We investigated the relationship between daclatasvir-induced clustering of 
      HCV proteins, intracellular localization of viral RNAs, and inhibition of viral
      particle assembly. METHODS: Cell-culture-derived HCV particles were produced from
      Huh7.5 hepatocarcinoma cells in presence of daclatasvir for short time periods.
      Infectivity and production of physical particles were quantified and producer
      cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation. Intracellular colocalization
      between core, E2, NS5A, NS4B proteins, and viral RNAs was quantitatively analyzed
      by confocal microscopy and by structured illumination microscopy. RESULTS: Short 
      exposure of HCV-infected cells to daclatasvir reduced viral assembly and induced 
      clustering of structural proteins with non-structural HCV proteins, including
      core, E2, NS4B, and NS5A. These clustered structures appeared to be inactive
      assembly platforms, likely owing to loss of functional connection with
      replication complexes. Daclatasvir greatly reduced delivery of viral genomes to
      these core clusters without altering HCV RNA colocalization with NS5A. In
      contrast, daclatasvir neither induced clustered structures nor inhibited HCV
      assembly in cells infected with a daclatasvir-resistant mutant (NS5A-Y93H),
      indicating that daclatasvir targets a mutual, specific function of NS5A
      inhibiting both processes. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to inhibiting replication
      complex biogenesis, daclatasvir prevents viral assembly by blocking transfer of
      the viral genome to assembly sites. This leads to clustering of HCV proteins
      because viral particles and replication complex vesicles cannot form or egress.
      This dual mode of action of daclatasvir could explain its efficacy in blocking
      HCV replication in cultured cells and in treatment of patients with HCV
      infection.

TI  - A Clinical Prediction Model to Assess Risk for Pancreatic Cancer Among Patients
      With New-Onset Diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Approximately 50% of all patients with pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDA) develop diabetes mellitus before their cancer diagnosis.
      Screening individuals with new-onset diabetes might allow earlier diagnosis of
      PDA. We sought to develop and validate a PDA risk prediction model to identify
      high-risk individuals among those with new-onset diabetes. METHODS: We conducted 
      a retrospective cohort study in a population representative database from the
      United Kingdom. Individuals with incident diabetes after the age of 35 years and 
      3 or more years of follow-up after diagnosis of diabetes were eligible for
      inclusion. Candidate predictors consisted of epidemiologic and clinical
      characteristics available at the time of diabetes diagnosis. Variables with P
      values <.25 in the univariable analyses were evaluated using backward stepwise
      approach. Model discrimination was assessed using receiver operating
      characteristic curve analysis. Calibration was evaluated using the
      Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results were internally validated using a bootstrapping
      procedure. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 109,385 patients with new-onset
      diabetes. Among them, 390 (0.4%) were diagnosed with PDA within 3 years. The
      final model (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.89)
      included age, body mass index, change in body mass index, smoking, use of proton 
      pump inhibitors, and anti-diabetic medications, as well as levels of hemoglobin
      A1C, cholesterol, hemoglobin, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase. Bootstrapping
      validation showed negligible optimism. If the predicted risk threshold for
      definitive PDA screening was set at 1% over 3 years, only 6.19% of the new-onset 
      diabetes population would undergo definitive screening, which would identify
      patients with PDA with 44.7% sensitivity, 94.0% specificity, and a positive
      predictive value of 2.6%. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a risk model based on widely 
      available clinical parameters to help identify patients with new-onset diabetes
      who might benefit from PDA screening.

      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the prevalence and burden of undiagnosed
      celiac disease in individuals younger than age 50. We determined the prevalence
      and morbidity of undiagnosed celiac disease in individuals younger than age 50 in
      a community. METHODS: We tested sera from 31,255 residents of Olmsted County,
      Minnesota (<50 y), without a prior diagnosis of celiac disease assay using an
      assay for IgA against tissue transglutaminase; in subjects with positive test
      results, celiac disease was confirmed using an assay for endomysial IgA. We
      performed a nested case-control study to compare the proportion of comorbidities 
      between undiagnosed cases of celiac disease and age- and sex-matched seronegative
      controls (1:2). Medical records were abstracted to identify potential
      comorbidities. RESULTS: We identified 338 of 30,425 adults with positive results 
      from both serologic tests. Based on this finding, we estimated the prevalence of 
      celiac disease to be 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.0%-1.2%); 8 of 830 children
      tested positive for IgA against tissue transglutaminase (1.0%; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.4%-1.9%). No typical symptoms or classic consequences of diagnosed
      celiac disease (diarrhea, anemia, or fracture) were associated with undiagnosed
      celiac disease. Undiagnosed celiac disease was associated with increased rates of
      hypothyroidism (odds ratio, 2.2; P < .01) and a lower than average cholesterol
      level (P = .03) and ferritin level (P = .01). During a median follow-up period of
      6.3 years, the cumulative incidence of a subsequent diagnosis with celiac disease
      at 5 years after testing was 10.8% in persons with undiagnosed celiac disease vs 
      0.1% in seronegative persons (P < .01). Celiac disease status was not associated 
      with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Based on serologic tests of a community
      population for celiac disease, we estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed celiac 
      disease to be 1.1%. Undiagnosed celiac disease appeared to be clinically silent
      and remained undetected, but long-term outcomes have not been determined.

      Screening Program and Optimization by Altering Fecal Immunochemical Test Cut-Off 
      Levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: After careful pilot studies and planning, the national
      screening program for colorectal cancer (CRC), with biennial fecal immunochemical
      tests (FITs), was initiated in The Netherlands in 2014. A national information
      system for real-time monitoring was developed to allow for timely evaluation.
      Data were collected from the first year of this screening program to determine
      the importance of planning and monitoring for optimal screening program
      performance. METHODS: The national information system of the CRC screening
      program kept track of the number of invitations sent in 2014, FIT kits returned, 
      and colonoscopies performed. Age-adjusted rates of participation, the number of
      positive test results, and positive predictive values (PPVs) for advanced
      neoplasia were determined weekly, quarterly, and yearly. RESULTS: In 2014, there 
      were 741,914 persons invited for FIT; of these, 529,056 (71.3%; 95% CI,
      71.2%-71.4%) participated. A few months into the program, real-time monitoring
      showed that rates of participation and positive test results (10.6%; 95% CI,
      10.5%-10.8%) were higher than predicted and the PPV was lower (42.1%; 95% CI,
      41.3%-42.9%) than predicted based on pilot studies. To reduce the burden of
      unnecessary colonoscopies and alleviate colonoscopy capacity, the cut-off level
      for a positive FIT result was increased from 15 to 47 mug Hb/g feces halfway
      through 2014. This adjustment decreased the percentage of positive test results
      to 6.7% (95% CI, 6.6%-6.8%) and increased the PPV to 49.1% (95% CI, 48.3%-49.9%).
      In total, the first year of the Dutch screening program resulted in the detection
      of 2483 cancers and 12,030 advanced adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: Close monitoring of
      the implementation of the Dutch national CRC screening program allowed for
      instant adjustment of the FIT cut-off levels to optimize program performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor
      antagonists (H2RAs) suppress gastric acid production, which can inhibit iron
      absorption. However, few data exist regarding whether these medications increase 
      the risk of clinical iron deficiency. METHODS: A community-based case-control
      study evaluated the association between acid-suppressing medication use and the
      subsequent risk of iron deficiency. It contrasted 77,046 patients with new iron
      deficiency diagnoses (January 1999-December 2013), with 389,314 controls.
      Medication exposures, outcomes, and potential confounders used electronic
      databases. We excluded patients with pre-existing risk factors for iron
      deficiency. Associations were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
      RESULTS: Among cases, 2343 (3.0%) received a prior >/=2-year supply of PPIs and
      1063 (1.4%) received H2RAs (without PPI use). Among controls, 3354 (0.9%)
      received a prior >/=2-year supply of PPIs and 2247 (0.6%) H2RAs. Both >/=2 years 
      of PPIs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 2.35-2.64) and >/=2 
      years of H2RAs (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.46-1.71) were associated with an
      increased subsequent risk for iron deficiency. Among PPI users, the associations 
      were stronger for higher daily doses (>1.5 vs <0.75 PPI pills/d; P value
      interaction = .004) and decreased after medication discontinuation (P-trend <
      .001). Some of the strongest associations were among persons taking >1.5 pills
      per day for at least 10 years (odds ratio, 4.27; 95% CI, 2.53-7.21). No similar
      strong associations were found for other commonly used prescription medications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients without known risk factors for iron deficiency,
      gastric acid inhibitor use for >/=2 years was associated with an increased
      subsequent risk of iron deficiency. The risk increased with increasing potency of
      acid inhibition and decreased after medication discontinuation.

      2012.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      have been reported to be plateauing in the United States. The United States has
      large racial, ethnic, and regional variation; we collected data from all 50
      states to better analyze changes in HCC incidence in the entire United States.
      METHODS: We collected data from the US Cancer Statistics registry, which covers
      97% of the population, and calculated adjusted incidence rates. We assessed
      annual trends among sociodemographic and geographic subgroups using joinpoint
      analysis. RESULTS: HCC incidence increased from 4.4/100,000 in 2000 to
      6.7/100,000 in 2012, increasing by 4.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3%-4.7%)
      annually between 2000 and 2009, but only by 0.7% annually (95% CI, -0.2% to 1.6%)
      from 2010 through 2012. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) between 2000 
      and 2012 was higher in men (increase, 3.7%) than in women (increase, 2.7%), and
      highest in 55- to 59-year-old individuals (AAPC, 8.9%; 95% CI, 7.1%-10.7%) and
      60- to 64-year-old individuals (AAPC, 6.4%; 95% CI, 4.7%-8.2%). By 2012, rates in
      Hispanics surpassed those in Asians, and rates in Texas surpassed those in Hawaii
      (9.71/100,000 vs 9.68/100,000). Geographic variation within individual race and
      ethnic groups was observed, but rates were highest in all major race and ethnic
      groups in Texas. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of the incidence of HCC in all 50 US
      states, we found the rate of increase in HCC to have slowed from 2010 through
      2012. However, incidence is increasing in subgroups such as men ages 55 to 64
      years old-especially those born in the peak era of hepatitis C virus infection
      and among whites/Caucasians. Rates in Hispanics have surpassed those in Asian
      Americans. We observed geographic differences, with Texas having the highest
      age-adjusted HCC rates nationwide.

TI  - Budesonide Oral Suspension Improves Symptomatic, Endoscopic, and Histologic
      Parameters Compared With Placebo in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pharmacologic treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is
      limited to off-label use of corticosteroids not optimized for esophageal
      delivery. We performed a randomized, controlled phase 2 trial to assess the
      ability of budesonide oral suspension (BOS), a novel muco-adherent topical
      steroid formulation, to reduce symptoms and esophageal eosinophilia in
      adolescents and adults with EoE. METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 93 EoE patients between
      the ages of 11 and 40 years with dysphagia and active esophageal eosinophilia
      were randomized to receive either BOS 2 mg or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks.
      Co-primary outcomes were change in Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score
      from baseline, and proportion of patients with a histologic response (</=6
      eosinophils/high-power field) after treatment. Endoscopic severity scores and
      safety parameters were assessed. RESULTS: At baseline, mean DSQ scores were 29.3 
      and 29.0, and mean peak eosinophil counts were 156 and 130 per hpf in the BOS and
      placebo groups, respectively. After treatment, DSQ scores were 15.0 and 21.5, and
      mean peak eosinophil counts were 39 and 113 per high-power field, respectively (P
      < .05 for all). For BOS vs placebo, change in DSQ score was -14.3 vs -7.5 (P =
      .0096), histologic response rates were 39% vs 3% (P < .0001), and change in
      endoscopic severity score was -3.8 vs 0.4 (P < .0001). Adverse events were
      similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with BOS was well tolerated in
      adolescent and young adult patients with EoE and resulted in improvement in
      symptomatic, endoscopic, and histologic parameters using validated outcome
      instruments. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01642212.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine that promotes
      inflammation and contributes to pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Unlike other cells and tissues, intestinal epithelial cells undergo rapid cell
      death upon exposure to TNF, by unclear mechanisms. We investigated the roles of
      inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in the regulation of TNF-induced cell
      death in the intestinal epithelium of mice and intestinal organoids. METHODS: RNA
      from cell lines and tissues was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction, protein levels were analyzed by immunoblot assays. BIRC2 (also called
      cIAP1) was expressed upon induction from lentiviral vectors in young adult mouse 
      colon (YAMC) cells. YAMC cells, the mouse colon carcinoma cell line MC38, the
      mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, or mouse and human organoids were incubated
      with second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac)-mimetic compound LCL161 or
      recombinant TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TNFSF12) along with TNF, and cell
      death was quantified. C57BL/6 mice with disruption of Xiap, Birc2 (encodes
      cIAP1), Birc3 (encodes cIAP2), Tnfrsf1a, or Tnfrsf1b (Tnfrsf1a and b encode TNF
      receptors) were injected with TNF or saline (control); liver and intestinal
      tissues were collected and analyzed for apoptosis induction by cleaved caspase 3 
      immunohistochemistry. We also measured levels of TNF and alanine aminotransferase
      in serum from mice. RESULTS: YAMC cells, and mouse and human intestinal
      organoids, died rapidly in response to TNF. YAMC and intestinal crypts expressed 
      lower levels of XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and cFLIP than liver tissue. Smac-mimetics
      reduced levels of cIAP1 and XIAP in MC38 and YAMC cells, and Smac-mimetics and
      TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis increased TNF-induced cell death in YAMC
      cells and organoids-most likely by sequestering and degrading cIAP1. Injection of
      TNF greatly increased levels of cell death in intestinal tissue of cIAP1-null
      mice, compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, cIAP2-null mice, or XIAP-null mice.
      Excessive TNF-induced cell death in the intestinal epithelium was mediated TNF
      receptor 1. CONCLUSIONS: In a study of mouse and human cell lines, organoids, and
      tissues, we found cIAP1 to be required for regulation of TNF-induced intestinal
      epithelial cell death and survival. These findings have important implications
      for the pathogenesis of TNF-mediated enteropathies and chronic inflammatory
      diseases of the intestine.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nearly 20% of the global cancer burden can be linked to
      infectious agents. Fusobacterium nucleatum promotes tumor formation by epithelial
      cells via unclear mechanisms. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) induced by 
      F nucleatum and evaluate their ability to promote colorectal carcinogenesis in
      mice. METHODS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines were incubated with F nucleatum
      or control reagents and analyzed in proliferation and would healing assays.
      HCT116, HT29, LoVo, and SW480 CRC cell lines were incubated with F nucleatum or
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS [control]) and analyzed for miRNA expression
      patterns and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Cells were incubated with
      miRNAs mimics, control sequences, or small interfering RNAs; expression of
      reporter constructs was measured in luciferase assays. CRC cells were incubated
      with F nucleatum or PBS and injected into BALB/C nude mice; growth of xenograft
      tumors was measured. C57BL adenomatous polyposis coli(min/+), C57BL miR21a(-/-), 
      and C57BL mice with full-length miR21a (controls) were given F nucleatum by
      gavage; some mice were given azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate to induce
      colitis and colon tumors. Intestinal tissues were collected and tumors were
      counted. Serum samples from mice were analyzed for cytokine levels by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We performed in situ hybridization analyses to
      detect enrichment of F nucleatum in CRC cells. Fusobacterium nucleatum DNA in 90 
      tumor and matched nontumor tissues from patients in China were explored for the
      expression correlation analysis; levels in 125 tumor tissues from patients in
      Japan were compared with their survival times. RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum
      increased proliferation and invasive activities of CRC cell lines compared with
      control cells. CRC cell lines infected with F nucleatum formed larger tumors,
      more rapidly, in nude mice than uninfected cells. Adenomatous polyposis
      coli(min/+) mice gavaged with F nucleatum developed significantly more colorectal
      tumors than mice given PBS and had shorter survival times. We found several
      inflammatory factors to be significantly increased in serum from mice given F
      nucleatum (interleukin 17F, interleukin 21, and interleukin 22, and MIP3A). We
      found 50 miRNAs to be significantly up-regulated and 52 miRNAs to be
      significantly down-regulated in CRCs incubated with F nucleatum vs PBS; levels of
      miR21 increased by the greatest amount (>4-fold). Inhibitors of miR21 prevented F
      nucleatum from inducing cell proliferation and invasion in culture. miR21a(-/-)
      mice had a later appearance of fecal blood and diarrhea after administration of
      azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate, and had longer survival times compared
      with control mice. The colorectum of miR21a(-/-) mice had fewer tumors, of
      smaller size, and the miR21a(-/-) mice survived longer than control mice. We
      found RASA1, which encodes an RAS GTPase, to be one of the target genes
      consistently down-regulated in cells that overexpressed miR21 and up-regulated in
      cells exposed to miR21 inhibitors. Infection of cells with F nucleatum increased 
      expression of miR21 by activating Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MYD88,
      leading to activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB. Levels of F nucleatum DNA and
      miR21 were increased in tumor tissues (and even more so in advanced tumor
      tissues) compared with non-tumor colon tissues from patients. Patients whose
      tumors had high amounts of F nucleatum DNA and miR21 had shorter survival times
      than patients whose tumors had lower amounts. CONCLUSIONS: We found infection of 
      CRC cells with F nucleatum to increase their proliferation, invasive activity,
      and ability to form xenograft tumors in mice. Fusobacterium nucleatum activates
      Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MYD88, leading to activation of the nuclear
      factor-kappaB and increased expression of miR21; this miRNA reduces levels of the
      RAS GTPase RASA1. Patients with both high amount of tissue F nucleatum DNA and
      miR21 demonstrated a higher risk for poor outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective
      therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). However,
      transferring undefined living bacteria entails uncontrollable risks for
      infectious and metabolic or malignant diseases, particularly in immunocompromised
      patients. We investigated whether sterile fecal filtrates (containing bacterial
      debris, proteins, antimicrobial compounds, metabolic products, and
      oligonucleotides/DNA), rather than intact microorganisms, are effective in
      patients with CDI. METHODS: We performed a clinical case series to investigate
      the effects of fecal filtrate transfer (FFT) in 5 patients with symptomatic
      chronic-relapsing CDI at the Department of Internal Medicine I at the University 
      Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel, Germany). Patients were followed up for at
      least 6 months and for up to 33 months. Stool was collected from 5 donors
      selected by the patients, and fully characterized according to FMT standards.
      Stool was sterile-filtered to remove small particles and bacteria; the filtrate
      was transferred to patients in a single administration via nasojejunal tube.
      Fecal samples were collected from patients before and at 1 week and 6 weeks after
      FFT. Microbiome, virome, and proteome profiles of donors and patients were
      compared. RESULTS: In all 5 patients, FFT restored normal stool habits and
      eliminated symptoms of CDI for a minimum period of 6 months. Proteome analyses of
      selected FFT filtrates showed no obvious protein candidates associated with
      therapeutic efficacy. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing detected diverse
      bacterial DNA signatures in the filtrates. Analysis of virus-like particles from 
      a filtrate found to reduce symptoms of CDI showed a complex signature of
      bacteriophages. Bacterial phylogeny and virome profile analyses of fecal samples 
      from recipients indicated longitudinal changes in microbial and viral community
      structures after FFT. CONCLUSIONS: A preliminary investigation of 5 patients with
      CDI shows that transfer of sterile filtrates from donor stool (FFT), rather than 
      fecal microbiota, can be sufficient to restore normal stool habits and eliminate 
      symptoms. This finding indicates that bacterial components, metabolites, or
      bacteriophages mediate many of the effects of FMT, and that FFT might be an
      alternative approach, particularly for immunocompromised patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gluten ingestion leads to symptoms and small intestinal
      mucosal injury in patients with celiac disease. The only option is the strict
      lifelong exclusion of dietary gluten, which is difficult to accomplish. Many
      patients following a gluten-free diet continue to have symptoms and have small
      intestinal mucosal injury. Nondietary therapies are needed. We performed a phase 
      2 study of the ability of latiglutenase, an orally administered mixture of 2
      recombinant gluten-targeting proteases, to reduce mucosal morphometric measures
      in biopsy specimens from patients with celiac disease. METHODS: We performed a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of latiglutenase in 494 patients with celiac disease (with moderate or
      severe symptoms) in North America and Europe, from August 2013 until December
      2014. Participants reported following a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year
      before the study began. Patients with documented moderate or severe symptoms and 
      villous atrophy (villous height:crypt depth ratio of </=2.0) were assigned
      randomly to groups given placebo or 100, 300, 450, 600, or 900 mg latiglutenase
      daily for 12 or 24 weeks. Subjects completed the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary
      each day for 28 days and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with
      duodenal biopsy of the distal duodenum at baseline and at weeks 12 and 24. The
      primary end point was a change in the villous height:crypt depth ratio. Secondary
      end points included numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, serology test results
      (for levels of antibodies against tissue transglutaminase-2 and deamidated
      gliadin peptide), symptom frequencies, and safety. RESULTS: In a modified
      intent-to-treat population, there were no differences between latiglutenase and
      placebo groups in change from baseline in villous height:crypt depth ratio,
      numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, or serologic markers of celiac disease.
      All groups had significant improvements in histologic and symptom scores.
      CONCLUSIONS: In a phase 2 study of patients with symptomatic celiac disease and
      histologic evidence of significant duodenal mucosal injury, latiglutenase did not
      improve histologic and symptom scores when compared with placebo. There were no
      significant differences in change from baseline between groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Video capsule endoscopy (CE) provides a noninvasive option to 
      assess the small intestine, but its use with respect to endoscopic procedures and
      cross-sectional imaging varies widely. The aim of this consensus was to provide
      guidance on the appropriate use of CE in clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic
      literature search identified studies on the use of CE in patients with Crohn's
      disease, celiac disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. The quality of
      evidence and strength of recommendations were rated using the Grading of
      Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS:
      The consensus includes 21 statements focused on the use of small-bowel CE and
      colon capsule endoscopy. CE was recommended for patients with suspected, known,
      or relapsed Crohn's disease when ileocolonoscopy and imaging studies were
      negative if it was imperative to know whether active Crohn's disease was present 
      in the small bowel. It was not recommended in patients with chronic abdominal
      pain or diarrhea, in whom there was no evidence of abnormal biomarkers typically 
      associated with Crohn's disease. CE was recommended to assess patients with
      celiac disease who have unexplained symptoms despite appropriate treatment, but
      not to make the diagnosis. In patients with overt gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      negative findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, CE should be
      performed as soon as possible. CE was recommended only in selected patients with 
      unexplained, mild, chronic iron-deficiency anemia. CE was suggested for
      surveillance in patients with polyposis syndromes or other small-bowel cancers,
      who required small-bowel studies. Colon capsule endoscopy should not be
      substituted routinely for colonoscopy. Patients should be made aware of the
      potential risks of CE including a failed procedure, capsule retention, or a
      missed lesion. Finally, standardized criteria for training and reporting in CE
      should be defined. CONCLUSIONS: CE generally should be considered a complementary
      test in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, Crohn's disease, or celiac
      disease, who have had negative or inconclusive endoscopic or imaging studies.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway, also known as the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway, is a
      regulator of organ size. The pathway takes its name from the Drosophila protein
      kinase, Hippo (STK4/MST1 and STK3/MST2 in mammals), which, when inactivated,
      leads to considerable tissue overgrowth. In mammals, MST1 and MST2 negatively
      regulate the transcriptional co-activators yes-associated protein 1 and WW domain
      containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1/TAZ), which together regulate
      expression of genes that control proliferation, survival, and differentiation.
      Yes-associated protein 1 and TAZ activation have been associated with liver
      development, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. How their activity is dynamically
      regulated in these contexts is just beginning to be elucidated. We review the
      mechanisms of Hippo signaling in the liver and explore outstanding questions for 
      future research.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Elastography vs Transient Elastography in Detection of
      Fibrosis and Noninvasive Measurement of Steatosis in Patients With Biopsy-Proven 
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and
      ultrasound-based transient elastography (TE) can be used in noninvasive diagnosis
      of fibrosis and steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD). We performed a prospective study to compare the performance of magnetic 
      resonance elastography (MRE) vs TE for diagnosis of fibrosis, and MRI-based
      proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) analysis vs TE-based controlled
      attenuation parameter (CAP) for diagnosis of steatosis in patients undergoing
      biopsy to assess NAFLD. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 104
      consecutive adults (56.7% female) who underwent MRE, TE, and liver biopsy
      analysis (using the histologic scoring system for NAFLD from the Nonalcoholic
      Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Scoring System) from October 2011
      through May 2016 at a tertiary medical center. All patients received a standard
      clinical evaluation, including collection of history, anthropometric examination,
      and biochemical tests. The primary outcomes were fibrosis and steatosis.
      Secondary outcomes included dichotomized stages of fibrosis and nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis vs no nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Receiver operating
      characteristic curve analyses were used to compare performances of MRE vs TE in
      diagnosis of fibrosis (stages 1-4 vs 0) and MRI-PDFF vs CAP for diagnosis of
      steatosis (grades 1-3 vs 0) with respect to findings from biopsy analysis.
      RESULTS: MRE detected any fibrosis (stage 1 or more) with an area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.74-0.91), which was significantly higher than that of TE (AUROC, 0.67;
      95% CI, 0.56-0.78). MRI-PDFF detected any steatosis with an AUROC of 0.99 (95%
      CI, 0.98-1.00), which was significantly higher than that of CAP (AUROC, 0.85; 95%
      CI, 0.75-0.96). MRE detected fibrosis of stages 2, 3, or 4 with AUROC values of
      0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78-0.96), and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.71-1.00);
      TE detected fibrosis of stages 2, 3, or 4 with AUROC values of 0.86 (95% CI,
      0.77-0.95), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93), and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.45-0.94). MRI-PDFF
      identified steatosis of grades 2 or 3 with AUROC values of 0.90 (95% CI,
      0.82-0.97) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99); CAP identified steatosis of grades 2 or 
      3 with AUROC values of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.82) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.89).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective, cross-sectional study of more than 100 patients,
      we found MRE to be more accurate than TE in identification of liver fibrosis
      (stage 1 or more), using biopsy analysis as the standard. MRI-PDFF is more
      accurate than CAP in detecting all grades of steatosis in patients with NAFLD.

TI  - Prostaglandin E2 Activates YAP and a Positive-Signaling Loop to Promote Colon
      Regeneration After Colitis but Also Carcinogenesis in Mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is mediator of inflammation that
      regulates tissue regeneration, but its continual activation has been associated
      with carcinogenesis. Little is known about factors in the PGE2 signaling pathway 
      that contribute to tumor formation. We investigated whether yes-associated
      protein 1 (YAP1), a transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo signaling pathway, 
      mediates PGE2 function. METHODS: DLD-1 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines were
      transfected with vectors expressing transgenes or small hairpin RNAs and
      incubated with recombinant PGE2, with or without pharmacologic inhibitors of
      signaling proteins, and analyzed by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, quantitative 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, transcriptional reporter, and
      proliferation assays. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was given to induce colitis in
      C57/BL6 (control) mice, as well as in mice with disruption of the
      hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15 gene (15-PGDH-knockout mice), Yap1 gene
      (YAP-knockout mice), and double-knockout mice. Some mice also were given
      indomethacin to block PGE2 synthesis. 15-PGDH knockout mice were crossed with
      mice with intestine-specific disruption of the salvador family WW domain
      containing 1 gene (Sav1), which encodes an activator of Hippo signaling. We
      performed immunohistochemical analyses of colon biopsy samples from 26 patients
      with colitis-associated cancer and 51 age-and sex-matched patients with
      colorectal cancer (without colitis). RESULTS: Incubation of colon cancer cell
      lines with PGE2 led to phosphorylation of cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate-responsive element binding protein 1 and increased levels of YAP1
      messenger RNA, protein, and YAP1 transcriptional activity. This led to increased 
      transcription of the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 gene (PTGS2 or
      cyclooxygenase 2) and prostaglandin E-receptor 4 gene (PTGER4 or EP4). Incubation
      with PGE2 promoted proliferation of colon cancer cell lines, but not cells with
      knockdown of YAP1. Control mice developed colitis after administration of DSS,
      but injection of PGE2 led to colon regeneration in these mice. However,
      YAP-knockout mice did not regenerate colon tissues and died soon after
      administration of DSS. 15-PGDH-knockout mice regenerated colon tissues more
      rapidly than control mice after withdrawal of DSS, and had faster recovery of
      body weight, colon length, and colitis histology scores. These effects were
      reversed by injection of indomethacin. SAV1-knockout or 15-PGDH-knockout mice did
      not develop spontaneous tumors after colitis induction, but SAV1/15-PGDH
      double-knockout mice developed polyps that eventually progressed to carcinoma in 
      situ. Administration of indomethacin to these mice prevented spontaneous tumor
      formation. Levels of PGE2 correlated with those of YAP levels in human sporadic
      colorectal tumors and colitis-associated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: PGE2 signaling
      increases the expression and transcriptional activities of YAP1, leading to
      increased expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and EP4 to activate a positive signaling
      loop. This pathway promotes proliferation of colon cancer cell lines and colon
      tissue regeneration in mice with colitis. Constitutive activation of this pathway
      led to formation of polyps and colon tumors in mice.

AB  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and mesenchymal stromal
      cell therapy have been proposed for patients with refractory Crohn's disease (CD)
      and fistulizing CD, respectively. Will these highly advanced techniques be
      available only for select patients, at specialized centers, or is further
      clinical development justified, with the aim of offering widespread, more
      definitive therapeutic options for often very difficult to treat disease?
      Patients with CD who are eligible for HSCT have typically been failed by most
      approved therapies, have undergone multiple surgeries, and have coped with years 
      of disease activity and poor quality of life. The objective of HSCT is to
      immediately shut down the immune response and allow the transplanted stem cells
      to develop into self-tolerant lymphocytes. For patients with fistulizing CD,
      mesenchymal stromal cell therapy deposits MSCs locally, into fistulizing tracts, 
      to down-regulate the local immune response and induce wound healing. Recent
      trials have produced promising results for HSCT and mesenchymal stromal cell
      therapy as alternatives to systemic therapies and antibiotics for patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases, but are these immunotherapies ready for prime time?

TI  - Detection of Occult Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Patients Who Achieved a

      Infection After Liver Transplantation.

AB  - Occult infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is defined as the presence of the
      HCV genome in either liver tissue or peripheral blood monocytes, despite constant
      negative results from tests for HCV RNA in serum. We investigated whether
      patients who maintained a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after therapy
      (SVR12) with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents for recurrent HCV infection
      after liver transplantation had occult HCV infections. We performed a prospective
      study of 134 patients with recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation
      who were treated with DAAs, with or without ribavirin, from 2014 through 2016
      (129 patients achieved an SVR12). In >10% of the patients who achieved SVR12 (n =
      14), serum levels of aminotransferases did not normalize during or after DAA
      therapy, or they normalized transiently but then increased sharply after DAA
      therapy. Of these 14 patients, 9 were assessed for occult HCV infection by
      reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This analysis
      revealed that 55% of these patients (n = 5) had an occult infection, with the
      detection of negative strand viral genome, indicating viral replication. These
      findings indicate the presence of occult HCV infection in some patients with
      abnormal levels of serum aminotransferases, despite SVR12 to DAAs for HCV
      infection after liver transplantation.

TI  - Mailed Outreach Program Increases Ultrasound Screening of Patients With Cirrhosis
      for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Surveillance of patients with cirrhosis increases early
      detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and prolongs survival. However, its
      effectiveness is limited by underuse, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities
      and individuals of low socioeconomic status. We compared the effectiveness of
      mailed outreach strategies, with and without patient navigation, in increasing
      the numbers of patients with cirrhosis undergoing surveillance for HCC in a
      racially diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged cohort. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective study of patients with documented or suspected cirrhosis 
      at a large safety-net health system from December 2014 through March 2016.
      Patients were assigned randomly (1:1:1) to groups that received mailed
      invitations for an ultrasound screening examination (n = 600), mailed invitations
      for an ultrasound screening examination and patient navigation (barrier
      assessment and motivational education for patients who declined screening; n =
      600), or usual care (visit-based screening; n = 600). Patients who did not
      respond to outreach invitations within 2 weeks received up to 3 reminder
      telephone calls. The primary outcome was completion of abdominal imaging within 6
      months of randomization. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar among
      groups. Cirrhosis was documented, based on International Classification of
      Diseases, 9th revision, codes, for 79.6% of patients, and suspected, based on
      noninvasive markers of fibrosis, for 20.4%. In an intent-to-treat analysis,
      significantly greater proportions of patients who received the mailed invitation 
      and navigation (47.2%) or the mailed invitation alone (44.5%) underwent HCC
      screening than patients who received usual care (24.3%) (P < .001 for both
      comparisons). However, screening rates did not differ significantly between
      outreach the outreach groups (P = .25). The effects of the outreach program were 
      consistent in all subgroups, including Caucasian vs non-Caucasian race,
      documented vs suspected cirrhosis, Child-Pugh A vs B cirrhosis, and receipt of
      gastroenterology care. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study, we found outreach
      strategies to double the percentage of patients with cirrhosis who underwent
      ultrasound screening for HCC. However, adding patient navigation to telephone
      reminders provided no significant additional benefit. ClinicalTrials.gov no:
      NCT02312817.

      Tumorigenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the mechanisms by which chronic
      inflammation contributes to carcinogenesis, such as the development of colon
      tumors in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Specific microRNA (miRNAs)
      can function as suppressors or oncogenes, and widespread alterations in miRNA
      expression have been associated with tumorigenesis. We studied whether
      alterations in miRNA function contribute to inflammation-associated colon
      carcinogenesis. METHODS: We studied the effects of inflammatory cytokines, such
      as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1alpha (IL1A), and IL1beta (IL1B), on miRNA
      function, measured by activity of reporter constructs containing miRNA-binding
      sites in their 3' untranslated regions, in human 293T embryonic kidney, Caco-2,
      HT29, and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, as well as dicer(+/+) and dicer(-/-), and
      Apobec3(+/+) and Apobec3(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cells were analyzed by
      immunoblots, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. We generated transgenic
      mice expressing reporter constructs regulated by LET7B, MIR122, and MIR29b
      response elements; some mice were given injections of miRNA inhibitors
      (anti-MIR122 or anti-LET7B), a negative control, or tumor necrosis factor. Liver 
      tissues were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Reporter mice were given
      azoxymethane followed by dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis and colon
      tumors; some mice were given the ROCK inhibitor fasudil along with these agents
      (ROCK inhibitors increase miRNA function). Colon tissues were collected and
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, and fluorescence microscopy.
      RESULTS: Incubation of cell lines with inflammatory cytokines reduced the ability
      of miRNAs to down-regulate expression from reporter constructs; dicer was
      required for this effect, so these cytokines relieve miRNA-dependent reductions
      in expression. The cytokines promoted degradation of APOBEC3G, which normally
      promotes miRNA loading into argonaute 2-related complexes. Mice with colitis had 
      reduced miRNA function, based on increased expression of reporter genes.
      Administration of fasudil to mice did not reduce the severity of colitis that
      developed but greatly reduced the numbers of colon tumors formed (mean 2
      tumors/colon in mice given fasudil vs 9 tumors/colon in mice given control
      agent). We made similar observations in IL10-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: We
      found inflammatory cytokines to reduce the activities of miRNAs. In mice with
      colitis, activities of miRNAs are reduced; administration of an agent that
      increases miRNA function prevents colon tumor formation in these mice. This
      pathway might be targeted to prevent colon carcinogenesis in patients with
      inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  - Discordance Among Pathologists in the United States and Europe in Diagnosis of
      Low-Grade Dysplasia for Patients With Barrett's Esophagus.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is suboptimal inter-observer agreement, even among
      expert gastrointestinal pathologists, in the diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia
      (LGD) in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). We analyzed histopathologic
      criteria required for a diagnosis of LGD using the new subcategories of LGD with 
      inflammatory and dysplastic features. We categorized each diagnosis based on the 
      level of confidence and assessed inter-observer agreement among gastrointestinal 
      pathologists from 5 tertiary centers in the United States and Europe. METHODS: In
      the first phase of the study, 3 pathologists held a consensus conference at which
      they discussed the diagnostic criteria for LGD. In the second phase, 79 slides
      from patients with BE (23 samples of non-dysplastic BE, 22 samples of LGD, and 34
      samples of high-grade dysplasia) were identified, randomly assigned to 7
      pathologists (4 from the United States and 3 from Europe), and interpreted in a
      blinded fashion. kappa Values were calculated for inter-observer agreement. We
      performed multinomial logistic regression analysis to assess the weighting of
      histologic features with the diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall kappa value for
      diagnosis was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.48). When categorized
      based on degree of dysplasia, the kappa value was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11-0.29) for
      non-dysplastic BE, 0.11 (95% CI, 0.004-0.15) for LGD, and 0.43 (95% CI,
      0.36-0.46) for high-grade dysplasia. When all pathologists made a diagnosis with 
      high confidence, the inter-observer agreement was substantial among the US
      pathologists (kappa, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.61-0.66) and European pathologists (kappa,
      0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97). The kappa values for all diagnoses made by European
      pathologists were higher than those made by US pathologists. CONCLUSIONS: In an
      analysis of criteria used in histopathologic diagnosis of LGD, we did not observe
      improvement in level of agreement among experienced pathologists, even after
      accounting for inflammation. The level of inter-observer agreement increased with
      level of pathologist confidence. There was also a difference in reading of
      histopathology samples of BE tissues between US and European pathologists.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that brain-gut interactions are altered during
      development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Understanding the relationship
      between the neurobiology, psychological symptoms, and social ramifications of IBD
      can guide comprehensive care for the whole patient. The most common psychological
      conditions in patients with IBD are chronic abdominal pain, anxiety, and
      depression. We review the evidence-based data and rates of these conditions and
      their respective relationship to IBD and the diagnostic approaches to identify
      patients with these conditions. Different treatment options for pain and
      psychosocial conditions are discussed, and new models of team-based IBD care are 
      introduced. Providing the health care provider with tools to diagnose and manage 
      psychological conditions in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
      is necessary for their total care and should be part of quality-improvement
      initiatives.

AB  - We investigated the presence and patterns of mosaicism in the APC gene in
      patients with colon neoplasms not associated with any other genetic variants; we 
      performed deep sequence analysis of APC in at least 2 adenomas or carcinomas per 
      patient. We identified mosaic variants in APC in adenomas from 9 of the 18
      patients with 21 to approximately 100 adenomas. Mosaic variants of APC were
      variably detected in leukocyte DNA and/or non-neoplastic intestinal mucosa of
      these patients. In a comprehensive sequence analysis of 1 patient, we found no
      evidence for mosaicism in APC in non-neoplastic intestinal mucosa. One patient
      was found to carry a mosaic c.4666dupA APC variant in only 10 of 16 adenomas,
      indicating the importance of screening 2 or more adenomas for genetic variants.

AB  - The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are contemporary conditions of
      industrialized societies. The prevalence of IBD continues to increase steadily in
      Western countries, and newly industrialized countries have a rapidly increasing
      incidence. The global spread of IBD appears to associate with Westernization of
      diets and environments, which affects the intestinal microbiome and increases the
      risk of IBD in genetically susceptible individuals. It is important to increase
      our understanding of these events to slow progression of IBD. We present a
      long-term plan to develop interventions that slow or stop the global increase in 
      the incidence of IBD.

AB  - The most common question asked by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      is, "Doctor, what should I eat?" Findings from epidemiology studies have
      indicated that diets high in animal fat and low in fruits and vegetables are the 
      most common pattern associated with an increased risk of IBD. Low levels of
      vitamin D also appear to be a risk factor for IBD. In murine models, diets high
      in fat, especially saturated animal fats, also increase inflammation, whereas
      supplementation with omega 3 long-chain fatty acids protect against intestinal
      inflammation. Unfortunately, omega 3 supplements have not been shown to decrease 
      the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn's disease. Dietary intervention
      studies have shown that enteral therapy, with defined formula diets, helps
      children with Crohn's disease and reduces inflammation and dysbiosis. Although
      fiber supplements have not been shown definitively to benefit patients with IBD, 
      soluble fiber is the best way to generate short-chain fatty acids such as
      butyrate, which has anti-inflammatory effects. Addition of vitamin D and curcumin
      has been shown to increase the efficacy of IBD therapy. There is compelling
      evidence from animal models that emulsifiers in processed foods increase risk for
      IBD. We discuss current knowledge about popular diets, including the specific
      carbohydrate diet and diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides
      and polyols. We present findings from clinical and basic science studies to help 
      gastroenterologists navigate diet as it relates to the management of IBD.

AB  - Insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have
      provided important information for the development of therapeutics. Levels of
      interleukin 23 (IL23) and T-helper (Th) 17 cell pathway molecules are increased
      in inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with IBD. Loss-of-function variants of
      the IL23-receptor gene (IL23R) protect against IBD, and, in animals, blocking
      IL23 reduces the severity of colitis. These findings indicated that the IL23 and 
      Th17 cell pathways might be promising targets for the treatment of IBD. Clinical 
      trials have investigated the effects of agents designed to target distinct levels
      of the IL23 and Th17 cell pathways, and the results are providing insights into
      IBD pathogenesis and additional strategies for modulating these pathways.
      Strategies to reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines more broadly and
      increase anti-inflammatory mechanisms also are emerging for the treatment of IBD.
      The results from trials targeting these immune system pathways have provided
      important lessons for future trials. Findings indicate the importance of
      improving approaches to integrate patient features and biomarkers of response
      with selection of therapeutics.

TI  - Regulatory Analysis of Effects of Hepatitis C Virus NS5A Polymorphisms on
      Efficacy of Elbasvir and Grazoprevir.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Elbasvir (an NS5A inhibitor) and grazoprevir (an NS3/4A
      protease inhibitor) are direct-acting antiviral agents recently approved in the
      United States for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and 4
      infections, as a fixed-dose combination. Trials of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with
      or without ribavirin, demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response 12 
      weeks after treatment ended (SVR12). However, 12 weeks of treatment with elbasvir
      and grazoprevir failed in a small proportion of patients with HCV genotype 1
      infection. We summarize findings from independent US Food and Drug Administration
      analyses of drug resistance data from trials of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with
      and without ribavirin. METHODS: We independently analyzed HCV drug resistance and
      HCV RNA measurement results that were submitted to the US Food and Drug
      Administration to support the regulatory approval of elbasvir and grazoprevir.
      These data were reported from selected phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of elbasvir 
      and grazoprevir, with and without ribavirin. Genotypic resistance analyses were
      conducted using Sanger population nucleotide sequencing data derived from blood
      samples from study patients. RESULTS: In 56 of 506 (11%) patients with HCV
      genotype 1a infection who received elbasvir and grazoprevir for 12 weeks,
      baseline HCV genetic variants encoding amino acid polymorphisms in NS5A (M28,
      Q30, L31, or Y93) reduced treatment efficacy; rates of SVR12 were 70% and 98% for
      patients with or without NS5A polymorphisms, respectively (P < .0001). Most
      patients with treatment failure acquired resistance-associated substitutions in
      NS3 and/or NS5A. Based on data from a small number of patients (n = 6), an
      intensified 16-week regimen of elbasvir and grazoprevir plus ribavirin could
      increase efficacy in patients with HCV genotype 1a infection with NS5A
      polymorphisms. Among patients with HCV genotype 4a or 4d infections with NS5A
      polymorphisms, all 26 who received the elbasvir and grazoprevir regimens
      recommended in prescribing information achieved an SVR12. CONCLUSIONS: The
      combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin is safe and
      effective for patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infections. In patients with HCV 
      genotype 1a infection, polymorphisms in NS5A at baseline (before treatment) can
      affect the efficacy of this direct-acting antiviral regimen, and pretreatment
      resistance analyses can optimize treatment selection.

      A Nationwide Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopy is an integral part of the investigation and
      management of gastrointestinal disease. We aimed to examine outcomes of
      pregnancies for women who underwent endoscopy during their pregnancy. METHODS: We
      performed a nationwide population-based cohort study, linking data from the
      Swedish Medical Birth Registry (for births from 1992 through 2011) with those
      from the Swedish Patient Registry. We identified 3052 pregnancies exposed to
      endoscopy (2025 upper endoscopies, 1109 lower endoscopies, and 58 endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatographies). Using Poisson regression, we calculated
      adjusted relative risks (ARRs) for adverse outcomes of pregnancy according to
      endoscopy status using 1,589,173 unexposed pregnancies as reference. To consider 
      the effects of disease activity, we examined pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth,
      stillbirth, small for gestational age, or congenital malformations) in women who 
      underwent endoscopy just before or after pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures
      included induction of labor, low birth weight (<2500 g), cesarean section, Apgar 
      score <7 at 5 minutes, and neonatal death within 28 days. To consider
      intrafamilial factors, we compared pregnancies within the same mother. RESULTS:
      Exposure to any endoscopy during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk 
      of preterm birth (ARR, 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.75) or small
      for gestational age (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.57) but not of congenital
      malformation (ARR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83-1.20) or stillbirth (ARR, 1.45; 95% CI,
      0.87-2.40). None of the 15 stillbirths to women with endoscopy occurred <2 weeks 
      after endoscopy. ARRs were independent of trimester. Compared to women with
      endoscopy <1 year before or after pregnancy, endoscopy during pregnancy was
      associated with preterm birth (ARR, 1.16) but not with small for gestational age 
      (ARR, 1.19), stillbirth (ARR, 1.11), or congenital malformation (ARR, 0.90).
      Restricting the study population to women having an endoscopy during pregnancy or
      before/after, and only analyzing data from women without a diagnosis of
      inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or liver disease, endoscopy during
      pregnancy was not linked to preterm birth (ARR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84-1.27).
      Comparing births within the same mother, for which only 1 birth had been exposed 
      to endoscopy, we found no association between endoscopy and gestational age or
      birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide population-based cohort study, we
      found endoscopy during pregnancy to be associated with increased risk of preterm 
      birth or small for gestational age, but not of congenital malformation or
      stillbirth. However, these risks are small and likely due to intrafamilial
      factors or disease activity.

      a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be
      caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (>4 weeks in duration) are
      more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic 
      diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal 
      epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result
      from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, 
      as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various
      extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical
      evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic
      diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and
      pharmacotherapy is presented.

AB  - Intestinal microbiota are involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease,
      ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. We review the mechanisms by which these gut
      bacteria, fungi, and viruses mediate mucosal homeostasis via their composite
      genes (metagenome) and metabolic products (metabolome). We explain how
      alterations to their profiles and functions under conditions of dysbiosis
      contribute to inflammation and effector immune responses that mediate
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans and enterocolitis in mice. It could
      be possible to engineer the intestinal environment by modifying the microbiota
      community structure or function to treat patients with IBD-either with individual
      agents, via dietary management, or as adjuncts to immunosuppressive drugs. We
      summarize the latest information on therapeutic use of fecal microbial
      transplantation and propose improved strategies to selectively normalize the
      dysbiotic microbiome in personalized approaches to treatment.

AB  - The management of the pregnant patient with inflammatory bowel disease is
      complicated by multiple providers, misinformation, and a disease entity that,
      particularly when active, can adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. This article
      seeks to frame the debate on medication safety in pregnancy and lactation using
      the US Food and Drug Administration's new Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule
      and the most up-to-date safety information to discuss the risks and benefits of
      using each class of inflammatory bowel disease medication.

TI  - Isocaloric Diets High in Animal or Plant Protein Reduce Liver Fat and
      Inflammation in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with
      increased risk of hepatic, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. High-protein
      diets, rich in methionine and branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), apparently
      reduce liver fat, but can induce insulin resistance. We investigated the effects 
      of diets high in animal protein (AP) vs plant protein (PP), which differ in
      levels of methionine and BCAAs, in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. We
      examined levels of liver fat, lipogenic indices, markers of inflammation, serum
      levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and activation of signaling
      pathways in adipose tissue. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of
      individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD at a tertiary medical center in
      Germany from June 2013 through March 2015. We analyzed data from 37 subjects
      placed on a diet high in AP (rich in meat and dairy foods; n = 18) or PP (mainly 
      legume protein; n = 19) without calorie restriction for 6 weeks. The diets were
      isocaloric with the same macronutrient composition (30% protein, 40%
      carbohydrates, and 30% fat). Participants were examined at the start of the study
      and after the 6-week diet period for body mass index, body composition, hip
      circumference, resting energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient. Body fat and
      intrahepatic fat were detected by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy,
      respectively. Levels of glucose, insulin, liver enzymes, and inflammation
      markers, as well as individual free fatty acids and free amino acids, were
      measured in collected blood samples. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were
      performed to determine whole-body insulin sensitivity. Subcutaneous adipose
      tissue samples were collected and analyzed for gene expression patterns and
      phosphorylation of signaling proteins. RESULTS: Postprandial levels of BCAAs and 
      methionine were significantly higher in subjects on the AP vs the PP diet. The AP
      and PP diets each reduced liver fat by 36%-48% within 6 weeks (for AP diet P =
      .0002; for PP diet P = .001). These reductions were unrelated to change in body
      weight, but correlated with down-regulation of lipolysis and lipogenic indices.
      Serum level of FGF21 decreased by 50% in each group (for AP diet P < .0002; for
      PP diet P < .0002); decrease in FGF21 correlated with loss of hepatic fat. In
      gene expression analyses of adipose tissue, expression of the FGF21 receptor
      cofactor beta-klotho was associated with reduced expression of genes encoding
      lipolytic and lipogenic proteins. In patients on each diet, levels of hepatic
      enzymes and markers of inflammation decreased, insulin sensitivity increased, and
      serum level of keratin 18 decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of
      patients with type 2 diabetes, we found diets high in protein (either animal or
      plant) significantly reduced liver fat independently of body weight, and reduced 
      markers of insulin resistance and hepatic necroinflammation. The diets appear to 
      mediate these changes via lipolytic and lipogenic pathways in adipose tissue.
      Negative effects of BCAA or methionine were not detectable. FGF21 level appears
      to be a marker of metabolic improvement. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02402985.

AB  - Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous inflammatory bowel
      diseases, and therapeutic requirements vary among patients. We have a limited
      capacity to predict disease progression for individual patients, therefore it is 
      important that they are evaluated for the presence of active disease when
      symptoms are mild or even absent, when patients are more likely to respond to new
      treatment interventions. It then is important to monitor responses to treatment, 
      to quickly identify those therapies that are ineffective, modify or change
      therapy, and avoid disease complications. Studies are underway to assess the
      effects of different monitoring strategies. Because of the heavy burden of severe
      inflammatory bowel disease on patients' health and quality of life, and the
      association between intestinal healing and disease progression in high-risk
      patients, a treat-to-target strategy (based on tissue healing) is likely to be
      optimal.

AB  - Patients and physicians often have many questions regarding the role of
      complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), or nonallopathic therapies, for
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). CAMs of various forms are used by more than
      half of patients with IBD during some point in their disease course. We summarize
      the available evidence for the most commonly used and discussed CAMs. We discuss 
      evidence for the effects of herbs (such as cannabis and curcumin), probiotics,
      acupuncture, exercise, and mind-body therapy. There have been few controlled
      studies of these therapies, which have been limited by their small sample sizes; 
      most studies have been uncontrolled. In addition, there has been a lack of
      quality control for herbal preparations. It has been a challenge to design
      rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, in part owing to problems of
      adequate blinding for psychological interventions, acupuncture, and exercise.
      These barriers have limited the acceptance of CAMs by physicians. However, such
      therapies might be used to supplement conventional therapies and help ease
      patient symptoms. We conclude that physicians should understand the nature of and
      evidence for CAMs for IBD so that rational advice can be offered to patients who 
      inquire about their use. CAMs have the potential to aid in the treatment of IBD, 
      but further research is needed to validate these approaches.

AB  - Pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) involves immune and microbial dysregulation,
      induced by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. There
      are believed to be multiple subtypes of CD, which contributes to its observed
      clinical heterogeneity. This concept has been reinforced by recognition of the
      complexity of the genetic, microbial, immune, and environmental factors that
      affect risk for CD. Paneth cells mediate immunity and maintain the small
      intestinal epithelium; defects in activities of these cells have been observed in
      high proportions of patients with CD, and are associated with a more aggressive
      CD phenotype. Paneth cells integrate complex genetic, immune, and environmental
      signals, therefore alterations in their function could lead to different subtypes
      of CD, as observed in studies in cohorts of primarily European descent. Subtypes 
      of CD associated with Paneth cell function have been observed even among patients
      from different genetic backgrounds. We discuss genetic susceptibility loci for CD
      and how these affect Paneth cell activity.

AB  - Strategies for management of inflammatory bowel diseases are shifting from simple
      control of symptoms toward full control of these diseases (clinical and
      endoscopic remission), with the final aim of blocking their progression and
      preventing bowel damage and disability. New goals have been proposed for
      treatment, such as treat to target and tight control based on therapeutic
      monitoring and early intervention. For patients who achieve clinical remission,
      there is often interest in discontinuation of therapy due to safety or economic
      concerns. We review the evidence supporting these emerging paradigms, the reasons
      that early effective treatment can alter progression of inflammatory bowel
      diseases, the importance of examining objective signs of inflammation, and the
      safety of reducing treatment dosage. We also discuss recent findings regarding
      personalization of care, including factors that predict patient outcomes and
      response to therapies, as well as preventative strategies.

AB  - In the last 10 years, we have learned much about the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and
      management of intestinal fibrosis in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
      Just a decade ago, intestinal strictures were considered to be an inevitable
      consequence of long-term inflammation in patients who did not respond to
      anti-inflammatory therapies. Inflammatory bowel diseases-associated fibrosis was 
      seen as an irreversible process that frequently led to intestinal obstructions
      requiring surgical intervention. This paradigm has changed rapidly, due to the
      antifibrotic approaches that may become available. We review the mechanisms and
      diagnosis of this serious complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as
      factors that predict its progression and management strategies.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is molecularly diverse, with few effective therapies. Increased
      mutation burden and defective DNA repair are associated with response to immune
      checkpoint inhibitors in several other cancer types. We interrogated 385
      pancreatic cancer genomes to define hypermutation and its causes. Mutational
      signatures inferring defects in DNA repair were enriched in those with the
      highest mutation burdens. Mismatch repair deficiency was identified in 1% of
      tumors harboring different mechanisms of somatic inactivation of MLH1 and MSH2.
      Defining mutation load in individual pancreatic cancers and the optimal assay for
      patient selection may inform clinical trial design for immunotherapy in
      pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta cytokines signal via a complex network of
      pathways to regulate proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and
      other functions in many cell types. A high percentage of colorectal tumors
      contain mutations that disrupt TGF-beta family member signaling. We review how
      TGF-beta family member signaling is altered during development of colorectal
      cancer, models of study, interaction of pathways, and potential therapeutic
      strategies.

AB  - Technologies such as genome sequencing, gene expression profiling, proteomic and 
      metabolomic analyses, electronic medical records, and patient-reported health
      information have produced large amounts of data from various populations, cell
      types, and disorders (big data). However, these data must be integrated and
      analyzed if they are to produce models or concepts about physiological function
      or mechanisms of pathogenesis. Many of these data are available to the public,
      allowing researchers anywhere to search for markers of specific biological
      processes or therapeutic targets for specific diseases or patient types. We
      review recent advances in the fields of computational and systems biology and
      highlight opportunities for researchers to use big data sets in the fields of
      gastroenterology and hepatology to complement traditional means of diagnostic and
      therapeutic discovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Poorly digested, fermentable carbohydrates may induce symptoms
      of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) via unclear mechanisms. We performed a
      randomized trial with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis to investigate
      correlations between symptoms and changes in small- and large-bowel contents
      after oral challenge. METHODS: We performed a 3-period, cross-over study of 29
      adult patients with IBS (based on Rome III criteria, with symptoms of abdominal
      pain or discomfort for at least 2 days/wk) and reported bloating. In parallel, we
      performed the same study of 29 healthy individuals (controls). Studies were
      performed in the United Kingdom from January 2013 through February 2015. On 3
      separate occasions (at least 7 days apart), subjects were given a 500-mL drink
      containing 40 g of carbohydrate (glucose in the first period, fructose in the
      second, and inulin in the third, in a random order). Levels of breath hydrogen
      were measured and intestinal content was assessed by MRI before and at various
      time points after consumption of each drink. Symptoms were determined based on
      subjects' responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire
      and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15. The primary end point was whether
      participants had a clinically important symptom response during the 300 minutes
      after consumption of the drink. RESULTS: More patients with IBS reached the
      predefined symptom threshold after intake of inulin (13 of 29) or fructose (11 of
      29) than glucose (6 of 29). Symptoms peaked sooner after intake of fructose than 
      inulin. Fructose increased small-bowel water content in both patients and
      controls whereas inulin increased colonic volume and gas in both. Fructose and
      inulin increased breath hydrogen levels in both groups, compared with glucose;
      fructose produced an earlier increase than inulin. Controls had lower symptom
      scores during the period after drink consumption than patients with IBS, despite 
      similar MRI parameters and breath hydrogen responses. In patients who reached the
      symptom threshold after inulin intake, peak symptom intensity correlated with
      peak colonic gas (r = 0.57; P < .05). Changes in MRI features and peak breath
      hydrogen levels were similar in patients who did and did not reach the symptom
      threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS and healthy individuals without IBS
      (controls) have similar physiological responses after intake of fructose or
      inulin; patients reported symptoms more frequently after inulin than controls. In
      patients with a response to inulin, symptoms related to levels of intraluminal
      gas, but peak gas levels did not differ significantly between responders,
      nonresponders, or controls. This indicates that colonic hypersensitivity to
      distension, rather than excessive gas production, produces carbohydrate-related
      symptoms in patients with IBS. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01776853.

AB  - Alterations in hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) uptake and metabolism contribute to 
      the development of prevalent liver disorders such as hepatosteatosis. However,
      detecting dynamic changes in FFA uptake by the liver in live model organisms has 
      proven difficult. To enable noninvasive real-time imaging of FFA flux in the
      liver, we generated transgenic mice with liver-specific expression of luciferase 
      and performed bioluminescence imaging with an FFA probe. Our approach enabled us 
      to observe the changes in FFA hepatic uptake under different physiological
      conditions in live animals. By using this method, we detected a decrease in FFA
      accumulation in the liver after mice were given injections of deoxycholic acid
      and an increase after they were fed fenofibrate. In addition, we observed diurnal
      regulation of FFA hepatic uptake in living mice. Our imaging system appears to be
      a useful and reliable tool for studying the dynamic changes in hepatic FFA flux
      in models of liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the association between the
      composition of the intestinal microbiota and clinical features of irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated
      microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these were associated with 
      symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal and mucosal samples from adult patients who
      met the Rome III criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics
      in Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set comprised 149
      subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects); 232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal
      biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted
      pyrosequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with IBS and 17
      healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal samples, were collected and
      analyzed. For each subject, we measured exhaled H2 and CH4, oro-anal transit
      time, and the severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal
      methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Numerical
      ecology analyses and a machine learning procedure were used to analyze the data. 
      RESULTS: Fecal microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent microbiota. By
      using classic approaches, we found no differences in fecal microbiota abundance
      or composition between patients with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning 
      procedure, a computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the 16S
      ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature for severe IBS,
      consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic units. We confirmed the
      robustness of the intestinal microbial signature for severe IBS in the validation
      set. The signature was able to discriminate between patients with severe
      symptoms, patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects. By using
      this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS symptom severity to be
      associated negatively with microbial richness, exhaled CH4, presence of
      methanogens, and enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species.
      This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences in diet or use of
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal and mucosal microbiota from patients
      with IBS and healthy individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile 
      that is associated with the severity of IBS symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Effectiveness of Elbasvir and Grazoprevir Combination, With or Without Ribavirin,
      for Treatment-Experienced Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 4, 
      or 6, with or without cirrhosis, previously treated with peg-interferon and
      ribavirin, are a challenge to treat. We performed a phase 3 randomized controlled
      open-label trial to assess the effects of 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with
      once-daily elbasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor, 50 mg) and grazoprevir (an HCV NS3/4A
      protease inhibitor, 100 mg), in a fixed-dose combination tablet, with or without 
      twice-daily ribavirin, in this patient population. METHODS: We analyzed data from
      420 patients (35% with cirrhosis, 64% with a null or partial response to
      peg-interferon and ribavirin) who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to groups
      given elbasvir and grazoprevir once daily, with or without twice-daily ribavirin,
      for 12 or 16 weeks, at 65 study centers in 15 countries in Europe, Asia, and
      Central and North America. Randomization was stratified by cirrhosis status and
      type of peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment failure. HCV RNA was measured
      using COBAS TaqMan v2.0. The primary end point was HCV RNA <15 IU/mL, 12 weeks
      after completion of treatment (SVR12). We aimed to determine whether the
      proportion of patients achieving an SVR12 in any group was greater than the
      reference rate (58%). RESULTS: With 12 weeks of treatment, an SVR12 was achieved 
      by 92.4% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir and 94.2% of patients given
      elbasvir and grazoprevir with ribavirin. With 16 weeks of treatment, an SVR12 was
      achieved by 92.4% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir and 98.1% of
      patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir with ribavirin. Among patients treated
      for 12 weeks without ribavirin, virologic failure occurred in 6.8%, 0%, and 12.5%
      of patients with HCV genotype 1a, 1b, or 4 infection, respectively. Among
      patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir for 12 weeks, virologic failure occurred 
      in 0% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 who relapsed after
      completing peg-interferon and ribavirin, and 7.5% infected with HCV genotypes 1
      and 4, respectively, with a null or partial response to peg-interferon and
      ribavirin. Among patients treated for 16 weeks who received ribavirin, there were
      no incidences of virologic failure. Common adverse events were fatigue (23.1%),
      headache (19.8%), and nausea (11.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination tablet of
      elbasvir and grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin, was highly efficacious in
      inducing an SVR12 in patients with HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 infection failed by
      previous treatment with peg-interferon and ribavirin, including patients with
      cirrhosis and/or a prior null response. The treatment was generally well
      tolerated. ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT02105701.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing analysis has accelerated searches for genes associated
      with risk for colorectal cancer (CRC); germline mutations in NTHL1, RPS20, FANCM,
      FAN1, TP53, BUB1, BUB3, LRP6, and PTPN12 have been recently proposed to increase 
      CRC risk. We attempted to validate the association between variants in these
      genes and development of CRC in a systematic review of 11 publications, using
      sequence data from 863 familial CRC cases and 1604 individuals without CRC
      (controls). All cases were diagnosed at an age of 55 years or younger and did not
      carry mutations in an established CRC predisposition gene. We found sufficient
      evidence for NTHL1 to be considered a CRC predisposition gene-members of 3
      unrelated Dutch families were homozygous for inactivating p.Gln90Ter mutations; a
      Canadian woman with polyposis, CRC, and multiple tumors was reported to be
      heterozygous for the inactivating NTHL1 p.Gln90Ter/c.709+1G>A mutations; and a
      man with polyposis was reported to carry p.Gln90Ter/p.Gln287Ter; whereas no
      inactivating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were detected in
      controls. Variants that disrupted RPS20 were detected in a Finnish family with
      early-onset CRC (p.Val50SerfsTer23), a 39-year old individual with metachronous
      CRC (p.Leu61GlufsTer11 mutation), and a 41-year-old individual with CRC (missense
      p.Val54Leu), but not in controls. We therefore found published evidence to
      support the association between variants in NTHL1 and RPS20 with CRC, but not of 
      other recently reported CRC susceptibility variants. We urge the research
      community to adopt rigorous statistical and biological approaches coupled with
      independent replication before making claims of pathogenicity.

TI  - Infection of Hepatocytes With HCV Increases Cell Surface Levels of Heparan

      Up-regulating SMAD6 and SMAD7.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The signaling molecule and transcriptional regulator SMAD6,
      which inhibits the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, is required
      for infection of hepatocytes by hepatitis C virus (HCV). We investigated the
      mechanisms by which SMAD6 and another inhibitory SMAD (SMAD7) promote HCV
      infection in human hepatoma cells and hepatocytes. METHODS: We infected Huh7 and 
      Huh7.5.1 cells and primary human hepatocytes with Japanese fulminant hepatitis-1 
      (JFH1) HCV cell culture system (HCVcc). We then measured HCV binding,
      intracellular levels of HCV RNA, and expression of target genes. We examined HCV 
      entry in HepG2/microRNA (miR) 122/CD81 cells, which support entry and replication
      of HCV, were transfected these cells with small interfering RNAs targeting
      inhibitory SMADs to analyze gene expression profiles. Uptake of labeled
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol was measured. Cell surface proteins
      were quantified by flow cytometry. We obtained liver biopsy samples from 69
      patients with chronic HCV infection and 19 uninfected individuals (controls) and 
      measured levels of syndecan 1 (SDC1), SMAD7, and SMAD6 messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
      RESULTS: Small interfering RNA knockdown of SMAD6 blocked the binding and
      infection of hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes by HCV, whereas
      SMAD6 overexpression increased HCV infection. We found levels of mRNAs encoding
      heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), particularly SDC1 mRNA, and cell surface
      levels of heparan sulfate to be reduced in cells after SMAD6 knockdown. SMAD6
      knockdown also reduced transcription of genes encoding lipoprotein and
      cholesterol uptake receptors, including the LDL receptor (LDLR), the very LDLR,
      and the scavenger receptor class B member 1 in hepatocytes; knockdown of SMAD6
      also inhibited cell uptake of cholesterol and lipoprotein. Overexpression of
      SMAD6 increased the expression of these genes. Similar effects were observed with
      knockdown and overexpression of SMAD7. In addition, HCV infection of cells
      increased the expression of SMAD6, which required the activity of nuclear
      factor-kappaB, but not transforming growth factor beta. Liver tissues from
      patients with chronic HCV infection had significantly higher levels of SMAD6,
      SMAD7, and HSPG mRNAs than controls. CONCLUSIONS: In studies of hepatoma cell
      lines and primary human hepatocytes, we found that infection with HCV leads to
      activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, resulting in increased expression of SMAD6
      and SMAD7. Up-regulation of SMAD6 and SMAD7 induces the expression of HSPGs, such
      as SDC1, as well as LDLR, very LDLR, and the scavenger receptor class B member 1,
      which promote HCV entry and propagation, as well as cellular uptake of
      cholesterol and lipoprotein.

      African Americans With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in
      prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200
      susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European
      ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities.
      METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of 
      African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel
      disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from
      the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in meta-analysis with a
      nominal evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide
      significance. RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at
      ZNF649 and LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We
      detected SNPs at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No 
      associations of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9
      genes previously associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for
      replication (P < 1.6 x 10(-6)): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide
      significance on conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and 
      SNX20 (in strong linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near
      TNFRSF6B) for UC. Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and 
      genes associated with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique
      association patterns with African-specific alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a
      genome-wide association study of African Americans with IBD and identified loci
      associated with UC in only this population; we also replicated IBD, CD, and UC
      loci identified in European populations. The detection of variants associated
      with IBD risk in only people of African descent demonstrates the importance of
      studying the genetics of IBD and other complex diseases in populations beyond
      those of European ancestry.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the mechanisms of gastric
      carcinogenesis, partly because it has been a challenge to identify characterize
      gastric stem cells. Runx genes regulate development and their products are
      transcription factors associated with cancer development. A Runx1 enhancer
      element, eR1, is a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. We studied expression from
      eR1 in the stomach and the roles of gastric stem cells in gastric carcinogenesis 
      in transgenic mice. METHODS: We used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence
      analyses to study expression of Runx1 in gastric tissues from C57BL/6 (control)
      mice. We then created mice that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein
      (EGFP) or CreERT2 under the control of eR1 (eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-Lox-Stop-Lox
      [LSL]-tdTomato, eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-EYFP mice). Gastric tissues were collected
      and lineage-tracing experiments were performed. Gastric organoids were cultured
      from eR1-CreERT2(5-2);Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice and immunofluorescence analyses were
      performed. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic mutations in stem 
      cells under control of eR1 using eR1-CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice; gastric tissues
      were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Most
      proliferation occurred in the isthmus; 86% of proliferating cells were
      RUNX1-positive and 76% were MUC5AC-positive. In eR1-EGFP mice, EGFP signals were 
      detected mainly in the upper part of the gastric unit, and 83% of EGFP-positive
      cells were located in the isthmus/pit region. We found that eR1 marked
      undifferentiated stem cells in the isthmus and a smaller number of terminally
      differentiated chief cells at the base. eR1 also marked cells in the pyloric
      gland in the antrum. Lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that stem cells in 
      the isthmus and antrum continuously gave rise to mature cells to maintain the
      gastric unit. eR1-positive cells in the isthmus and pyloric gland generated
      organoid cultures in vitro. In eR1-CreERT2;LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice, MUC5AC-positive 
      cells rapidly differentiated from stem cells in the isthmus, resulting in
      distinct metaplastic lesions similar to that observed in human gastric atrophy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using lineage-tracing experiments in mice, we found that a Runx1
      enhancer element, eR1, promotes its expression in the isthmus stem cells of
      stomach corpus as well as pyloric gland in the antrum. We were able to use eR1 to
      express oncogenic mutations in gastric stem cells, proving a new model for
      studies of gastric carcinogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy over the ability of transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) to increase survival times of patients
      with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. The high rate of shunt dysfunction with
      the use of uncovered stents counteracts the benefits of TIPS. We performed a
      randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of TIPS with stents covered 
      with polytetrafluoroethylene in these patients. METHODS: We performed a
      prospective study of 62 patients with cirrhosis and at least 2 large-volume
      paracenteses within a period of at least 3 weeks; the study was performed at 4
      tertiary care centers in France from August 2005 through December 2012. Patients 
      were randomly assigned to groups that received covered TIPS (n = 29) or
      large-volume paracenteses and albumin as necessary (LVP+A, n = 33). All patients 
      maintained a low-salt diet and were examined at 1 month after the procedure then 
      every 3 months until 1 year. At each visit, liver disease-related complications, 
      treatment modifications, and clinical and biochemical variables needed to
      calculate Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores were recorded. 
      Doppler ultrasonography was performed at the start of the study and then at 6 and
      12 months after the procedure. The primary study end point was survival without a
      liver transplant for 1 year after the procedure. RESULTS: A higher proportion of 
      patients in the TIPS group (93%) met the primary end point than in the LVP+A
      group (52%) (P = .003). The total number of paracenteses was 32 in the TIPS group
      vs 320 in the LVP+A group. Higher proportions of patients in the LVP+A group had 
      portal hypertension-related bleeding (18% vs 0%; P = .01) or hernia-related
      complications (18% vs 0%; P = .01) than in the TIPS group. Patients in LVP+A
      group had twice as many days of hospitalization (35 days) as the TIPS group (17
      days) (P = .04). The 1-year probability of remaining free of encephalopathy was
      65% for each group. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial, we found covered stents
      for TIPS to increase the proportion of patients with cirrhosis and recurrent
      ascites who survive transplantation-free for 1 year, compared with patients given
      repeated LVP+A. These findings support TIPS as the first-line intervention in
      such patients. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00222014.

      Coactivator 1alpha to Reduce Oxidative Damage Associated With Diet-Induced Fatty 
      Liver Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inefficient fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and increased
      oxidative damage are features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In
      rodent models and patients with NAFLD, hepatic expression of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG) coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A or
      PGC1A) is inversely correlated with liver fat and disease severity. A common
      polymorphism in this gene (rs8192678, encoding Gly482Ser) has been associated
      with NAFLD. We investigated whether reduced expression of PGC1A contributes to
      development of NAFLD using mouse models, primary hepatocytes, and human cell
      lines. METHODS: HepG2 cells were transfected with variants of PPARGC1A and
      protein and messenger RNA levels were measured. Mice with liver-specific
      hemizygous or homozygous disruption of Ppargc1a (Ppargc1a(f/+)Alb-cre(+/0) and
      Ppargc1a(f/f) Alb-cre(+/0) mice, respectively) were fed regular chow (control) or
      a high-fat diet supplemented with 30% d-fructose in drinking water (obesogenic
      diet) for 25-33 weeks. Liver tissues were analyzed by histology and by
      immunoblotting. Primary hepatocytes were analyzed for insulin signaling, reactive
      oxygen species, and estrogen response. Luciferase reporter expression was
      measured in transfected H2.35 cells expressing an estrogen receptor reporter
      gene, estrogen receptor 1, and/or PGC1A/B. RESULTS: The serine 482 variant of the
      human PGC1A protein had a shorter half-life than the glycine 482 variant when
      expressed in HepG2 cells. Liver tissues from mice with liver-specific hemizygous 
      disruption of Ppargc1a placed on an obesogenic diet expressed increased markers
      of inflammation and fibrosis and decreased levels of antioxidant enzymes compared
      with the Ppargc1a(+/+) on the same diet. Oxidative damage was observed in livers 
      from Ppargc1a(f/+)Alb-cre(+/0) mice of each sex, in a cell-autonomous manner, but
      was greater in livers from the female mice. Expression of PGC1A in H2.35 cells
      coactivated estrogen receptor 1 and was required for estrogen-dependent
      expression of genes that encode antioxidant proteins. These findings could
      account for the increased liver damage observed in female
      Ppargc1a(f/+)Alb-cre(+/0) mice; while, compensatory increases in PPARG
      coactivator 1beta could prevent oxidative damage associated with complete loss of
      PGC1A expression in Ppargc1a(f/f)Alb-cre(+/0) female mice. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, 
      loss of estrogen signaling contributes to oxidative damage caused by low levels
      of PGC1A in liver, exacerbating steatohepatitis associated with diets high in
      fructose and fat.

      Compared With Standard Medical Care.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Functional constipation (FC) is a common childhood problem
      often related to pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. We compared the effectiveness
      of pelvic physiotherapy (PPT) vs standard medical care (SMC) in children with FC.
      METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial of 53 children
      (age, 5-16 y) with FC according to the Rome III criteria, at hospitals in The
      Netherlands from December 2009 to May 2014. Group allocation was concealed using 
      a central computer system. SMC consisted of education, toilet training, and
      laxatives (n = 26), whereas PPT included SMC plus specific physiotherapeutic
      interventions (n = 27). Results were obtained from written reports from the
      subjects' pediatricians and parents. The primary outcome was absence of FC,
      according to Rome III criteria, after a 6-month follow-up period. Secondary
      outcomes were global perceived effect (range, 1-9; success was defined as a score
      >/= 8), numeric rating scales assessing quality of life (parent and child; scale,
      1-10), and the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: Treatment
      was effective for 92.3% of the children receiving PPT and for 63.0% of the
      children receiving SMC (adjusted odds ratio for success of PPT, 11.7; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.8-78.3) (P = .011). Significantly more children undergoing
      PPT stopped using laxatives (adjusted odds ratio, 6.5; 95% confidence interval,
      1.6-26.4) (P = .009). Treatment success (based on global perceived effect) was
      achieved for 88.5% of subjects receiving PPT vs 33.3% of subjects receiving SMC) 
      (P < .001). PPT also produced larger adjusted mean differences, before vs after
      treatment, in numeric rating scales to assess quality of life: an increase of 1.8
      points for parents (P = .047) and 2.0 points for children (P = .028). Results
      from the SDQ did not differ significantly between groups (P = .78). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In a randomized controlled trial of children with FC, PPT was more effective than
      SMC on all outcomes measured, with the exception of findings from the SDQ. PPT
      should be considered as a treatment option for FC in children 5-16 years old.

TI  - Similar Efficacy of Proton-Pump Inhibitors vs H2-Receptor Antagonists in Reducing
      Risk of Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding or Ulcers in High-Risk Users of Low-Dose 
      Aspirin.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear whether H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) reduce
      the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in aspirin users at high risk. We
      performed a double-blind randomized trial to compare the effects of a proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) vs a H2RA antagonist in preventing recurrent upper GI bleeding
      and ulcers in high-risk aspirin users. METHODS: We studied 270 users of low-dose 
      aspirin (</=325 mg/day) with a history of endoscopically confirmed ulcer bleeding
      at 8 sites in Hong Kong and Japan. After healing of ulcers, subjects with
      negative results from tests for Helicobacter pylori resumed aspirin (80 mg) daily
      and were assigned randomly to groups given a once-daily PPI (rabeprazole, 20 mg; 
      n = 138) or H2RA (famotidine, 40 mg; n = 132) for up to 12 months. Subjects were 
      evaluated every 2 months; endoscopy was repeated if they developed symptoms of
      upper GI bleeding or had a reduction in hemoglobin level greater than 2 g/dL and 
      after 12 months of follow-up evaluation. The adequacy of upper GI protection was 
      assessed by end points of recurrent upper GI bleeding and a composite of
      recurrent upper GI bleeding or recurrent endoscopic ulcers at month 12. RESULTS: 
      During the 12-month study period, upper GI bleeding recurred in 1 patient
      receiving rabeprazole (0.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1%-5.1%) and in 4
      patients receiving famotidine (3.1%; 95% CI, 1.2%-8.1%) (P = .16). The composite 
      end point of recurrent bleeding or endoscopic ulcers at month 12 was reached by 9
      patients receiving rabeprazole (7.9%; 95% CI, 4.2%-14.7%) and 13 patients
      receiving famotidine (12.4%; 95% CI, 7.4%-20.4%) (P = .26). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      randomized controlled trial of users of low-dose aspirin at risk for recurrent GI
      bleeding, a slightly lower proportion of patients receiving a PPI along with
      aspirin developed recurrent bleeding or ulcer than of patients receiving an H2RA 
      with the aspirin, although this difference was not statistically significant.

TI  - Eradication of Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Patients With Cirrhosis Reduces
      Risk of Liver and Non-Liver Complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We performed a prospective study to investigate the effects of
      a sustained viral response (SVR) on outcomes of patients with hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection and compensated cirrhosis. METHODS: We collected data from 1323
      patients included in the prospective Agence Nationale pour la Recherche sur le
      SIDA et les hepatites virales (ANRS) viral cirrhosis (CirVir) cohort, recruited
      from 35 clinical centers in France from 2006 through 2012. All patients had HCV
      infection and biopsy-proven cirrhosis, were Child-Pugh class A, and had no prior 
      liver complications. All patients received anti-HCV treatment before or after
      inclusion (with interferon then with direct antiviral agents) and underwent an
      ultrasound examination every 6 months, as well as endoscopic evaluations. SVR was
      considered as a time-dependent covariate; its effect on outcome was assessed by
      the Cox proportional hazard regression method. We used a propensity score to
      minimize confounding by indication of treatment and capacity to achieve SVR.
      RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 58.2 months, 668 patients (50.5%)
      achieved SVR. SVR was associated with a decreased incidence of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (hazard ratio [HR] compared with patients without an SVR, 0.29; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.43; P < .001) and hepatic decompensation (HR,
      0.26; 95% CI, 0.17-0.39; P < .001). Patients with SVRs also had a lower risk of
      cardiovascular events (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.69; P = .001) and bacterial
      infections (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29-0.68; P < .001). Metabolic features were
      associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with SVRs, 
      but not in patients with viremia. SVR affected overall mortality (HR, 0.27
      compared with patients without SVR; 95% CI, 0.18-0.42; P < .001) and death from
      liver-related and non-liver-related causes. Similar results were obtained in a
      propensity score-matched population. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed a reduction in
      critical events, liver-related or not, in a prospective study of patients with
      HCV infection and compensated cirrhosis included in the CirVir cohort who
      achieved an SVR. We found an SVR to reduce overall mortality and risk of death
      from liver-related and non-liver-related causes. A longer follow-up evaluation is
      required to accurately describe and assess specific risk factors for
      complications in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: GATA3 is a transcription factor that regulates T-cell
      production of cytokines. We investigated the role of GATA3 in development of
      colitis in mice. METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
      immunofluorescence analyses of colon tissues from patients with Crohn's disease
      (n = 61) or ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 74) or from patients without inflammatory
      bowel diseases (n = 22), to measure levels of GATA3. Colitis was induced by
      administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to control
      mice, mice with T-cell-specific deletion of GATA3, and mice with deletion of
      tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 (TNFR double knockouts); some
      mice were given a GATA3-specific DNAzyme (hgd40) or a control DNAzyme via
      intrarectal administration, or systemic injections of an antibody to TNF before
      or during sensitization and challenge phase of colitis induction. Colon tissues
      were collected and immunofluorescence and histochemical analyses were performed. 
      Lamina propria mononuclear cells and T cells were isolated and analyzed by flow
      cytometry or cytokine assays. Colonic distribution of labeled DNAzyme and
      inflammation were monitored by in vivo imaging (endoscopy) of mice. RESULTS:
      Levels of GATA3 messenger RNA were higher in colon tissues from patients with UC,
      but not ileal Crohn's disease, than control tissues; levels of GATA3 correlated
      with levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL] 9, IL17A, IL6, IL5, IL4, 
      IL13, and TNF). We observed increased expression of GATA3 by lamina propria T
      cells from mice with colitis compared with controls. Mice with T-cell-specific
      deletion of GATA3 did not develop colitis and their colonic tissues did not
      produce inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL9, or IL13). The DNAzyme hgd40 inhibited
      expression of GATA3 messenger RNA by unstimulated and stimulated T cells, and
      distributed throughout the inflamed colons of mice with colitis. Colon tissues
      from mice given hgd40 had reduced expression of GATA3 messenger RNA, compared
      with mice given a control DNAzyme. Mice given hgd40 did not develop colitis after
      administration of oxazolone or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; lamina propria
      cells from these mice expressed lower levels of IL6, IL9, and IL13 than cells
      from mice given the control DNAzyme. Mini-endoscopic images revealed that hgd40
      and anti-TNF reduced colon inflammation over 3 days; hgd40 reduced colitis in
      TNFR double-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of GATA3 are increased in patients
      with UC and correlate with production of inflammatory cytokines in mice and
      humans. A DNAzyme that prevents expression of GATA3 reduces colitis in mice,
      independently of TNF, and reduces levels of cytokines in the colon. This DNAzyme 
      might be developed for treatment of patients with UC.

      Cirrhosis in A Population Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious complication of
      cirrhosis and is associated with gut dysbiosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
      frequently prescribed to patients with cirrhosis, can contribute to small-bowel
      bacterial overgrowth. We investigated whether PPI predisposes patients with
      cirrhosis to HE using a large database of patients. METHODS: We performed a
      case-control study nested within a sample of Taiwan National Health Insurance
      beneficiaries (n = 1,000,000), followed up longitudinally from 1998 through 2011.
      Patients with cirrhosis and an occurrence of HE (n = 1166) were selected as the
      case cohort and matched to patients without HE (1:1, controls) for sex,
      enrollment time, end point time, follow-up period, and advanced cirrhosis.
      Information on prescribed drugs, drug dosage, supply days, and numbers of
      dispensed pills was extracted from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database.
      PPI use was defined as more than 30 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs); PPI
      nonuse was defined as 30 cDDDs or fewer. We performed logistic regression
      analyses to estimate the association between PPI use and the occurrence of HE.
      RESULTS: Among patients with cirrhosis and an occurrence of HE, 38% (n = 445) had
      a history of PPI use before HE occurrence. We observed a relationship between
      dose of PPI taken and HE risk. The confounder-adjusted odd ratios were 1.41 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.84), 1.51 (95% CI, 1.11-2.06), and 3.01 (95% CI,
      1.78-5.10) for patients with 30-120 cDDDs, 120-365 cDDDs, and more than 365
      cDDDs, respectively, compared with PPI nonusers. All categories of PPIs, except
      rabeprazole, were associated with an increased risk of HE. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 
      an analysis of data from Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries, we found
      that use of PPIs in patients with cirrhosis increases the risk for HE; risk
      increases with dose. It therefore is important for health care providers to
      carefully consider prolonged PPI use by patients with cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Certain subsets of colorectal serrated polyps (SP) have
      malignant potential. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      investigate the association between modifiable lifestyle factors and risk for
      SPs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of
      Science for observational or interventional studies that contained the terms risk
      or risk factor, and serrated or hyperplastic, and polyps or adenomas, and
      colorectal (or synonymous terms), published by March 2016. Titles and abstracts
      of identified articles were independently reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.
      Adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were combined using 
      random effects meta-analyses to assess the risk of SP, when possible. RESULTS: We
      identified 43 studies of SP risk associated with 7 different lifestyle factors:
      smoking, alcohol, body fatness, diet, physical activity, medication, and
      hormone-replacement therapy. When we compared the highest and lowest categories
      of exposure, factors we found to significantly increase risk for SP included
      tobacco smoking (RR, 2.47; 95% CI, 2.12-2.87), alcohol intake (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 
      1.17-1.52), body mass index (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.22-1.61), and high intake of fat
      or meat. Direct associations for smoking and alcohol, but not body fat, tended to
      be stronger for sessile serrated adenomas/polyps than hyperplastic polyps. In
      contrast, factors we found to significantly decrease risks for SP included use of
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.92) or aspirin
      (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99), as well as high intake of folate, calcium, or
      fiber. No significant associations were detected between SP risk and physical
      activity or hormone replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Several lifestyle factors, 
      most notably smoking and alcohol, are associated with SP risk. These findings
      enhance our understanding of mechanisms of SP development and indicate that risk 
      of serrated pathway colorectal neoplasms could be reduced with lifestyle changes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: No targeted therapies have been found to be effective against 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), possibly due to the large degree of intratumor
      heterogeneity. We performed genetic analyses of different regions of HCCs to
      evaluate levels of intratumor heterogeneity and associate alterations with
      responses to different pharmacologic agents. METHODS: We obtained samples of HCCs
      (associated with hepatitis B virus infection) from 10 patients undergoing
      curative resection, before adjuvant therapy, at hospitals in China. We collected 
      4-9 spatially distinct samples from each tumor (55 regions total), performed
      histologic analyses, isolated cancer cells, and carried them low-passage culture.
      We performed whole-exome sequencing, copy-number analysis, and high-throughput
      screening of the cultured primary cancer cells. We tested responses of an
      additional 105 liver cancer cell lines to a fibroblast growth factor receptor
      (FGFR) 4 inhibitor. RESULTS: We identified a total of 3670 non-silent mutations
      (3192 missense, 94 splice-site variants, and 222 insertions or deletions) in the 
      tumor samples. We observed considerable intratumor heterogeneity and branched
      evolution in all 10 tumors; the mean percentage of heterogeneous mutations in
      each tumor was 39.7% (range, 12.9%-68.5%). We found significant mutation shifts
      toward C>T and C>G substitutions in branches of phylogenetic trees among samples 
      from each tumor (P < .0001). Of note, 14 of the 26 oncogenic alterations (53.8%) 
      varied among subclones that mapped to different branches. Genetic alterations
      that can be targeted by existing pharmacologic agents (such as those in FGF19,
      DDR2, PDGFRA, and TOP1) were identified in intratumor subregions from 4 HCCs and 
      were associated with sensitivity to these agents. However, cells from the
      remaining subregions, which did not have these alterations, were not sensitive to
      these drugs. High-throughput screening identified pharmacologic agents to which
      these cells were sensitive, however. Overexpression of FGF19 correlated with
      sensitivity of cells to an inhibitor of FGFR 4; this observation was validated in
      105 liver cancer cell lines (P = .0024). CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing genetic
      alterations in different tumor regions of 10 HCCs, we observed extensive
      intratumor heterogeneity. Our patient-derived cell line-based model, integrating 
      genetic and pharmacologic data from multiregional cancer samples, provides a
      platform to elucidate how intratumor heterogeneity affects sensitivity to
      different therapeutic agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: De novo synthesis of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-fucose, a
      substrate for fucosylglycans, requires sequential reactions mediated by
      GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose
      3,5-epimerase-4-reductase (FX or tissue specific transplantation antigen P35B
      [TSTA3]). GMDS deletions and mutations are found in 6%-13% of colorectal cancers;
      these mostly affect the ascending and transverse colon. We investigated whether a
      lack of fucosylation consequent to loss of GDP-fucose synthesis contributes to
      colon carcinogenesis. METHODS: FX deficiency and GMDS deletion produce the same
      biochemical phenotype of GDP-fucose deficiency. We studied a mouse model of
      fucosylation deficiency (Fx-/- mice) and mice with the full-length Fx gene
      (controls). Mice were placed on standard chow or fucose-containing diet
      (equivalent to a control fucosylglycan phenotype). Colon tissues were collected
      and analyzed histologically or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure
      cytokine levels; T cells also were collected and analyzed. Fecal samples were
      analyzed by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing. Mucosal barrier function was measured
      by uptake of fluorescent dextran. We transplanted bone marrow cells from Fx-/- or
      control mice (Ly5.2) into irradiated 8-week-old Fx-/- or control mice (Ly5.1). We
      performed immunohistochemical analyses for expression of Notch and the hes family
      bHLH transcription factor (HES1) in colon tissues from mice and a panel of 60
      human colorectal cancer specimens (27 left-sided, 33 right-sided). RESULTS: Fx-/-
      mice developed colitis and serrated-like lesions. The intestinal pathology of
      Fx-/- mice was reversed by addition of fucose to the diet, which restored
      fucosylation via a salvage pathway. In the absence of fucosylation, dysplasia
      appeared and progressed to adenocarcinoma in up to 40% of mice, affecting mainly 
      the right colon and cecum. Notch was not activated in Fx-/- mice fed standard
      chow, leading to decreased expression of its target Hes1. Fucosylation deficiency
      altered the composition of the fecal microbiota, reduced mucosal barrier
      function, and altered epithelial proliferation marked by Ki67. Fx-/- mice
      receiving control bone marrow cells had intestinal inflammation and dysplasia,
      and reduced expression of cytokines produced by cytotoxic T cells. Human sessile 
      serrated adenomas and right-sided colorectal tumors with epigenetic loss of MutL 
      homolog 1 (MLH1) had lost or had lower levels of HES1 than other colorectal tumor
      types or nontumor tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, fucosylation deficiency leads to
      colitis and adenocarcinoma, loss of Notch activation, and down-regulation of
      Hes1. HES1 loss correlates with the development of human right-sided colorectal
      tumors with epigenetic loss of MLH1. These findings indicate that carcinogenesis 
      in a subset of colon cancer is consequent to a molecular mechanism driven by
      fucosylation deficiency and/or HES1-loss.
