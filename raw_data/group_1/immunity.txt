TI  - KLRG1(+) Effector CD8(+) T Cells Lose KLRG1, Differentiate into All Memory T Cell
      Lineages, and Convey Enhanced Protective Immunity.

AB  - Protective immunity against pathogens depends on the efficient generation of
      functionally diverse effector and memory T lymphocytes. However, whether
      plasticity during effector-to-memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation affects memory
      lineage specification and functional versatility remains unclear. Using genetic
      fate mapping analysis of highly cytotoxic KLRG1(+) effector CD8(+) T cells, we
      demonstrated that KLRG1(+) cells receiving intermediate amounts of activating and
      inflammatory signals downregulated KLRG1 during the contraction phase in a
      Bach2-dependent manner and differentiated into all memory T cell linages,
      including CX3CR1(int) peripheral memory cells and tissue-resident memory cells.
      "ExKLRG1" memory cells retained high cytotoxic and proliferative capacity
      distinct from other populations, which contributed to effective anti-influenza
      and anti-tumor immunity. Our work demonstrates that developmental plasticity of
      KLRG1(+) effector CD8(+) T cells is important in promoting functionally versatile
      memory cells and long-term protective immunity.

TI  - A Circular RNA Protects Dormant Hematopoietic Stem Cells from DNA Sensor
      cGAS-Mediated Exhaustion.

LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2018.03.016 [doi]
AB  - Disrupting the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic 
      stem cells (HSCs) leads to bone marrow failure or hematologic malignancy.
      However, how HSCs sustain their quiescent state and avoid type I interferon
      (IFN)-mediated exhaustion remains elusive. Here we defined a circular RNA that we
      named cia-cGAS that was highly expressed in the nucleus of long-term (LT)-HSCs.
      Cia-cGAS deficiency in mice caused elevated expression of type I IFNs in bone
      marrow and led to decreased numbers of dormant LT-HSCs. Under homeostatic
      conditions, cia-cGAS bound DNA sensor cGAS in the nucleus to block its synthase
      activity, thereby protecting dormant LT-HSCs from cGAS-mediated exhaustion.
      Moreover, cia-cGAS harbored a stronger binding affinity to cGAS than self-DNA did
      and consequently suppressed cGAS-mediated production of type I IFNs in LT-HSCs.
      Our findings reveal a mechanism by which cia-cGAS inhibits nuclear cGAS by
      blocking its enzymatic activity and preventing cGAS from recognizing self-DNA to 
      maintain host homeostasis.

TI  - Co-inhibitory Molecule B7 Superfamily Member 1 Expressed by Tumor-Infiltrating
      Myeloid Cells Induces Dysfunction of Anti-tumor CD8(+) T Cells.
LID - S1074-7613(18)30115-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2018.03.018 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms whereby CD8(+) T cells become "exhausted" in the tumor
      microenvironment remain unclear. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is upregulated
      on tumor cells and PD-1-PD-L1 blockade has significant efficacy in human tumors; 
      however, most patients do not respond, suggesting additional mechanisms
      underlying T cell exhaustion. B7 superfamily member 1 (B7S1), also called B7-H4, 
      B7x, or VTCN1, negatively regulates T cell activation. Here we show increased
      B7S1 expression on myeloid cells from human hepatocellular carcinoma correlated
      with CD8(+) T cell dysfunction. B7S1 inhibition suppressed development of murine 
      tumors. Putative B7S1 receptor was co-expressed with PD-1 but not T cell
      immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3) at an activated state of
      early tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells, and B7S1 promoted T cell exhaustion,
      possibly through Eomes overexpression. Combinatorial blockade of B7S1 and PD-1
      synergistically enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. Collectively, B7S1
      initiates dysfunction of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and may be targeted
      for cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA containing CpG motifs derived from
      bacteria and viruses and activates the innate immune response to eliminate them. 
      TLR9 is known to bind to CpG DNA, and here, we identified another DNA binding
      site in TLR9 that binds DNA containing cytosine at the second position from the
      5' end (5'-xCx DNA). 5'-xCx DNAs bound to TLR9 in the presence of CpG DNA and
      cooperatively promoted dimerization and activation of TLR9. Binding at both sites
      was important for efficient activation of TLR9. The 5'-xCx DNA bound the site
      corresponding to the nucleoside binding site in TLR7 and TLR8 as revealed by the 
      structural analysis. This study revealed that TLR9 recognizes two types of DNA
      through its two binding sites for efficient activation. This information may
      contribute to the development of drugs that control the activity of TLR9.

TI  - Interleukin-15 Complex Treatment Protects Mice from Cerebral Malaria by Inducing

AB  - Cerebral malaria is a deadly complication of Plasmodium infection and involves
      blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption following infiltration of white blood cells.
      During experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), mice inoculated with Plasmodium
      berghei ANKA-infected red blood cells develop a fatal CM-like disease caused by
      CD8(+) T cell-mediated pathology. We found that treatment with interleukin-15
      complex (IL-15C) prevented ECM, whereas IL-2C treatment had no effect.
      IL-15C-expanded natural killer (NK) cells were necessary and sufficient for
      protection against ECM. IL-15C treatment also decreased CD8(+) T cell activation 
      in the brain and prevented BBB breakdown without influencing parasite load.
      IL-15C induced NK cells to express IL-10, which was required for IL-15C-mediated 
      protection against ECM. Finally, we show that ALT-803, a modified human IL-15C,
      mediates similar induction of IL-10 in NK cells and protection against ECM. These
      data identify a regulatory role for cytokine-stimulated NK cells in the
      prevention of a pathogenic immune response.

AB  - Polymorphisms in NFKB1 that diminish its expression have been linked to human
      inflammatory diseases and increased risk for epithelial cancers. The underlying
      mechanisms are unknown, and the link is perplexing given that NF-kappaB signaling
      reportedly typically exerts pro-tumorigenic activity. Here we have shown that
      NF-kappaB1 deficiency, even loss of a single allele, resulted in spontaneous
      invasive gastric cancer (GC) in mice that mirrored the histopathological
      progression of human intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma. Bone marrow chimeras
      revealed that NF-kappaB1 exerted tumor suppressive functions in both epithelial
      and hematopoietic cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that NF-kappaB1 deficiency
      resulted in aberrant JAK-STAT signaling, which dysregulated expression of
      effectors of inflammation, antigen presentation, and immune checkpoints.
      Concomitant loss of STAT1 prevented these immune abnormalities and GC
      development. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how polymorphisms
      that attenuate NFKB1 expression predispose humans to epithelial cancers,
      highlighting the pro-tumorigenic activity of STAT1 and identifying targetable
      vulnerabilities in GC.

AB  - The death receptor Fas removes activated lymphocytes through apoptosis. Previous 
      transcriptional profiling predicted that Fas positively regulates interleukin-17 
      (IL-17)-producing T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Here, we demonstrate that Fas
      promoted the generation and stability of Th17 cells and prevented their
      differentiation into Th1 cells. Mice with T-cell- and Th17-cell-specific deletion
      of Fas were protected from induced autoimmunity, and Th17 cell differentiation
      and stability were impaired. Fas-deficient Th17 cells instead developed a
      Th1-cell-like transcriptional profile, which a new algorithm predicted to depend 
      on STAT1. Experimentally, Fas indeed bound and sequestered STAT1, and Fas
      deficiency enhanced IL-6-induced STAT1 activation and nuclear translocation,
      whereas deficiency of STAT1 reversed the transcriptional changes induced by Fas
      deficiency. Thus, our computational and experimental approach identified Fas as a
      regulator of the Th17-to-Th1 cell balance by controlling the availability of
      opposing STAT1 and STAT3 to have a direct impact on autoimmunity.

AB  - Selective expansion of high-affinity antigen-specific B cells in germinal centers
      (GCs) is a key event in antibody affinity maturation. GC B cells with improved
      affinity can either continue affinity-driven selection or exit the GC to
      differentiate into plasma cells (PCs) or memory B cells. Here we found that
      deleting E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl and Cbl-b (Cbls) in GC B cells resulted in the 
      early exit of high-affinity antigen-specific B cells from the GC reaction and
      thus impaired clonal expansion. Cbls were highly expressed in GC light zone (LZ) 
      B cells, where they promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of Irf4, a
      transcription factor facilitating PC fate choice. Strong CD40 and BCR stimulation
      triggered the Cbl degradation, resulting in increased Irf4 expression and exit
      from GC affinity selection. Thus, a regulatory cascade that is centered on the
      Cbl ubiquitin ligases ensures affinity-driven clonal expansion by connecting BCR 
      affinity signals with differentiation programs.

      Science, Vainchtein et al. (2018) describe an additional role for
      astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33) in promoting synapse refinement by
      microglia in the developing brain.

AB  - Most studies on the immunotherapeutic potential of T cells have focused on CD8
      and CD4 T cells that recognize peptide antigens (Ag) presented by polymorphic
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II molecules,
      respectively. However, unconventional T cells, which interact with MHC class Ib
      and MHC-I like molecules, are also implicated in tumor immunity, although their
      role therein is unclear. These include unconventional T cells targeting MHC class
      Ib molecules such as HLA-E and its murine ortholog Qa-1b, natural killer T (NKT) 
      cells, mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gammadelta T cells. Here,
      we review the current understanding of the roles of these unconventional T cells 
      in tumor immunity and discuss why further studies into the immunotherapeutic
      potential of these cells is warranted.

AB  - Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is frequently observed in human
      cancers. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 on activated T cells inhibits
      anti-tumor immunity by counteracting T cell-activating signals. Antibody-based
      PD-1-PD-L1 inhibitors can induce durable tumor remissions in patients with
      diverse advanced cancers, and thus expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and other
      cells in the tumor microenviroment is of major clinical relevance. Here we review
      the roles of the PD-1-PD-L1 axis in cancer, focusing on recent findings on the
      mechanisms that regulate PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional,
      posttranscriptional, and protein level. We place this knowledge in the context of
      observations in the clinic and discuss how it may inform the design of more
      precise and effective cancer immune checkpoint therapies.

AB  - The success of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with a wide variety of
      malignancies has changed the treatment paradigm in oncology. However, combination
      therapies with immune checkpoint blockade will be needed to overcome resistance
      and broaden the clinical utility of immunotherapy. Here we discuss a framework
      for rationally designing combination therapy strategies based on enhancing major 
      discriminatory functions of the immune system that are corrupted by
      cancer-namely, antigenicity, adjuvanticity, and homeostatic feedback inhibition. 
      We review recent advances on how conventional genotoxic cancer therapies,
      molecularly targeted therapies, epigenetic agents, and immune checkpoint
      inhibitors can restore these discriminatory functions. Potential barriers that
      can impede response despite combination therapy are also discussed.

AB  - Owing to their tremendous diversity and plasticity, immune cells exert
      multifaceted functions in tumor-bearing hosts, ranging from anti-tumor to
      pro-tumor activities. Tumor immune landscapes differ greatly between and within
      cancer types. Emerging evidence suggests that genetic aberrations in cancer cells
      dictate the immune contexture of tumors. Here, we review the current
      understanding of the mechanisms whereby common drivers of tumorigenesis modulate 
      the tumor immune milieu. We discuss these findings in the context of clinical
      observations and examine how cancer-cell-intrinsic properties can be exploited to
      maximize the benefit of immunomodulatory therapies. Understanding the
      relationship between cancer cell-intrinsic genetic events and the immune response
      may enable personalized immune intervention strategies for cancer patients.

AB  - Live vaccines historically afford superior protection, yet the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms mediating protective immunity remain unclear. Here we found 
      that vaccination of mice with live, but not dead, Gram-negative bacteria
      heightened follicular T helper cell (Tfh) differentiation, germinal center
      formation, and protective antibody production through the signaling adaptor TRIF.
      Complementing the dead vaccine with an innate signature of bacterial viability,
      bacterial RNA, recapitulated these responses. The interferon (IFN) and
      inflammasome pathways downstream of TRIF orchestrated Tfh responses extrinsically
      to B cells and classical dendritic cells. Instead, CX3CR1(+)CCR2(-) monocytes
      instructed Tfh differentiation through interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a tightly
      regulated cytokine secreted upon TRIF-dependent IFN licensing of the
      inflammasome. Hierarchical production of IFN-beta and IL-1beta dictated Tfh
      differentiation and elicited the augmented humoral responses characteristic of
      live vaccines. These findings identify bacterial RNA, an innate signature of
      microbial viability, as a trigger for Tfh differentiation and suggest new
      approaches toward vaccine formulations for coordinating augmented Tfh and B cell 
      responses.

AB  - Microglia as tissue macrophages contribute to the defense and maintenance of
      central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Little is known about the epigenetic
      signals controlling microglia function in vivo. We employed constitutive and
      inducible mutagenesis in microglia to delete two class I histone deacetylases,
      Hdac1 and Hdac2. Prenatal ablation of Hdac1 and Hdac2 impaired microglial
      development. Mechanistically, the promoters of pro-apoptotic and cell cycle genes
      were hyperacetylated in absence of Hdac1 and Hdac2, leading to increased
      apoptosis and reduced survival. In contrast, Hdac1 and Hdac2 were not required
      for adult microglia survival during homeostasis. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's 
      disease, deletion of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in microglia, but not in neuroectodermal
      cells, resulted in a decrease in amyloid load and improved cognitive impairment
      by enhancing microglial amyloid phagocytosis. Collectively, we report a role for 
      epigenetic factors that differentially affect microglia development, homeostasis,
      and disease that could potentially be utilized therapeutically.

TI  - A Neutralizing Antibody Recognizing Primarily N-Linked Glycan Targets the Silent 
      Face of the HIV Envelope.

AB  - Virtually the entire surface of the HIV-1-envelope trimer is recognized by
      neutralizing antibodies, except for a highly glycosylated region at the center of
      the "silent face" on the gp120 subunit. From an HIV-1-infected donor, #74, we
      identified antibody VRC-PG05, which neutralized 27% of HIV-1 strains. The crystal
      structure of the antigen-binding fragment of VRC-PG05 in complex with gp120
      revealed an epitope comprised primarily of N-linked glycans from N262, N295, and 
      N448 at the silent face center. Somatic hypermutation occurred preferentially at 
      antibody residues that interacted with these glycans, suggesting somatic
      development of glycan recognition. Resistance to VRC-PG05 in donor #74 involved
      shifting of glycan-N448 to N446 or mutation of glycan-proximal residue E293.
      HIV-1 neutralization can thus be achieved at the silent face center by
      glycan-recognizing antibody; along with other known epitopes, the VRC-PG05
      epitope completes coverage by neutralizing antibody of all major exposed regions 
      of the prefusion closed trimer.

AB  - Although interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT
      proteins) inhibit infection of many viruses by recognizing their RNA, the
      regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we report a crystal structure
      of cap 0 (m(7)GpppN) RNA bound to human IFIT1 in complex with the C-terminal
      domain of human IFIT3. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that 
      IFIT3 binding to IFIT1 has dual regulatory functions: (1) extending the half-life
      of IFIT1 and thereby increasing its steady-state amounts in cells; and (2)
      allosterically regulating the IFIT1 RNA-binding channel, thereby enhancing the
      specificity of recognition for cap 0 but not cap 1 (m(7)GpppNm) or 5'-ppp RNA.
      Mouse Ifit3 lacks this key C-terminal domain and does not bind mouse Ifit1. The
      IFIT3 interaction with IFIT1 is important for restricting infection of viruses
      lacking 2'-O methylation in their RNA cap structures. Our experiments establish
      differences in the regulation of IFIT1 orthologs and define targets for
      modulation of human IFIT protein activity.

AB  - Glycolysis is linked to the rapid response of memory CD8(+) T cells, but the
      molecular and subcellular structural elements enabling enhanced glucose
      metabolism in nascent activated memory CD8(+) T cells are unknown. We found that 
      rapid activation of protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) by mammalian target of
      rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) led to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta 
      (GSK3beta) at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions. This enabled
      recruitment of hexokinase I (HK-I) to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 
      on mitochondria. Binding of HK-I to VDAC promoted respiration by facilitating
      metabolite flux into mitochondria. Glucose tracing pinpointed pyruvate oxidation 
      in mitochondria, which was the metabolic requirement for rapid generation of
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in memory T cells. Subcellular organization of
      mTORC2-AKT-GSK3beta at mitochondria-ER contact sites, promoting HK-I recruitment 
      to VDAC, thus underpins the metabolic reprogramming needed for memory CD8(+) T
      cells to rapidly acquire effector function.

AB  - Neutrophils are specialized innate cells that require constant replenishment from
      proliferative bone marrow (BM) precursors as a result of their short half-life.
      Although it is established that neutrophils are derived from the
      granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), the differentiation pathways from GMP to
      functional mature neutrophils are poorly defined. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF)
      and cell-cycle-based analysis, we identified three neutrophil subsets within the 
      BM: a committed proliferative neutrophil precursor (preNeu) which differentiates 
      into non-proliferating immature neutrophils and mature neutrophils.
      Transcriptomic profiling and functional analysis revealed that preNeu require the
      C/EBPepsilon transcription factor for their generation from the GMP, and their
      proliferative program is substituted by a gain of migratory and effector function
      as they mature. preNeus expand under microbial and tumoral stress, and immature
      neutrophils are recruited to the periphery of tumor-bearing mice. In summary, our
      study identifies specialized BM granulocytic populations that ensure supply under
      homeostasis and stress responses.

AB  - Immunosurveillance of secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) is performed by central
      memory T cells that recirculate through blood. Resident memory T (Trm) cells
      remain parked in nonlymphoid tissues and often stably express CD69. We recently
      identified Trm cells within SLO, but the origin and phenotype of these cells
      remains unclear. Using parabiosis of "dirty" mice, we found that CD69 expression 
      is insufficient to infer stable residence of SLO Trm cells. Restimulation of
      nonlymphoid memory CD8(+) T cells within the skin or mucosa resulted in a
      substantial increase in bona fide Trm cells specifically within draining lymph
      nodes. SLO Trm cells derived from emigrants from nonlymphoid tissues and shared
      some transcriptional and phenotypic signatures associated with nonlymphoid Trm
      cells. These data indicate that nonlymphoid cells can give rise to SLO Trm cells 
      and suggest vaccination strategies by which memory CD8(+) T cell
      immunosurveillance can be regionalized to specific lymph nodes.

AB  - Stem cells are critical for the maintenance of many tissues, but whether their
      integrity is maintained in the face of immunity is unclear. Here we found that
      cycling epithelial stem cells, including Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells, as well
      as ovary and mammary stem cells, were eliminated by activated T cells, but
      quiescent stem cells in the hair follicle and muscle were resistant to T cell
      killing. Immune evasion was an intrinsic property of the quiescent stem cells
      resulting from systemic downregulation of the antigen presentation machinery,
      including MHC class I and TAP proteins, and is mediated by the transactivator
      NLRC5. This process was reversed upon stem cell entry into the cell cycle. These 
      studies identify a link between stem cell quiescence, antigen presentation, and
      immune evasion. As cancer-initiating cells can derive from stem cells, these
      findings may help explain how the earliest cancer cells evade immune
      surveillance.

AB  - T cell development is orchestrated by transcription factors that regulate the
      expression of genes initially buried within inaccessible chromatin, but the
      transcription factors that establish the regulatory landscape of the T cell
      lineage remain unknown. Profiling chromatin accessibility at eight stages of T
      cell development revealed the selective enrichment of TCF-1 at genomic regions
      that became accessible at the earliest stages of development. TCF-1 was further
      required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements and at the
      single-cell level, it dictated a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells.
      TCF-1 expression in fibroblasts generated de novo chromatin accessibility even at
      chromatin regions with repressive marks, inducing the expression of T
      cell-restricted genes. These results indicate that a mechanism by which TCF-1
      controls T cell fate is through its widespread ability to target silent chromatin
      and establish the epigenetic identity of T cells.

AB  - How chromatin reorganization coordinates differentiation and lineage commitment
      from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to mature immune cells has
      not been well understood. Here, we carried out an integrative analysis of
      chromatin accessibility, topologically associating domains, AB compartments, and 
      gene expression from HSPCs to CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells. We found that abrupt
      genome-wide changes at all three levels of chromatin organization occur during
      the transition from double-negative stage 2 (DN2) to DN3, accompanying the T
      lineage commitment. The transcription factor BCL11B, a critical regulator of T
      cell commitment, is associated with increased chromatin interaction, and Bcl11b
      deletion compromised chromatin interaction at its target genes. We propose that
      these large-scale and concerted changes in chromatin organization present an
      energy barrier to prevent the cell from reversing its fate to earlier stages or
      redirecting to alternatives and thus lock the cell fate into the T lineages.

AB  - Considerable advances have been made in recent years in understanding the
      generation and function of memory T cells. Memory T cells are typically parsed
      into discreet subsets based on phenotypic definitions that connote distinct roles
      in immunity. Here we consider new developments in the field and focus on how
      emerging differences between memory cells with respect to their trafficking,
      metabolism, epigenetic regulation, and longevity may fail to fit into small
      groups of "memory subsets." Rather, the properties of individual memory T cells
      fall on a continuum within each of these and other parameters. We discuss how
      this continuum influences the way that the efficacy of vaccination is assessed,
      as well as the suitability of a memory population for protective immunity.

AB  - Throughout life, T cells coordinate multiple aspects of adaptive immunity,
      including responses to pathogens, allergens, and tumors. In mouse models, the
      role of T cells is studied in the context of a specific type of pathogen,
      antigen, or disease condition over a limited time frame, whereas in humans, T
      cells control multiple insults simultaneously throughout the body and maintain
      immune homeostasis over decades. In this review, we discuss how human T cells
      develop and provide essential immune protection at different life stages and
      highlight tissue localization and subset delineation as key determinants of the T
      cell functional role in immune responses. We also discuss how anatomic
      compartments undergo distinct age-associated changes in T cell subset composition
      and function over a lifetime. It is important to consider age and tissue
      influences on human T cells when developing targeted strategies to modulate T
      cell-mediated immunity in vaccines and immunotherapies.

      inflammatory type 2 ILCs migrate from the intestine to the lungs and that this
      movement is guided by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.

AB  - Activated B cells mature in germinal centers (GCs), but GC initiation during
      infection is poorly understood. Gaya et al. (2018) show that NKT cells, activated
      by CD169(+) macrophages, produce an early wave of interleukin-4 (IL-4) that
      promotes GC formation during viral infection.

TI  - E3 Ligase VHL Promotes Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Maturation and Function via

AB  - Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a specialized subset of lymphoid
      effector cells that are critically involved in allergic responses; however, the
      mechanisms of their regulation remain unclear. We report that conditional
      deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL in innate lymphoid progenitors minimally 
      affected early-stage bone marrow ILC2s but caused a selective and intrinsic
      decrease in mature ILC2 numbers in peripheral non-lymphoid tissues, resulting in 
      reduced type 2 immune responses. VHL deficiency caused the accumulation of
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and attenuated interleukin-33 (IL-33)
      receptor ST2 expression, which was rectified by HIF1alpha ablation or inhibition.
      HIF1alpha-driven expression of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2
      downmodulated ST2 expression via epigenetic modification and inhibited
      IL-33-induced ILC2 development. Our study indicates that the VHL-HIF-glycolysis
      axis is essential for the late-stage maturation and function of ILC2s via
      targeting IL-33-ST2 pathway.

AB  - Individual reports suggest that the central nervous system (CNS) contains
      multiple immune cell types with diverse roles in tissue homeostasis, immune
      defense, and neurological diseases. It has been challenging to map leukocytes
      across the entire brain, and in particular in pathology, where phenotypic changes
      and influx of blood-derived cells prevent a clear distinction between reactive
      leukocyte populations. Here, we applied high-dimensional single-cell mass and
      fluorescence cytometry, in parallel with genetic fate mapping systems, to
      identify, locate, and characterize multiple distinct immune populations within
      the mammalian CNS. Using this approach, we revealed that microglia, several
      subsets of border-associated macrophages and dendritic cells coexist in the CNS
      at steady state and exhibit disease-specific transformations in the immune
      microenvironment during aging and in models of Alzheimer's disease and multiple
      sclerosis. Together, these data and the described framework provide a resource
      for the study of disease mechanisms, potential biomarkers, and therapeutic
      targets in CNS disease.

AB  - Despite evidence that gammadelta T cells play an important role during malaria,
      their precise role remains unclear. During murine malaria induced by Plasmodium
      chabaudi infection and in human P. falciparum infection, we found that gammadelta
      T cells expanded rapidly after resolution of acute parasitemia, in contrast to
      alphabeta T cells that expanded at the acute stage and then declined. Single-cell
      sequencing showed that TRAV15N-1 (Vdelta6.3) gammadelta T cells were clonally
      expanded in mice and had convergent complementarity-determining region 3
      sequences. These gammadelta T cells expressed specific cytokines, M-CSF, CCL5,
      CCL3, which are known to act on myeloid cells, indicating that this gammadelta T 
      cell subset might have distinct functions. Both gammadelta T cells and M-CSF were
      necessary for preventing parasitemic recurrence. These findings point to an
      M-CSF-producing gammadelta T cell subset that fulfills a specialized protective
      role in the later stage of malaria infection when alphabeta T cells have
      declined.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant mortality, and
      there are currently no licensed vaccines to protect this vulnerable population. A
      comprehensive understanding of infant antibody responses to natural RSV infection
      would facilitate vaccine development. Here, we isolated more than 450 RSV fusion 
      glycoprotein (F)-specific antibodies from 7 RSV-infected infants and found that
      half of the antibodies recognized only two antigenic sites. Antibodies targeting 
      both sites showed convergent sequence features, and structural studies revealed
      the molecular basis for their recognition of RSV F. A subset of antibodies
      targeting one of these sites displayed potent neutralizing activity despite
      lacking somatic mutations, and similar antibodies were detected in RSV-naive B
      cell repertoires, suggesting that expansion of these B cells in infants may be
      possible with suitably designed vaccine antigens. Collectively, our results
      provide fundamental insights into infant antibody responses and a framework for
      the rational design of age-specific RSV vaccines.

AB  - Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones with strong anti-inflammatory and
      immunosuppressive effects that are produced in a diurnal fashion. Although
      glucocorticoids have the potential to induce interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R)
      expression in T cells, whether they control T cell homeostasis and responses at
      physiological concentrations remains unclear. We found that glucocorticoid
      receptor signaling induces IL-7R expression in mouse T cells by binding to an
      enhancer of the IL-7Ralpha locus, with a peak at midnight and a trough at midday.
      This diurnal induction of IL-7R supported the survival of T cells and their
      redistribution between lymph nodes, spleen, and blood by controlling expression
      of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. In mice, T cell accumulation in the spleen at
      night enhanced immune responses against soluble antigens and systemic bacterial
      infection. Our results reveal the immunoenhancing role of glucocorticoids in
      adaptive immunity and provide insight into how immune function is regulated by
      the diurnal rhythm.

AB  - Positive selection of germinal center (GC) B cells is driven by B cell receptor
      (BCR) affinity and requires help from follicular T helper cells. The
      transcription factors c-Myc and Foxo1 are critical for GC B cell selection and
      survival. However, how different affinity-related signaling events control these 
      transcription factors in a manner that links to selection is unknown. Here we
      showed that GC B cells reprogram CD40 and BCR signaling to transduce via
      NF-kappaB and Foxo1, respectively, whereas naive B cells propagate both signals
      downstream of either receptor. Although either BCR or CD40 ligation induced c-Myc
      in naive B cells, both signals were required to highly induce c-Myc, a critical
      mediator of GC B cell survival and cell cycle reentry. Thus, GC B cells rewire
      their signaling to enhance selection stringency via a requirement for both
      antigen receptor- and T cell-mediated signals to induce mediators of positive
      selection.

AB  - Chronic viral infections remain a global health concern. The early events that
      facilitate viral persistence have been linked to the activity of the
      immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. However, the mechanisms by which IL-10
      facilitates the establishment of chronic infection are not fully understood.
      Herein, we demonstrated that the antigen sensitivity of CD8(+) T cells was
      decreased during chronic infection and that this was directly mediated by IL-10. 
      Mechanistically, we showed that IL-10 induced the expression of Mgat5, a
      glycosyltransferase that enhances N-glycan branching on surface glycoproteins.
      Increased N-glycan branching on CD8(+) T cells promoted the formation of a
      galectin 3-mediated membrane lattice, which restricted the interaction of key
      glycoproteins, ultimately increasing the antigenic threshold required for T cell 
      activation. Our study identified a regulatory loop in which IL-10 directly
      restricts CD8(+) T cell activation and function through modification of cell
      surface glycosylation allowing the establishment of chronic infection.

AB  - CD103(+) dendritic cells are critical for cross-presentation of tumor antigens.
      Here we have shown that during immunotherapy, large numbers of cells expressing
      CD103 arose in murine tumors via direct differentiation of Ly6c(+) monocytic
      precursors. These Ly6c(+)CD103(+) cells could derive from bone-marrow monocytic
      progenitors (cMoPs) or from peripheral cells present within the myeloid-derived
      suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Differentiation was controlled by
      inflammation-induced activation of the transcription factor p53, which drove
      upregulation of Batf3 and acquisition of the Ly6c(+)CD103(+) phenotype. Mice with
      a targeted deletion of p53 in myeloid cells selectively lost the Ly6c(+)CD103(+) 
      population and became unable to respond to multiple forms of immunotherapy and
      immunogenic chemotherapy. Conversely, increasing p53 expression using a
      p53-agonist drug caused a sustained increase in Ly6c(+)CD103(+) cells in tumors
      during immunotherapy, which markedly enhanced the efficacy and duration of
      response. Thus, p53-driven differentiation of Ly6c(+)CD103(+) monocytic cells
      represents a potent and previously unrecognized target for immunotherapy.

TI  - The Transcription Factor STAT6 Mediates Direct Repression of Inflammatory
      Enhancers and Limits Activation of Alternatively Polarized Macrophages.

AB  - The molecular basis of signal-dependent transcriptional activation has been
      extensively studied in macrophage polarization, but our understanding remains
      limited regarding the molecular determinants of repression. Here we show that
      IL-4-activated STAT6 transcription factor is required for the direct
      transcriptional repression of a large number of genes during in vitro and in vivo
      alternative macrophage polarization. Repression results in decreased
      lineage-determining transcription factor, p300, and RNA polymerase II binding
      followed by reduced enhancer RNA expression, H3K27 acetylation, and chromatin
      accessibility. The repressor function of STAT6 is HDAC3 dependent on a subset of 
      IL-4-repressed genes. In addition, STAT6-repressed enhancers show extensive
      overlap with the NF-kappaB p65 cistrome and exhibit decreased responsiveness to
      lipopolysaccharide after IL-4 stimulus on a subset of genes. As a consequence,
      macrophages exhibit diminished inflammasome activation, decreased IL-1beta
      production, and pyroptosis. Thus, the IL-4-STAT6 signaling pathway establishes an
      alternative polarization-specific epigenenomic signature resulting in dampened
      macrophage responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli.

TI  - Chanzyme TRPM7 Mediates the Ca(2+) Influx Essential for
      Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Toll-Like Receptor 4 Endocytosis and Macrophage
      Activation.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns to
      activate the production of inflammatory mediators. TLR4 recognizes
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and drives the secretion of inflammatory cytokines,
      often contributing to sepsis. We report that transient receptor potential
      melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7), a non-selective but Ca(2+)-conducting ion channel,
      mediates the cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations essential for LPS-induced macrophage
      activation. LPS triggered TRPM7-dependent Ca(2+) elevations essential for TLR4
      endocytosis and the subsequent activation of the transcription factor IRF3. In a 
      parallel pathway, the Ca(2+) signaling initiated by TRPM7 was also essential for 
      the nuclear translocation of NFkappaB. Consequently, TRPM7-deficient macrophages 
      exhibited major deficits in the LPS-induced transcriptional programs in that they
      failed to produce IL-1beta and other key pro-inflammatory cytokines. In accord
      with these defects, mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Trpm7 are protected
      from LPS-induced peritonitis. Our study highlights the importance of Ca(2+)
      signaling in macrophage activation and identifies the ion channel TRPM7 as a
      central component of TLR4 signaling.

AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor
      that is activated by small molecules provided by the diet, microorganisms,
      metabolism, and pollutants. AhR is expressed by a number of immune cells, and
      thus AhR signaling provides a molecular pathway that integrates the effects of
      the environment and metabolism on the immune response. Studies have shown that
      AhR signaling plays important roles in the immune system in health and disease.
      As its activity is regulated by small molecules, AhR also constitutes a potential
      target for therapeutic immunomodulation. In this review we discuss the role of
      AhR in the regulation of the immune response in the context of autoimmunity,
      infection, and cancer, as well as the potential opportunities and challenges of
      developing AhR-targeted therapeutics.

AB  - Human B cell antigen-receptor (BCR) repertoires reflect repeated exposures to
      evolving influenza viruses; new exposures update the previously generated B cell 
      memory (Bmem) population. Despite structural similarity of hemagglutinins (HAs)
      from the two groups of influenza A viruses, cross-reacting antibodies (Abs) are
      uncommon. We analyzed Bmem compartments in three unrelated, adult donors and
      found frequent cross-group BCRs, both HA-head directed and non-head directed.
      Members of a clonal lineage from one donor had a BCR structure similar to that of
      a previously described Ab, encoded by different gene segments. Comparison showed 
      that both Abs contacted the HA receptor-binding site through long heavy-chain
      third complementarity determining regions. Affinities of the clonal-lineage BCRs 
      for historical influenza-virus HAs from both group 1 and group 2 viruses
      suggested that serial responses to seasonal influenza exposures had elicited the 
      lineage and driven affinity maturation. We propose that appropriate immunization 
      regimens might elicit a comparably broad response.

AB  - Despite recent advances, many cancers remain refractory to available
      immunotherapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence indicates that the tolerization
      of local dendritic cells (DCs) within the tumor microenvironment promotes immune 
      evasion. Here, we have described a mechanism by which melanomas establish a site 
      of immune privilege via a paracrine Wnt5a-beta-catenin-peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) signaling pathway that drives 
      fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in DCs by upregulating the expression of the carnitine
      palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) fatty acid transporter. This FAO shift increased 
      the protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group of indoleamine 2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO)
      while suppressing interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-12 cytokine expression, culminating in
      enhanced IDO activity and the generation of regulatory T cells. We demonstrated
      that blockade of this pathway augmented anti-melanoma immunity, enhanced the
      activity of anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy, and suppressed disease progression 
      in a transgenic melanoma model. This work implicates a role for tumor-mediated
      metabolic reprogramming of local DCs in immune evasion and immunotherapy
      resistance.

AB  - Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) sense environmental signals and are
      critical for tissue integrity in the intestine. Yet, which signals are sensed and
      what receptors control ILC3 function remain poorly understood. Here, we show that
      ILC3s with a lymphoid-tissue-inducer (LTi) phenotype expressed G-protein-coupled 
      receptor 183 (GPR183) and migrated to its oxysterol ligand
      7alpha,25-hydroxycholesterol (7alpha,25-OHC). In mice lacking Gpr183 or
      7alpha,25-OHC, ILC3s failed to localize to cryptopatches (CPs) and isolated
      lymphoid follicles (ILFs). Gpr183 deficiency in ILC3s caused a defect in CP and
      ILF formation in the colon, but not in the small intestine. Localized oxysterol
      production by fibroblastic stromal cells provided an essential signal for colonic
      lymphoid tissue development, and inflammation-induced increased oxysterol
      production caused colitis through GPR183-mediated cell recruitment. Our findings 
      show that GPR183 promotes lymphoid organ development and indicate that
      oxysterol-GPR183-dependent positioning within tissues controls ILC3 activity and 
      intestinal homeostasis.

      human tumors correlates with better prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which
      NK cells control tumors in vivo are unclear. Here, we used reflectance confocal
      microscopy (RCM) imaging in humans and in mice to visualize tumor architecture in
      vivo. We demonstrated that signaling via the NK cell receptor NKp46 (human) and
      Ncr1 (mouse) induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion from intratumoral NK 
      cells. NKp46- and Ncr1-mediated IFN-gamma production led to the increased
      expression of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin 1 (FN1) in the tumors,
      which altered primary tumor architecture and resulted in decreased metastases
      formation. Injection of IFN-gamma into tumor-bearing mice or transgenic
      overexpression of Ncr1 in NK cells in mice resulted in decreased metastasis
      formation. Thus, we have defined a mechanism of NK cell-mediated control of
      metastases in vivo that may help develop NK cell-dependent cancer therapies.

AB  - Acute hepatitis A (AHA) involves severe CD8(+) T cell-mediated liver injury. Here
      we showed during AHA, CD8(+) T cells specific to unrelated viruses became
      activated. Hepatitis A virus (HAV)-infected cells produced IL-15 that induced T
      cell receptor (TCR)-independent activation of memory CD8(+) T cells.
      TCR-independent activation of non-HAV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in
      patients, as indicated by NKG2D upregulation, a marker of TCR-independent T cell 
      activation by IL-15. CD8(+) T cells derived from AHA patients exerted innate-like
      cytotoxicity triggered by activating receptors NKG2D and NKp30 without TCR
      engagement. We demonstrated that the severity of liver injury in AHA patients
      correlated with the activation of HAV-unrelated virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and
      the innate-like cytolytic activity of CD8(+) T cells, but not the activation of
      HAV-specific T cells. Thus, host injury in AHA is associated with innate-like
      cytotoxicity of bystander-activated CD8(+) T cells, a result with implications
      for acute viral diseases.

AB  - How precursor frequencies and antigen affinities impact interclonal B cell
      competition is a particularly relevant issue for candidate germline-targeting HIV
      vaccine designs because of the in vivo rarity of naive B cells that recognize
      broadly neutralizing epitopes. Knowing the frequencies and affinities of
      HIV-specific VRC01-class naive human B cells, we transferred B cells with
      germline VRC01 B cell receptors into congenic recipients to elucidate the roles
      of precursor frequency, antigen affinity, and avidity on B cell responses
      following immunization. All three factors were interdependently limiting for
      competitive success of VRC01-class B cells. In physiological high-affinity
      conditions using a multivalent immunogen, rare VRC01-class B cells successfully
      competed in germinal centers (GC), underwent extensive somatic hypermutation, and
      differentiated into memory B cells. The data reveal dominant influences of
      precursor frequency, affinity, and avidity for interclonal GC competition and
      indicate that germline-targeting immunogens can overcome these challenges with
      high-affinity multimeric designs.

AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23), an IL-12 family cytokine, plays pivotal roles in
      pro-inflammatory T helper 17 cell responses linked to autoimmune and inflammatory
      diseases. Despite intense therapeutic targeting, structural and mechanistic
      insights into receptor complexes mediated by IL-23, and by IL-12 family members
      in general, have remained elusive. We determined a crystal structure of human
      IL-23 in complex with its cognate receptor, IL-23R, and revealed that IL-23R
      bound to IL-23 exclusively via its N-terminal immunoglobulin domain. The
      structural and functional hotspot of this interaction partially restructured the 
      helical IL-23p19 subunit of IL-23 and restrained its IL-12p40 subunit to
      cooperatively bind the shared receptor IL-12Rbeta1 with high affinity. Together
      with structural insights from the interaction of IL-23 with the inhibitory
      antibody briakinumab and by leveraging additional IL-23:antibody complexes, we
      propose a mechanistic paradigm for IL-23 and IL-12 whereby cognate receptor
      binding to the helical cytokine subunits primes recruitment of the shared
      receptors via the IL-12p40 subunit.

AB  - The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are cytosolic proteins that exhibit
      inflammatory activity upon release into the extracellular space. These factors
      are released following various cell death processes, with pyroptosis being a
      common mechanism. Recently, it was recognized that phagocytes can achieve a state
      of hyperactivation, which is defined by their ability to secrete IL-1 while
      retaining viability, yet it is unclear how IL-1 can be secreted from living
      cells. Herein, we report that the pyroptosis regulator gasdermin D (GSDMD) was
      necessary for IL-1beta secretion from living macrophages that have been exposed
      to inflammasome activators, such as bacteria and their products or host-derived
      oxidized lipids. Cell- and liposome-based assays demonstrated that GSDMD pores
      were required for IL-1beta transport across an intact lipid bilayer. These
      findings identify a non-pyroptotic function for GSDMD, and raise the possibility 
      that GSDMD pores represent conduits for the secretion of cytosolic cytokines
      under conditions of cell hyperactivation.

AB  - CD4(+) T cells are tightly regulated by microbiota in the intestine, but whether 
      intestinal T cells interface with host-derived metabolites is less clear. Here,
      we show that CD4(+) T effector (Teff) cells upregulated the xenobiotic
      transporter, Mdr1, in the ileum to maintain homeostasis in the presence of bile
      acids. Whereas wild-type Teff cells upregulated Mdr1 in the ileum, those lacking 
      Mdr1 displayed mucosal dysfunction and induced Crohn's disease-like ileitis
      following transfer into Rag1(-/-) hosts. Mdr1 mitigated oxidative stress and
      enforced homeostasis in Teff cells exposed to conjugated bile acids (CBAs), a
      class of liver-derived emulsifying agents that actively circulate through the
      ileal mucosa. Blocking ileal CBA reabsorption in transferred Rag1(-/-) mice
      restored Mdr1-deficient Teff cell homeostasis and attenuated ileitis. Further, a 
      subset of ileal Crohn's disease patients displayed MDR1 loss of function.
      Together, these results suggest that coordinated interaction between mucosal Teff
      cells and CBAs in the ileum regulate intestinal immune homeostasis.

AB  - Memory B cells (MBCs) and plasma cells (PCs) constitute the two cellular outputs 
      of germinal center (GC) responses that together facilitate long-term humoral
      immunity. Although expression of the transcription factor BLIMP-1 identifies
      cells undergoing PC differentiation, no such marker exists for cells committed to
      the MBC lineage. Here, we report that the chemokine receptor CCR6 uniquely marks 
      MBC precursors in both mouse and human GCs. CCR6(+) GC B cells were highly
      enriched within the GC light zone (LZ), were the most quiescent of all GC B
      cells, exhibited a cell-surface phenotype and gene expression signature
      indicative of an MBC transition, and possessed the augmented response
      characteristics of MBCs. MBC precursors within the GC LZ predominantly possessed 
      a low affinity for antigen but also included cells from within the high-affinity 
      pool. These data indicate a fundamental dichotomy between the processes that
      drive MBC and PC differentiation during GC responses.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are present in large populations at the maternal-fetal 
      interface during early pregnancy. However, the role of NK cells in fetal growth
      is unclear. Here, we have identified a CD49a(+)Eomes(+) subset of NK cells that
      secreted growth-promoting factors (GPFs), including pleiotrophin and osteoglycin,
      in both humans and mice. The crosstalk between HLA-G and ILT2 served as a
      stimulus for GPF-secreting function of this NK cell subset. Decreases in this
      GPF-secreting NK cell subset impaired fetal development, resulting in fetal
      growth restriction. The transcription factor Nfil3, but not T-bet, affected the
      function and the number of this decidual NK cell subset. Adoptive transfer of
      induced CD49a(+)Eomes(+) NK cells reversed impaired fetal growth and rebuilt an
      appropriate local microenvironment. These findings reveal properties of NK cells 
      in promoting fetal growth. In addition, this research proposes approaches for
      therapeutic administration of NK cells in order to reverse restricted
      nourishments within the uterine microenvironment during early pregnancy.

AB  - Human in vitro generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and macrophages
      are used clinically, e.g., to induce immunity against cancer. However, their
      physiological counterparts, ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and
      heterogeneity remains largely unknown, hampering their clinical use.
      High-dimensional techniques were used to elucidate transcriptional, phenotypic,
      and functional differences between human in vivo and in vitro generated
      mononuclear phagocytes to facilitate their full potential in the clinic. We
      demonstrate that monocytes differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resembled in
      vivo inflammatory macrophages, while moDCs resembled in vivo inflammatory DCs.
      Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic,
      phenotypic, and functional differences. Monocytes integrated GM-CSF and IL-4
      stimulation combinatorically and temporally, resulting in a mode- and
      time-dependent differentiation relying on NCOR2. Finally, moDCs are
      phenotypically heterogeneous and therefore necessitate the use of
      high-dimensional phenotyping to open new possibilities for better clinical
      tailoring of these cellular therapies.

AB  - Type-2-cell-mediated immune responses play a critical role in mediating both
      host-resistance and disease-tolerance mechanisms during helminth infections.
      Recently, type 2 cell responses have emerged as major regulators of tissue repair
      and metabolic homeostasis even under steady-state conditions. In this review, we 
      consider how studies of helminth infection have contributed toward our expanding 
      cellular and molecular understanding of type-2-cell-mediated immunity, as well as
      new areas such as the microbiome. By studying how these successful parasites form
      chronic infections without overt pathology, we are gaining additional insights
      into allergic and inflammatory diseases, as well as normal physiology.

      issue of Science, Wang et al. (2017) reveal an additional function of a
      host-encoded long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in regulating viral expression by
      binding a host metabolic enzyme to enhance its catalytic activity.

AB  - The tumor suppressor PTEN controls cell proliferation by regulating
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, but the participation of PTEN in
      host defense against bacterial infection is less well understood.
      Anti-inflammatory PI3K-Akt signaling is suppressed in patients with cystic
      fibrosis (CF), a disease characterized by hyper-inflammatory responses to airway 
      infection. We found that Ptenl(-/-) mice, which lack the NH2-amino terminal
      splice variant of PTEN, were unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the 
      airways and could not generate sufficient anti-inflammatory PI3K activity,
      similar to what is observed in CF. PTEN and the CF transmembrane conductance
      regulator (CFTR) interacted directly and this interaction was necessary to
      position PTEN at the membrane. CF patients under corrector-potentiator therapy,
      which enhances CFTR transport to the membrane, have increased PTEN amounts. These
      findings suggest that improved CFTR trafficking could enhance P. aeruginosa
      clearance from the CF airway by activating PTEN-mediated anti-bacterial responses
      and might represent a therapeutic strategy.

TI  - Transcription Factor IRF4 Promotes CD8(+) T Cell Exhaustion and Limits the
      Development of Memory-like T Cells during Chronic Infection.

AB  - During chronic stimulation, CD8(+) T cells acquire an exhausted phenotype
      characterized by expression of inhibitory receptors, down-modulation of effector 
      function, and metabolic impairments. T cell exhaustion protects from excessive
      immunopathology but limits clearance of virus-infected or tumor cells. We
      transcriptionally profiled antigen-specific T cells from mice infected with
      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strains that cause acute or chronic disease. T
      cell exhaustion during chronic infection was driven by high amounts of T cell
      receptor (TCR)-induced transcription factors IRF4, BATF, and NFATc1. These
      regulators promoted expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, and
      mediated impaired cellular metabolism. Furthermore, they repressed the expression
      of TCF1, a transcription factor required for memory T cell differentiation.
      Reducing IRF4 expression restored the functional and metabolic properties of
      antigen-specific T cells and promoted memory-like T cell development. These
      findings indicate that IRF4 functions as a central node in a TCR-responsive
      transcriptional circuit that establishes and sustains T cell exhaustion during
      chronic infection.

TI  - Oncogenic RAS Signaling Promotes Tumor Immunoresistance by Stabilizing PD-L1
      mRNA.

AB  - The immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 is upregulated in many cancers and
      contributes to evasion of the host immune system. The relative importance of the 
      tumor microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic signaling in the regulation of
      PD-L1 expression remains unclear. We report that oncogenic RAS signaling can
      upregulate tumor cell PD-L1 expression through a mechanism involving increases in
      PD-L1 mRNA stability via modulation of the AU-rich element-binding protein
      tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP negatively regulates PD-L1 expression through AU-rich 
      elements in the 3' UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. MEK signaling downstream of RAS leads to
      phosphorylation and inhibition of TTP by the kinase MK2. In human lung and
      colorectal tumors, RAS pathway activation is associated with elevated PD-L1
      expression. In vivo, restoration of TTP expression enhances anti-tumor immunity
      dependent on degradation of PD-L1 mRNA. We demonstrate that RAS can drive
      cell-intrinsic PD-L1 expression, thus presenting therapeutic opportunities to
      reverse the innately immunoresistant phenotype of RAS mutant cancers.

TI  - Roquin Suppresses the PI3K-mTOR Signaling Pathway to Inhibit T Helper Cell
      Differentiation and Conversion of Treg to Tfr Cells.

AB  - Roquin proteins preclude spontaneous T cell activation and aberrant
      differentiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) or T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Here we
      showed that deletion of Roquin-encoding alleles specifically in regulatory T
      (Treg) cells also caused the activation of conventional T cells. Roquin-deficient
      Treg cells downregulated CD25, acquired a follicular Treg (Tfr) cell phenotype,
      and suppressed germinal center reactions but could not protect from colitis.
      Roquin inhibited the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway by upregulation of Pten through 
      interfering with miR-17 approximately 92 binding to an overlapping cis-element in
      the Pten 3' UTR, and downregulated the Foxo1-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch.
      Loss of Roquin enhanced Akt-mTOR signaling and protein synthesis, whereas
      inhibition of PI3K or mTOR in Roquin-deficient T cells corrected enhanced Tfh and
      Th17 or reduced iTreg cell differentiation. Thereby, Roquin-mediated control of
      PI3K-mTOR signaling prevents autoimmunity by restraining activation and
      differentiation of conventional T cells and specialization of Treg cells.

AB  - White adipose tissue bridges body organs and plays a fundamental role in host
      metabolism. To what extent adipose tissue also contributes to immune surveillance
      and long-term protective defense remains largely unknown. Here, we have shown
      that at steady state, white adipose tissue contained abundant memory lymphocyte
      populations. After infection, white adipose tissue accumulated large numbers of
      pathogen-specific memory T cells, including tissue-resident cells. Memory T cells
      in white adipose tissue expressed a distinct metabolic profile, and white adipose
      tissue from previously infected mice was sufficient to protect uninfected mice
      from lethal pathogen challenge. Induction of recall responses within white
      adipose tissue was associated with the collapse of lipid metabolism in favor of
      antimicrobial responses. Our results suggest that white adipose tissue represents
      a memory T cell reservoir that provides potent and rapid effector memory
      responses, positioning this compartment as a potential major contributor to
      immunological memory.

TI  - Ablation of Transcription Factor IRF4 Promotes Transplant Acceptance by Driving
      Allogenic CD4(+) T Cell Dysfunction.

AB  - CD4(+) T cells orchestrate immune responses and destruction of allogeneic organ
      transplants, but how this process is regulated on a transcriptional level remains
      unclear. Here, we demonstrated that interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) was a
      key transcriptional determinant controlling T cell responses during
      transplantation. IRF4 deletion in mice resulted in progressive establishment of
      CD4(+) T cell dysfunction and long-term allograft survival. Mechanistically, IRF4
      repressed PD-1, Helios, and other molecules associated with T cell dysfunction.
      In the absence of IRF4, chromatin accessibility and binding of Helios at PD-1
      cis-regulatory elements were increased, resulting in enhanced PD-1 expression and
      CD4(+) T cell dysfunction. The dysfunctional state of Irf4-deficient T cells was 
      initially reversible by PD-1 ligand blockade, but it progressively developed into
      an irreversible state. Hence, IRF4 controls a core regulatory circuit of CD4(+) T
      cell dysfunction, and targeting IRF4 represents a potential therapeutic strategy 
      for achieving transplant acceptance.

AB  - Given the limited efficacy of clinical approaches that rely on ex vivo generated 
      dendritic cells (DCs), it is imperative to design strategies that harness
      specialized DC subsets in situ. This requires delineating the expression of
      surface markers by DC subsets among individuals and tissues. Here, we performed a
      multiparametric phenotypic characterization and unbiased analysis of human DC
      subsets in blood, tonsil, spleen, and skin. We uncovered previously unreported
      phenotypic heterogeneity of human cDC2s among individuals, including variable
      expression of functional receptors such as CD172a. We found marked differences in
      DC subsets localized in blood and lymphoid tissues versus skin, and a striking
      absence of the newly discovered Axl(+) DCs in the skin. Finally, we evaluated the
      capacity of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to deliver vaccine components to 
      skin DC subsets. These results offer a promising path for developing DC
      subset-specific immunotherapies that cannot be provided by transcriptomic
      analysis alone.

AB  - Antibodies against the NANP repeat of circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major
      surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites, can protect from
      malaria in animal models but protective humoral immunity is difficult to induce
      in humans. Here we cloned and characterized rare affinity-matured human
      NANP-reactive memory B cell antibodies elicited by natural Pf exposure that
      potently inhibited parasite transmission and development in vivo. We unveiled the
      molecular details of antibody binding to two distinct protective epitopes within 
      the NANP repeat. NANP repeat recognition was largely mediated by germline encoded
      and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) 
      residues, whereas affinity maturation contributed predominantly to stabilizing
      the antigen-binding site conformation. Combined, our findings illustrate the
      power of exploring human anti-CSP antibody responses to develop tools for malaria
      control in the mammalian and the mosquito vector and provide a molecular basis
      for the structure-based design of next-generation CSP malaria vaccines.

AB  - Understanding how broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV envelope (Env)
      develop during natural infection can help guide the rational design of an HIV
      vaccine. Here, we described a bnAb lineage targeting the Env V2 apex and the
      Ab-Env co-evolution that led to development of neutralization breadth. The
      lineage Abs bore an anionic heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3
      (CDRH3) of 25 amino acids, among the shortest known for this class of Abs, and
      achieved breadth with only 10% nucleotide somatic hypermutation and no insertions
      or deletions. The data suggested a role for Env glycoform heterogeneity in the
      activation of the lineage germline B cell. Finally, we showed that localized
      diversity at key V2 epitope residues drove bnAb maturation toward breadth,
      mirroring the Env evolution pattern described for another donor who developed
      V2-apex targeting bnAbs. Overall, these findings suggest potential strategies for
      vaccine approaches based on germline-targeting and serial immunogen design.

AB  - Innate and adaptive immune cells modulate heart failure pathogenesis during viral
      myocarditis, yet their identities and functions remain poorly defined. We
      utilized a combination of genetic fate mapping, parabiotic, transcriptional, and 
      functional analyses and demonstrated that the heart contained two major
      conventional dendritic cell (cDC) subsets, CD103(+) and CD11b(+), which
      differentially relied on local proliferation and precursor recruitment to
      maintain their tissue residency. Following viral infection of the myocardium,
      cDCs accumulated in the heart coincident with monocyte infiltration and loss of
      resident reparative embryonic-derived cardiac macrophages. cDC depletion
      abrogated antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferative expansion, transforming
      subclinical cardiac injury to overt heart failure. These effects were mediated by
      CD103(+) cDCs, which are dependent on the transcription factor BATF3 for their
      development. Collectively, our findings identified resident cardiac cDC subsets, 
      defined their origins, and revealed an essential role for CD103(+) cDCs in
      antigen-specific T cell responses during subclinical viral myocarditis.

AB  - Pancreatic-islet inflammation contributes to the failure of beta cell insulin
      secretion during obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the 
      nature and function of resident immune cells in this context or in homeostasis.
      Here we show that interleukin (IL)-33 was produced by islet mesenchymal cells and
      enhanced by a diabetes milieu (glucose, IL-1beta, and palmitate). IL-33 promoted 
      beta cell function through islet-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s)
      that elicited retinoic acid (RA)-producing capacities in macrophages and
      dendritic cells via the secretion of IL-13 and colony-stimulating factor 2. In
      turn, local RA signaled to the beta cells to increase insulin secretion. This
      IL-33-ILC2 axis was activated after acute beta cell stress but was defective
      during chronic obesity. Accordingly, IL-33 injections rescued islet function in
      obese mice. Our findings provide evidence that an immunometabolic crosstalk
      between islet-derived IL-33, ILC2s, and myeloid cells fosters insulin secretion.

AB  - Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and monocyte-dendritic cell progenitors
      (MDPs) produce monocytes during homeostasis and in response to increased demand
      during infection. Both progenitor populations are thought to derive from common
      myeloid progenitors (CMPs), and a hierarchical relationship
      (CMP-GMP-MDP-monocyte) is presumed to underlie monocyte differentiation. Here,
      however, we demonstrate that mouse MDPs arose from CMPs independently of GMPs,
      and that GMPs and MDPs produced monocytes via similar but distinct
      monocyte-committed progenitors. GMPs and MDPs yielded classical (Ly6C(hi))
      monocytes with gene expression signatures that were defined by their origins and 
      impacted their function. GMPs produced a subset of "neutrophil-like" monocytes,
      whereas MDPs gave rise to a subset of monocytes that yielded monocyte-derived
      dendritic cells. GMPs and MDPs were also independently mobilized to produce
      specific combinations of myeloid cell types following the injection of microbial 
      components. Thus, the balance of GMP and MDP differentiation shapes the myeloid
      cell repertoire during homeostasis and following infection.

AB  - Migration of activated regulatory T (Treg) cells to inflamed tissue is crucial
      for their immune-modulatory function. While metabolic reprogramming during Treg
      cell differentiation has been extensively studied, the bioenergetics of Treg cell
      trafficking remains undefined. We have investigated the metabolic demands of
      migrating Treg cells in vitro and in vivo. We show that glycolysis was
      instrumental for their migration and was initiated by pro-migratory stimuli via a
      PI3K-mTORC2-mediated pathway culminating in induction of the enzyme glucokinase
      (GCK). Subsequently, GCK promoted cytoskeletal rearrangements by associating with
      actin. Treg cells lacking this pathway were functionally suppressive but failed
      to migrate to skin allografts and inhibit rejection. Similarly, human carriers of
      a loss-of-function GCK regulatory protein gene-leading to increased GCK
      activity-had reduced numbers of circulating Treg cells. These cells displayed
      enhanced migratory activity but similar suppressive function, while conventional 
      T cells were unaffected. Thus, GCK-dependent glycolysis regulates Treg cell
      migration.

AB  - Chemoattractant-mediated recruitment of hematopoietic cells to sites of pathogen 
      growth or tissue damage is critical to host defense and organ homeostasis.
      Chemotaxis is typically considered to rely on spatial sensing, with cells
      following concentration gradients as long as these are present. Utilizing a
      microfluidic approach, we found that stable gradients of intermediate chemokines 
      (CCL19 and CXCL12) failed to promote persistent directional migration of
      dendritic cells or neutrophils. Instead, rising chemokine concentrations were
      needed, implying that temporal sensing mechanisms controlled prolonged responses 
      to these ligands. This behavior was found to depend on G-coupled receptor
      kinase-mediated negative regulation of receptor signaling and contrasted with
      responses to an end agonist chemoattractant (C5a), for which a stable gradient
      led to persistent migration. These findings identify temporal sensing as a key
      requirement for long-range myeloid cell migration to intermediate chemokines and 
      provide insights into the mechanisms controlling immune cell motility in complex 
      tissue environments.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells provide protection against infectious pathogens and
      cancer. For decades it has been appreciated that two major NK cell subsets
      (CD56(bright) and CD56(dim)) exist in humans and have distinct anatomical
      localization patterns, phenotypes, and functions in immunity. In light of this
      traditional NK cell dichotomy, it is now clear that the spectrum of human NK cell
      diversity is much broader than originally appreciated as a result of variegated
      surface receptor, intracellular signaling molecule, and transcription factor
      expression; tissue-specific imprinting; and foreign antigen exposure. The recent 
      discoveries of tissue-resident NK cell developmental intermediates, non-NK innate
      lymphoid cells, and the capacity for NK cells to adapt and differentiate into
      long-lived memory cells has added further complexity to this field. Here we
      review our current understanding of the breadth and generation of human NK cell
      diversity.

      tissue-resident macrophages. Baratin et al. (2017) identify a resident macrophage
      population in the T cell zone of lymph nodes responsible for the silent uptake of
      vast numbers of apoptotic cells. Roberts et al. (2017) find that resident
      macrophages can be programmed by local tissue signals not to respond to the
      nucleic acid of apoptotic cells.

AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages shape the development and homeostasis of the organs
      that they colonize. Yu et al. (2017) demonstrate that, unique to the lung, the
      instructive cytokine TGF-beta collaborates with GM-CSF to induce the master
      transcription factor PPARgamma to drive alveolar macrophage differentiation and
      maintenance early in life.

TI  - Targeting Interleukin-1beta Protects from Aortic Aneurysms Induced by Disrupted

AB  - Aortic aneurysms are life-threatening conditions with effective treatments mainly
      limited to emergency surgery or trans-arterial endovascular stent grafts, thus
      calling for the identification of specific molecular targets. Genetic studies
      have highlighted controversial roles of transforming growth factor beta
      (TGF-beta) signaling in aneurysm development. Here, we report on aneurysms
      developing in adult mice after smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific inactivation of 
      Smad4, an intracellular transducer of TGF-beta. The results revealed that Smad4
      inhibition activated interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in SMCs. This danger signal
      later recruited innate immunity in the adventitia through chemokine (C-C motif)
      ligand 2 (CCL2) and modified the mechanical properties of the aortic wall, thus
      favoring vessel dilation. SMC-specific Smad4 deletion in Il1r1- or Ccr2-null mice
      resulted in milder aortic pathology. A chronic treatment with anti-IL-1beta
      antibody effectively hampered aneurysm development. These findings identify a
      mechanistic target for controlling the progression of aneurysms with compromised 
      TGF-beta signaling, such as those driven by SMAD4 mutations.

AB  - T cell antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions early during chronic viral
      infection are crucial for determining viral set point and disease outcome, but
      how and when different APC subtypes contribute to these outcomes is unclear. The 
      TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) member GITR is important for CD4(+) T cell
      accumulation and control of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We
      found that type I interferon (IFN-I) induced TNFSF ligands GITRL, 4-1BBL, OX40L, 
      and CD70 predominantly on monocyte-derived APCs and CD80 and CD86 predominantly
      on classical dendritic cells (cDCs). Mice with hypofunctional GITRL in Lyz2(+)
      cells had decreased LCMV-specific CD4(+) T cell accumulation and increased viral 
      load. GITR signals in CD4(+) T cells occurred after priming to upregulate OX40,
      CD25, and chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Thus IFN-I (signal 3) induced a post-priming
      checkpoint (signal 4) for CD4(+) T cell accumulation, revealing a division of
      labor between cDCs and monocyte-derived APCs in regulating T cell expansion.

AB  - Although apoptotic cells (ACs) contain nucleic acids that can be recognized by
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs), engulfment of ACs does not initiate inflammation in
      healthy organisms. Here we identified macrophage populations that continually
      engulf ACs in distinct tissues and found that these macrophages share
      characteristics compatible with immunologically silent clearance of ACs; such
      characteristics include high expression of AC recognition receptors, low
      expression of TLR9, and reduced TLR responsiveness to nucleic acids. Removal of
      the macrophages from tissues resulted in loss of many of these characteristics
      and the ability to generate inflammatory responses to AC-derived nucleic acids,
      suggesting that cues from the tissue microenvironment program macrophages for
      silent AC clearance. The transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4 control the
      expression of many genes within this AC clearance program. The coordinated
      expression of AC receptors with genes that limit responses to nucleic acids might
      ensure maintenance of homeostasis and thus represent a central feature of tissue 
      macrophages.

AB  - Immune response (Ir) genes, originally proposed by Baruj Benacerraf to explain
      differential antigen-specific responses in animal models, have become synonymous 
      with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We discovered a non-MHC-linked
      Ir gene in a T cell receptor (TCR) locus that was required for CD8(+) T cell
      responses to the Plasmodium berghei GAP5040-48 epitope in mice expressing the MHC
      class I allele H-2D(b). GAP5040-48-specific CD8(+) T cell responses emerged from 
      a very large pool of naive Vbeta8.1(+) precursors, which dictated susceptibility 
      to cerebral malaria and conferred protection against recombinant Listeria
      monocytogenes infection. Structural analysis of a prototypical Vbeta8.1(+)
      TCR-H-2D(b)-GAP5040-48 ternary complex revealed that germline-encoded
      complementarity-determining region 1beta residues present exclusively in the
      Vbeta8.1 segment mediated essential interactions with the GAP5040-48 peptide.
      Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Vbeta8.1 functioned as an Ir gene 
      that was indispensable for immune reactivity against the malaria GAP5040-48
      epitope.

AB  - CD4(+) T cells optimize the cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response in magnitude and
      quality, by unknown molecular mechanisms. We here present the transcriptomic
      changes in CTLs resulting from CD4(+) T cell help after anti-cancer vaccination
      or virus infection. The gene expression signatures revealed that CD4(+) T cell
      help during priming optimized CTLs in expression of cytotoxic effector molecules 
      and many other functions that ensured efficacy of CTLs throughout their life
      cycle. Key features included downregulation of PD-1 and other coinhibitory
      receptors that impede CTL activity, and increased motility and migration
      capacities. "Helped" CTLs acquired chemokine receptors that helped them reach
      their tumor target tissue and metalloprotease activity that enabled them to
      invade into tumor tissue. A very large part of the "help" program was instilled
      in CD8(+) T cells via CD27 costimulation. The help program thus enhances specific
      CTL effector functions in response to vaccination or a virus infection.

AB  - Alveolar macrophages (AMs) derive from fetal liver monocytes, which colonize the 
      lung during embryonic development and give rise to fully mature AMs perinatally. 
      AM differentiation requires granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF), but whether additional factors are involved in AM regulation is not
      known. Here we report that AMs, in contrast to most other tissue macrophages,
      were also dependent on transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGF-betaR)
      signaling. Conditional deletion of TGF-betaR in mice at different time points
      halted the development and differentiation of AMs. In adult mice, TGF-beta was
      also critical for AM homeostasis. The source of TGF-beta was AMs themselves,
      indicative of an autocrine loop that promotes AM self-maintenance.
      Mechanistically, TGF-betaR signaling resulted in upregulation of PPAR-gamma, a
      signature transcription factor essential for the development of AMs. These
      findings reveal an additional layer of complexity regarding the guidance cues,
      which govern the genesis, maturation, and survival of AMs.

AB  - Inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET are currently used in the clinic
      to target oncogenic signaling in tumor cells. We found that concomitant c-MET
      inhibition promoted adoptive T cell transfer and checkpoint immunotherapies in
      murine cancer models by increasing effector T cell infiltration in tumors. This
      therapeutic effect was independent of tumor cell-intrinsic c-MET dependence.
      Mechanistically, c-MET inhibition impaired the reactive mobilization and
      recruitment of neutrophils into tumors and draining lymph nodes in response to
      cytotoxic immunotherapies. In the absence of c-MET inhibition, neutrophils
      recruited to T cell-inflamed microenvironments rapidly acquired immunosuppressive
      properties, restraining T cell expansion and effector functions. In cancer
      patients, high serum levels of the c-MET ligand HGF correlated with increasing
      neutrophil counts and poor responses to checkpoint blockade therapies. Our
      findings reveal a role for the HGF/c-MET pathway in neutrophil recruitment and
      function and suggest that c-MET inhibitor co-treatment may improve responses to
      cancer immunotherapy in settings beyond c-MET-dependent tumors.

AB  - Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication in HIV-infected
      individuals but does not eliminate the reservoir of latently infected cells.
      Recent work identified PD-1(+) follicular helper T (Tfh) cells as an important
      cellular compartment for viral persistence. Here, using ART-treated, SIV-infected
      rhesus macaques, we show that CTLA-4(+)PD-1(-) memory CD4(+) T cells, which share
      phenotypic markers with regulatory T cells, were enriched in SIV DNA in blood,
      lymph nodes (LN), spleen, and gut, and contained replication-competent and
      infectious virus. In contrast to PD-1(+) Tfh cells, SIV-enriched CTLA-4(+)PD-1(-)
      CD4(+) T cells were found outside the B cell follicle of the LN, predicted the
      size of the persistent viral reservoir during ART, and significantly increased
      their contribution to the SIV reservoir with prolonged ART-mediated viral
      suppression. We have shown that CTLA-4(+)PD-1(-) memory CD4(+) T cells are a
      previously unrecognized component of the SIV and HIV reservoir that should be
      therapeutically targeted for a functional HIV-1 cure.

AB  - The latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells is the major
      barrier to curing HIV-1 infection. Studies of HIV-1 latency have focused on
      regulation of viral gene expression in cells in which latent infection is
      established. However, it remains unclear how infection initially becomes latent. 
      Here we described a unique set of properties of CD4(+) T cells undergoing
      effector-to-memory transition including temporary upregulation of CCR5 expression
      and rapid downregulation of cellular gene transcription. These cells allowed
      completion of steps in the HIV-1 life cycle through integration but suppressed
      HIV-1 gene transcription, thus allowing the establishment of latency. CD4(+) T
      cells in this stage were substantially more permissive for HIV-1 latent infection
      than other CD4(+) T cells. Establishment of latent HIV-1 infection in CD4(+) T
      could be inhibited by viral-specific CD8(+) T cells, a result with implications
      for elimination of latent HIV-1 infection by T cell-based vaccines.

AB  - After traumatic injury, some cells function as detectors to sense injury and to
      modulate the local immune response toward a restitution phase by affecting the
      local cytokine milieu. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that patrolling
      invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells were initially excluded from a site of
      hepatic injury but subsequently were strategically arrested first via
      self-antigens and then by cytokines, circumscribing the injured site at exactly
      the location where monocytes co-localized and hepatocytes proliferated.
      Activation of iNKT cells by self-antigens resulted in the production of
      interleukin-4 (IL-4) but not interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). This promoted
      increased hepatocyte proliferation, monocyte transition (from Ly6C(hi) to
      Ly6C(lo)), and improved healing where IL-4 from iNKT cells was critical for these
      processes. Disruption of any of these mechanisms led to delayed wound healing. We
      have shown that self-antigen-driven iNKT cells function as sensors and
      orchestrators of the transformation from inflammation to tissue restitution for

AB  - Infection by helminth parasites is associated with amelioration of allergic
      reactivity, but mechanistic insights into this association are lacking. Products 
      secreted by the mouse parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus suppress type 2
      (allergic) immune responses through interference in the interleukin-33 (IL-33)
      pathway. Here, we identified H. polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI), an
      IL-33-suppressive 26-kDa protein, containing three predicted complement control
      protein (CCP) modules. In vivo, recombinant HpARI abrogated IL-33, group 2 innate
      lymphoid cell (ILC2) and eosinophilic responses to Alternaria allergen
      administration, and diminished eosinophilic responses to Nippostrongylus
      brasiliensis, increasing parasite burden. HpARI bound directly to both mouse and 
      human IL-33 (in the cytokine's activated state) and also to nuclear DNA via its
      N-terminal CCP module pair (CCP1/2), tethering active IL-33 within necrotic
      cells, preventing its release, and forestalling initiation of type 2 allergic
      responses. Thus, HpARI employs a novel molecular strategy to suppress type 2
      immunity in both infection and allergy.

AB  - Gastro-intestinal helminth infections trigger the release of interleukin-33
      (IL-33), which induces type-2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) at the site of infection
      to produce IL-13, thereby contributing to host resistance in a T cell receptor
      (TCR)-independent manner. Here, we show that, as a prerequisite for IL-33-induced
      IL-13 secretion, Th2 cells required the expression of the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and of its ligand, amphiregulin, for the formation of a signaling
      complex between T1/ST2 (the IL-33R) and EGFR. This shared signaling complex
      allowed IL-33 to induce the EGFR-mediated activation of the MAP-kinase signaling 
      pathway and consequently the expression of IL-13. Lack of EGFR expression on T
      cells abrogated IL-13 expression in infected tissues and impaired host
      resistance. EGFR expression on Th2 cells was TCR-signaling dependent, and
      therefore, our data reveal a mechanism by which antigen presentation controls the
      innate effector function of Th2 cells at the site of inflammation.

      Induces Inflammasome-Dependent Phagocyte Hyperactivation.

AB  - A heterogeneous mixture of lipids called oxPAPC, derived from dying cells, can
      hyperactivate dendritic cells (DCs) but not macrophages. Hyperactive DCs are
      defined by their ability to release interleukin-1 (IL-1) while maintaining cell
      viability, endowing these cells with potent aptitude to stimulate adaptive
      immunity. Herein, we found that the bacterial lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14
      captured extracellular oxPAPC and delivered these lipids into the cell to promote
      inflammasome-dependent DC hyperactivation. Notably, we identified two specific
      components within the oxPAPC mixture that hyperactivated macrophages, allowing
      these cells to release IL-1 for several days, by a CD14-dependent process. In
      murine models of sepsis, conditions that promoted cell hyperactivation resulted
      in inflammation but not lethality. Thus, multiple phagocytes are capable of
      hyperactivation in response to oxPAPC, with CD14 acting as the earliest regulator
      in this process, serving to capture and transport these lipids to promote
      inflammatory cell fate decisions.

AB  - The classical model of hematopoiesis established in the mouse postulates that
      lymphoid cells originate from a founder population of common lymphoid
      progenitors. Here, using a modeling approach in humanized mice, we showed that
      human lymphoid development stemmed from distinct populations of CD127(-) and
      CD127(+) early lymphoid progenitors (ELPs). Combining molecular analyses with in 
      vitro and in vivo functional assays, we demonstrated that CD127(-) and CD127(+)
      ELPs emerged independently from lympho-mono-dendritic progenitors, responded
      differently to Notch1 signals, underwent divergent modes of lineage restriction, 
      and displayed both common and specific differentiation potentials. Whereas
      CD127(-) ELPs comprised precursors of T cells, marginal zone B cells, and natural
      killer (NK) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), CD127(+) ELPs supported production 
      of all NK cell, ILC, and B cell populations but lacked T potential. On the basis 
      of these results, we propose a "two-family" model of human lymphoid development
      that differs from the prevailing model of hematopoiesis.

AB  - Distinct molecular pathways govern the differentiation of CD8(+) effector T cells
      into memory or exhausted T cells during acute and chronic viral infection, but
      these are not well studied in humans. Here, we employed an integrative systems
      immunology approach to identify transcriptional commonalities and differences
      between virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from patients with persistent and
      spontaneously resolving hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection during the acute phase.
      We observed dysregulation of metabolic processes during early persistent
      infection that was linked to changes in expression of genes related to
      nucleosomal regulation of transcription, T cell differentiation, and the
      inflammatory response and correlated with subject age, sex, and the presence of
      HCV-specific CD4(+) T cell populations. These early changes in HCV-specific
      CD8(+) T cell transcription preceded the overt establishment of T cell
      exhaustion, making this signature a prime target in the search for the regulatory
      origins of T cell dysfunction in chronic viral infection.

AB  - In the Drosophila immune response, bacterial derived diaminopimelic acid-type
      peptidoglycan binds the receptors PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, which through interaction 
      with the adaptor protein Imd leads to activation of the NF-kappaB homolog Relish 
      and robust antimicrobial peptide gene expression. PGRP-LC, PGRP-LE, and Imd each 
      contain a motif with some resemblance to the RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif
      (RHIM), a domain found in mammalian RIPK proteins forming functional amyloids
      during necroptosis. Here we found that despite sequence divergence, these
      Drosophila cryptic RHIMs formed amyloid fibrils in vitro and in cells. Amyloid
      formation was required for signaling downstream of Imd, and in contrast to the
      mammalian RHIMs, was not associated with cell death. Furthermore, amyloid
      formation constituted a regulatable step and could be inhibited by Pirk, an
      endogenous feedback regulator of this pathway. Thus, diverse sequence motifs are 
      capable of forming amyloidal signaling platforms, and the formation of these
      platforms may present a regulatory point in multiple biological processes.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is an arterial disease process characterized by the focal
      subendothelial accumulation of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins, immune
      and vascular wall cells, and extracellular matrix. The lipoproteins acquire
      features of damage-associated molecular patterns and trigger first an innate
      immune response, dominated by monocyte-macrophages, and then an adaptive immune
      response. These inflammatory responses often become chronic and non-resolving and
      can lead to arterial damage and thrombosis-induced organ infarction. The innate
      immune response is regulated at various stages, from hematopoiesis to monocyte
      changes and macrophage activation. The adaptive immune response is regulated
      primarily by mechanisms that affect the balance between regulatory and effector T
      cells. Mechanisms related to cellular cholesterol, phenotypic plasticity,
      metabolism, and aging play key roles in affecting these responses. Herein, we
      review select topics that shed light on these processes and suggest new treatment
      strategies.

AB  - Noroviruses can establish chronic infections with active viral shedding in
      healthy humans but whether persistence is associated with adaptive immune
      dysfunction is unknown. We used genetically engineered strains of mouse norovirus
      (MNV) to investigate CD8(+) T cell differentiation during chronic infection. We
      found that chronic infection drove MNV-specific tissue-resident memory (Trm)
      CD8(+) T cells to a differentiation state resembling inflationary effector
      responses against latent cytomegalovirus with only limited evidence of
      exhaustion. These MNV-specific Trm cells remained highly functional yet appeared 
      ignorant of ongoing viral replication. Pre-existing MNV-specific Trm cells
      provided partial protection against chronic infection but largely ceased to
      detect virus within 72 hours of challenge, demonstrating rapid sequestration of
      viral replication away from T cells. Our studies revealed a strategy of immune
      evasion by MNV via the induction of a CD8(+) T cell program normally reserved for
      latent pathogens and persistence in an immune-privileged enteric niche.

AB  - Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is the main Ca(2+) influx pathway in
      lymphocytes and is essential for T cell function and adaptive immunity. SOCE is
      mediated by Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels that are activated by
      stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 and STIM2. SOCE regulates many
      Ca(2+)-dependent signaling molecules, including calcineurin, and inhibition of
      SOCE or calcineurin impairs antigen-dependent T cell proliferation. We here
      report that SOCE and calcineurin regulate cell cycle entry of quiescent T cells
      by controlling glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. SOCE directs the
      metabolic reprogramming of naive T cells by regulating the expression of glucose 
      transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and metabolic regulators through the activation
      of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and the PI3K-AKT kinase-mTOR
      nutrient-sensing pathway. We propose that SOCE controls a critical "metabolic
      checkpoint" at which T cells assess adequate nutrient supply to support clonal
      expansion and adaptive immune responses.

TI  - Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Controls Monocyte Differentiation into Dendritic Cells 
      versus Macrophages.

AB  - After entering tissues, monocytes differentiate into cells that share functional 
      features with either macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs). How monocyte fate is
      directed toward monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-Macs) or monocyte-derived DCs
      (mo-DCs) and which transcription factors control these differentiation pathways
      remains unknown. Using an in vitro culture model yielding human mo-DCs and
      mo-Macs closely resembling those found in vivo in ascites, we show that IRF4 and 
      MAFB were critical regulators of monocyte differentiation into mo-DCs and
      mo-Macs, respectively. Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) promoted
      mo-DC differentiation through the induction of BLIMP-1, while impairing
      differentiation into mo-Macs. AhR deficiency also impaired the in vivo
      differentiation of mouse mo-DCs. Finally, AHR activation correlated with mo-DC
      infiltration in leprosy lesions. These results establish that mo-DCs and mo-Macs 
      are controlled by distinct transcription factors and show that AHR acts as a
      molecular switch for monocyte fate specification in response to
      micro-environmental factors.

TI  - The TREM2-APOE Pathway Drives the Transcriptional Phenotype of Dysfunctional
      Microglia in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

AB  - Microglia play a pivotal role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis but lose
      homeostatic function during neurodegenerative disorders. We identified a specific
      apolipoprotein E (APOE)-dependent molecular signature in microglia from models of
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) and in microglia surrounding neuritic beta-amyloid (Abeta)-plaques
      in the brains of people with AD. The APOE pathway mediated a switch from a
      homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglia phenotype after phagocytosis of
      apoptotic neurons. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2)
      induced APOE signaling, and targeting the TREM2-APOE pathway restored the
      homeostatic signature of microglia in ALS and AD mouse models and prevented
      neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. APOE-mediated
      neurodegenerative microglia had lost their tolerogenic function. Our work
      identifies the TREM2-APOE pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional
      phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target that could
      aid in the restoration of homeostatic microglia.

AB  - Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells differentiate from conventional regulatory T 
      (Treg) cells and suppress excessive germinal center (GC) responses by acting on
      both GC B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Here, we examined the impact
      of mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase that senses and integrates diverse
      environmental cues, on the differentiation and functional competency of Tfr cells
      in response to protein immunization or viral infection. By genetically deleting
      Rptor or Rictor, essential components for mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR
      complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively, we found that mTORC1 but not mTORC2 is
      essential for Tfr differentiation. Mechanistically, mTORC1-mediated
      phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 induced the expression of the
      transcription factor TCF-1 by promoting STAT3 binding to the Tcf7 5'-regulatory
      region. Subsequently, TCF-1 bound to the Bcl6 promoter to induce Bcl6 expression,
      which launched the Tfr cell differentiation program. Thus, mTORC1 initiates Tfr
      cell differentiation by activating the TCF-1-Bcl-6 axis during immunization or
      infection.

TI  - IL-1 Family Cytokines Use Distinct Molecular Mechanisms to Signal through Their
      Shared Co-receptor.

AB  - Within the interleukin 1 (IL-1) cytokine family, IL-1 receptor accessory protein 
      (IL-1RAcP) is the co-receptor for eight receptor-cytokine pairs, including those 
      involving cytokines IL-1beta and IL-33. Unlike IL-1beta, IL-33 does not have a
      signaling complex that includes both its cognate receptor, ST2, and the shared
      co-receptor IL-1RAcP, which we now present here. Although the IL-1beta and IL-33 
      complexes shared structural features and engaged identical molecular surfaces of 
      IL-1RAcP, these cytokines had starkly different strategies for co-receptor
      engagement and signal activation. Our data suggest that IL-1beta binds to IL-1RI 
      to properly present the cytokine to IL-1RAcP, whereas IL-33 binds to ST2 in order
      to conformationally constrain the cognate receptor in an IL-1RAcP-receptive
      state. These findings indicate that members of the IL-1 family of cytokines use
      distinct molecular mechanisms to signal through their shared co-receptor, and
      they provide the foundation from which to design new therapies to target IL-33
      signaling.

TI  - The IRF4 Gene Regulatory Module Functions as a Read-Write Integrator to
      Dynamically Coordinate T Helper Cell Fate.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation during CD4(+) T cell fate decisions enables their
      differentiation into distinct states, guiding immune responses toward antibody
      production via Tfh cells or inflammation by Teff cells. Tfh-Teff cell fate
      commitment is regulated by mutual antagonism between the transcription factors
      Bcl6 and Blimp-1. Here we examined how T cell receptor (TCR) signals establish
      and arbitrate Bcl6-Blimp-1 counter-antagonism. We found that the
      TCR-signal-induced transcription factor Irf4 is essential for the differentiation
      of Bcl6-expressing Tfh and Blimp-1-expressing Teff cells. Increased TCR signaling
      raised Irf4 amounts and promoted Teff cell fates at the expense of Tfh ones.
      Importantly, orthogonal induction of Irf4 expression redirected Tfh cell fate
      trajectories toward those of Teff. Mechanistically, we linked greater Irf4
      abundance with its recruitment toward low-affinity binding sites within Teff cell
      cis-regulatory elements, including those of Prdm1. We propose that the Irf4 locus
      functions as the "reader" of TCR signal strength, and in turn,
      concentration-dependent activity of Irf4 "writes" T helper fate choice.

AB  - Commitment to the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) lineage is determined by Id2, a
      transcriptional regulator that antagonizes T and B cell-specific gene expression 
      programs. Yet how Id2 expression is regulated in each ILC subset remains poorly
      understood. We identified a cis-regulatory element demarcated by a long
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that controls the function and lineage identity of group 
      1 ILCs, while being dispensable for early ILC development and homeostasis of
      ILC2s and ILC3s. The locus encoding this lncRNA, which we termed Rroid, directly 
      interacted with the promoter of its neighboring gene, Id2, in group 1 ILCs.
      Moreover, the Rroid locus, but not the lncRNA itself, controlled the identity and
      function of ILC1s by promoting chromatin accessibility and deposition of STAT5 at
      the promoter of Id2 in response to interleukin (IL)-15. Thus, non-coding elements
      responsive to extracellular cues unique to each ILC subset represent a key
      regulatory layer for controlling the identity and function of ILCs.

AB  - Environmental insults are often detected by multiple sensors that activate
      diverse signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators, leading to a tailored 
      transcriptional output. To understand how a tailored response is coordinated, we 
      examined the inflammatory response elicited in mouse macrophages by ionizing
      radiation (IR). RNA-sequencing studies revealed that most radiation-induced genes
      were strongly dependent on only one of a small number of sensors and signaling
      pathways, notably the DNA damage-induced kinase ATM, which regulated many
      IR-response genes, including interferon response genes, via an atypical
      IRF1-dependent, STING-independent mechanism. Moreover, small, defined sets of
      genes activated by p53 and NRF2 accounted for the selective response to radiation
      in comparison to a microbial inducer of inflammation. Our findings reveal that
      genes comprising an environmental response are activated by defined sensing
      mechanisms with a high degree of selectivity, and they identify distinct
      components of the radiation response that might be susceptible to therapeutic
      perturbation.

AB  - Highly ordered interactions between immune and metabolic responses are
      evolutionarily conserved and paramount for tissue and organismal health.
      Disruption of these interactions underlies the emergence of many pathologies,
      particularly chronic non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes.
      Here, we examine decades of research identifying the complex immunometabolic
      signaling networks and the cellular and molecular events that occur in the
      setting of altered nutrient and energy exposures and offer a historical
      perspective. Furthermore, we describe recent advances such as the discovery that 
      a broad complement of immune cells play a role in immunometabolism and the
      emerging evidence that nutrients and metabolites modulate inflammatory pathways. 
      Lastly, we discuss how this work may eventually lead to tangible therapeutic
      advancements to promote health.

AB  - Some microbial metabolites can be immunomodulatory, but there is limited
      understanding of how these contribute to inter-individual variation in response
      to infection. In a recent study in Science, Steed et al. (2017) show that the
      bacterial metabolite desaminotyrosine (DAT) increases type I interferon
      expression, resulting in an improved immune response to influenza infection.

AB  - Microglial cell function is implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease by 
      human genetics. In this issue of Immunity, Krasemann et al. (2017) describe a
      gene expression signature associated with an APOE- and TREM2-dependent response
      of microglia to brain tissue damage that accumulates in aging and disease,
      defining an axis that might be amenable to therapeutic targeting.

AB  - Inhibiting Treg cell function in tumors is an attractive strategy to improve
      anti-cancer immunity. In a pair of papers in Immunity and Cell, Ghosh and
      colleagues show that the canonical NF-kappaB subunits p65 and c-Rel have
      non-redundant, critical roles in promoting Treg cell development and function (Oh
      et al., 2017). Targeting c-Rel blunts Treg cell immunosuppressive activity in the
      tumor microenvironment and enhances anti-tumor T cell responses (Grinberg-Bleyer 
      et al., 2017).

AB  - The transcriptional repressor Id2 is constitutively expressed in all innate
      lymphoid cells (ILCs) and is required for their development. In this issue of
      Immunity, Mowel et al. (2017) demonstrate that Id2 expression is regulated by a
      cell type-specific cis-regulatory element in group 1 ILCs that is demarcated by a
      long non-coding RNA.

AB  - Apex broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies (bnAbs) recognize glycans and protein
      surface close to the 3-fold axis of the envelope (Env) trimer and are among the
      most potent and broad Abs described. The evolution of apex bnAbs from one donor
      (CAP256) has been studied in detail and many Abs at different stages of
      maturation have been described. Using diverse engineering tools, we investigated 
      the involvement of glycan recognition in the development of the CAP256.VRC26 Ab
      lineage. We found that sialic acid-bearing glycans were recognized by
      germline-encoded and somatically mutated residues on the Ab heavy chain. This
      recognition provided an "anchor" for the Abs as the core protein epitope varies, 
      prevented complete neutralization escape, and eventually led to broadening of the
      response. These findings illustrate how glycan-specific maturation enables a
      human Ab to cope with pathogen escape mechanisms and will aid in optimization of 
      immunization strategies to induce V2 apex bnAb responses.

      Recognition.

AB  - Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a common by-product of viral infections and acts
      as a potent trigger of antiviral immunity. In the nematode C. elegans, sid-1
      encodes a dsRNA transporter that is highly conserved throughout animal evolution,
      but the physiological role of SID-1 and its orthologs remains unclear. Here, we
      show that the mammalian SID-1 ortholog, SIDT2, is required to transport
      internalized extracellular dsRNA from endocytic compartments into the cytoplasm
      for immune activation. Sidt2-deficient mice exposed to extracellular dsRNA,
      encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) show
      impaired production of antiviral cytokines and-in the case of EMCV and
      HSV-1-reduced survival. Thus, SIDT2 has retained the dsRNA transport activity of 
      its C. elegans ortholog, and this transport is important for antiviral immunity.

AB  - Neutrophils are critical and short-lived mediators of innate immunity that
      require constant replenishment. Their differentiation in the bone marrow requires
      extensive cytoplasmic and nuclear remodeling, but the processes governing these
      energy-consuming changes are unknown. While previous studies show that autophagy 
      is required for differentiation of other blood cell lineages, its function during
      granulopoiesis has remained elusive. Here, we have shown that metabolism and
      autophagy are developmentally programmed and essential for neutrophil
      differentiation in vivo. Atg7-deficient neutrophil precursors had increased
      glycolytic activity but impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased ATP
      production, and accumulated lipid droplets. Inhibiting autophagy-mediated lipid
      degradation or fatty acid oxidation alone was sufficient to cause defective
      differentiation, while administration of fatty acids or pyruvate for
      mitochondrial respiration rescued differentiation in autophagy-deficient
      neutrophil precursors. Together, we show that autophagy-mediated lipolysis
      provides free fatty acids to support a mitochondrial respiration pathway
      essential to neutrophil differentiation.

AB  - Both conventional T (Tconv) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells are activated
      through ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex, leading to the induction
      of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. In Tconv cells, NF-kappaB regulates
      expression of genes essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and function.
      However the role of NF-kappaB in Treg function remains unclear. We conditionally 
      deleted canonical NF-kappaB members p65 and c-Rel in developing and mature Treg
      cells and found they have unique but partially redundant roles. c-Rel was
      critical for thymic Treg development while p65 was essential for mature Treg
      identity and maintenance of immune tolerance. Transcriptome and NF-kappaB p65
      binding analyses demonstrated a lineage specific, NF-kappaB-dependent
      transcriptional program, enabled by enhanced chromatin accessibility. These dual 
      roles of canonical NF-kappaB in Tconv and Treg cells highlight the functional
      plasticity of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and underscores the need for more
      selective strategies to therapeutically target NF-kappaB.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) enters the host in aerosol droplets deposited in
      lung alveoli, where the bacteria first encounter lung-resident alveolar
      macrophages. We studied the earliest mycobacterium-macrophage interactions in the
      optically transparent zebrafish. First-responding resident macrophages
      phagocytosed and eradicated infecting mycobacteria, suggesting that to establish 
      a successful infection, mycobacteria must escape out of the initially infected
      resident macrophage into growth-permissive monocytes. We defined a critical role 
      for mycobacterial membrane phenolic glycolipid (PGL) in engineering this
      transition. PGL activated the STING cytosolic sensing pathway in resident
      macrophages, inducing the production of the chemokine CCL2, which in turn
      recruited circulating CCR2(+) monocytes toward infection. Transient fusion of
      infected macrophages with CCR2(+) monocytes enabled bacterial transfer and
      subsequent dissemination, and interrupting this transfer so as to prolong
      mycobacterial sojourn in resident macrophages promoted clearing of infection.
      Human alveolar macrophages produced CCL2 in a PGL-dependent fashion following
      infection, arguing for the potential of PGL-blocking interventions or
      PGL-targeting vaccine strategies in the prevention of tuberculosis. VIDEO

TI  - A Liver Capsular Network of Monocyte-Derived Macrophages Restricts Hepatic
      Dissemination of Intraperitoneal Bacteria by Neutrophil Recruitment.

AB  - The liver is positioned at the interface between two routes traversed by
      pathogens in disseminating infection. Whereas blood-borne pathogens are
      efficiently cleared in hepatic sinusoids by Kupffer cells (KCs), it is unknown
      how the liver prevents dissemination of peritoneal pathogens accessing its outer 
      membrane. We report here that the hepatic capsule harbors a contiguous cellular
      network of liver-resident macrophages phenotypically distinct from KCs. These
      liver capsular macrophages (LCMs) were replenished in the steady state from blood
      monocytes, unlike KCs that are embryonically derived and self-renewing. LCM
      numbers increased after weaning in a microbiota-dependent process. LCMs sensed
      peritoneal bacteria and promoted neutrophil recruitment to the capsule, and their
      specific ablation resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment and increased
      intrahepatic bacterial burden. Thus, the liver contains two separate and
      non-overlapping niches occupied by distinct resident macrophage populations
      mediating immunosurveillance at these two pathogen entry points to the liver.

AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are essential components of the cancer
      microenvironment and play critical roles in the regulation of tumor progression. 
      Optimal therapeutic intervention requires in-depth understanding of the sources
      that sustain macrophages in malignant tissues. In this study, we investigated the
      ontogeny of TAMs in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. We
      identified both inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages as sources
      of TAMs. Unexpectedly, significant portions of pancreas-resident macrophages
      originated from embryonic development and expanded through in situ proliferation 
      during tumor progression. Whereas monocyte-derived TAMs played more potent roles 
      in antigen presentation, embryonically derived TAMs exhibited a pro-fibrotic
      transcriptional profile, indicative of their role in producing and remodeling
      molecules in the extracellular matrix. Collectively, these findings uncover the
      heterogeneity of TAM origin and functions and could provide therapeutic insight
      for PDAC treatment.

AB  - Select humans and animals control persistent viral infections via adaptive immune
      responses that include production of neutralizing antibodies. The precise genetic
      basis for the control remains enigmatic. Here, we report positional cloning of
      the gene responsible for production of retrovirus-neutralizing antibodies in mice
      of the I/LnJ strain. It encodes the beta subunit of the non-classical major
      histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-like molecule H2-O, a negative
      regulator of antigen presentation. The recessive and functionally null I/LnJ
      H2-Ob allele supported the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies
      independently of the classical MHC haplotype. Subsequent bioinformatics and
      functional analyses of the human H2-Ob homolog, HLA-DOB, revealed both loss- and 
      gain-of-function alleles, which could affect the ability of their carriers to
      control infections with human hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses. Thus,
      understanding of the previously unappreciated role of H2-O (HLA-DO) in immunity
      to infections may suggest new approaches in achieving neutralizing immunity to
      viruses.

TI  - The DNA Methylcytosine Dioxygenase Tet2 Sustains Immunosuppressive Function of
      Tumor-Infiltrating Myeloid Cells to Promote Melanoma Progression.

AB  - Ten-Eleven-Translocation-2 (Tet2) is a DNA methylcytosine dioxygenase that
      functions as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic malignancies. We examined the
      role of Tet2 in tumor-tissue myeloid cells and found that Tet2 sustains the
      immunosuppressive function of these cells. We found that Tet2 expression is
      increased in intratumoral myeloid cells both in mouse models of melanoma and in
      melanoma patients and that this increased expression is dependent on an
      IL-1R-MyD88 pathway. Ablation of Tet2 in myeloid cells suppressed melanoma growth
      in vivo and shifted the immunosuppressive gene expression program in
      tumor-associated macrophages to a proinflammatory one, with a concomitant
      reduction of the immunosuppressive function. This resulted in increased numbers
      of effector T cells in the tumor, and T cell depletion abolished the reduced
      tumor growth observed upon myeloid-specific deletion of Tet2. Our findings reveal
      a non-cell-intrinsic, tumor-promoting function for Tet2 and suggest that Tet2 may
      present a therapeutic target for the treatment of non-hematologic malignancies.

      Metabolic Changes in T Cells into Context-Dependent Gene Programs.

AB  - Despite considerable research connecting cellular metabolism with differentiation
      decisions, the underlying mechanisms that translate metabolite-sensitive
      activities into unique gene programs are still unclear. We found that aspects of 
      the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-sensitive effector gene program in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T
      cells in type 1 conditions (Th1) were regulated by glutamine and
      alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG)-induced events, in part through changes in DNA and 
      histone methylation states. We further identified a mechanism by which IL-2- and 
      alphaKG-sensitive metabolic changes regulated the association of CCCTC-binding
      factor (CTCF) with select genomic sites. alphaKG-sensitive CTCF sites were often 
      associated with loci containing IL-2- and alphaKG-sensitive genome organization
      patterns and gene expression in T cells. IL-2- and alphaKG-sensitive CTCF sites
      in T cells were also associated with genes from developmental pathways that had
      alphaKG-sensitive expression in embryonic stem cells. The data collectively
      support a mechanism wherein CTCF serves to translate alphaKG-sensitive metabolic 
      changes into context-dependent differentiation gene programs.

AB  - Mechanisms by which interferon (IFN)-gamma activates genes to promote macrophage 
      activation are well studied, but little is known about mechanisms and functions
      of IFN-gamma-mediated gene repression. We used an integrated transcriptomic and
      epigenomic approach to analyze chromatin accessibility, histone modifications,
      transcription-factor binding, and gene expression in IFN-gamma-primed human
      macrophages. IFN-gamma suppressed basal expression of genes corresponding to an
      "M2"-like homeostatic and reparative phenotype. IFN-gamma repressed genes by
      suppressing the function of enhancers enriched for binding by transcription
      factor MAF. Mechanistically, IFN-gamma disassembled a subset of enhancers by
      inducing coordinate suppression of binding by MAF, lineage-determining
      transcription factors, and chromatin accessibility. Genes associated with
      MAF-binding enhancers were suppressed in macrophages isolated from
      rheumatoid-arthritis patients, revealing a disease-associated signature of
      IFN-gamma-mediated repression. These results identify enhancer inactivation and
      disassembly as a mechanism of IFN-gamma-mediated gene repression and reveal that 
      MAF regulates the macrophage enhancer landscape and is suppressed by IFN-gamma to
      augment macrophage activation.

AB  - Through specific interactions with distinct types of Fcgamma receptors
      (FcgammaRs), the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) mediates a wide spectrum of 
      immunological functions that influence both innate and adaptive responses. Recent
      studies indicate that IgG Fc-FcgammaR interactions are dynamically regulated
      during an immune response through the control of the Fc-associated glycan
      structure and Ig subclass composition on the one hand and selective FcgammaR
      expression on immune cells on the other, which together determine the capacity of
      IgG to interact in a cell-type-specific manner with specific members of the
      FcgammaR family. Here, we present a framework that synthesizes the current
      understanding of the contribution of FcgammaR pathways to the induction and
      regulation of antibody and T cell responses. Within this context, we discuss
      vaccination strategies to elicit broad and potent immune responses based on the
      immunomodulatory properties of Fc-FcgammaR interactions.

AB  - Somatic mutations in cancer can be translated into peptides, termed neoantigens, 
      which can be recognized by the immune system as "foreign" epitopes. Two recent
      studies in Nature (Sahin et al., 2017; Ott et al., 2017) examine the effects of
      neoantigen vaccines on patients with stage III or IV melanoma and demonstrate
      immunogenicity and intriguing clinical safety and efficacy data in phase I

AB  - In this issue of Immunity, Zhu et al. (2017) report that tumor-associated
      macrophages in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) originate
      from both the yolk sac (YS) and bone marrow. Differential ablation of these
      populations indicates that only the YS-derived macrophages promote PDAC
      progression and growth.

AB  - Hayatsu et al. (2017) reveal that a FOXP3 mutant found in some patients afflicted
      with the autoimmune disease IPEX has broadened DNA-recognition specificity,
      directly repressing the expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor 
      Batf. Their findings identify Batf as critical to tissue regulatory T cell
      function and suggest that polymorphisms that impact FOXP3 DNA-binding specificity
      may contribute susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

AB  - Interferon (IFN)-gamma can prime macrophages for inflammatory responses by
      several mechanisms, including enhancer establishment and gene activation. In this
      issue of Immunity, Kang et al. (2017) provide insight into the mechanisms of
      IFN-gamma-mediated gene repression as they show that IFN-gamma promotes the
      disassembly of select active enhancers by interfering with enhancer-binding
      transcription factor MAF.

AB  - A multidisciplinary group of researchers gathered at the Honggerberg Campus at
      ETH Zurich, Switzerland, for the first meeting on the Human Immuno-Peptidome
      Project (https://hupo.org/human-immuno-peptidome-project/). The long-term goal of
      this project is to map the entire repertoire of peptides presented by human
      leukocyte antigen molecules using mass spectrometry technologies, and make its
      robust analysis accessible to any immunologist. Here we outline the specific
      challenges identified toward this goal, and within this framework, describe the
      structure of a multipronged program aimed at addressing these challenges and
      implementing solutions at a community-wide level. Pillars of that program are:
      (1) method and technology development, (2) standardization, (3) effective data
      sharing, and (4) education. If successful, this community-driven endeavor might
      provide a roadmap toward new paradigms in immunology.

      for immune evasion, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we have shown
      that CD47-signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) axis dictates the fate of
      ingested DNA in DCs for immune evasion. Although macrophages were more potent in 
      uptaking tumor DNA, increase of DNA sensing by blocking the interaction of
      SIRPalpha with CD47 preferentially occurred in dendritic cells (DCs) but not in
      macrophages. Mechanistically, CD47 blockade enabled the activation of NADPH
      oxidase NOX2 in DCs, which in turn inhibited phagosomal acidification and reduced
      the degradation of tumor mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in DCs. mtDNA was recognized
      by cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the DC cytosol, contributing to type I
      interferon (IFN) production and antitumor adaptive immunity. Thus, our findings
      have demonstrated how tumor cells inhibit innate sensing in DCs and suggested
      that the CD47-SIRPalpha axis is critical for DC-driven antitumor immunity.

AB  - In lymph nodes (LNs), dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to dispose of apoptotic
      cells, a function pertaining to macrophages in other tissues. We found that a
      population of CX3CR1(+) MERTK(+) cells located in the T cell zone of LNs,
      previously identified as DCs, are efferocytic macrophages. Lineage-tracing
      experiments and shield chimeras indicated that these T zone macrophages (TZM) are
      long-lived macrophages seeded in utero and slowly replaced by blood monocytes
      after birth. Imaging the LNs of mice in which TZM and DCs express different
      fluorescent proteins revealed that TZM-and not DCs-act as the only professional
      scavengers, clearing apoptotic cells in the LN T cell zone in a CX3CR1-dependent 
      manner. Furthermore, similar to other macrophages, TZM appear inefficient in
      priming CD4 T cells. Thus, efferocytosis and T cell activation in the LN are
      uncoupled processes designated to macrophages and DCs, respectively, with
      implications to the maintenance of immune homeostasis.

TI  - Nlrp6- and ASC-Dependent Inflammasomes Do Not Shape the Commensal Gut Microbiota 
      Composition.

AB  - The gut microbiota regulate susceptibility to multiple human diseases. The
      Nlrp6-ASC inflammasome is widely regarded as a hallmark host innate immune axis
      that shapes the gut microbiota composition. This notion stems from studies
      reporting dysbiosis in mice lacking these inflammasome components when compared
      with non-littermate wild-type animals. Here, we describe microbial analyses in
      inflammasome-deficient mice while minimizing non-genetic confounders using
      littermate-controlled Nlrp6-deficient mice and ex-germ-free littermate-controlled
      ASC-deficient mice that were all allowed to shape their gut microbiota naturally 
      after birth. Careful microbial phylogenetic analyses of these cohorts failed to
      reveal regulation of the gut microbiota composition by the Nlrp6- and
      ASC-dependent inflammasomes. Our results obtained in two geographically separated
      animal facilities dismiss a generalizable impact of Nlrp6- and ASC-dependent
      inflammasomes on the composition of the commensal gut microbiota and highlight
      the necessity for littermate-controlled experimental design in assessing the
      influence of host immunity on gut microbial ecology.

AB  - Despite the widespread use of glucocorticoids (GCs), their anti-inflammatory
      effects are not understood mechanistically. Numerous investigations have examined
      the effects of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation prior to inflammatory
      challenges. However, clinical situations are emulated by a GC intervention
      initiated in the midst of rampant inflammatory responses. To characterize the
      effects of a late GC treatment, we profiled macrophage transcriptional and
      chromatinscapes with Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment before or after stimulation by
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The late activation of GR had a similar gene-expression
      profile as from GR pre-activation, while ameliorating the disruption of metabolic
      genes. Chromatin occupancy of GR was not predictive of Dex-regulated gene
      expression, contradicting the "trans-repression by tethering" model. Rather, GR
      activation resulted in genome-wide blockade of NF-kappaB interaction with
      chromatin and directly induced inhibitors of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Our
      investigation using GC treatments with clinically relevant timing highlights
      mechanisms underlying GR actions for modulating the "inflamed epigenome."

TI  - Analyses of a Mutant Foxp3 Allele Reveal BATF as a Critical Transcription Factor 
      in the Differentiation and Accumulation of Tissue Regulatory T Cells.

AB  - Foxp3 controls the development and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells, but it 
      remains elusive how Foxp3 functions in vivo. Here, we established mouse models
      harboring three unique missense Foxp3 mutations that were identified in patients 
      with the autoimmune disease IPEX. The I363V and R397W mutations were
      loss-of-function mutations, causing multi-organ inflammation by globally
      compromising Treg cell physiology. By contrast, the A384T mutation induced a
      distinctive tissue-restricted inflammation by specifically impairing the ability 
      of Treg cells to compete with pathogenic T cells in certain non-lymphoid tissues.
      Mechanistically, repressed BATF expression contributed to these A384T effects. At
      the molecular level, the A384T mutation altered Foxp3 interactions with its
      specific target genes including Batf by broadening its DNA-binding specificity.
      Our findings identify BATF as a critical regulator of tissue Treg cells and
      suggest that sequence-specific perturbations of Foxp3-DNA interactions can
      influence specific facets of Treg cell physiology and the immunopathologies they 
      regulate.

AB  - The innate immune response is critical for animal homeostasis and is conserved
      from invertebrates to vertebrates. This response depends on specialized cells
      that recognize, internalize, and destroy microbial invaders through phagocytosis.
      This is coupled to autonomous or non-autonomous cellular signaling via reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and cytokine production. Lipids are known signaling factors 
      in this process, as the acute phase response of macrophages is accompanied by
      systemic lipid changes that help resolve inflammation. We found that peroxisomes,
      membrane-enclosed organelles central to lipid metabolism and ROS turnover, were
      necessary for the engulfment of bacteria by Drosophila and mouse macrophages.
      Peroxisomes were also required for resolution of bacterial infection through
      canonical innate immune signaling. Reduced peroxisome function impaired the
      turnover of the oxidative burst necessary to fight infection. This impaired
      response to bacterial challenge affected cell and organism survival and revealed 
      a previously unknown requirement for peroxisomes in phagocytosis and innate
      immunity.

AB  - T cell homeostasis critically depends on interleukin-7 (IL-7). In this issue of
      Immunity, Martin et al. (2017) provide evidence that IL-7 availability is
      regulated through a "cytokine sink" involving innate lymphoid cells that compete 
      for and consume IL-7 and thereby restrict T cell homeostasis in lymphoid organs.

      Macrophages and Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis.

AB  - Hypoxia augments inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis by incompletely
      understood mechanisms. We identified COMMD1 as a cell-intrinsic negative
      regulator of osteoclastogenesis that is suppressed by hypoxia. In human
      macrophages, COMMD1 restrained induction of NF-kappaB signaling and a
      transcription factor E2F1-dependent metabolic pathway by the cytokine RANKL.
      Downregulation of COMMD1 protein expression by hypoxia augmented RANKL-induced
      expression of inflammatory and E2F1 target genes and downstream
      osteoclastogenesis. E2F1 targets included glycolysis and metabolic genes
      including CKB that enabled cells to meet metabolic demands in challenging
      environments, as well as inflammatory cytokine-driven target genes. Expression
      quantitative trait locus analysis linked increased COMMD1 expression with
      decreased bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis. Myeloid deletion of Commd1
      resulted in increased osteoclastogenesis in arthritis and inflammatory osteolysis
      models. These results identify COMMD1 and an E2F-metabolic pathway as key
      regulators of osteoclastogenic responses under pathological inflammatory
      conditions and provide a mechanism by which hypoxia augments inflammation and
      bone destruction.

AB  - "Paucibacterial" levels of the normal eye surface have left immunologists
      wondering whether a true microbiome exists there. In this issue of Immunity, St. 
      Leger et al. (2017) address this head-on, discovering a naturally existing
      commensal in mice that induces gammadeltaT cell-mediated protection from
      opportunistic infection.

AB  - Many consider food allergy as the "second wave" of the allergy epidemic following
      the "first wave" of respiratory allergy, i.e., asthma and allergic rhinitis,
      plaguing westernized countries, with up to 8% of young children and 2%-3% of
      adults in the United States now affected by hypersensitivity reactions to various
      foods. In the past decade, there have been great strides in our understanding of 
      the underlying immunopathogenesis of these disorders, which have led to improved 
      diagnostic techniques, management strategies, and therapeutic approaches. Here we
      will review the most recent understanding of basic mechanisms underlying
      IgE-mediated food allergies and novel therapeutic approaches under investigation 
      for both the prevention and treatment of IgE-mediated food allergies.

AB  - Following a severe primary infection or trauma, the risk of developing pneumonia 
      increases due to acquired immune defects collectively known as sepsis-induced
      immunosuppression. In this issue of Immunity, Roquilly et al. (2017) show that
      dendritic cells and macrophages developing in the lung after the resolution of a 
      severe infection acquire tolerogenic properties that contribute to persistent
      immunosuppression and susceptibility to secondary infections.

AB  - Tissue macrophages arise during embryogenesis from yolk-sac (YS) progenitors that
      give rise to primitive YS macrophages. Until recently, it has been impossible to 
      isolate or derive sufficient numbers of YS-derived macrophages for further study,
      but data now suggest that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be driven to
      undergo a process reminiscent of YS-hematopoiesis in vitro. We asked whether
      iPSC-derived primitive macrophages (iMacs) can terminally differentiate into
      specialized macrophages with the help of growth factors and organ-specific cues. 
      Co-culturing human or murine iMacs with iPSC-derived neurons promoted
      differentiation into microglia-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, murine iMacs
      differentiated in vivo into microglia after injection into the brain and into
      functional alveolar macrophages after engraftment in the lung. Finally, iPSCs
      from a patient with familial Mediterranean fever differentiated into iMacs with
      pro-inflammatory characteristics, mimicking the disease phenotype. Altogether,
      iMacs constitute a source of tissue-resident macrophage precursors that can be
      used for biological, pathophysiological, and therapeutic studies.

AB  - Interleukin-7 (IL-7) availability determines the size and proliferative state of 
      the resting T cell pool. However, the mechanisms that regulate steady-state IL-7 
      amounts are unclear. Using experimental lymphopenic mouse models and IL-7-induced
      homeostatic proliferation to measure IL-7 availability in vivo, we found that
      radioresistant cells were the source of IL-7 for both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. 
      Hematopoietic lineage cells, although irrelevant as a source of IL-7, were
      primarily responsible for limiting IL-7 availability via their expression of
      IL-7R. Unexpectedly, innate lymphoid cells were found to have a potent influence 
      on IL-7 amounts in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. These results
      demonstrate that IL-7 homeostasis is achieved through consumption by multiple
      subsets of innate and adaptive immune cells.

AB  - Clearance of pathogens or tumor cells by antibodies traditionally requires both
      Fab and Fc domains of IgG. Here, we show the Fc domain of IgG alone mediates
      recognition and clearance of herpes simplex virus (HSV1)-infected cells. The
      human natural killer (NK) cell surface is naturally coated with IgG bound by its 
      Fc domain to the Fcgamma receptor CD16a. NK cells utilize the Fc domain of bound 
      IgG to recognize gE, an HSV1-encoded glycoprotein that also binds the Fc domain
      of IgG but at a site distinct from CD16a. The bridge formed by the Fc domain
      between the HSV1-infected cell and the NK cell results in NK cell activation and 
      lysis of the HSV1-infected cell in the absence of HSV1-specific antibody in vitro
      and prevents fatal HSV1 infection in vivo. This mechanism also explains how
      bacterial IgG-binding proteins regulate NK cell function and may be broadly
      applicable to Fcgamma-receptor-bearing cells.

AB  - Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accumulates at sites of tissue injury and
      inflammation. Effects of extracellular ATP are mediated by plasma membrane
      receptors named P2 receptors (P2Rs). The P2R most involved in inflammation and
      immunity is the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), expressed by virtually all cells of innate
      and adaptive immunity. P2X7R mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cytokine and
      chemokine release, T lymphocyte survival and differentiation, transcription
      factor activation, and cell death. Ten human P2RX7 gene splice variants and
      several SNPs that produce complex haplotypes are known. The P2X7R is a potent
      stimulant of inflammation and immunity and a promoter of cancer cell growth. This
      makes P2X7R an appealing target for anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapy.
      However, an in-depth knowledge of its structure and of the associated signal
      transduction mechanisms is needed for an effective therapeutic development.

AB  - Lung infections cause prolonged immune alterations and elevated susceptibility to
      secondary pneumonia. We found that, after resolution of primary viral or
      bacterial pneumonia, dendritic cells (DC), and macrophages exhibited poor
      antigen-presentation capacity and secretion of immunogenic cytokines. Development
      of these "paralyzed" DCs and macrophages depended on the immunosuppressive
      microenvironment established upon resolution of primary infection, which involved
      regulatory T (Treg) cells and the cytokine TGF-beta. Paralyzed DCs secreted
      TGF-beta and induced local Treg cell accumulation. They also expressed lower
      amounts of IRF4, a transcription factor associated with increased
      antigen-presentation capacity, and higher amounts of Blimp1, a transcription
      factor associated with tolerogenic functions, than DCs present during primary
      infection. Blimp1 expression in DC of humans suffering sepsis or trauma
      correlated with severity and complicated outcomes. Our findings describe
      mechanisms underlying sepsis- and trauma-induced immunosuppression, reveal
      prognostic markers of susceptibility to secondary infections and identify
      potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - In this issue of Immunity, Takata et al. (2017) describe a novel method to
      differentiate macrophages from iPSCs. These cells, which they call iMacs, are
      similar to yolk-sac-derived macrophages and are capable of undergoing terminal
      differentiation into tissue-resident-like macrophages in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - RIPK3 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL pseudokinase is the execution event
      of necroptosis. Two independent reports-in Immunity (Yoon et al., 2017) and Cell 
      (Gong et al., 2017)-reveal that MLKL affects homeostatic membrane trafficking and
      necroptosis-enhanced bubble formation involving interaction with the ESCRT
      machinery.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 are critical 
      for the prevention of autoimmunity and the suppression of anti-tumor immunity.
      The major self-antigens recognized by Treg cells remain undefined, representing a
      substantial barrier to the understanding of immune regulation. Here, we have
      identified natural Treg cell ligands in mice. We found that two recurrent Treg
      cell clones, one prevalent in prostate tumors and the other associated with
      prostatic autoimmune lesions, recognized distinct non-overlapping
      MHC-class-II-restricted peptides derived from the same prostate-specific protein.
      Notably, this protein is frequently targeted by autoantibodies in experimental
      models of prostatic autoimmunity. On the basis of these findings, we propose a
      model in which Treg cell responses at peripheral sites converge on those
      self-proteins that are most susceptible to autoimmune attack, and we suggest that
      this link could be exploited as a generalizable strategy for identifying the Treg
      cell antigens relevant to human autoimmunity.

AB  - Mucosal sites such as the intestine, oral cavity, nasopharynx, and vagina all
      have associated commensal flora. The surface of the eye is also a mucosal site,
      but proof of a living, resident ocular microbiome remains elusive. Here, we used 
      a mouse model of ocular surface disease to reveal that commensals were present in
      the ocular mucosa and had functional immunological consequences. We isolated one 
      such candidate commensal, Corynebacterium mastitidis, and showed that this
      organism elicited a commensal-specific interleukin-17 response from gammadelta T 
      cells in the ocular mucosa that was central to local immunity. The
      commensal-specific response drove neutrophil recruitment and the release of
      antimicrobials into the tears and protected the eye from pathogenic Candida
      albicans or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Our findings provide direct
      evidence that a resident commensal microbiome exists on the ocular surface and
      identify the cellular mechanisms underlying its effects on ocular immune
      homeostasis and host defense.

AB  - Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) enhances host-microbiota symbiosis, whereas
      SIgM remains poorly understood. We found that gut IgM(+) plasma cells (PCs) were 
      more abundant in humans than mice and clonally related to a large repertoire of
      memory IgM(+) B cells disseminated throughout the intestine but rare in systemic 
      lymphoid organs. In addition to sharing a gut-specific gene signature with memory
      IgA(+) B cells, memory IgM(+) B cells were related to some IgA(+) clonotypes and 
      switched to IgA in response to T cell-independent or T cell-dependent signals.
      These signals induced abundant IgM which, together with SIgM from clonally
      affiliated PCs, recognized mucus-embedded commensals. Bacteria recognized by
      human SIgM were dually coated by SIgA and showed increased richness and diversity
      compared to IgA-only-coated or uncoated bacteria. Thus, SIgM may emerge from
      pre-existing memory rather than newly activated naive IgM(+) B cells and could
      help SIgA to anchor highly diverse commensal communities to mucus.

AB  - Lymph nodes (LNs) are strategically situated throughout the body at junctures of 
      the blood vascular and lymphatic systems to direct immune responses against
      antigens draining from peripheral tissues. The current paradigm describes LN
      development as a programmed process that is governed through the interaction
      between mesenchymal lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells and hematopoietic
      lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Using cell-type-specific ablation of key
      molecules involved in lymphoid organogenesis, we found that initiation of LN
      development is dependent on LTi-cell-mediated activation of lymphatic endothelial
      cells (LECs) and that engagement of mesenchymal stromal cells is a succeeding
      event. LEC activation was mediated mainly by signaling through receptor activator
      of NF-kappaB (RANK) and the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway and was steered by
      sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor-dependent retention of LTi cells in the LN
      anlage. Finally, the finding that pharmacologically enforced interaction between 
      LTi cells and LECs promotes ectopic LN formation underscores the central LTo
      function of LECs.

AB  - Activation of the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) upon its
      phosphorylation by the protein kinase RIPK3 triggers necroptosis, a form of
      programmed cell death in which rupture of cellular membranes yields release of
      intracellular components. We report that MLKL also associated with endosomes and 
      controlled the transport of endocytosed proteins, thereby enhancing degradation
      of receptors and ligands, modulating their induced signaling and facilitating the
      generation of extracellular vesicles. This role was exerted on two quantitative
      grades: a constitutive one independent of RIPK3, and an enhanced one, triggered
      by RIPK3, where the association of MLKL with the endosomes was enhanced, and it
      was found to bind endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)
      proteins and the flotillins and to be excluded, together with them, from cells
      within vesicles. We suggest that release of phosphorylated MLKL within
      extracellular vesicles serves as a mechanism for self-restricting the necroptotic
      activity of this protein.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) functions as a potent antiviral immunity in plants and
      invertebrates; however, whether RNAi plays antiviral roles in mammals remains
      unclear. Here, using human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) as a model, we showed HEV71 3A 
      protein as an authentic viral suppressor of RNAi during viral infection. When the
      3A-mediated RNAi suppression was impaired, the mutant HEV71 readily triggered the
      production of abundant HEV71-derived small RNAs with canonical siRNA properties
      in cells and mice. These virus-derived siRNAs were produced from viral dsRNA
      replicative intermediates in a Dicer-dependent manner and loaded into AGO, and
      they were fully active in degrading cognate viral RNAs. Recombinant HEV71
      deficient in 3A-mediated RNAi suppression was significantly restricted in human
      somatic cells and mice, whereas Dicer deficiency rescued HEV71 infection
      independently of type I interferon response. Thus, RNAi can function as an
      antiviral immunity, which is induced and suppressed by a human virus, in mammals.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well known to modulate inflammatory responses. In a
      recent issue of Cell, Ali et al. (2017) reveal a function for Treg cells in stem 
      cell maintenance by showing that skin-resident Foxp3(+) Treg cells preferentially
      localize to the hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) niche to control HFSC-mediated
      hair regeneration.

AB  - Whereas strong evidence supports the notion that the microbiota promotes immune
      system maturation in multiple tissues, the identity of the specific microbes that
      elicit protective immunity to different infections is less clear. In a recent
      issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Thiemann et al. (2017) report the identification of
      specific gut bacteria that protect from Salmonella infection by priming host
      IFN-gamma responses.

AB  - The signaling pathways regulating positive selection in germinal centers (GCs)
      are incompletely understood. Ersching et al. (2017) identify a critical but
      temporal role for the action of the kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin
      complex (mTORC1), which promotes key changes in GC B cells and thereby
      facilitates affinity maturation.

      mechanism has been controversial. Qiu et al. (2017) now present data suggesting

AB  - Astrocytes constitute approximately 30% of the cells in the mammalian central
      nervous system (CNS). They are integral to brain and spinal-cord physiology and
      perform many functions important for normal neuronal development, synapse
      formation, and proper propagation of action potentials. We still know very
      little, however, about how these functions change in response to immune attack,
      chronic neurodegenerative disease, or acute trauma. In this review, we summarize 
      recent studies that demonstrate that different initiating CNS injuries can elicit
      at least two types of "reactive" astrocytes with strikingly different properties,
      one type being helpful and the other harmful. We will also discuss new methods
      for purifying and investigating reactive-astrocyte functions and provide an
      overview of new markers for delineating these different states of reactive
      astrocytes. The discovery that astrocytes have different types of reactive states
      has important implications for the development of new therapies for CNS injury
      and diseases.

AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) and its meningeal coverings accommodate a
      diverse myeloid compartment that includes parenchymal microglia and perivascular 
      macrophages, as well as choroid plexus and meningeal macrophages, dendritic
      cells, and granulocytes. These myeloid populations enjoy an intimate relationship
      with the CNS, where they play an essential role in both health and disease.
      Although the importance of these cells is clearly recognized, their exact
      function in the CNS continues to be explored. Here, we review the subsets of
      myeloid cells that inhabit the parenchyma, meninges, and choroid plexus and
      discuss their roles in CNS homeostasis. We also discuss the role of these cells
      in various neurological pathologies, such as autoimmunity, mechanical injury,
      neurodegeneration, and infection. We highlight the neuroprotective nature of
      certain myeloid cells by emphasizing their therapeutic potential for the
      treatment of neurological conditions.

AB  - Active research at the frontiers of immunology and neuroscience has identified
      multiple points of interaction and communication between the immune system and
      the nervous system. Immune cell activation stimulates neuronal circuits that
      regulate innate and adaptive immunity. Molecular mechanistic insights into the
      inflammatory reflex and other neuro-immune interactions have greatly advanced our
      understanding of immunity and identified new therapeutic possibilities in
      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Recent successful clinical trials using
      bioelectronic devices that modulate the inflammatory reflex to significantly
      ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease provide a path for
      using electrons as a therapeutic modality for targeting molecular mechanisms of
      immunity. Here, we review mechanisms of peripheral sensory neuronal function in
      response to immune challenges, the neural regulation of immunity and
      inflammation, and the therapeutic implications of those mechanistic insights.

AB  - Interactions between the nervous and immune systems enable the gut to respond to 
      the variety of dietary products that it absorbs, the broad spectrum of pathogens 
      that it encounters, and the diverse microbiome that it harbors. The enteric
      nervous system (ENS) senses and reacts to the dynamic ecosystem of the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract by translating chemical cues from the environment
      into neuronal impulses that propagate throughout the gut and into other organs in
      the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). This review will describe
      the current understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the GI tract by
      focusing on the ENS and the mucosal immune system. We highlight emerging
      literature that the ENS is essential for important aspects of microbe-induced
      immune responses in the gut. Although most basic and applied research in
      neuroscience has focused on the brain, the proximity of the ENS to the immune
      system and its interface with the external environment suggest that novel
      paradigms for nervous system function await discovery.

AB  - The concept of immune privilege of the central nervous system (CNS) has dominated
      the study of inflammatory processes in the brain. However, clinically relevant
      models have highlighted that innate pathways limit pathogen invasion of the CNS
      and adaptive immunity mediates control of many neural infections. As protective
      responses can result in bystander damage, there are regulatory mechanisms that
      balance protective and pathological inflammation, but these mechanisms might also
      allow microbial persistence. The focus of this review is to consider the
      host-pathogen interactions that influence neurotropic infections and to highlight
      advances in our understanding of innate and adaptive mechanisms of resistance as 
      key determinants of the outcome of CNS infection. Advances in these areas have
      broadened our comprehension of how the immune system functions in the brain and
      can readily overcome immune privilege.

TI  - Elicitation of Robust Tier 2 Neutralizing Antibody Responses in Nonhuman Primates
      by HIV Envelope Trimer Immunization Using Optimized Approaches.

AB  - The development of stabilized recombinant HIV envelope trimers that mimic the
      virion surface molecule has increased enthusiasm for a neutralizing antibody
      (nAb)-based HIV vaccine. However, there is limited experience with recombinant
      trimers as immunogens in nonhuman primates, which are typically used as a model
      for humans. Here, we tested multiple immunogens and immunization strategies
      head-to-head to determine their impact on the quantity, quality, and kinetics of 
      autologous tier 2 nAb development. A bilateral, adjuvanted, subcutaneous
      immunization protocol induced reproducible tier 2 nAb responses after only two
      immunizations 8 weeks apart, and these were further enhanced by a third
      immunization with BG505 SOSIP trimer. We identified immunogens that minimized
      non-neutralizing V3 responses and demonstrated that continuous immunogen delivery
      could enhance nAb responses. nAb responses were strongly associated with germinal
      center reactions, as assessed by lymph node fine needle aspiration. This study
      provides a framework for preclinical and clinical vaccine studies targeting nAb
      elicitation.

AB  - Neutrophils play a crucial role in defense against systemic candidiasis, a
      disease associated with a high mortality rate in patients receiving
      immunosuppressive therapy, although the early immune mechanisms that boost the
      candidacidal activity of neutrophils remain to be defined in depth. Here, we used
      a murine model of systemic candidiasis to explore the role of inflammatory
      Ly6C(high) monocytes in NK cell-mediated neutrophil activation during the innate 
      immune response against C. albicans. We found that efficient anti-Candida
      immunity required a collaborative response between the spleen and kidney, which
      relied on type I interferon-dependent IL-15 production by spleen inflammatory
      Ly6C(high) monocytes to drive efficient activation and GM-CSF release by spleen
      NK cells; this in turn was necessary to boost the Candida killing potential of
      kidney neutrophils. Our findings unveil a role for IL-15 as a critical mediator
      in defense against systemic candidiasis and hold promise for the design of
      IL-15-based antifungal immunotherapies.

AB  - During antibody affinity maturation, germinal center (GC) B cells cycle between
      affinity-driven selection in the light zone (LZ) and proliferation and somatic
      hypermutation in the dark zone (DZ). Although selection of GC B cells is
      triggered by antigen-dependent signals delivered in the LZ, DZ proliferation
      occurs in the absence of such signals. We show that positive selection triggered 
      by T cell help activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), 
      which promotes the anabolic program that supports DZ proliferation. Blocking
      mTORC1 prior to growth prevented clonal expansion, whereas blockade after cells
      reached peak size had little to no effect. Conversely, constitutively active
      mTORC1 led to DZ enrichment but loss of competitiveness and impaired affinity
      maturation. Thus, mTORC1 activation is required for fueling B cells prior to DZ
      proliferation rather than for allowing cell-cycle progression itself and must be 
      regulated dynamically during cyclic re-entry to ensure efficient affinity-based
      selection.

AB  - Microglia seed the embryonic neuro-epithelium, expand and actively sculpt
      neuronal circuits in the developing central nervous system, but eventually adopt 
      relative quiescence and ramified morphology in the adult. Here, we probed the
      impact of post-transcriptional control by microRNAs (miRNAs) on microglial
      performance during development and adulthood by generating mice lacking
      microglial Dicer expression at these distinct stages. Conditional Dicer ablation 
      in adult microglia revealed that miRNAs were required to limit microglial
      responses to challenge. After peripheral endotoxin exposure, Dicer-deficient
      microglia expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type microglia and 
      thereby compromised hippocampal neuronal functions. In contrast, prenatal Dicer
      ablation resulted in spontaneous microglia activation and revealed a role for
      Dicer in DNA repair and preservation of genome integrity. Accordingly, Dicer
      deficiency rendered otherwise radio-resistant microglia sensitive to gamma
      irradiation. Collectively, the differential impact of the Dicer ablation on
      microglia of the developing and adult brain highlights the changes these cells
      undergo with time.

AB  - Evidence is mounting that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule
      HLA-F (human leukocyte antigen F) regulates the immune system in pregnancy,
      infection, and autoimmunity by signaling through NK cell receptors (NKRs). We
      present structural, biochemical, and evolutionary analyses demonstrating that
      HLA-F presents peptides of unconventional length dictated by a newly arisen
      mutation (R62W) that has produced an open-ended groove accommodating particularly
      long peptides. Compared to empty HLA-F open conformers (OCs), HLA-F tetramers
      bound with human-derived peptides differentially stained leukocytes, suggesting
      peptide-dependent engagement. Our in vitro studies confirm that NKRs
      differentiate between peptide-bound and peptide-free HLA-F. The complex structure
      of peptide-loaded beta2m-HLA-F bound to the inhibitory LIR1 revealed similarities
      to high-affinity recognition of the viral MHC-I mimic UL18 and a docking strategy
      that relies on contacts with HLA-F as well as beta2m, thus precluding binding to 
      HLA-F OCs. These findings provide a biochemical framework to understand how HLA-F
      could regulate immunity via interactions with NKRs.

TI  - Structure of CC Chemokine Receptor 5 with a Potent Chemokine Antagonist Reveals
      Mechanisms of Chemokine Recognition and Molecular Mimicry by HIV.

AB  - CCR5 is the primary chemokine receptor utilized by HIV to infect leukocytes,
      whereas CCR5 ligands inhibit infection by blocking CCR5 engagement with HIV
      gp120. To guide the design of improved therapeutics, we solved the structure of
      CCR5 in complex with chemokine antagonist [5P7]CCL5. Several structural features 
      appeared to contribute to the anti-HIV potency of [5P7]CCL5, including the
      distinct chemokine orientation relative to the receptor, the near-complete
      occupancy of the receptor binding pocket, the dense network of intermolecular
      hydrogen bonds, and the similarity of binding determinants with the FDA-approved 
      HIV inhibitor Maraviroc. Molecular modeling indicated that HIV gp120 mimicked the
      chemokine interaction with CCR5, providing an explanation for the ability of CCR5
      to recognize diverse ligands and gp120 variants. Our findings reveal that
      structural plasticity facilitates receptor-chemokine specificity and enables
      exploitation by HIV, and provide insight into the design of small molecule and
      protein inhibitors for HIV and other CCR5-mediated diseases.

AB  - Host defense requires the specification of CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells into
      distinct fates, including Th1 cells that preferentially produce interferon-gamma 
      (IFN-gamma). IFN-gamma, a member of a large family of anti-pathogenic and
      anti-tumor IFNs, induces T-bet, a lineage-defining transcription factor for Th1
      cells, which in turn supports IFN-gamma production in a feed-forward manner.
      Herein, we show that a cell-intrinsic role of T-bet influences how T cells
      perceive their secreted product in the environment. In the absence of T-bet,
      IFN-gamma aberrantly induced a type I IFN transcriptomic program. T-bet
      preferentially repressed genes and pathways ordinarily activated by type I IFNs
      to ensure that its transcriptional response did not evoke an aberrant
      amplification of type I IFN signaling circuitry, otherwise triggered by its own
      product. Thus, in addition to promoting Th1 effector commitment, T-bet acts as a 
      repressor in differentiated Th1 cells to prevent abberant autocrine type I IFN
      and downstream signaling.

AB  - Lambda interferons (IFNlambdas) or type III IFNs share homology, expression
      patterns, signaling cascades, and antiviral functions with type I IFNs. This has 
      complicated the unwinding of their unique non-redundant roles. Through the
      systematic study of influenza virus infection in mice, we herein show that
      IFNlambdas are the first IFNs produced that act at the epithelial barrier to
      suppress initial viral spread without activating inflammation. If infection
      progresses, type I IFNs come into play to enhance viral resistance and induce
      pro-inflammatory responses essential for confronting infection but causing
      immunopathology. Central to this are neutrophils which respond to both cytokines 
      to upregulate antimicrobial functions but exhibit pro-inflammatory activation
      only to type I IFNs. Accordingly, Ifnlr1(-/-) mice display enhanced type I IFN
      production, neutrophilia, lung injury, and lethality, while therapeutic
      administration of PEG-IFNlambda potently suppresses these effects. IFNlambdas
      therefore constitute the front line of antiviral defense in the lung without
      compromising host fitness.

AB  - Mast cells are important for eradication of intestinal nematodes; however, their 
      precise mechanisms of action have remained elusive, especially in the early phase
      of infection. We found that Spi-B-deficient mice had increased numbers of mast
      cells and rapidly expelled the Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Hp) nematode. This was 
      accompanied by induction of interleukin-13 (IL-13)-producing group 2 innate
      lymphoid cells (ILC2) and goblet cell hyperplasia. Immediately after Hp
      infection, mast cells were rapidly activated to produce IL-33 in response to ATP 
      released from apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells. In vivo inhibition of the
      P2X7 ATP receptor rendered the Spi-B-deficient mice susceptible to Hp,
      concomitant with elimination of mast cell activation and IL-13-producing ILC2
      induction. These results uncover a previously unknown role for mast cells in
      innate immunity in that activation of mast cells by ATP orchestrates the
      development of a protective type 2 immune response, in part by producing IL-33,
      which contributes to ILC2 activation.

      Factor Dependence of Ly6C(-) Cells.

AB  - Monocytes are circulating, short-lived mononuclear phagocytes, which in mice and 
      man comprise two main subpopulations. Murine Ly6C(+) monocytes display
      developmental plasticity and are recruited to complement tissue-resident
      macrophages and dendritic cells on demand. Murine vascular Ly6C(-) monocytes
      patrol the endothelium, act as scavengers, and support vessel wall repair. Here
      we characterized population and single cell transcriptomes, as well as enhancer
      and promoter landscapes of the murine monocyte compartment. Single cell RNA-seq
      and transplantation experiments confirmed homeostatic default differentiation of 
      Ly6C(+) into Ly6C(-) monocytes. The main two subsets were homogeneous, but linked
      by a more heterogeneous differentiation intermediate. We show that monocyte
      differentiation occurred through de novo enhancer establishment and activation of
      pre-established (poised) enhancers. Generation of Ly6C(-) monocytes involved
      induction of the transcription factor C/EBPbeta and C/EBPbeta-deficient mice
      lacked Ly6C(-) monocytes. Mechanistically, C/EBPbeta bound the Nr4a1 promoter and
      controlled expression of this established monocyte survival factor.

AB  - Monocytes give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) under steady-state
      and inflammatory conditions, thereby contributing to host defense and tissue
      pathology. A common monocyte progenitor (cMoP) that is strictly committed to the 
      monocyte lineage has been recently identified in mice. Here, we identified human 
      cMoPs as a CLEC12A(hi)CD64(hi) subpopulation of conventional granulocyte-monocyte
      progenitors (cGMPs) in umbilical cord blood and in bone marrow. Human cMoPs gave 
      rise to monocyte subsets without showing any potential for differentiating into
      myeloid or lymphoid cells. Within the cGMP population, we also identified revised
      GMPs that completely lacked DC and lymphoid potential. Collectively, our findings
      expand and revise the current understanding of human myeloid cell differentiation
      pathways.

AB  - Innate and adaptive lymphoid development is orchestrated by the activities of E
      proteins and their antagonist Id proteins, but how these factors regulate early T
      cell progenitor (ETP) and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) development remains unclear.
      Using multiple genetic strategies, we demonstrated that E proteins E2A and HEB
      acted in synergy in the thymus to establish T cell identity and to suppress the
      aberrant development of ILCs, including ILC2s and lymphoid-tissue-inducer-like
      cells. E2A and HEB orchestrated T cell fate and suppressed the ILC transcription 
      signature by activating the expression of genes associated with Notch receptors, 
      T cell receptor (TCR) assembly, and TCR-mediated signaling. E2A and HEB acted in 
      ETPs to establish and maintain a T-cell-lineage-specific enhancer repertoire,
      including regulatory elements associated with the Notch1, Rag1, and Rag2 loci. On
      the basis of these and previous observations, we propose that the E-Id protein
      axis specifies innate and adaptive lymphoid cell fate.

      Antibodies that Display a Unique V2 Cap Approach.

AB  - The development of soluble envelope glycoprotein (Env) mimetics displaying
      ordered trimeric symmetry has ushered in a new era in HIV-1 vaccination. The
      recently reported native, flexibly linked (NFL) design allows the generation of
      native-like trimers from clinical isolates at high yields and homogeneity. As the
      majority of infections world-wide are of the clade C subtype, we examined
      responses in non-human primates to well-ordered subtype C 16055 trimers
      administered in soluble or high-density liposomal formats. We detected superior
      germinal center formation and enhanced autologous neutralizing antibodies against
      the neutralization-resistant (tier 2) 16055 virus following inoculation of
      liposome-arrayed trimers. Epitope mapping of the neutralizing monoclonal
      antibodies (mAbs) indicated major contacts with the V2 apex, and 3D electron
      microscopy reconstructions of Fab-trimer complexes revealed a horizontal binding 
      angle to the Env spike. These vaccine-elicited mAbs target the V2 cap,
      demonstrating a means to accomplish tier 2 virus neutralization by penetrating
      the dense N-glycan shield.

AB  - Advances in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) design generate native-like trimers
      and high-resolution clade A, B, and G structures and elicit neutralizing
      antibodies. However, a high-resolution clade C structure is critical, as this
      subtype accounts for the majority of HIV infections worldwide, but well-ordered
      clade C Env trimers are more challenging to produce due to their instability.
      Based on targeted glycine substitutions in the Env fusion machinery, we defined a
      general approach that disfavors helical transitions leading to post-fusion
      conformations, thereby favoring the pre-fusion state. We generated a stabilized, 
      soluble clade C Env (16055 NFL) and determined its crystal structure at 3.9 A.
      Its overall conformation is similar to SOSIP.664 and native Env trimers but
      includes a covalent linker between gp120 and gp41, an engineered 201-433
      disulfide bond, and density corresponding to 22 N-glycans. Env-structure-guided
      design strategies resulted in multiple homogeneous cross-clade immunogens with
      the potential to advance HIV vaccine development.

TI  - Virus-like Particles Identify an HIV V1V2 Apex-Binding Neutralizing Antibody that
      Lacks a Protruding Loop.

AB  - Most HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies isolated to date exhibit unusual
      characteristics that complicate their elicitation. Neutralizing antibodies that
      target the V1V2 apex of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer feature unusually long
      protruding loops, which enable them to penetrate the HIV-1 glycan shield. As
      antibodies with loops of requisite length are created through uncommon
      recombination events, an alternative mode of apex binding has been sought. Here, 
      we isolated a lineage of Env apex-directed neutralizing antibodies,
      N90-VRC38.01-11, by using virus-like particles and conformationally stabilized
      Env trimers as B cell probes. A crystal structure of N90-VRC38.01 with a
      scaffolded V1V2 revealed a binding mode involving side-chain-to-side-chain
      interactions that reduced the distance the antibody loop must traverse the glycan
      shield, thereby facilitating V1V2 binding via a non-protruding loop. The
      N90-VRC38 lineage thus identifies a solution for V1V2-apex binding that provides 
      a more conventional B cell pathway for vaccine design.

AB  - Productive humoral responses require that naive B cells and their differentiated 
      progeny move among distinct micro-environments. In this review, we discuss how
      studies are beginning to address the nature of these niches as well as the
      interplay between cellular signaling, metabolic programming, and adaptation to
      the locale. Recent work adds evidence to the expectation that B cells at distinct
      stages of development or functional subsets are influenced by the altered
      profiles of nutrients and metabolic by-products that distinguish these sites.
      Moreover, emerging findings reveal a cross-talk among the external milieu, signal
      transduction pathways, and transcription factors that direct B cell fate in the
      periphery.

AB  - Tissue-resident immune cells must balance survival in peripheral tissues with the
      capacity to respond rapidly upon infection or tissue damage, and in turn couple
      these responses with intrinsic metabolic control and conditions in the tissue
      microenvironment. The serine/threonine kinase mammalian/mechanistic target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) is a central integrator of extracellular and intracellular
      growth signals and cellular metabolism and plays important roles in both innate
      and adaptive immune responses. This review discusses the function of mTOR
      signaling in the differentiation and function of tissue-resident immune cells,
      with focus on the role of mTOR as a metabolic sensor and its impact on metabolic 
      regulation in innate and adaptive immune cells. We also discuss the impact of
      metabolic constraints in tissues on immune homeostasis and disease, and how
      manipulating mTOR activity with drugs such as rapamycin can modulate immunity in 
      these contexts.

AB  - Recognition of pathogens by innate and adaptive immune cells instructs rapid
      alterations of cellular processes to promote effective resolution of infection.
      To accommodate increased bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands, metabolic
      pathways are harnessed to maximize proliferation and effector molecule
      production. In parallel, activation initiates context-specific gene-expression
      programs that drive effector functions and cell fates that correlate with changes
      in epigenetic landscapes. Many chromatin- and DNA-modifying enzymes make use of
      substrates and cofactors that are intermediates of metabolic pathways, providing 
      potential cross talk between metabolism and epigenetic regulation of gene
      expression. In this review, we discuss recent studies of T cells and macrophages 
      supporting a role for metabolic activity in integrating environmental signals
      with activation-induced gene-expression programs through modulation of the
      epigenome and speculate as to how this may influence context-specific macrophage 
      and T cell responses to infection.

AB  - The metabolism of immune cells affects their function and influences host
      immunity. This review explores how immune cell metabolic phenotypes reflect
      biochemical dependencies and highlights evidence that both the metabolic state of
      immune cells and nutrient availability can alter immune responses. The central
      importance of oxygen, energetics, and redox homeostasis in immune cell
      metabolism, and how these factors are reflected in different metabolic
      phenotypes, is also discussed. Linking immune cell metabolic phenotype to
      effector functions is important to understand how altering metabolism can impact 
      the way in which immune cells meet their metabolic demands and affect the immune 
      response in various disease contexts.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV delineate vaccine targets and are 
      prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Some of the most potent bnAbs target a
      quaternary epitope at the apex of the surface HIV envelope (Env) trimer. Using
      cryo-electron microscopy, we solved the atomic structure of an apex bnAb, PGT145,
      in complex with Env. We showed that the long anionic HCDR3 of PGT145 penetrated
      between glycans at the trimer 3-fold axis, to contact peptide residues from all
      three Env protomers, and thus explains its highly trimer-specific nature. Somatic
      hypermutation in the other CDRs of PGT145 were crucially involved in stabilizing 
      the structure of the HCDR3, similar to bovine antibodies, to aid in recognition
      of a cluster of conserved basic residues hypothesized to facilitate trimer
      disassembly during viral entry. Overall, the findings exemplify the creative
      solutions that the human immune system can evolve to recognize a conserved motif 
      buried under a canopy of glycans.

AB  - Activated T cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which trigger the
      antioxidative glutathione (GSH) response necessary to buffer rising ROS and
      prevent cellular damage. We report that GSH is essential for T cell effector
      functions through its regulation of metabolic activity. Conditional gene
      targeting of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclc) blocked
      GSH production specifically in murine T cells. Gclc-deficient T cells initially
      underwent normal activation but could not meet their increased energy and
      biosynthetic requirements. GSH deficiency compromised the activation of mammalian
      target of rapamycin-1 (mTOR) and expression of NFAT and Myc transcription
      factors, abrogating the energy utilization and Myc-dependent metabolic
      reprogramming that allows activated T cells to switch to glycolysis and
      glutaminolysis. In vivo, T-cell-specific ablation of murine Gclc prevented
      autoimmune disease but blocked antiviral defense. The antioxidative GSH pathway
      thus plays an unexpected role in metabolic integration and reprogramming during
      inflammatory T cell responses.

AB  - Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) perform suppressive functions in disparate tissue
      environments and against many inflammatory insults, yet the tissue-enriched
      factor(s) that influence Treg cell phenotype and function remain largely unknown.
      We have shown a vital role for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signals
      in safe-guarding specific Treg cell functions. TGF-beta signals were dispensable 
      for steady-state Treg cell homeostasis and for Treg cell suppression of T cell
      proliferation and T helper-1 (Th1) cell differentiation. However, Treg cells
      require TGF-beta signals to appropriately dampen Th17 cells and regulate
      responses in the gastrointestinal tract. TGF-beta signaling maintains CD103
      expression, promotes expression of the colon-specific trafficking molecule GPR15,
      and inhibits expression of GPR174, a receptor for lysophosphatidylserine, on Treg
      cells, collectively supporting the accumulation and retention of Treg cells in
      the colon and control of colitogenic responses. Thus, we reveal an unrecognized
      function for TGF-beta signaling as an upstream factor controlling Treg cell
      activity in specific tissue environments.

AB  - Cytosolic sensing of nucleic acids initiates tightly regulated programs to limit 
      infection. Oocyte fertilization represents a scenario wherein inappropriate
      responses to exogenous yet non-pathogen-derived nucleic acids would have negative
      consequences. We hypothesized that germ cells express negative regulators of
      nucleic acid sensing (NAS) in steady state and applied an integrated data-mining 
      and functional genomics approach to identify a rheostat of DNA and RNA
      sensing-the inflammasome component NLRP14. We demonstrated that NLRP14 interacted
      physically with the nucleic acid sensing pathway and targeted TBK1 (TANK binding 
      kinase 1) for ubiquitination and degradation. We further mapped domains in NLRP14
      and TBK1 that mediated the inhibitory function. Finally, we identified a human
      nonsense germline variant associated with male sterility that results in loss of 
      NLRP14 function and hyper-responsiveness to nucleic acids. The discovery points
      to a mechanism of nucleic acid sensing regulation that may be of particular
      importance in fertilization.

AB  - Although vaccines confer protection against influenza A viruses, antiviral
      treatment becomes the first line of defense during pandemics because there is
      insufficient time to produce vaccines. Current antiviral drugs are susceptible to
      drug resistance, and developing new antivirals is essential. We studied host
      defense peptides from the skin of the South Indian frog and demonstrated that one
      of these, which we named "urumin," is virucidal for H1 hemagglutinin-bearing
      human influenza A viruses. This peptide specifically targeted the conserved stalk
      region of H1 hemagglutinin and was effective against drug-resistant H1 influenza 
      viruses. Using electron microscopy, we showed that this peptide physically
      destroyed influenza virions. It also protected naive mice from lethal influenza
      infection. Urumin represents a unique class of anti-influenza virucide that
      specifically targets the hemagglutinin stalk region, similar to targeting of
      antibodies induced by universal influenza vaccines. Urumin therefore has the
      potential to contribute to first-line anti-viral treatments during influenza
      outbreaks.

AB  - The microbiota plays a fundamental role in the induction, education, and function
      of the host immune system. In return, the host immune system has evolved multiple
      means by which to maintain its symbiotic relationship with the microbiota. The
      maintenance of this dialogue allows the induction of protective responses to
      pathogens and the utilization of regulatory pathways involved in the sustained
      tolerance to innocuous antigens. The ability of microbes to set the immunological
      tone of tissues, both locally and systemically, requires tonic sensing of
      microbes and complex feedback loops between innate and adaptive components of the
      immune system. Here we review the dominant cellular mediators of these
      interactions and discuss emerging themes associated with our current
      understanding of the homeostatic immunological dialogue between the host and its 
      microbiota.

AB  - Pulmonary immune homeostasis is maintained by a network of tissue-resident cells 
      that continually monitor the external environment, and in health, instruct
      tolerance to innocuous inhaled particles while ensuring that efficient and rapid 
      immune responses can be mounted against invading pathogens. Here we review the
      multiple pathways that underlie effective lung immunity in health, and discuss
      how these may be affected by external environmental factors and contribute to
      chronic inflammation during disease. In this context, we examine the current
      understanding of the impact of the microbiota in immune development and function 
      and in the setting of the threshold for immune responses that maintains the
      balance between tolerance and chronic inflammation in the lung. We propose that
      host interactions with microbes are critical for establishing the immune
      landscape of the lungs.

AB  - The intestinal immune system has the daunting task of protecting us from
      pathogenic insults while limiting inflammatory responses against the resident
      commensal microbiota and providing tolerance to food antigens. This role is
      particularly impressive when one considers the vast mucosal surface and changing 
      landscape that the intestinal immune system must monitor. In this review, we
      highlight regional differences in the development and composition of the adaptive
      immune landscape of the intestine and the impact of local intrinsic and
      environmental factors that shape this process. To conclude, we review the
      evidence for a critical window of opportunity for early-life exposures that
      affect immune development and alter disease susceptibility later in life.

AB  - The identity of PD-1 dependency on other receptors and signaling has been
      unclear. In a recent issue of Science, Hui et al. (2017) and Kamphorst et al.
      (2017) now show that CD28 expression is a target of PD-1-associated phosphatases 
      and is needed for T cell expansion in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.

      cells under antiretroviral therapy is the major obstacle to an HIV-1 cure.

TI  - NAIP-NLRC4 Inflammasomes Coordinate Intestinal Epithelial Cell Expulsion with
      Eicosanoid and IL-18 Release via Activation of Caspase-1 and -8.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) form a critical barrier against pathogen
      invasion. By generation of mice in which inflammasome expression is restricted to
      IECs, we describe a coordinated epithelium-intrinsic inflammasome response in
      vivo. This response was sufficient to protect against Salmonella tissue invasion 
      and involved a previously reported IEC expulsion that was coordinated with lipid 
      mediator and cytokine production and lytic IEC death. Excessive inflammasome
      activation in IECs was sufficient to result in diarrhea and pathology.
      Experiments with IEC organoids demonstrated that IEC expulsion did not require
      other cell types. IEC expulsion was accompanied by a major actin rearrangement in
      neighboring cells that maintained epithelium integrity but did not absolutely
      require Caspase-1 or Gasdermin D. Analysis of Casp1(-/-)Casp8(-/-) mice revealed 
      a functional Caspase-8 inflammasome in vivo. Thus, a coordinated IEC-intrinsic,
      Caspase-1 and -8 inflammasome response plays a key role in intestinal immune
      defense and pathology.

AB  - Mice carrying a hypomorphic point mutation in the Ptpn6 gene (Ptpn6(spin) mice)
      develop an inflammatory skin disease that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in
      humans. Here, we demonstrated that interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) signaling
      through IL-1R and MyD88 in both stromal and immune cells drive inflammation in
      Ptpn6(spin) mice. We further identified SYK as a critical kinase that
      phosphorylates MyD88, promoted MyD88-dependent signaling and mediates dermatosis 
      in Ptpn6(spin) mice. Our studies further demonstrated that SHP1 encoded by Ptpn6 
      binds and suppresses SYK activation to inhibit MyD88 phosphorylation. Downstream 
      of SHP1 and SYK-dependent counterregulation of MyD88 tyrosine phosphorylation, we
      have demonstrated that the scaffolding function of receptor interacting protein
      kinase 1 (RIPK1) and tumor growth factor-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-mediating
      signaling were required to spur inflammatory disease. Overall, these studies
      identify SHP1 and SYK crosstalk as a critical regulator of MyD88
      post-translational modifications and IL-1-driven inflammation.

AB  - Understanding immunological memory formation depends on elucidating how
      multipotent memory precursor (MP) cells maintain developmental plasticity and
      longevity to provide long-term immunity while other effector cells develop into
      terminally differentiated effector (TE) cells with limited survival. Profiling
      active (H3K27ac) and repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin in naive, MP, and TE CD8(+) T
      cells during viral infection revealed increased H3K27me3 deposition at numerous
      pro-memory and pro-survival genes in TE relative to MP cells, indicative of fate 
      restriction, but permissive chromatin at both pro-memory and pro-effector genes
      in MP cells, indicative of multipotency. Polycomb repressive complex 2 deficiency
      impaired clonal expansion and TE cell differentiation, but minimally impacted
      CD8(+) memory T cell maturation. Abundant H3K27me3 deposition at pro-memory genes
      occurred late during TE cell development, probably from diminished transcription 
      factor FOXO1 expression. These results outline a temporal model for loss of
      memory cell potential through selective epigenetic silencing of pro-memory genes 
      in effector T cells.

AB  - CD25 is expressed at high levels on regulatory T (Treg) cells and was initially
      proposed as a target for cancer immunotherapy. However, anti-CD25 antibodies have
      displayed limited activity against established tumors. We demonstrated that CD25 
      expression is largely restricted to tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in mice and
      humans. While existing anti-CD25 antibodies were observed to deplete Treg cells
      in the periphery, upregulation of the inhibitory Fc gamma receptor (FcgammaR) IIb
      at the tumor site prevented intra-tumoral Treg cell depletion, which may underlie
      the lack of anti-tumor activity previously observed in pre-clinical models. Use
      of an anti-CD25 antibody with enhanced binding to activating FcgammaRs led to
      effective depletion of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, increased effector to Treg 
      cell ratios, and improved control of established tumors. Combination with
      anti-programmed cell death protein-1 antibodies promoted complete tumor
      rejection, demonstrating the relevance of CD25 as a therapeutic target and
      promising substrate for future combination approaches in immune-oncology.

AB  - Immune cells communicate by exchanging cytokines to achieve a context-appropriate
      response, but the distances over which such communication happens are not known. 
      Here, we used theoretical considerations and experimental models of immune
      responses in vitro and in vivo to quantify the spatial extent of cytokine
      communications in dense tissues. We established that competition between cytokine
      diffusion and consumption generated spatial niches of high cytokine
      concentrations with sharp boundaries. The size of these self-assembled niches
      scaled with the density of cytokine-consuming cells, a parameter that gets tuned 
      during immune responses. In vivo, we measured interactions on length scales of
      80-120 mum, which resulted in a high degree of cell-to-cell variance in cytokine 
      exposure. Such heterogeneous distributions of cytokines were a source of
      non-genetic cell-to-cell variability that is often overlooked in single-cell
      studies. Our findings thus provide a basis for understanding variability in the
      patterning of immune responses by diffusible factors.

AB  - Maturation and migration to lymph nodes (LNs) constitutes a central paradigm in
      conventional dendritic cell (cDC) biology but remains poorly defined in humans.
      Using our organ donor tissue resource, we analyzed cDC subset distribution,
      maturation, and migration in mucosal tissues (lungs, intestines), associated
      lymph nodes (LNs), and other lymphoid sites from 78 individuals ranging from less
      than 1 year to 93 years of age. The distribution of cDC1 (CD141(hi)CD13(hi)) and 
      cDC2 (Sirp-alpha(+)CD1c(+)) subsets was a function of tissue site and was
      conserved between donors. We identified cDC2 as the major mature (HLA-DR(hi))
      subset in LNs with the highest frequency in lung-draining LNs. Mature cDC2 in
      mucosal-draining LNs expressed tissue-specific markers derived from the paired
      mucosal site, reflecting their tissue-migratory origin. These distribution and
      maturation patterns were largely maintained throughout life, with site-specific
      variations. Our findings provide evidence for localized DC tissue surveillance
      and reveal a lifelong division of labor between DC subsets, with cDC2 functioning
      as guardians of the mucosa.

AB  - Living in a microbe-rich environment reduces the risk of developing asthma.
      Exposure of humans or mice to unmethylated CpG DNA (CpG) from bacteria reproduces
      these protective effects, suggesting a major contribution of CpG to
      microbe-induced asthma resistance. However, how CpG confers protection remains
      elusive. We found that exposure to CpG expanded regulatory lung interstitial
      macrophages (IMs) from monocytes infiltrating the lung or mobilized from the
      spleen. Trafficking of IM precursors to the lung was independent of CCR2, a
      chemokine receptor required for monocyte mobilization from the bone marrow. Using
      a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation, we found that adoptive transfer of
      IMs isolated from CpG-treated mice recapitulated the protective effects of CpG
      when administered before allergen sensitization or challenge. IM-mediated
      protection was dependent on IL-10, given that Il10(-/-) CpG-induced IMs lacked
      regulatory effects. Thus, the expansion of regulatory lung IMs upon exposure to
      CpG might underlie the reduced risk of asthma development associated with a
      microbe-rich environment.

AB  - Bacterial and host cyclic dinucleotides (cdNs) mediate cytosolic immune responses
      through the STING signaling pathway, although evidence suggests that alternative 
      pathways exist. We used cdN-conjugated beads to biochemically isolate host
      receptors for bacterial cdNs, and we identified the oxidoreductase RECON.
      High-affinity cdN binding inhibited RECON enzyme activity by simultaneously
      blocking the substrate and cosubstrate sites, as revealed by structural analyses.
      During bacterial infection of macrophages, RECON antagonized STING activation by 
      acting as a molecular sink for cdNs. Bacterial infection of hepatocytes, which do
      not express STING, revealed that RECON negatively regulates NF-kappaB activation.
      Loss of RECON activity, via genetic ablation or inhibition by cdNs, increased
      NF-kappaB activation and reduced bacterial survival, suggesting that cdN
      inhibition of RECON promotes a proinflammatory, antibacterial state that is
      distinct from the antiviral state associated with STING activation. Thus, RECON
      functions as a cytosolic sensor for bacterial cdNs, shaping inflammatory gene
      activation via its effects on STING and NF-kappaB.

      Underlying Type III IFN Functional Plasticity.

AB  - Type III interferons (IFN-lambdas) signal through a heterodimeric receptor
      complex composed of the IFN-lambdaR1 subunit, specific for IFN-lambdas, and
      interleukin-10Rbeta (IL-10Rbeta), which is shared by multiple cytokines in the
      IL-10 superfamily. Low affinity of IL-10Rbeta for cytokines has impeded efforts
      aimed at crystallizing cytokine-receptor complexes. We used yeast surface display
      to engineer a higher-affinity IFN-lambda variant, H11, which enabled
      crystallization of the ternary complex. The structure revealed that IL-10Rbeta
      uses a network of tyrosine residues as hydrophobic anchor points to engage IL-10 
      family cytokines that present complementary hydrophobic binding patches,
      explaining its role as both a cross-reactive but cytokine-specific receptor. H11 
      elicited increased anti-proliferative and antiviral activities in vitro and in
      vivo. In contrast, engineered higher-affinity type I IFNs did not increase
      antiviral potency over wild-type type I IFNs. Our findings provide insight into
      cytokine recognition by the IL-10R family and highlight the plasticity of type
      III interferon signaling and its therapeutic potential.

AB  - Throughout life, the T cell system adapts to shifting resources and demands,
      resulting in a fundamentally restructured immune system in older individuals.
      Here we review the cellular and molecular features of an aged immune system and
      discuss the trade-offs inherent to these adaptive mechanisms. Processes include
      homeostatic proliferation that maintains compartment size at the expense of
      partial loss in stemness and incomplete differentiation and the activation of
      negative regulatory programs, which constrain effector T cell expansion and
      prevent increasing oligoclonality but also interfere with memory cell generation.
      We propose that immune failure occurs when adaptive strategies developed by the
      aging T cell system fail and also discuss how, in some settings, the programs
      associated with T cell aging culminates in a maladaptive response that directly
      contributes to chronic inflammatory disease.

AB  - Infections in the first year of life are common and often severe. The newborn
      host demonstrates both quantitative and qualitative differences to the adult in
      nearly all aspects of immunity, which at least partially explain the increased
      susceptibility to infection. Here we discuss how differences in susceptibility to
      infection result not out of a state of immaturity, but rather reflect adaptation 
      to the particular demands placed on the immune system in early life. We review
      the mechanisms underlying host defense in the very young, and discuss how
      specific developmental demands increase the risk of particular infectious
      diseases. In this context, we discuss how this plasticity, i.e. the capacity to
      adapt to demands encountered in early life, also provides the potential to
      leverage protection of the young against infection and disease through a number
      of interventions.

      issue of Nature, Chen et al. (2017) demonstrate that IL-17 plays a
      neuromodulatory role in Caenorhabditis elegans by acting directly on neurons to
      amplify neuronal responses to stimuli and produce changes in animal behavior.

AB  - The development of human innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) remains poorly
      characterized. In a recent issue of Cell, Lim et al. show that human
      peripheral-blood CD117(+) ILCs harbor ILC precursors (ILCPs) derived from
      hematopoietic stem cells. Peripheral-blood ILCPs can generate all ILC subsets in 
      vivo and in vitro.

AB  - Migration from peripheral tissues to lymph nodes is a key feature of dendritic
      cells (DCs), but little is known about the migration patterns of human DCs. By
      analyzing multiple lymphoid organs and tissues from the same donors, Granot et

AB  - Caspases have important functions beyond their established role in driving
      inflammation and apoptosis. In this issue of Immunity, Wang et al. (2017)
      demonstrate that inflammasome-triggered caspases cleave and inactivate the DNA
      sensor cGAS, thus restricting the type I interferon response to cytosolic DNA.

AB  - Immunology has recently witnessed several new developments in understanding the
      biology of innate lymphocytes. In particular, the discovery of innate lymphoid
      cells (ILCs) has opened entirely new avenues for research. The exciting new
      developments in this rapidly expanding field were the focus of the 2(nd)EMBO
      Conference on Innate Lymphoid Cells, which took place from November 30 to
      December 2, 2016 in Berlin, Germany. Here, we summarize the key new developments 
      reported at the conference.

AB  - Brain ischemia inhibits immune function systemically, with resulting infectious
      complications. Whether in stroke different immune alterations occur in brain and 
      periphery and whether analogous mechanisms operate in these compartments remains 
      unclear. Here we show that in patients with ischemic stroke and in mice subjected
      to middle cerebral artery occlusion, natural killer (NK) cells display remarkably
      distinct temporal and transcriptome profiles in the brain as compared to the
      periphery. The activation of catecholaminergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis leads to splenic atrophy and contraction of NK cell numbers in the periphery
      through a modulated expression of SOCS3, whereas cholinergic innervation-mediated
      suppression of NK cell responses in the brain involves RUNX3. Importantly,
      pharmacological or genetic ablation of innervation preserved NK cell function and
      restrained post-stroke infection. Thus, brain ischemia compromises NK
      cell-mediated immune defenses through mechanisms that differ in the brain versus 
      the periphery, and targeted inhibition of neurogenic innervation limits
      post-stroke infection.

TI  - 25-Hydroxycholesterol Protects Host against Zika Virus Infection and Its

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a public health threat due to its global
      transmission and link to severe congenital disorders. The host immune responses
      to ZIKV infection have not been fully elucidated, and effective therapeutics are 
      not currently available. Herein, we demonstrated that cholesterol-25-hydroxylase 
      (CH25H) was induced in response to ZIKV infection and that its enzymatic product,
      25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), was a critical mediator of host protection against 
      ZIKV. Synthetic 25HC addition inhibited ZIKV infection in vitro by blocking viral
      entry, and treatment with 25HC reduced viremia and conferred protection against
      ZIKV in mice and rhesus macaques. 25HC suppressed ZIKV infection and reduced
      tissue damage in human cortical organoids and the embryonic brain of the
      ZIKV-induced mouse microcephaly model. Our findings highlight the protective role
      of CH25H during ZIKV infection and the potential use of 25HC as a natural
      antiviral agent to combat ZIKV infection and prevent ZIKV-associated outcomes,
      such as microcephaly.

AB  - How the number of immune cells recruited to sites of infection is determined and 
      adjusted to differences in the cellular stoichiometry between host and pathogen
      is unknown. Here, we have uncovered a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) as
      sensors of microbe size. By sensing the differential localization of ROS
      generated in response to microbes of different size, neutrophils tuned their
      interleukin (IL)-1beta expression via the selective oxidation of NF-kappaB, in
      order to implement distinct inflammatory programs. Small microbes triggered ROS
      intracellularly, suppressing IL-1beta expression to limit neutrophil recruitment 
      as each phagocyte eliminated numerous pathogens. In contrast, large microbes
      triggered ROS extracellularly, amplifying IL-1beta expression to recruit numerous
      neutrophils forming cooperative clusters. Defects in ROS-mediated microbe size
      sensing resulted in large neutrophil infiltrates and clusters in response to
      small microbes that contribute to inflammatory disease. These findings highlight 
      the impact of ROS localization on signal transduction.

AB  - During immune responses, naive T cells transition from small quiescent cells to
      rapidly cycling cells. We have found that T cells lacking TAX1BP1 exhibit delays 
      in growth of cell size and cell cycling. TAX1BP1-deficient T cells exited G0 but 
      stalled in S phase, due to both bioenergetic and biosynthetic defects. These
      defects were due to deficiencies in mTOR complex formation and activation. These 
      mTOR defects in turn resulted from defective autophagy induction. TAX1BP1 binding
      of LC3 and GABARAP via its LC3-interacting region (LIR), but not its
      ubiquitin-binding domain, supported T cell proliferation. Supplementation of
      TAX1BP1-deficient T cells with metabolically active L-cysteine rescued mTOR
      activation and proliferation but not autophagy. These studies reveal that TAX1BP1
      drives a specialized form of autophagy, providing critical amino acids that
      activate mTOR and enable the metabolic transition of activated T cells.

      Responses to DNA Virus Infection.

AB  - Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses that result in the
      production of various cytokines including type I interferons (IFN), activation of
      inflammasomes, and programmed cell death of the infected cells. Tight control of 
      inflammatory cytokine production is crucial for the triggering of an effective
      immune response that can resolve the infection without causing host pathology. In
      examining the inflammatory response of Asc(-/-) and Casp1(-/-) macrophages, we
      found that deficiency in these molecules resulted in increased IFN production
      upon DNA virus infection, but not RNA virus challenge. Investigation of the
      underlying mechanism revealed that upon canonical and non-canonical inflammasome 
      activation, caspase-1 interacted with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS),
      cleaving it and dampening cGAS-STING-mediated IFN production. Deficiency in
      inflammasome signaling enhanced host resistance to DNA virus in vitro and in
      vivo, and this regulatory role extended to other inflammatory caspases. Thus,
      inflammasome activation dampens cGAS-dependent signaling, suggesting
      cross-regulation between intracellular DNA-sensing pathways.

AB  - The molecular circuits by which antigens activate quiescent T cells remain poorly
      understood. We combined temporal profiling of the whole proteome and
      phosphoproteome via multiplexed isobaric labeling proteomics technology,
      computational pipelines for integrating multi-omics datasets, and functional
      perturbation to systemically reconstruct regulatory networks underlying T cell
      activation. T cell receptors activated the T cell proteome and phosphoproteome
      with discrete kinetics, marked by early dynamics of phosphorylation and delayed
      ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrial activation. Systems biology analyses
      identified multiple functional modules, active kinases, transcription factors and
      connectivity between them, and mitochondrial pathways including mitoribosomes and
      complex IV. Genetic perturbation revealed physiological roles for mitochondrial
      enzyme COX10-mediated oxidative phosphorylation in T cell quiescence exit. Our
      multi-layer proteomics profiling, integrative network analysis, and functional
      studies define landscapes of the T cell proteome and phosphoproteome and reveal
      signaling and bioenergetics pathways that mediate lymphocyte exit from
      quiescence.

AB  - Identification of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-bound peptides by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is poised to provide a deep
      understanding of rules underlying antigen presentation. However, a key obstacle
      is the ambiguity that arises from the co-expression of multiple HLA alleles.
      Here, we have implemented a scalable mono-allelic strategy for profiling the HLA 
      peptidome. By using cell lines expressing a single HLA allele, optimizing
      immunopurifications, and developing an application-specific spectral search
      algorithm, we identified thousands of peptides bound to 16 different HLA class I 
      alleles. These data enabled the discovery of subdominant binding motifs and an
      integrative analysis quantifying the contribution of factors critical to epitope 
      presentation, such as protein cleavage and gene expression. We trained
      neural-network prediction algorithms with our large dataset (>24,000 peptides)
      and outperformed algorithms trained on datasets of peptides with measured
      affinities. We thus demonstrate a strategy for systematically learning the rules 
      of endogenous antigen presentation.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract
      infections in infants and is characterized by pulmonary infiltration of B cells
      in fatal cases. We analyzed the B cell compartment in human newborns and
      identified a population of neonatal regulatory B lymphocytes (nBreg cells) that
      produced interleukin 10 (IL-10) in response to RSV infection. The polyreactive B 
      cell receptor of nBreg cells interacted with RSV protein F and induced
      upregulation of chemokine receptor CX3CR1. CX3CR1 interacted with RSV
      glycoprotein G, leading to nBreg cell infection and IL-10 production that
      dampened T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine production. In the respiratory tract of
      neonates with severe RSV-induced acute bronchiolitis, RSV-infected nBreg cell
      frequencies correlated with increased viral load and decreased blood memory Th1
      cell frequencies. Thus, the frequency of nBreg cells is predictive of the
      severity of acute bronchiolitis disease and nBreg cell activity may constitute an
      early-life host response that favors microbial pathogenesis.

AB  - Adipose tissue has a dynamic immune system that adapts to changes in diet and
      maintains homeostatic tissue remodeling. Adipose type 1 innate lymphoid cells
      (AT1-ILCs) promote pro-inflammatory macrophages in obesity, but little is known
      about their functions at steady state. Here we found that human and murine
      adipose tissue harbor heterogeneous populations of AT1-ILCs. Experiments using
      parabiotic mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed differential trafficking of
      AT1-ILCs, particularly in response to short- and long-term HFD and diet
      restriction. At steady state, AT1-ILCs displayed cytotoxic activity toward
      adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Depletion of AT1-ILCs and perforin deficiency 
      resulted in alterations in the ratio of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory ATMs,
      and adoptive transfer of AT1-ILCs exacerbated metabolic disorder. Diet-induced
      obesity impaired AT1-ILC killing ability. Our findings reveal a role for AT1-ILCs
      in regulating ATM homeostasis through cytotoxicity and suggest that this function
      is relevant in both homeostasis and metabolic disease.

AB  - Variants of the CFH gene, encoding complement factor H (CFH), show strong
      association with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of
      blindness. Here, we used murine models of AMD to examine the contribution of CFH 
      to disease etiology. Cfh deletion protected the mice from the pathogenic
      subretinal accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes (MP) that characterize AMD and 
      showed accelerated resolution of inflammation. MP persistence arose secondary to 
      binding of CFH to CD11b, which obstructed the homeostatic elimination of MPs from
      the subretinal space mediated by thrombospsondin-1 (TSP-1) activation of CD47.
      The AMD-associated CFH(H402) variant markedly increased this inhibitory effect on
      microglial cells, supporting a causal link to disease etiology. This mechanism is
      not restricted to the eye, as similar results were observed in a model of acute
      sterile peritonitis. Pharmacological activation of CD47 accelerated resolution of
      both subretinal and peritoneal inflammation, with implications for the treatment 
      of chronic inflammatory disease.

AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases are influenced by dysregulation of cytokines. Among
      them, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is crucial for
      the pathogenic function of T cells in preclinical models of autoimmunity. To
      study the impact of dysregulated GM-CSF expression in vivo, we generated a
      transgenic mouse line allowing the induction of GM-CSF expression in mature,
      peripheral helper T (Th) cells. Antigen-independent GM-CSF release led to the
      invasion of inflammatory myeloid cells into the central nervous system (CNS),
      which was accompanied by the spontaneous development of severe neurological
      deficits. CNS-invading phagocytes produced reactive oxygen species and exhibited 
      a distinct genetic signature compared to myeloid cells invading other organs. We 
      propose that the CNS is particularly vulnerable to the attack of monocyte-derived
      phagocytes and that the effector functions of GM-CSF-expanded myeloid cells are
      in turn guided by the tissue microenvironment.

AB  - Fibroblasts are major contributors to and regulators of inflammation and dominant
      producers of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid
      arthritis. Yet, compared to leukocytes, the regulation of inflammatory pathways
      in fibroblasts is largely unknown. Here, we report that analyses of genes
      coordinately upregulated with IL-6 pointed to STAT4 and leukemia inhibitory
      factor (LIF) as potentially linked. Gene silencing revealed that STAT4 was
      required for IL-6 transcription. STAT4 was recruited to the IL-6 promoter after
      fibroblast activation, and LIF receptor (LIFR) and STAT4 formed a molecular
      complex that, together with JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, controlled STAT4 activation.
      Importantly, a positive feedback loop involving autocrine LIF, LIFR, and STAT4
      drove sustained IL-6 transcription. Besides IL-6, this autorine loop also drove
      the production of other key inflammatory factors including IL-8,
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-33, IL-11, IL-1alpha, and
      IL-1beta. These findings define the transcriptional regulation of
      fibroblast-mediated inflammation as distinct from leukocytes.

AB  - Response to immune checkpoint blockade in mesenchymal tumors is poorly
      characterized, but immunogenomic dissection of these cancers could inform
      immunotherapy mediators. We identified a treatment-naive patient who has
      metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma and has experienced complete tumor remission
      for >2 years on anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) monotherapy. We analyzed the primary
      tumor, the sole treatment-resistant metastasis, and germline tissue to explore
      mechanisms of immunotherapy sensitivity and resistance. Both tumors stained
      diffusely for PD-L2 and showed sparse PD-L1 staining. PD-1(+) cell infiltration
      significantly decreased in the resistant tumor (p = 0.039). Genomically, the
      treatment-resistant tumor uniquely harbored biallelic PTEN loss and had reduced
      expression of two neoantigens that demonstrated strong immunoreactivity with
      patient T cells in vitro, suggesting long-lasting immunological memory. In this
      near-complete response to PD-1 blockade in a mesenchymal tumor, we identified
      PTEN mutations and reduced expression of genes encoding neoantigens as potential 
      mediators of resistance to immune checkpoint therapy.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthropathy. The
      majority of evidence, derived from genetics, tissue analyses, models, and
      clinical studies, points to an immune-mediated etiology associated with stromal
      tissue dysregulation that together propogate chronic inflammation and articular
      destruction. A pre-RA phase lasting months to years may be characterized by the
      presence of circulating autoantibodies, increasing concentration and range of
      inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and altered metabolism. Clinical disease
      onset comprises synovitis and systemic comorbidities affecting the vasculature,
      metabolism, and bone. Targeted immune therapeutics and aggressive treatment
      strategies have substantially improved clinical outcomes and informed
      pathogenetic understanding, but no cure as yet exists. Herein we review recent
      data that support intriguing models of disease pathogenesis. They allude to the
      possibility of restoration of immunologic homeostasis and thus a state of
      tolerance associated with drug-free remission. This target represents a bold
      vision for the future of RA therapeutics.

AB  - A recent unprecedented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has been
      associated with microcephaly and other congenital malformations in infants as
      well as Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. The development of a safe and
      effective ZIKV vaccine is therefore an urgent global health priority. Promising
      data from preclinical vaccine studies in mice and monkeys suggest that an
      effective vaccine will likely be possible, but important scientific challenges
      remain. Here we review the current state of ZIKV vaccine development. We discuss 
      different vaccination strategies and we highlight challenges facing clinical
      evaluation of ZIKV vaccine candidates.

      co-stimulatory signals are rare. In this issue of Immunity, Brewitz et al. (2017)
      show that chemokines secreted by CD8(+) T cells recruit myeloid and plasmacytoid 
      DCs that in turn boost CD8(+) T cell activation.

TI  - CD49a Expression Defines Tissue-Resident CD8(+) T Cells Poised for Cytotoxic
      Function in Human Skin.

AB  - Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells form a heterogeneous population that
      provides localized protection against pathogens. Here, we identify CD49a as a
      marker that differentiates CD8(+) Trm cells on a compartmental and functional
      basis. In human skin epithelia, CD8(+)CD49a(+) Trm cells produced
      interferon-gamma, whereas CD8(+)CD49a(-) Trm cells produced interleukin-17
      (IL-17). In addition, CD8(+)CD49a(+) Trm cells from healthy skin rapidly induced 
      the expression of the effector molecules perforin and granzyme B when stimulated 
      with IL-15, thereby promoting a strong cytotoxic response. In skin from patients 
      with vitiligo, where melanocytes are eradicated locally, CD8(+)CD49a(+) Trm cells
      that constitutively expressed perforin and granzyme B accumulated both in the
      epidermis and dermis. Conversely, CD8(+)CD49a(-) Trm cells from psoriasis lesions
      predominantly generated IL-17 responses that promote local inflammation in this
      skin disease. Overall, CD49a expression delineates CD8(+) Trm cell specialization
      in human epithelial barriers and correlates with the effector cell balance found 
      in distinct inflammatory skin diseases.

AB  - Arginase 1 (Arg1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) are immunoregulatory
      enzymes catalyzing the degradation of l-arginine and l-tryptophan, respectively, 
      resulting in local amino acid deprivation. In addition, unlike Arg1, IDO1 is also
      endowed with non-enzymatic signaling activity in dendritic cells (DCs). Despite
      considerable knowledge of their individual biology, no integrated functions of
      Arg1 and IDO1 have been reported yet. We found that IDO1 phosphorylation and
      consequent activation of IDO1 signaling in DCs was strictly dependent on prior
      expression of Arg1 and Arg1-dependent production of polyamines. Polyamines,
      either produced by DCs or released by bystander Arg1(+) myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells, conditioned DCs toward an IDO1-dependent, immunosuppressive
      phenotype via activation of the Src kinase, which has IDO1-phosphorylating
      activity. Thus our data indicate that Arg1 and IDO1 are linked by an entwined
      pathway in immunometabolism and that their joint modulation could represent an
      important target for effective immunotherapy in several disease settings.

AB  - Adaptive cellular immunity is initiated by antigen-specific interactions between 
      T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) support
      antiviral immunity by linking innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we
      examined pDC spatiotemporal dynamics during viral infection to uncover when,
      where, and how they exert their functions. We found that pDCs accumulated at
      sites of CD8(+) T cell antigen-driven activation in a CCR5-dependent fashion.
      Furthermore, activated CD8(+) T cells orchestrated the local recruitment of lymph
      node-resident XCR1 chemokine receptor-expressing DCs via secretion of the XCL1
      chemokine. Functionally, this CD8(+) T cell-mediated reorganization of the local 
      DC network allowed for the interaction and cooperation of pDCs and XCR1(+) DCs,
      thereby optimizing XCR1(+) DC maturation and cross-presentation. These data
      support a model in which CD8(+) T cells upon activation create their own optimal 
      priming microenvironment by recruiting additional DC subsets to the site of
      initial antigen recognition.

AB  - How immunity is regulated at distinct epithelial tissues that vary in microbial
      occupancy and environmental and tissue specific cues isn't clear. Dutzan et al.
      (2017) report that mechanical-derived signals, not those from micro-organisms,
      are key to maintaining interleukin-17-expressing T helper (Th17) cells at the

AB  - FoxP3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining immune
      homeostasis. Activated Treg cells undergo further differentiation into an
      effector state that highly expresses genes critical for Treg cell function,
      although how this process is coordinated on a transcriptional level is poorly
      understood. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking the transcription factor Myb
      in Treg cells succumbed to a multi-organ inflammatory disease. Myb was
      specifically expressed in, and required for the differentiation of,
      thymus-derived effector Treg cells. The combination of transcriptome and genomic 
      footprint analyses revealed that Myb directly regulated a large proportion of the
      gene expression specific to effector Treg cells, identifying Myb as a critical
      component of the gene regulatory network controlling effector Treg cell
      differentiation and function.

AB  - Despite the importance of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in inhibiting T cell
      effector activity, the mechanisms regulating its expression remain poorly
      defined. We found that the chromatin organizer special AT-rich sequence-binding
      protein-1 (Satb1) restrains PD-1 expression induced upon T cell activation by
      recruiting a nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex to Pdcd1 regulatory
      regions. Satb1 deficienct T cells exhibited a 40-fold increase in PD-1
      expression. Tumor-derived transforming growth factor beta (Tgf-beta) decreased
      Satb1 expression through binding of Smad proteins to the Satb1 promoter. Smad
      proteins also competed with the Satb1-NuRD complex for binding to Pdcd1
      enhancers, releasing Pdcd1 expression from Satb1-mediated repression,
      Satb1-deficient tumor-reactive T cells lost effector activity more rapidly than
      wild-type lymphocytes at tumor beds expressing PD-1 ligand (CD274), and these
      differences were abrogated by sustained CD274 blockade. Our findings suggest that
      Satb1 functions to prevent premature T cell exhaustion by regulating Pdcd1
      expression upon T cell activation. Dysregulation of this pathway in
      tumor-infiltrating T cells results in diminished anti-tumor immunity.

AB  - Neutrophils were among the first leukocytes described and visualized by early
      immunologists. Prominent effector functions during infection and sterile
      inflammation classically placed them low in the immune tree as rapid, mindless
      aggressors with poor regulatory functions. This view is currently under
      reassessment as we uncover new aspects of their life cycle and identify
      transcriptional and phenotypic diversity that endows them with regulatory
      properties that extend beyond their lifetime in the circulation. These properties
      are revealing unanticipated roles for neutrophils in supporting homeostasis, as
      well as complex disease states such as cancer. We focus this review on these
      emerging functions in order to define the true roles of neutrophils in
      homeostasis, immunity, and disease.

AB  - Although CD8(+) T cells provide protection against many viral infections, their
      role in Zika virus (ZIKV) immunity has not been extensively examined. In a recent
      issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Elong Ngono et al. (2017) define antigenic epitopes
      determining CD8(+) T cell immunity in murine models of ZIKV infection.

TI  - Follicular Dendritic Cell Activation by TLR Ligands Promotes Autoreactive B Cell 
      Responses.

AB  - A hallmark of autoimmunity in murine models of lupus is the formation of germinal
      centers (GCs) in lymphoid tissues where self-reactive B cells expand and
      differentiate. In the host response to foreign antigens, follicular dendritic
      cells (FDCs) maintain GCs through the uptake and cycling of complement-opsonized 
      immune complexes. Here, we examined whether FDCs retain self-antigens and the
      impact of this process in autoantibody secretion in lupus. We found that FDCs
      took up and retained self-immune complexes composed of ribonucleotide proteins,
      autoantibody, and complement. This uptake, mediated through CD21, triggered
      endosomal TLR7 and led to the secretion of interferon (IFN) alpha via an
      IRF5-dependent pathway. Blocking of FDC secretion of IFN-alpha restored B cell
      tolerance and reduced the amount of GCs and pathogenic autoantibody. Thus, FDCs
      are a critical source of the IFN-alpha driving autoimmunity in this lupus model. 
      This pathway is conserved in humans, suggesting that it may be a viable
      therapeutic target in systemic lupus erythematosus.

AB  - Elevated inflammation in the female genital tract is associated with increased
      HIV risk. Cervicovaginal bacteria modulate genital inflammation; however, their
      role in HIV susceptibility has not been elucidated. In a prospective cohort of
      young, healthy South African women, we found that individuals with diverse
      genital bacterial communities dominated by anaerobes other than Gardnerella were 
      at over 4-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV and had increased numbers of
      activated mucosal CD4(+) T cells compared to those with Lactobacillus
      crispatus-dominant communities. We identified specific bacterial taxa linked with
      reduced (L. crispatus) or elevated (Prevotella, Sneathia, and other anaerobes)
      inflammation and HIV infection and found that high-risk bacteria increased
      numbers of activated genital CD4(+) T cells in a murine model. Our results
      suggest that highly prevalent genital bacteria increase HIV risk by inducing
      mucosal HIV target cells. These findings might be leveraged to reduce HIV
      acquisition in women living in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - Immuno-surveillance networks operating at barrier sites are tuned by local tissue
      cues to ensure effective immunity. Site-specific commensal bacteria provide key
      signals ensuring host defense in the skin and gut. However, how the oral
      microbiome and tissue-specific signals balance immunity and regulation at the
      gingiva, a key oral barrier, remains minimally explored. In contrast to the skin 
      and gut, we demonstrate that gingiva-resident T helper 17 (Th17) cells developed 
      via a commensal colonization-independent mechanism. Accumulation of Th17 cells at
      the gingiva was driven in response to the physiological barrier damage that
      occurs during mastication. Physiological mechanical damage, via induction of
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) from epithelial cells, tailored effector T cell function,
      promoting increases in gingival Th17 cell numbers. These data highlight that
      diverse tissue-specific mechanisms govern education of Th17 cell responses and
      demonstrate that mechanical damage helps define the immune tone of this important
      oral barrier.

AB  - Lymphocytes circulate through lymph nodes (LN) in search for antigen in what is
      believed to be a continuous process. Here, we show that lymphocyte migration
      through lymph nodes and lymph occurred in a non-continuous, circadian manner.
      Lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes peaked at night onset, with cells leaving the
      tissue during the day. This resulted in strong oscillations in lymphocyte
      cellularity in lymph nodes and efferent lymphatic fluid. Using lineage-specific
      genetic ablation of circadian clock function, we demonstrated this to be
      dependent on rhythmic expression of promigratory factors on lymphocytes.
      Dendritic cell numbers peaked in phase with lymphocytes, with diurnal
      oscillations being present in disease severity after immunization to induce
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These rhythms were abolished by 
      genetic disruption of T cell clocks, demonstrating a circadian regulation of
      lymphocyte migration through lymph nodes with time-of-day of immunization being
      critical for adaptive immune responses weeks later.

AB  - Uncovering mechanisms that control immune responses in the resolution of
      bacterial infections is critical for the development of new therapeutic
      strategies that resolve infectious inflammation without unwanted side effects. We
      found that disruption of the vagal system in mice delayed resolution of
      Escherichia coli infection. Dissection of the right vagus decreased peritoneal
      group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) numbers and altered peritoneal macrophage
      responses. Vagotomy resulted in an inflammatory peritoneal lipid mediator profile
      characterized by reduced concentrations of pro-resolving mediators, including the
      protective immunoresolvent PCTR1, along with elevated inflammation-initiating
      eicosanoids. We found that acetylcholine upregulated the PCTR biosynthetic
      pathway in ILC3s. Administration of PCTR1 or ILC3s to vagotomized mice restored
      tissue resolution tone and host responses to E. coli infections. Together these
      findings elucidate a host protective mechanism mediated by ILC3-derived
      pro-resolving circuit, including PCTR1, that is controlled by local neuronal
      output to regulate tissue resolution tone and myeloid cell responses.

AB  - The cell fate decision between interferon-producing plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and
      antigen-presenting classical DC (cDC) is controlled by the E protein
      transcription factor TCF4 (E2-2). We report that TCF4 comprises two
      transcriptional isoforms, both of which are required for optimal pDC development 
      in vitro. The long Tcf4 isoform is expressed specifically in pDCs, and its
      deletion in mice impaired pDCs development and led to the expansion of
      non-canonical CD8(+) cDCs. The expression of Tcf4 commenced in progenitors and
      was further upregulated in pDCs, correlating with stage-specific activity of
      multiple enhancer elements. A conserved enhancer downstream of Tcf4 was required 
      for its upregulation during pDC differentiation, revealing a positive feedback
      loop. The expression of Tcf4 and the resulting pDC differentiation were
      selectively sensitive to the inhibition of enhancer-binding BET protein activity.
      Thus, lineage-specifying function of E proteins is facilitated by
      lineage-specific isoform expression and by BET-dependent feedback regulation
      through distal regulatory elements.

AB  - Animal models have highlighted the importance of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in 
      multiple immune responses. However, technical limitations have hampered adequate 
      characterization of ILCs in humans. Here, we used mass cytometry including a
      broad range of surface markers and transcription factors to accurately identify
      and profile ILCs across healthy and inflamed tissue types. High dimensional
      analysis allowed for clear phenotypic delineation of ILC2 and ILC3 subsets. We
      were not able to detect ILC1 cells in any of the tissues assessed, however, we
      identified intra-epithelial (ie)ILC1-like cells that represent a broader category
      of NK cells in mucosal and non-mucosal pathological tissues. In addition, we have
      revealed the expression of phenotypic molecules that have not been previously
      described for ILCs. Our analysis shows that human ILCs are highly heterogeneous
      cell types between individuals and tissues. It also provides a global,
      comprehensive, and detailed description of ILC heterogeneity in humans across
      patients and tissues.

TI  - Reconstruction of LPS Transfer Cascade Reveals Structural Determinants within
      LBP, CD14, and TLR4-MD2 for Efficient LPS Recognition and Transfer.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of
      Gram-negative bacteria, binds Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-MD2 complex and
      activates innate immune responses. LPS transfer to TLR4-MD2 is catalyzed by both 
      LPS binding protein (LBP) and CD14. To define the sequential molecular
      interactions underlying this transfer, we reconstituted in vitro the entire LPS
      transfer process from LPS micelles to TLR4-MD2. Using electron microscopy and
      single-molecule approaches, we characterized the dynamic intermediate complexes
      for LPS transfer: LBP-LPS micelles, CD14-LBP-LPS micelle, and CD14-LPS-TLR4-MD2
      complex. A single LBP molecule bound longitudinally to LPS micelles catalyzed
      multi-rounds of LPS transfer to CD14s that rapidly dissociated from LPB-LPS
      complex upon LPS transfer via electrostatic interactions. Subsequently, the
      single LPS molecule bound to CD14 was transferred to TLR4-MD2 in a TLR4-dependent
      manner. The definition of the structural determinants of the LPS transfer cascade
      to TLR4 may enable the development of targeted therapeutics for intervention in
      LPS-induced sepsis.

AB  - Liver X receptors (LXRs) are regulators of cholesterol metabolism that also
      modulate immune responses. Inactivation of LXR alpha and beta in mice leads to
      autoimmunity; however, how the regulation of cholesterol metabolism contributes
      to autoimmunity is unclear. Here we found that cholesterol loading of CD11c(+)
      cells triggered the development of autoimmunity, whereas preventing excess lipid 
      accumulation by promoting cholesterol efflux was therapeutic. LXRbeta-deficient
      mice crossed to the hyperlipidemic ApoE-deficient background or challenged with a
      high-cholesterol diet developed autoantibodies. Cholesterol accumulation in
      lymphoid organs promoted T cell priming and stimulated the production of the B
      cell growth factors Baff and April. Conversely, B cell expansion and the
      development of autoantibodies in ApoE/LXR-beta-deficient mice was reversed by
      ApoA-I expression. These findings implicate cholesterol imbalance as a
      contributor to immune dysfunction and suggest that stimulating HDL-dependent
      reverse cholesterol transport could be beneficial in the setting of autoimmune
      disease.

AB  - Particulate pollution is thought to function as an adjuvant that can induce
      allergic responses. However, the exact cell types and immunological factors that 
      initiate the lung-specific immune responses are unclear. We found that upon
      intratracheal instillation, particulates such as aluminum salts and silica killed
      alveolar macrophages (AMs), which then released interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha)
      and caused inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) formation in the
      lung. IL-1alpha release continued for up to 2 weeks after particulate exposure,
      and type-2 allergic immune responses were induced by the inhalation of antigen
      during IL-1alpha release and iBALT formation, even long after particulate
      instillation. Recombinant IL-1alpha was sufficient to induce iBALTs, which
      coincided with subsequent immunoglobulin E responses, and IL-1-receptor-deficient
      mice failed to induce iBALT formation. Therefore, the AM-IL-1alpha-iBALT axis
      might be a therapeutic target for particulate-induced allergic inflammation.

TI  - The Heterogeneity of Ly6C(hi) Monocytes Controls Their Differentiation into
      iNOS(+) Macrophages or Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells.

AB  - Inflammation triggers the differentiation of Ly6C(hi) monocytes into microbicidal
      macrophages or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Yet, it is unclear
      whether environmental inflammatory cues control the polarization of monocytes
      toward each of these fates or whether specialized monocyte progenitor subsets
      exist before inflammation. Here, we have shown that naive monocytes are
      phenotypically heterogeneous and contain an NR4A1- and Flt3L-independent,
      CCR2-dependent, Flt3(+)CD11c(-)MHCII(+)PU.1(hi) subset. This subset acted as a
      precursor for FcgammaRIII(+)PD-L2(+)CD209a(+), GM-CSF-dependent moDCs but was
      distal from the DC lineage, as shown by fate-mapping experiments using Zbtb46. By
      contrast, Flt3(-)CD11c(-)MHCII(-)PU.1(lo) monocytes differentiated into
      FcgammaRIII(+)PD-L2(-)CD209a(-)iNOS(+) macrophages upon microbial stimulation.
      Importantly, Sfpi1 haploinsufficiency genetically distinguished the precursor
      activities of monocytes toward moDCs or microbicidal macrophages. Indeed,
      Sfpi1(+/-) mice had reduced Flt3(+)CD11c(-)MHCII(+) monocytes and
      GM-CSF-dependent FcgammaRIII(+)PD-L2(+)CD209a(+) moDCs but generated iNOS(+)
      macrophages more efficiently. Therefore, intercellular disparities of PU.1
      expression within naive monocytes segregate progenitor activity for inflammatory 
      iNOS(+) macrophages or moDCs.

AB  - New technologies have been propelling dramatic increases in the volume and
      diversity of large-scale public data, which can potentially be reused to answer
      questions beyond those originally envisioned. However, this often requires
      computational and statistical skills beyond the reach of most bench scientists.
      The development of educational and accessible computational tools is thus
      critical, as are crowdsourcing efforts that utilize the community's expertise to 
      curate public data for hypothesis generation and testing. Here we review the
      history of public-data reuse and argue for greater incorporation of computational
      and statistical sciences into the biomedical education curriculum and the
      development of biologist-friendly crowdsourcing tools. Finally, we provide a
      resource list for the reuse of public data and highlight an illustrative
      crowdsourcing exercise to explore public gene-expression data of human autoimmune
      diseases and corresponding mouse models. Through education, tool development, and
      community engagement, immunologists will be poised to transform public data into 
      biological insights.

AB  - It is known that young children exposed to allergens are prone to develop asthma 
      later in life. In this issue of Immunity, de Kleer et al. (2016) identify IL-33
      as a key player in the developing lung for sensitization to environmental

TI  - CD8(+) T Cells Utilize Highly Dynamic Enhancer Repertoires and Regulatory

AB  - Differentiation of effector and memory CD8(+) T cells is accompanied by extensive
      changes in the transcriptome and histone modifications at gene promoters;
      however, the enhancer repertoire and associated gene regulatory networks are
      poorly defined. Using histone mark chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
      deep sequencing, we mapped the enhancer and super-enhancer landscapes in
      antigen-specific naive, differentiated effector, and central memory CD8(+) T
      cells during LCMV infection. Epigenomics-based annotation revealed a highly
      dynamic repertoire of enhancers, which were inherited, de novo activated,
      decommissioned and re-activated during CD8(+) T cell responses. We employed a
      computational algorithm to pair enhancers with target gene promoters. On average,
      each enhancer targeted three promoters and each promoter was regulated by two
      enhancers. By identifying enriched transcription factor motifs in enhancers, we
      defined transcriptional regulatory circuitry at each CD8(+) T cell response
      stage. These multi-dimensional datasets provide a blueprint for delineating
      molecular mechanisms underlying functional differentiation of CD8(+) T cells.

AB  - Programmed death and shedding of epithelial cells is a powerful defense mechanism
      to reduce bacterial burden during infection but this activity cannot be
      indiscriminate because of the critical barrier function of the epithelium. We
      report that during cystitis, shedding of infected bladder epithelial cells (BECs)
      was preceded by the recruitment of mast cells (MCs) directly underneath the
      superficial epithelium where they docked and extruded their granules. MCs were
      responding to interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secreted by BECs after inflammasome
      and caspase-1 signaling. Upon uptake of granule-associated chymase (mouse MC
      protease 4 [mMCPT4]), BECs underwent caspase-1-associated cytolysis and
      exfoliation. Thus, infected epithelial cells require a specific cue for cytolysis
      from recruited sentinel inflammatory cells before shedding.

AB  - Allergic disease originates in early life and polymorphisms in interleukin-33
      gene (IL33) and IL1RL1, coding for IL-33R and decoy receptor sST2, confer allergy
      risk. Early life T helper 2 (Th2) cell skewing and allergy susceptibility are
      often seen as remnants of feto-maternal symbiosis. Here we report that shortly
      after birth, innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2s), eosinophils, basophils, and
      mast cells spontaneously accumulated in developing lungs in an IL-33-dependent
      manner. During the phase of postnatal lung alveolarization, house dust mite
      exposure further increased IL-33, which boosted cytokine production in ILC2s and 
      activated CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs). IL-33 suppressed IL-12p35 and induced
      OX40L in neonatal DCs, thus promoting Th2 cell skewing. Decoy sST2 had a strong
      preventive effect on asthma in the neonatal period, less so in adulthood. Thus,
      enhanced neonatal Th2 cell skewing to inhaled allergens results from postnatal
      hyperactivity of the IL-33 axis during a period of maximal lung remodeling.

AB  - In response to acute infection, naive CD8(+) T cells expand, differentiate into
      effector cells, and then contract to a long-lived pool of memory cells after
      pathogen clearance. During chronic infections or in tumors, CD8(+) T cells
      acquire an "exhausted" phenotype. Here we present genome-wide comparisons of
      chromatin accessibility and gene expression from endogenous CD8(+) T cells
      responding to acute and chronic viral infection using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq
      techniques. Acquisition of effector, memory, or exhausted phenotypes was
      associated with stable changes in chromatin accessibility away from the naive T
      cell state. Regions differentially accessible between functional subsets in vivo 
      were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors known to regulate these 
      subsets, including E2A, BATF, IRF4, T-bet, and TCF1. Exhaustion-specific
      accessible regions were enriched for consensus binding sites for NFAT and Nr4a
      family members, indicating that chronic stimulation confers a unique
      accessibility profile on exhausted cells.

      Subsets with Distinct Roles in Immune Surveillance and Homeostasis.

AB  - Infections induce pathogen-specific T cell differentiation into diverse effectors
      (Teff) that give rise to memory (Tmem) subsets. The cell-fate decisions and
      lineage relationships that underlie these transitions are poorly understood.
      Here, we found that the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 identifies three distinct
      CD8(+) Teff and Tmem subsets. Classical central (Tcm) and effector memory (Tem)
      cells and their corresponding Teff precursors were CX3CR1(-) and CX3CR1(high),
      respectively. Viral infection also induced a numerically stable CX3CR1(int)
      subset that represented approximately 15% of blood-borne Tmem cells. CX3CR1(int) 
      Tmem cells underwent more frequent homeostatic divisions than other Tmem subsets 
      and not only self-renewed, but also contributed to the expanding CX3CR1(-) Tcm
      pool. Both Tcm and CX3CR1(int) cells homed to lymph nodes, but CX3CR1(int) cells,
      and not Tem cells, predominantly surveyed peripheral tissues. As CX3CR1(int) Tmem
      cells present unique phenotypic, homeostatic, and migratory properties, we
      designate this subset peripheral memory (tpm) cells and propose that tpm cells
      are chiefly responsible for the global surveillance of non-lymphoid tissues.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renew in bone marrow niches formed by
      mesenchymal progenitors and endothelial cells expressing the chemokine CXCL12,
      but whether a separate niche instructs multipotent progenitor (MPP)
      differentiation remains unclear. We show that MPPs resided in HSC niches, where
      they encountered lineage-instructive differentiation signals. Conditional
      deletion of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in MPPs reduced differentiation into
      common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), which decreased lymphopoiesis. CXCR4 was
      required for CLP positioning near Interleukin-7(+) (IL-7) cells and for optimal
      IL-7 receptor signaling. IL-7(+) cells expressed CXCL12 and the cytokine SCF,
      were mesenchymal progenitors capable of differentiation into osteoblasts and
      adipocytes, and comprised a minor subset of sinusoidal endothelial cells.
      Conditional Il7 deletion in mesenchymal progenitors reduced B-lineage committed
      CLPs, while conditional Cxcl12 or Scf deletion from IL-7(+) cells reduced HSC and
      MPP numbers. Thus, HSC maintenance and multilineage differentiation are distinct 
      cell lineage decisions that are both controlled by HSC niches.

TI  - Positive Regulation of Lyn Kinase by CD148 Is Required for B Cell Receptor
      Signaling in B1 but Not B2 B Cells.

AB  - B1 and B2 B cells differ in their ability to respond to T-cell-independent (TI)
      antigens. Here we report that the Src-family kinase (SFK) regulator CD148 has a
      unique and critical role in the initiation of B1 but not B2 cell antigen receptor
      signaling. CD148 loss-of-function mice were found to have defective B1
      B-cell-mediated antibody responses against the T-cell-independent antigens
      NP-ficoll and Pneumovax 23 and had impaired selection of the B1 B cell receptor
      (BCR) repertoire. These deficiencies were associated with a decreased ability of 
      B1 B cells to induce BCR signaling downstream of the SFK Lyn. Notably, Lyn
      appeared to be selectively regulated by CD148 and loss of this SFK resulted in
      opposite signaling phenotypes in B1 and B2 B cells. These findings reveal that
      the function and regulation of Lyn during B1 cell BCR signaling is distinct from 
      other B cell subsets.

TI  - C-Type Lectin Receptor DCAR Recognizes Mycobacterial Phosphatidyl-Inositol
      Mannosides to Promote a Th1 Response during Infection.

AB  - Phosphatidyl-inositol mannosides (PIM) are glycolipids unique to mycobacteria and
      other related bacteria that stimulate host immune responses and are implicated in
      mycobacteria pathogenicity. Here, we found that the FcRgamma-coupled C-type
      lectin receptor DCAR (dendritic cell immunoactivating receptor; gene symbol
      Clec4b1) is a direct receptor for PIM. Mycobacteria activated reporter cells
      expressing DCAR, and delipidation of mycobacteria abolished this activity.
      Acylated PIMs purified from mycobacteria were identified as ligands for DCAR.
      DCAR was predominantly expressed in small peritoneal macrophages and
      monocyte-derived inflammatory cells in lungs and spleen. These cells produced
      monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) upon PIM treatment, and absence of
      DCAR or FcRgamma abrogated MCP-1 production. Upon mycobacterial infection,
      Clec4b1-deficient mice showed reduced numbers of monocyte-derived inflammatory
      cells at the infection site, impaired IFNgamma production by T cells, and an
      increased bacterial load. Thus, DCAR is a critical receptor for PIM that
      functions to promote T cell responses against mycobacteria.

TI  - Aire Inhibits the Generation of a Perinatal Population of
      Interleukin-17A-Producing gammadelta T Cells to Promote Immunologic Tolerance.

AB  - Aire's primary mechanism of action is to regulate transcription of a battery of
      genes in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and, consequently, negative
      selection of effector T cells and positive selection of regulatory T cells. We
      found that Aire-deficient mice had expanded thymic and peripheral populations of 
      perinatally generated IL-17A(+)Vgamma6(+)Vdelta1(+) T cells, considered to be
      "early responders" to tissue stress and drivers of inflammatory reactions.
      Aire-dependent control of Il7 expression in mTECs regulated the size of thymic
      IL-17A(+)Vgamma6(+)Vdelta1(+) compartments. In mice lacking Aire and gammadelta T
      cells, certain tissues typically targeted in the "Aire-less" disease, notably the
      retina, were only minimally infiltrated. IL-17A(+)Vgamma6(+)Vdelta1(+) cells were
      present in the retina of wild-type mice and expanded very early in Aire-deficient
      mice. A putatively parallel population of IL-17A(+)Vgamma9(+)Vdelta2(+) T cells
      was increased in humans lacking Aire. Thus, Aire exerts multi-faceted autoimmune 
      control that extends to a population of innate-like T cells.

AB  - T cells rapidly undergo contraction upon viral clearance, but how T cell function
      and fate are determined during this phase is unclear. During the contraction
      phase of an acute infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, we found
      that virus-specific CD8(+) T cells within the splenic red pulp (RP) had higher
      two-dimensional (2D) effective affinity than those within the white pulp (WP).
      This increased antigen recognition of RP-derived CD8(+) T cells correlated with
      more efficient target cell killing and improved control of viremia. FoxP3(+)
      regulatory T cells and cytokine TGF-beta limited the 2D-affinity in the WP during
      the contraction phase. Anatomical location drove gene expression patterns in
      CD8(+) T cells that led to preferential differentiation of memory precursor WP T 
      cells into long-term memory cells. These results highlight that intricate
      regulation of T cell function and fate is determined by anatomic
      compartmentalization during the early immune contraction phase.

AB  - The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was initially
      classified as a hematopoietic growth factor. However, unlike its close relatives 
      macrophage CSF (M-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), the majority of myeloid cells
      do not require GM-CSF for steady-state myelopoiesis. Instead, in inflammation,
      GM-CSF serves as a communication conduit between tissue-invading lymphocytes and 
      myeloid cells. Even though lymphocytes are in all likelihood the instigators of
      chronic inflammatory disease, GM-CSF-activated phagocytes are well equipped to
      cause tissue damage. The pivotal role of GM-CSF at the T cell:myeloid cell
      interface might shift our attention toward studying the function of the myeloid
      compartment in immunopathology. Targeting specifically the crosstalk between T
      cells and myeloid cells through GM-CSF holds promise for the development of
      therapeutics to combat chronic tissue inflammation. Here, we will review some of 
      the major discoveries of the recent past, which indicate that GM-CSF is so much
      more than its name suggests.

      functions to sub-populations using conventional loss-of-function approaches. In
      this issue of Immunity, Thomas et al. (2016) highlight the value of excising

AB  - Genetically modified T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      demonstrate potent clinical antitumor effects in a variety of blood cancers.
      However, clinical activity in solid tumors has been disappointing and toxicity
      has been a serious concern (Lamers et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2010). We
      recently found that a CAR composed of a scFv antibody fragment specific for the
      Tn-glycoform of MUC1 had potent activity in preclinical models of blood cancer
      and adenocarcinoma (Posey et al., 2016).

AB  - We read with interest the manuscript by June and colleagues published recently in
      Immunity in which they describe targeting of aberrantly glycosylated
      tumor-associated cell membrane mucin MUC1 using chimeric antigen
      receptor-engineered human T cells (Posey et al., 2016). In that study, the
      authors used a second generation 4-1BB costimulatory-molecule-based chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) (Imai et al., 2004) in which targeting was achieved using 
      a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from the 5E5 antibody. This CAR
      selectively binds MUC1 that carries the Tn or sialyl (S)Tn glycan. Both of these 
      truncated glycans are aberrantly expressed on the MUC1 glycoprotein in a spectrum
      of malignancies and consequently represent attractive targets for
      immunotherapeutic exploitation.

AB  - Cell-to-cell expression variation (CEV) is a prevalent feature of even
      well-defined cell populations, but its functions, particularly at the organismal 
      level, are not well understood. Using single-cell data obtained via
      high-dimensional flow cytometry of T cells as a model, we introduce an analysis
      framework for quantifying CEV in primary cell populations and studying its
      functional associations in human cohorts. Analyses of 840 CEV phenotypes spanning
      multiple baseline measurements of 14 proteins in 28 T cell subpopulations suggest
      that the quantitative extent of CEV can exhibit substantial subject-to-subject
      differences and yet remain stable within healthy individuals over months. We
      linked CEV to age and disease-associated genetic polymorphisms, thus implicating 
      CEV as a biomarker of aging and disease susceptibility and suggesting that it
      might play an important role in health and disease. Our dataset, interactive
      figures, and software for computing CEV with flow cytometry data provide a
      resource for exploring CEV functions.

AB  - The impact of epigenetics on the differentiation of memory T (Tmem) cells is
      poorly defined. We generated deep epigenomes comprising genome-wide profiles of
      DNA methylation, histone modifications, DNA accessibility, and coding and
      non-coding RNA expression in naive, central-, effector-, and terminally
      differentiated CD45RA(+) CD4(+) Tmem cells from blood and CD69(+) Tmem cells from
      bone marrow (BM-Tmem). We observed a progressive and proliferation-associated
      global loss of DNA methylation in heterochromatic parts of the genome during Tmem
      cell differentiation. Furthermore, distinct gradually changing signatures in the 
      epigenome and the transcriptome supported a linear model of memory development in
      circulating T cells, while tissue-resident BM-Tmem branched off with a unique
      epigenetic profile. Integrative analyses identified candidate master regulators
      of Tmem cell differentiation, including the transcription factor FOXP1. This
      study highlights the importance of epigenomic changes for Tmem cell biology and
      demonstrates the value of epigenetic data for the identification of lineage
      regulators.

AB  - Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) can suppress effector T cells 
      specific for tumor antigens. Deeper molecular definitions of
      tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes could thus offer therapeutic opportunities.
      Transcriptomes of T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and Treg cells infiltrating colorectal 
      or non-small-cell lung cancers were compared to transcriptomes of the same
      subsets from normal tissues and validated at the single-cell level. We found that
      tumor-infiltrating Treg cells were highly suppressive, upregulated several
      immune-checkpoints, and expressed on the cell surfaces specific signature
      molecules such as interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL1R2), programmed death (PD)-1
      Ligand1, PD-1 Ligand2, and CCR8 chemokine, which were not previously described on
      Treg cells. Remarkably, high expression in whole-tumor samples of Treg cell
      signature genes, such as LAYN, MAGEH1, or CCR8, correlated with poor prognosis.
      Our findings provide insights into the molecular identity and functions of human 
      tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and define potential targets for tumor
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells reside in lymphoid organs and barrier tissues where
      they control different types of inflammatory responses. Treg cells are also found
      in human cancers, and studies in animal models suggest that they contribute to
      cancer progression. However, properties of human intratumoral Treg cells and
      those present in corresponding normal tissue remain largely unknown. Here, we
      analyzed features of Treg cells in untreated human breast carcinomas, normal
      mammary gland, and peripheral blood. Tumor-resident Treg cells were potently
      suppressive and their gene-expression pattern resembled that of normal breast
      tissue, but not of activated peripheral blood Treg cells. Nevertheless, a number 
      of cytokine and chemokine receptor genes, most notably CCR8, were upregulated in 
      tumor-resident Treg cells in comparison to normal tissue-resident ones. Our
      studies suggest that targeting CCR8 for the depletion of tumor-resident Treg
      cells might represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of
      breast cancer.

AB  - Detailed studies of the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that underlie the
      best available examples of the humoral immune response to HIV are providing
      important information for the development of therapies and prophylaxis for HIV-1 
      infection. Here, we report a CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibody, named N6, that
      potently neutralized 98% of HIV-1 isolates, including 16 of 20 that were
      resistant to other members of its class. N6 evolved a mode of recognition such
      that its binding was not impacted by the loss of individual contacts across the
      immunoglobulin heavy chain. In addition, structural analysis revealed that the
      orientation of N6 permitted it to avoid steric clashes with glycans, which is a
      common mechanism of resistance. Thus, an HIV-1-specific bNAb can achieve potent, 
      near-pan neutralization of HIV-1, making it an attractive candidate for use in
      therapy and prophylaxis.

      Th17 Cell Migration to the Kidney.

AB  - Th17 cells are most abundant in the gut, where their presence depends on the
      intestinal microbiota. Here, we examined whether intestinal Th17 cells contribute
      to extra-intestinal Th17 responses in autoimmune kidney disease. We found high
      frequencies of Th17 cells in the kidneys of patients with antineutrophil
      cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis. We utilized
      photoconversion of intestinal cells in Kaede mice to track intestinal T cell
      mobilization upon glomerulonephritis induction, and we found that Th17 cells
      egress from the gut in a S1P-receptor-1-dependent fashion and subsequently
      migrate to the kidney via the CCL20/CCR6 axis. Depletion of intestinal Th17 cells
      in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated renal disease, whereas
      expansion of these cells upon Citrobacter rodentium infection exacerbated
      pathology. Thus, in some autoimmune settings, intestinal Th17 cells migrate into 
      target organs, where they contribute to pathology. Targeting the intestinal Th17 
      cell "reservoir" may present a therapeutic strategy for these autoimmune
      disorders.

TI  - PGRP-SD, an Extracellular Pattern-Recognition Receptor, Enhances
      Peptidoglycan-Mediated Activation of the Drosophila Imd Pathway.

AB  - Activation of the innate immune response in Metazoans is initiated through the
      recognition of microbes by host pattern-recognition receptors. In Drosophila,
      diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-containing peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria is
      detected by the transmembrane receptor PGRP-LC and by the intracellular receptor 
      PGRP-LE. Here, we show that PGRP-SD acted upstream of PGRP-LC as an extracellular
      receptor to enhance peptidoglycan-mediated activation of Imd signaling.
      Consistent with this, PGRP-SD mutants exhibited impaired activation of the Imd
      pathway and increased susceptibility to DAP-type bacteria. PGRP-SD enhanced the
      localization of peptidoglycans to the cell surface and hence promoted signaling. 
      Moreover, PGRP-SD antagonized the action of PGRP-LB, an extracellular negative
      regulator, to fine-tune the intensity of the immune response. These data reveal
      that Drosophila PGRP-SD functions as an extracellular receptor similar to
      mammalian CD14 and demonstrate that, comparable to lipopolysaccharide sensing in 
      mammals, Drosophila relies on both intra- and extracellular receptors for the
      detection of bacteria.

TI  - Macrophage PPARgamma, a Lipid Activated Transcription Factor Controls the Growth 
      Factor GDF3 and Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.
PG  - 1038-1051
LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2016.10.016 [doi]
AB  - Tissue regeneration requires inflammatory and reparatory activity of macrophages.
      Macrophages detect and eliminate the damaged tissue and subsequently promote
      regeneration. This dichotomy requires the switch of effector functions of
      macrophages coordinated with other cell types inside the injured tissue. The gene
      regulatory events supporting the sensory and effector functions of macrophages
      involved in tissue repair are not well understood. Here we show that the lipid
      activated transcription factor, PPARgamma, is required for proper skeletal muscle
      regeneration, acting in repair macrophages. PPARgamma controls the expression of 
      the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family member, GDF3, which in turn
      regulates the restoration of skeletal muscle integrity by promoting muscle
      progenitor cell fusion. This work establishes PPARgamma as a required metabolic
      sensor and transcriptional regulator of repair macrophages. Moreover, this work
      also establishes GDF3 as a secreted extrinsic effector protein acting on
      myoblasts and serving as an exclusively macrophage-derived regeneration factor in
      tissue repair.

AB  - Extensive metabolic changes accompany T cell activation, including a switch to
      glycolytic energy production and increased biosynthesis. Recent studies suggest
      that subsequent return to reliance on oxidative phosphorylation and increasing
      spare respiratory capacity are essential for the differentiation of memory CD8(+)
      T cells. In contrast, we found that constitutive glycolytic metabolism and
      suppression of oxidative phosphorylation in CD8(+) T cells, achieved by
      conditional deletion of hypoxia-inducible factor regulator Vhl, accelerated
      CD8(+) memory cell differentiation during viral infection. Despite sustained
      glycolysis, CD8(+) memory cells emerged that upregulated key memory-associated
      cytokine receptors and transcription factors and showed a heightened response to 
      secondary challenge. In addition, increased glycolysis not only permitted memory 
      formation, but it also favored the formation of long-lived effector-memory CD8(+)
      T cells. These data redefine the role of cellular metabolism in memory cell
      differentiation, showing that reliance on glycolytic metabolism does not hinder
      formation of a protective memory population.

TI  - Deleting an Nr4a1 Super-Enhancer Subdomain Ablates Ly6C(low) Monocytes while
      Preserving Macrophage Gene Function.

AB  - Mononuclear phagocytes are a heterogeneous family that occupy all tissues and
      assume numerous roles to support tissue function and systemic homeostasis. Our
      ability to dissect the roles of individual subsets is limited by a lack of
      technologies that ablate gene function within specific mononuclear phagocyte
      sub-populations. Using Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C(low) monocytes, we present a
      proof-of-principle approach that addresses these limitations. Combining ChIP-seq 
      and molecular approaches we identified a single, conserved, sub-domain within the
      Nr4a1 enhancer that was essential for Ly6C(low) monocyte development. Mice
      lacking this enhancer lacked Ly6C(low) monocytes but retained Nr4a1 gene
      expression in macrophages during steady state and in response to LPS. Because
      Nr4a1 regulates inflammatory gene expression and differentiation of Ly6C(low)
      monocytes, decoupling these processes allows Ly6C(low) monocytes to be studied
      independently.

AB  - The extrafollicular (EF) plasmablast response to self-antigens that contain
      Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands is prominent in murine lupus models and some
      bacterial infections, but the inhibitors and activators involved have not been
      fully delineated. Here, we used two conventional dendritic cell (cDC) depletion
      systems to investigate the role of cDCs on a classical TLR-dependent autoreactive
      EF response elicited in rheumatoid-factor B cells by DNA-containing immune
      complexes. Contrary to our hypothesis, cDC depletion amplified rather than
      dampened the EF response in Fas-intact but not Fas-deficient mice. Further, we
      demonstrated that cDC-dependent regulation requires Fas and Fas ligand (FasL)
      expression by T cells, but not Fas expression by B cells. Thus, cDCs activate
      FasL-expressing T cells that regulate Fas-expressing extrafollicular helper T
      (Tefh) cells. These studies reveal a regulatory role for cDCs in B cell
      plasmablast responses and provide a mechanistic explanation for the excess
      autoantibody production observed in Fas deficiency.

AB  - Type I interferon (IFN) is critical for controlling pathogen infection; however, 
      its regulatory mechanisms in plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) still remain unclear.
      Here, we have shown that nucleic acid sensors cGAS-, STING-, MDA5-, MAVS-, or
      transcription factor IRF3-deficient mice produced high amounts of type I
      IFN-alpha and IFN-beta (IFN-alpha/beta) in the serum and were resistant to lethal
      plasmodium yoelii YM infection. Robust IFN-alpha/beta production was abolished
      when gene encoding nucleic acid sensor TLR7, signaling adaptor MyD88, or
      transcription factor IRF7 was ablated or pDCs were depleted. Further, we
      identified SOCS1 as a key negative regulator to inhibit MyD88-dependent type I
      IFN signaling in pDCs. Finally, we have demonstrated that pDCs, cDCs, and
      macrophages were required for generating IFN-alpha/beta-induced subsequent
      protective immunity. Thus, our findings have identified a critical regulatory
      mechanism of type I IFN signaling in pDCs and stage-specific function of immune
      cells in generating potent immunity against lethal YM infection.

TI  - Immunomodulatory Functions of BTLA and HVEM Govern Induction of Extrathymic
      Regulatory T Cells and Tolerance by Dendritic Cells.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate immunity and also antigen-specific tolerance
      mediated by extrathymic regulatory T (Treg) cells, yet it remains unclear how DCs
      regulate induction of such tolerance. Here, we report that efficient induction of
      Treg cells was instructed by BTLA(+)DEC205(+)CD8(+)CD11c(+) DCs and the
      immunomodulatory functions of BTLA. In contrast, T cell activation in steady
      state by total CD11c(+) DCs that include a majority of DCs that do not express
      BTLA did not induce Treg cells and had no lasting impact on subsequent immune
      responses. Engagement of HVEM, a receptor of BTLA, promoted Foxp3 expression in T
      cells through upregulation of CD5. In contrast, T cells activated in the absence 
      of BTLA and HVEM-mediated functions remained CD5(lo) and therefore failed to
      resist the inhibition of Foxp3 expression in response to effector
      cell-differentiating cytokines. Thus, DCs require BTLA and CD5-dependent
      mechanisms to actively adjust tolerizing T cell responses under steady-state
      conditions.

TI  - Antiviral CD8(+) T Cells Restricted by Human Leukocyte Antigen Class II Exist
      during Natural HIV Infection and Exhibit Clonal Expansion.

AB  - CD8(+) T cell recognition of virus-infected cells is characteristically
      restricted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, although rare
      examples of MHC class II restriction have been reported in Cd4-deficient mice and
      a macaque SIV vaccine trial using a recombinant cytomegalovirus vector. Here, we 
      demonstrate the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-restricted
      CD8(+) T cell responses with antiviral properties in a small subset of
      HIV-infected individuals. In these individuals, T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta)
      analysis revealed that class II-restricted CD8(+) T cells underwent clonal
      expansion and mediated killing of HIV-infected cells. In one case, these cells
      comprised 12% of circulating CD8(+) T cells, and TCRalpha analysis revealed two
      distinct co-expressed TCRalpha chains, with only one contributing to binding of
      the class II HLA-peptide complex. These data indicate that class II-restricted
      CD8(+) T cell responses can exist in a chronic human viral infection, and may
      contribute to immune control.

AB  - Lymph node (LN) expansion during an immune response relies on the transient
      remodeling of its vasculature. Although the mechanisms driving LN endothelial
      cell division are beginning to be understood, a comprehensive view of LN
      endothelial cell dynamics at the single-cell level is lacking. Here, we used
      multicolored fluorescent fate-mapping models to track the behavior of blood
      endothelial cells during LN expansion upon inflammation and subsequent return to 
      homeostasis. We found that expansion of the LN vasculature relied on the
      sequential assembly of endothelial cell proliferative units. This segmented
      growth was sustained by the clonal proliferation of high endothelial venule (HEV)
      cells, which act as local progenitors to create capillaries and HEV neo-vessels
      at the periphery of the LN. Return to homeostasis was accompanied by the
      stochastic death of pre-existing and neo-synthesized LN endothelial cells. Thus, 
      our fate-mapping studies unravel-at a single-cell level-the complex dynamics of
      vascular-tree remodeling during LN expansion and contraction.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in humans triggers formation of granulomas, 
      which are tightly organized immune cell aggregates that are the central structure
      of tuberculosis. Infected and uninfected macrophages interdigitate, assuming an
      altered, flattened appearance. Although pathologists have described these changes
      for over a century, the molecular and cellular programs underlying this
      transition are unclear. Here, using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, we
      found that mycobacterial granuloma formation is accompanied by macrophage
      induction of canonical epithelial molecules and structures. We identified
      fundamental macrophage reprogramming events that parallel E-cadherin-dependent
      mesenchymal-epithelial transitions. Macrophage-specific disruption of E-cadherin 
      function resulted in disordered granuloma formation, enhanced immune cell access,
      decreased bacterial burden, and increased host survival, suggesting that the
      granuloma can also serve a bacteria-protective role. Granuloma macrophages in
      humans with tuberculosis were similarly transformed. Thus, during mycobacterial
      infection, granuloma macrophages are broadly reprogrammed by epithelial modules, 
      and this reprogramming alters the trajectory of infection and the associated
      immune response.

AB  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a CD4(+) T cell subset critical for
      long-lived humoral immunity. We hypothesized that integrins play a decisive role 
      in Tfh cell biology. Here we show that Tfh cells expressed a highly active form
      of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) that was required for their
      survival within the germinal center niche. In addition, LFA-1 promoted expression
      of Bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor critical for Tfh cell differentiation, and 
      inhibition of LFA-1 abolished Tfh cell generation and prevented protective
      humoral immunity to intestinal helminth infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated
      that expression of Talin-1, an adaptor protein that regulates LFA-1 affinity,
      dictated Tfh versus Th2 effector cell differentiation. Collectively, our results 
      define unique functions for LFA-1 in the Tfh cell effector program and suggest
      that integrin activity is important in lineage decision-making events in the
      adaptive immune system.

      for Macrophage Alternative Activation.

AB  - Macrophage activation status is intrinsically linked to metabolic remodeling.
      Macrophages stimulated by interleukin 4 (IL-4) to become alternatively (or, M2)
      activated increase fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation; these
      metabolic changes are critical for M2 activation. Enhanced glucose utilization is
      also characteristic of the M2 metabolic signature. Here, we found that increased 
      glucose utilization is essential for M2 activation. Increased glucose metabolism 
      in IL-4-stimulated macrophages required the activation of the mTORC2 pathway, and
      loss of mTORC2 in macrophages suppressed tumor growth and decreased immunity to a
      parasitic nematode. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) was implicated
      as a contributing upstream activator of mTORC2 in a pathway that involved PI3K
      and AKT. mTORC2 operated in parallel with the IL-4Ralpha-Stat6 pathway to
      facilitate increased glycolysis during M2 activation via the induction of the
      transcription factor IRF4. IRF4 expression required both mTORC2 and Stat6
      pathways, providing an underlying mechanism to explain how glucose utilization is
      increased to support M2 activation.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles in activating innate immune cells and
      initiating adaptive immune responses. The functions of DCs were originally
      obscured by their overlap with other mononuclear phagocytes, but new mouse models
      have allowed for the selective ablation of subsets of DCs and have helped to
      identify their non-redundant roles in the immune system. These tools have
      elucidated the functions of DCs in host defense against pathogens, autoimmunity, 
      and cancer. This review will describe the mouse models generated to interrogate
      the role of DCs and will discuss how their use has progressively clarified our
      understanding of the unique functions of DC subsets.

AB  - It has recently become apparent that the gut microbiota modulates the response to
      cancer therapy. In this issue of Immunity, Daillere et al. (2016) identified two 
      bacterial species potentiating the anti-tumor effect of cyclophosphamide that are
      kept in check by the sensor NOD2.

AB  - In tuberculosis, some macrophages in granulomas assume an epitheloid appearance. 
      Using the Mycobacterium marinum-zebrafish model, Cronan et al. (2016) now show
      that granuloma macrophages undergo reprograming events involving
      E-cadherin-dependent formation of epithelial-like cell-cell junctions.
      Interference with the function of E-cadherin in macrophages disorganized the
      granulomas and protected the fish, introducing new ideas and questions about
      macrophage function and granulomatous diseases.

AB  - Immune aging manifests with a combination of failing adaptive immunity and
      insufficiently restrained inflammation. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), T cell aging occurs prematurely, but the mechanisms involved and their
      contribution to tissue-destructive inflammation remain unclear. We found that RA 
      CD4(+) T cells showed signs of aging during their primary immune responses and
      differentiated into tissue-invasive, proinflammatory effector cells. RA T cells
      had low expression of the double-strand-break repair nuclease MRE11A, leading to 
      telomeric damage, juxtacentromeric heterochromatin unraveling, and senescence
      marker upregulation. Inhibition of MRE11A activity in healthy T cells induced the
      aging phenotype, whereas MRE11A overexpression in RA T cells reversed it. In
      human-synovium chimeric mice, MRE11A(low) T cells were tissue-invasive and
      pro-arthritogenic, and MRE11A reconstitution mitigated synovitis. Our findings
      link premature T cell aging and tissue-invasiveness to telomere deprotection and 
      heterochromatin unpacking, identifying MRE11A as a therapeutic target to combat
      immune aging and suppress dysregulated tissue inflammation.

TI  - Leishmania Uses Mincle to Target an Inhibitory ITAM Signaling Pathway in

AB  - C-type lectin receptors sense a diversity of endogenous and exogenous ligands
      that may trigger differential responses. Here, we have found that human and mouse
      Mincle bind to a ligand released by Leishmania, a eukaryote parasite that evades 
      an effective immune response. Mincle-deficient mice had milder dermal pathology
      and a tenth of the parasite burden compared to wild-type mice after Leishmania
      major intradermal ear infection. Mincle deficiency enhanced adaptive immunity
      against the parasite, correlating with increased activation, migration, and
      priming by Mincle-deficient dendritic cells (DCs). Leishmania triggered a
      Mincle-dependent inhibitory axis characterized by SHP1 coupling to the FcRgamma
      chain. Selective loss of SHP1 in CD11c(+) cells phenocopies enhanced adaptive
      immunity to Leishmania. In conclusion, Leishmania shifts Mincle to an inhibitory 
      ITAM (ITAMi) configuration that impairs DC activation. Thus, ITAMi can be
      exploited for immune evasion by a pathogen and may represent a paradigm for
      ITAM-coupled receptors sensing self and non-self.

AB  - The transcription factor Foxo3 plays a crucial role in myeloid cell function but 
      its role in lymphoid cells remains poorly defined. Here, we have shown that Foxo3
      expression was increased after T cell receptor engagement and played a specific
      role in the polarization of CD4(+) T cells toward pathogenic T helper 1 (Th1)
      cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte monocyte colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Consequently, Foxo3-deficient mice exhibited reduced
      susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. At the molecular
      level, we identified Eomes as a direct target gene for Foxo3 in CD4(+) T cells
      and we have shown that lentiviral-based overexpression of Eomes in
      Foxo3-deficient CD4(+) T cells restored both IFN-gamma and GM-CSF production.
      Thus, the Foxo3-Eomes pathway is central to achieve the complete specialized gene
      program required for pathogenic Th1 cell differentiation and development of
      neuroinflammation.

TI  - Structural Analysis Reveals that Toll-like Receptor 7 Is a Dual Receptor for
      Guanosine and Single-Stranded RNA.
PG  - 737-748

AB  - Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sensor in innate
      immunity and also responds to guanosine and chemical ligands, such as
      imidazoquinoline compounds. However, TLR7 activation mechanism by these ligands
      remain largely unknown. Here, we generated crystal structures of three TLR7
      complexes, and found that all formed an activated m-shaped dimer with two
      ligand-binding sites. The first site conserved in TLR7 and TLR8 was used for
      small ligand-binding essential for its activation. The second site spatially
      distinct from that of TLR8 was used for a ssRNA-binding that enhanced the
      affinity of the first-site ligands. The first site preferentially recognized
      guanosine and the second site specifically bound to uridine moieties in ssRNA.
      Our structural, biochemical, and mutagenesis studies indicated that TLR7 is a
      dual receptor for guanosine and uridine-containing ssRNA. Our findings have
      important implications for understanding of TLR7 function, as well as for
      therapeutic manipulation of TLR7 activation.

AB  - The anti-viral T cell response is drawn from the naive T cell repertoire. During 
      influenza infection, the CD8(+) T cell response to an H-2D(b)-restricted
      nucleoprotein epitope (NP366) is characterized by preferential expansion of T
      cells bearing TRBV13(+) T cell receptors (TCRs) and avoidance of TRBV17(+) T
      cells, despite the latter dominating the naive precursor repertoire. We found two
      TRBV17(+) TCRs that bound H-2D(b)-NP366 with a 180 degrees reversed polarity
      compared to the canonical TCR-pMHC-I docking. The TRBV17 beta-chain dominated the
      interaction and, whereas the complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3) loops
      exclusively mediated contacts with the MHC-I, peptide specificity was
      attributable to germline-encoded recognition. Nevertheless, the TRBV17(+) TCR
      exhibited moderate affinity toward H-2D(b)-NP366 and was capable of signal
      transduction. Thus, the naive CD8(+) T cell pool can comprise TCRs adopting
      reversed pMHC-I docking modes that limit their involvement in the immune
      response.

AB  - The efficacy of the anti-cancer immunomodulatory agent cyclophosphamide (CTX)
      relies on intestinal bacteria. How and which relevant bacterial species are
      involved in tumor immunosurveillance, and their mechanism of action are unclear. 
      Here, we identified two bacterial species, Enterococcus hirae and Barnesiella
      intestinihominis that are involved during CTX therapy. Whereas E. hirae
      translocated from the small intestine to secondary lymphoid organs and increased 
      the intratumoral CD8/Treg ratio, B. intestinihominis accumulated in the colon and
      promoted the infiltration of IFN-gamma-producing gammadeltaT cells in cancer
      lesions. The immune sensor, NOD2, limited CTX-induced cancer immunosurveillance
      and the bioactivity of these microbes. Finally, E. hirae and B. intestinihominis 
      specific-memory Th1 cell immune responses selectively predicted longer
      progression-free survival in advanced lung and ovarian cancer patients treated
      with chemo-immunotherapy. Altogether, E. hirae and B. intestinihominis represent 
      valuable "oncomicrobiotics" ameliorating the efficacy of the most common
      alkylating immunomodulatory compound.

AB  - Imiquimod is a small-molecule ligand of Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) that is
      licensed for the treatment of viral infections and cancers of the skin. Imiquimod
      has TLR7-independent activities that are mechanistically unexplained, including
      NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells and apoptosis induction in cancer 
      cells. We investigated the mechanism of inflammasome activation by imiquimod and 
      the related molecule CL097 and determined that K(+) efflux was dispensable for
      NLRP3 activation by these compounds. Imiquimod and CL097 inhibited the quinone
      oxidoreductases NQO2 and mitochondrial Complex I. This induced a burst of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiol oxidation, and led to NLRP3 activation
      via NEK7, a recently identified component of this inflammasome. Metabolic
      consequences of Complex I inhibition and endolysosomal effects of imiquimod might
      also contribute to NLRP3 activation. Our results reveal a K(+) efflux-independent
      mechanism for NLRP3 activation and identify targets of imiquimod that might be
      clinically relevant.

AB  - Despite the crucial role of tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells in protective
      immunity, their priming remains poorly understood. Here, we have shown
      differential priming requirements for Trm versus circulating memory CD8(+) T
      cells. In vaccinia cutaneous-infected mice, DNGR-1-mediated crosspresentation was
      required for optimal Trm cell priming but not for their skin differentiation or
      for circulating memory T cell generation. DNGR-1(+) dendritic cells (DCs)
      promoted T-bet transcription-factor induction and retention of CD8(+) T cells in 
      the lymph nodes (LNs). Inhibition of LN egress enhanced Trm cell generation,
      whereas genetic or antibody blockade of DNGR-1 or specific signals provided
      during priming by DNGR-1(+) DCs, such as interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, or CD24, 
      impaired Trm cell priming. DNGR-1 also regulated Trm cell generation during
      influenza infection. Moreover, protective immunity depended on optimal Trm cell
      induction by DNGR-1(+) DCs. Our results reveal specific priming requirements for 
      CD8(+) Trm cells during viral infection and vaccination.

AB  - Reciprocal interactions between the metabolic system and immune cells play
      pivotal roles in diverse inflammatory diseases, but the underlying mechanisms
      remain elusive. The activation of bile acid-mediated signaling has been linked to
      improvement in metabolic syndromes and enhanced control of inflammation. Here, we
      demonstrated that bile acids inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the
      TGR5-cAMP-PKA axis. TGR5 bile acid receptor-induced PKA kinase activation led to 
      the ubiquitination of NLRP3, which was associated with the PKA-induced
      phosphorylation of NLRP3 on a single residue, Ser 291. Furthermore, this
      PKA-induced phosphorylation of NLRP3 served as a critical brake on NLRP3
      inflammasome activation. In addition, in vivo results indicated that bile acids
      and TGR5 activation blocked NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammation, including 
      lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation, alum-induced peritoneal
      inflammation, and type-2 diabetes-related inflammation. Altogether, our study
      unveils the PKA-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of NLRP3 and suggests 
      TGR5 as a potential target for the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-related
      diseases.

AB  - In recent years, various intervention strategies have reduced malaria morbidity
      and mortality, but further improvements probably depend upon development of a
      broadly protective vaccine. To better understand immune requirement for
      protection, we examined liver-stage immunity after vaccination with irradiated
      sporozoites, an effective though logistically difficult vaccine. We identified a 
      population of memory CD8(+) T cells that expressed the gene signature of
      tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells and remained permanently within the liver,
      where they patrolled the sinusoids. Exploring the requirements for liver Trm cell
      induction, we showed that by combining dendritic cell-targeted priming with liver
      inflammation and antigen recognition on hepatocytes, high frequencies of Trm
      cells could be induced and these cells were essential for protection against
      malaria sporozoite challenge. Our study highlights the immune potential of liver 
      Trm cells and provides approaches for their selective transfer, expansion, or
      depletion, which may be harnessed to control liver infections or autoimmunity.

TI  - CD8(+) Lymphocytes Are Required for Maintaining Viral Suppression in SIV-Infected
      Macaques Treated with Short-Term Antiretroviral Therapy.

AB  - Infection with HIV persists despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and
      treatment interruption results in rapid viral rebound. Antibody-mediated CD8(+)
      lymphocyte depletion in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus
      macaques (RMs) shows that these cells contribute to viral control in untreated
      animals. However, the contribution of CD8(+) lymphocytes to maintaining viral
      suppression under ART remains unknown. Here, we have shown that in SIV-infected
      RMs treated with short-term (i.e., 8-32 week) ART, depletion of CD8(+)
      lymphocytes resulted in increased plasma viremia in all animals and that
      repopulation of CD8(+) T cells was associated with prompt reestablishment of
      virus control. Although the number of SIV-DNA-positive cells remained unchanged
      after CD8 depletion and reconstitution, the frequency of SIV-infected CD4(+) T
      cells before depletion positively correlated with both the peak and area under
      the curve of viremia after depletion. These results suggest a role for CD8(+) T
      cells in controlling viral production during ART, thus providing a rationale for 
      exploring immunotherapeutic approaches in ART-treated HIV-infected individuals.

AB  - Germinal centers (GCs) are the site of antibody diversification and affinity
      maturation and as such are vitally important for humoral immunity. The study of
      GC biology has undergone a renaissance in the past 10 years, with a succession of
      findings that have transformed our understanding of the cellular dynamics of
      affinity maturation. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the field,
      with special emphasis on how GC cellular and clonal dynamics shape antibody
      affinity and diversity during the immune response.

AB  - B-1 B cells differ from conventional B-2 B cells functionally, but how these

      Immunity articles, Kristiansen et al. (2016) and Montecino-Rodriguez et al.
      (2016), now provide insight into the origins of B-1 and B-2 B cells, revealing a 
      multi-layered developmental program and successive waves of B cell precursors.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that hold great
      therapeutic potential. Multiple DC subsets have been described, and it remains
      challenging to align them across tissues and species to analyze their function in
      the absence of macrophage contamination. Here, we provide and validate a
      universal toolbox for the automated identification of DCs through unsupervised
      analysis of conventional flow cytometry and mass cytometry data obtained from
      multiple mouse, macaque, and human tissues. The use of a minimal set of
      lineage-imprinted markers was sufficient to subdivide DCs into conventional type 
      1 (cDC1s), conventional type 2 (cDC2s), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) across
      tissues and species. This way, a large number of additional markers can still be 
      used to further characterize the heterogeneity of DCs across tissues and during
      inflammation. This framework represents the way forward to a universal,
      high-throughput, and standardized analysis of DC populations from mutant mice and
      human patients.

TI  - IRF8 Transcription Factor Controls Survival and Function of Terminally
      Differentiated Conventional and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells, Respectively.

AB  - Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) has been proposed to be essential for
      development of monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 1
      conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) and remains highly expressed in
      differentiated DCs. Transcription factors that are required to maintain the
      identity of terminally differentiated cells are designated "terminal selectors." 
      Using BM chimeras, conditional Irf8(fl/fl) mice and various promotors to target
      Cre recombinase to different stages of monocyte and DC development, we have
      identified IRF8 as a terminal selector of the cDC1 lineage controlling survival. 
      In monocytes, IRF8 was necessary during early but not late development. Complete 
      or late deletion of IRF8 had no effect on pDC development or survival but altered
      their phenotype and gene-expression profile leading to increased T cell
      stimulatory function but decreased type 1 interferon production. Thus, IRF8
      differentially controls the survival and function of terminally differentiated
      monocytes, cDC1s, and pDCs.

AB  - During viral infection, sensing of cytosolic DNA by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
      (cGAS) activates the adaptor protein STING and triggers an antiviral response.
      Little is known about the mechanisms that determine the kinetics of activation
      and deactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway, ensuring effective but controlled
      innate antiviral responses. Here we found that the ubiquitin ligase Trim38
      targets cGas for sumoylation in uninfected cells and during the early phase of
      viral infection. Sumoylation of cGas prevented its polyubiquitination and
      degradation. Trim38 also sumoylated Sting during the early phase of viral
      infection, promoting both Sting activation and protein stability. In the late
      phase of infection, cGas and Sting were desumoylated by Senp2 and subsequently
      degraded via proteasomal and chaperone-mediated autophagy pathways, respectively.
      Our findings reveal an essential role for Trim38 in the innate immune response to
      DNA virus and provide insight into the mechanisms that ensure optimal activation 
      and deactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway.

AB  - Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are crucial for germinal center (GC) formation
      and humoral adaptive immunity. Mechanisms underlying Tfh cell differentiation in 
      peripheral and mucosal lymphoid organs are incompletely understood. We report
      here that mTOR kinase complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2) are essential for Tfh
      cell differentiation and GC reaction under steady state and after antigen
      immunization and viral infection. Loss of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in T cells exerted
      distinct effects on Tfh cell signature gene expression, whereas increased mTOR
      activity promoted Tfh responses. Deficiency of mTORC2 impaired CD4(+) T cell
      accumulation and immunoglobulin A production and aberrantly induced the
      transcription factor Foxo1. Mechanistically, the costimulatory molecule ICOS
      activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 to drive glycolysis and lipogenesis, and glucose
      transporter 1-mediated glucose metabolism promoted Tfh cell responses.
      Altogether, mTOR acts as a central node in Tfh cells by linking immune signals to
      anabolic metabolism and transcriptional activity.

TI  - Multi-tiered Reorganization of the Genome during B Cell Affinity Maturation
      Anchored by a Germinal Center-Specific Locus Control Region.

AB  - During the humoral immune response, B cells undergo a dramatic change in
      phenotype to enable antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs). Using
      genome-wide chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C), we found that GC B cells
      undergo massive reorganization of the genomic architecture that encodes the GC B 
      cell transcriptome. Coordinate expression of genes that specify the GC B cell
      phenotype-most prominently BCL6-was achieved through a multilayered chromatin
      reorganization process involving (1) increased promoter connectivity, (2)
      formation of enhancer networks, (3) 5' to 3' gene looping, and (4) merging of
      gene neighborhoods that share active epigenetic marks. BCL6 was an anchor point
      for the formation of GC-specific gene and enhancer loops on chromosome 3.
      Deletion of a GC-specific, highly interactive locus control region upstream of
      Bcl6 abrogated GC formation in mice. Thus, large-scale and multi-tiered genomic
      three-dimensional reorganization is required for coordinate expression of
      phenotype-driving gene sets that determine the unique characteristics of GC B
      cells.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the N332 supersite of the HIV
      envelope (Env) trimer are the most common bnAbs induced during infection, making 
      them promising leads for vaccine design. Wild-type Env glycoproteins lack
      detectable affinity for supersite-bnAb germline precursors and are therefore
      unsuitable immunogens to prime supersite-bnAb responses. We employed mammalian
      cell surface display to design stabilized Env trimers with affinity for
      germline-reverted precursors of PGT121-class supersite bnAbs. The trimers
      maintained native-like antigenicity and structure, activated PGT121
      inferred-germline B cells ex vivo when multimerized on liposomes, and primed
      PGT121-like responses in PGT121 inferred-germline knockin mice. Design
      intermediates have levels of epitope modification between wild-type and
      germline-targeting trimers; their mutation gradient suggests sequential
      immunization to induce bnAbs, in which the germline-targeting prime is followed
      by progressively less-mutated design intermediates and, lastly, with native
      trimers. The vaccine design strategies described could be utilized to target
      other epitopes on HIV or other pathogens.

AB  - The nature of gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) lacking antigen receptors
      remains controversial. Herein we showed that, in humans and in mice, innate
      intestinal IELs expressing intracellular CD3 (iCD3(+)) differentiate along an Id2
      transcription factor (TF)-independent pathway in response to TF NOTCH1,
      interleukin-15 (IL-15), and Granzyme B signals. In NOTCH1-activated human
      hematopoietic precursors, IL-15 induced Granzyme B, which cleaved NOTCH1 into a
      peptide lacking transcriptional activity. As a result, NOTCH1 target genes
      indispensable for T cell differentiation were silenced and precursors were
      reprogrammed into innate cells with T cell marks including intracellular CD3 and 
      T cell rearrangements. In the intraepithelial lymphoma complicating celiac
      disease, iCD3(+) innate IELs acquired gain-of-function mutations in Janus kinase 
      1 or Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which enhanced their
      response to IL-15. Overall we characterized gut T cell-like innate IELs,
      deciphered their pathway of differentiation and showed their malignant
      transformation in celiac disease.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain long-term reconstitution of hematopoiesis
      in transplantation recipients, yet their role in the endogenous steady-state
      hematopoiesis remains unclear. In particular, recent studies suggested that HSCs 
      provide a relatively minor contribution to immune cell development in adults. We 
      directed transgene expression in a fraction of HSCs that maintained
      reconstituting activity during serial transplantations. Inducible genetic
      labeling showed that transgene-expressing HSCs gave rise to other phenotypic
      HSCs, confirming their top position in the differentiation hierarchy. The labeled
      HSCs rapidly contributed to committed progenitors of all lineages and to mature
      myeloid cells and lymphocytes, but not to B-1a cells or tissue macrophages.
      Importantly, labeled HSCs gave rise to more than two-thirds of all myeloid cells 
      and platelets in adult mice, and this contribution could be accelerated by an
      induced interferon response. Thus, classically defined HSCs maintain immune cell 
      development in the steady state and during systemic cytokine responses.

AB  - Although all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is a key regulator of intestinal
      immunity, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We found that mice with
      colitis-associated CRC had a marked deficiency in colonic atRA due to alterations
      in atRA metabolism mediated by microbiota-induced intestinal inflammation. Human 
      ulcerative colitis (UC), UC-associated CRC, and sporadic CRC specimens have
      similar alterations in atRA metabolic enzymes, consistent with reduced colonic
      atRA. Inhibition of atRA signaling promoted tumorigenesis, whereas atRA
      supplementation reduced tumor burden. The benefit of atRA treatment was mediated 
      by cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which were activated due to MHCI upregulation on
      tumor cells. Consistent with these findings, increased colonic expression of the 
      atRA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, correlated with reduced frequencies of tumoral
      cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells and with worse disease prognosis in human CRC. These
      results reveal a mechanism by which microbiota drive colon carcinogenesis and
      highlight atRA metabolism as a therapeutic target for CRC.

AB  - Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) are a highly heterogeneous group of cells that play
      important roles in maintaining the body's homeostasis. Here, we found CD301b
      (also known as MGL2), a lectin commonly used as a marker for alternatively
      activated macrophages, was selectively expressed by a subset of
      CD11b(+)CD11c(+)MHCII(+) MNPs in multiple organs including adipose tissues.
      Depleting CD301b(+) MNPs in vivo led to a significant weight loss with increased 
      insulin sensitivity and a marked reduction in serum Resistin-like molecule (RELM)
      alpha, a multifunctional cytokine produced by MNPs. Reconstituting RELMalpha in
      CD301b(+) MNP-depleted animals restored body weight and normoglycemia. Thus,
      CD301b(+) MNPs play crucial roles in maintaining glucose metabolism and net
      energy balance.

AB  - B cells diversify and affinity mature their antigen receptor repertoire in
      germinal centers (GCs). GC B cells receive help signals during transient
      interaction with T cells, yet it remains unknown how these transient T-B
      interactions in the light zone sustain the subsequent proliferative program of
      selected B cells that occurs in the anatomically distant dark zone. Here, we show
      that the transcription factor AP4 was required for sustained GC B cell
      proliferation and subsequent establishment of a diverse and protective antibody
      repertoire. AP4 was induced by c-MYC during the T-B interactions, was maintained 
      by T-cell-derived interleukin-21 (IL-21), and promoted repeated rounds of
      divisions of selected GC B cells. B-cell-specific deletion of AP4 resulted in
      reduced GC sizes and reduced somatic hypermutation coupled with a failure to
      control chronic viral infection. These results indicate that AP4 integrates
      T-cell-mediated selection and sustained expansion of GC B cells for humoral
      immunity.

AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a fundamental cytokine that controls proliferation and
      differentiation of T cells. Here, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry to
      generate a comprehensive and detailed map of IL-2 protein phosphorylations in
      cytotoxic T cells (CTL). The data revealed that Janus kinases (JAKs) couple IL-2 
      receptors to the coordinated phosphorylation of transcription factors, regulators
      of chromatin, mRNA translation, GTPases, vesicle trafficking, and the actin and
      microtubule cytoskeleton. We identified an IL-2-JAK-independent SRC family
      Tyr-kinase-controlled signaling network that regulates approximately 10% of the
      CTL phosphoproteome, the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
      (PIP3), and the activity of the serine/threonine kinase AKT. These data reveal a 
      signaling framework wherein IL-2-JAK-controlled pathways coordinate with
      IL-2-independent networks of kinase activity and provide a resource toward the
      further understanding of the networks of protein phosphorylation that program CTL
      fate.

AB  - B cell development is often depicted as a linear process initiating in the fetus 
      and continuing postnatally. Using a PU.1 hypomorphic mouse model, we found that
      B-1 and B-2 lymphopoiesis occurred in distinct fetal and adult waves
      differentially dependent on the Sfpi1 14 kB upstream regulatory element. The
      initial wave of fetal B-1 development was absent in PU.1 hypomorphic mice, while 
      subsequent fetal and adult waves emerged. In contrast, B-2 lymphopoiesis occurred
      in distinct fetal and adult waves. Whole-transcriptome profiling of fetal and
      adult B cell progenitors supported the existence of three waves of B-1 and two
      waves of B-2 development and revealed that the network of transcription factors
      governing B lineage specification and commitment was highly divergent between B-1
      and B-2 progenitors. These findings support the view that the B-1 and B-2
      lineages are distinct and provide a genetic basis for layering of immune system
      development.

TI  - The Pseudokinase MLKL and the Kinase RIPK3 Have Distinct Roles in Autoimmune
      Disease Caused by Loss of Death-Receptor-Induced Apoptosis.

AB  - The kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 and the pseudo-kinase MLKL have been identified as
      key regulators of the necroptotic cell death pathway, although a role for MLKL
      within the whole animal has not yet been established. Here, we have shown that
      MLKL deficiency rescued the embryonic lethality caused by loss of Caspase-8 or
      FADD. Casp8(-/-)Mlkl(-/-) and Fadd(-/-)Mlkl(-/-) mice were viable and fertile but
      rapidly developed severe lymphadenopathy, systemic autoimmune disease, and
      thrombocytopenia. These morbidities occurred more rapidly and with increased
      severity in Casp8(-/-)Mlkl(-/-) and Fadd(-/-)Mlkl(-/-) mice compared to
      Casp8(-/-)Ripk3(-/-) or Fadd(-/-)Ripk3(-/-) mice, respectively. These results
      demonstrate that MLKL is an essential effector of aberrant necroptosis in embryos
      caused by loss of Caspase-8 or FADD. Furthermore, they suggest that RIPK3 and/or 
      MLKL may exert functions independently of necroptosis. It appears that
      non-necroptotic functions of RIPK3 contribute to the lymphadenopathy,
      autoimmunity, and excess cytokine production that occur when FADD or
      Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis is abrogated.

AB  - Chronic infections promote the terminal differentiation (or "exhaustion") of T
      cells and are thought to preclude the formation of memory T cells. In contrast,
      we discovered a small subpopulation of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells that
      sustained the T cell response during chronic infections. These cells were defined
      by, and depended on, the expression of the transcription factor Tcf1.
      Transcriptome analysis revealed that this population shared key characteristics
      of central memory cells but lacked an effector signature. Unlike conventional
      memory cells, Tcf1-expressing T cells displayed hallmarks of an "exhausted"
      phenotype, including the expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and
      Lag-3. This population was crucial for the T cell expansion that occurred in
      response to inhibitory receptor blockade during chronic infection. These findings
      identify a memory-like T cell population that sustains T cell responses and is a 
      prime target for therapeutic interventions to improve the immune response in
      chronic infections.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo a functional switch in neonatal mice
      hallmarked by a decrease in self-renewing divisions and entry into quiescence.
      Here, we investigated whether the developmental attenuation of B-1a cell output
      is a consequence of a shift in stem cell state during ontogeny. Using cellular
      barcoding for in vivo single-cell fate analyses, we found that fetal liver
      definitive HSCs gave rise to both B-1a and B-2 cells. Whereas B-1a potential
      diminished in all HSCs with time, B-2 output was maintained. B-1a and B-2
      plasticity could be reinitiated in a subset of adult HSCs by ectopic expression
      of the RNA binding protein LIN28B, a key regulator of fetal hematopoiesis, and
      this coincided with the clonal reversal to fetal-like elevated self-renewal and
      repopulation potential. These results anchor the attenuation of B-1a cell output 
      to fetal HSC behavior and demonstrate that the developmental decline in
      regenerative potential represents a reversible HSC state.

AB  - Many pathogens, including Plasmodium spp., exploit the interaction of programmed 
      death-1 (PD-1) with PD-1-ligand-1 (PD-L1) to "deactivate" T cell functions, but
      the role of PD-L2 remains unclear. We studied malarial infections to understand
      the contribution of PD-L2 to immunity. Here we have shown that higher PD-L2
      expression on blood dendritic cells, from Plasmodium falciparum-infected
      individuals, correlated with lower parasitemia. Mechanistic studies in mice
      showed that PD-L2 was indispensable for establishing effective CD4(+) T cell
      immunity against malaria, because it not only inhibited PD-L1 to PD-1 activity
      but also increased CD3 and inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) expression on T cells. 
      Importantly, administration of soluble multimeric PD-L2 to mice with lethal
      malaria was sufficient to dramatically improve immunity and survival. These
      studies show immuno-regulation by PD-L2, which has the potential to be translated
      into an effective treatment for malaria and other diseases where T cell immunity 
      is ineffective or short-lived due to PD-1-mediated signaling.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are instrumental in the initiation of T cell responses, but
      how thymic and peripheral tolerogenic DCs differ globally from Toll-like receptor
      (TLR)-induced immunogenic DCs remains unclear. Here, we show that thymic XCR1(+) 
      DCs undergo a high rate of maturation, accompanied by profound gene-expression
      changes that are essential for central tolerance and also happen in germ-free
      mice. Those changes largely overlap those occurring during tolerogenic and, more 
      unexpectedly, TLR-induced maturation of peripheral XCR1(+) DCs, arguing against
      the commonly held view that tolerogenic DCs undergo incomplete maturation.
      Interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression was among the few discriminators of
      immunogenic and tolerogenic XCR1(+) DCs. Tolerogenic XCR1(+) thymic DCs were,
      however, unique in expressing ISGs known to restrain virus replication.
      Therefore, a broad functional convergence characterizes tolerogenic and
      immunogenic XCR1(+) DC maturation in the thymus and periphery, maximizing antigen
      presentation and signal delivery to developing and to conventional and regulatory
      mature T cells.

AB  - Complement is well appreciated as a critical arm of innate immunity. It is
      required for the removal of invading pathogens and works by directly destroying
      them through the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells. However,
      complement activation and function is not confined to the extracellular space but
      also occurs within cells. Recent work indicates that complement activation
      regulates key metabolic pathways and thus can impact fundamental cellular
      processes, such as survival, proliferation, and autophagy. Newly identified
      functions of complement include a key role in shaping metabolic reprogramming,
      which underlies T cell effector differentiation, and a role as a nexus for
      interactions with other effector systems, in particular the inflammasome and
      Notch transcription-factor networks. This review focuses on the contributions of 
      complement to basic processes of the cell, in particular the integration of
      complement with cellular metabolism and the potential implications in infection
      and other disease settings.

AB  - Following the fate of antigen-specific memory B cells has been difficult. In this
      issue of Immunity, Krishnamurty et al. (2016) use a novel B cell tetramer to
      define Plasmodium-specific memory B cells in parasite-infected mice and
      demonstrate that after re-infection, somatically mutated IgM(+) memory B cells
      function as first responders by rapidly differentiating into T-cell-dependent
      plasmablasts and T-cell-independent plasma cells.

      characterized by reduced effector functionality, termed exhaustion. In two
      related studies by Scharping et al. (2016) and Bengsch et al. (2016) in this
      issue of Immunity, dysfunctional mitochondria are identified as a key correlate
      of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion.

AB  - Depending on the tissue microenvironment, T cells can differentiate into highly
      diverse subsets expressing unique trafficking receptors and cytokines. Studies of
      human lymphocytes have primarily focused on a limited number of parameters in
      blood, representing an incomplete view of the human immune system. Here, we have 
      utilized mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze T cell trafficking and
      functional markers across eight different human tissues, including blood,
      lymphoid, and non-lymphoid tissues. These data have revealed that combinatorial
      expression of trafficking receptors and cytokines better defines tissue
      specificity. Notably, we identified numerous T helper cell subsets with
      overlapping cytokine expression, but only specific cytokine combinations are
      secreted regardless of tissue type. This indicates that T cell lineages defined
      in mouse models cannot be clearly distinguished in humans. Overall, our data
      uncover a plethora of tissue immune signatures and provide a systemic map of how 
      T cell phenotypes are altered throughout the human body.

AB  - CD8(+) T cells recognizing tumor-specific antigens are detected in cancer
      patients but are dysfunctional. Here we developed a tamoxifen-inducible liver
      cancer mouse model with a defined oncogenic driver antigen (SV40 large T-antigen)
      to follow the activation and differentiation of naive tumor-specific CD8(+) T
      (TST) cells after tumor initiation. Early during the pre-malignant phase of
      tumorigenesis, TST cells became dysfunctional, exhibiting phenotypic, functional,
      and transcriptional features similar to dysfunctional T cells isolated from
      late-stage human tumors. Thus, T cell dysfunction seen in advanced human cancers 
      may already be established early during tumorigenesis. Although the TST cell
      dysfunctional state was initially therapeutically reversible, it ultimately
      evolved into a fixed state. Persistent antigen exposure rather than factors
      associated with the tumor microenvironment drove dysfunction. Moreover, the TST
      cell differentiation and dysfunction program exhibited features distinct from T
      cell exhaustion in chronic infections. Strategies to overcome this
      antigen-driven, cell-intrinsic dysfunction may be required to improve cancer
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Lyn Kinase Suppresses the Transcriptional Activity of IRF5 in the TLR-MyD88
      Pathway to Restrain the Development of Autoimmunity.

AB  - Interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5), a transcription factor critical for the
      induction of innate immune responses, contributes to the pathogenesis of the
      autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans and mice. Lyn, a 
      Src family kinase, is also implicated in human SLE, and Lyn-deficient mice
      develop an SLE-like disease. Here, we found that Lyn physically interacted with
      IRF5 to inhibit ubiquitination and phosphorylation of IRF5 in the TLR-MyD88
      pathway, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activity of IRF5 in a manner
      independent of Lyn's kinase activity. Conversely, Lyn did not inhibit NF-kappaB
      signaling, another major branch downstream of MyD88. Monoallelic deletion of Irf5
      alleviated the hyperproduction of cytokines in TLR-stimulated Lyn(-/-) dendritic 
      cells and the development of SLE-like symptoms in Lyn(-/-) mice. Our results
      reveal a role for Lyn as a specific suppressor of the TLR-MyD88-IRF5 pathway and 
      illustrate the importance of fine-tuning IRF5 activity for the maintenance of
      immune homeostasis.

TI  - The Self-Specific Activation Receptor SLAM Family Is Critical for NK Cell
      Education.

AB  - NK cell education, a term describing a process for NK cell acquisition of
      functional competence, is primarily achieved by self-MHC-I-specific inhibitory
      receptors. In this study, we have demonstrated that SLAM family receptors (SFRs) 
      redundantly expressed on hematopoietic cells function as self-specific activation
      receptors critical for NK cell education. To overcome gene redundancy, we
      generated mice simultaneously lacking seven SFRs, revealing that NK-cell-mediated
      rejection of semi-allogeneic hematopoietic cells largely depended on the presence
      of SFRs on target cells. This stimulatory effect was determined by the presence
      of SFR-coupled adaptors; however, SFR-deficient mice displayed enhanced
      reactivity to hematopoietic cells. These findings demonstrate that SFRs endow NK 
      cells with an ability to kill hematopoietic cells during the effector phase;
      however, the sustained engagement of SFRs can desensitize NK cell responses
      during an education process. Therefore, self-specific activating ligands may be
      "tolerogens" for NK cells, akin to self-antigens that induce T cell tolerance.

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) function to protect epithelial barriers against
      pathogens and maintain tissue homeostasis in both barrier and non-barrier
      tissues. Here, utilizing Eomes reporter mice, we identify a subset of adipose
      group 1 ILC (ILC1) and demonstrate a role for these cells in metabolic disease.
      Adipose ILC1s were dependent on the transcription factors Nfil3 and T-bet but
      phenotypically and functionally distinct from adipose mature natural killer (NK) 
      and immature NK cells. Analysis of parabiotic mice revealed that adipose ILC1s
      maintained long-term tissue residency. Diet-induced obesity drove early
      production of interleukin (IL)-12 in adipose tissue depots and led to the
      selective proliferation and accumulation of adipose-resident ILC1s in a manner
      dependent on the IL-12 receptor and STAT4. ILC1-derived interferon-gamma was
      necessary and sufficient to drive proinflammatory macrophage polarization to
      promote obesity-associated insulin resistance. Thus, adipose-resident ILC1s
      contribute to obesity-related pathology in response to dysregulated local
      proinflammatory cytokine production.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense
      microbial ligands and initiate signaling to induce inflammatory responses.
      Although the quality of inflammatory responses is influenced by internalization
      of TLRs, the role of endosomal maturation in clearing receptors and terminating
      inflammatory responses is not well understood. Here, we report that Drosophila
      and mammalian Vps33B proteins play critical roles in the maturation of phagosomes
      and endosomes following microbial recognition. Vps33B was necessary for clearance
      of endosomes containing internalized PRRs, failure of which resulted in enhanced 
      signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators. Lack of Vps33B had no effect 
      on trafficking of endosomes containing non-microbial cargo. These findings
      indicate that Vps33B function is critical for determining the fate of signaling
      endosomes formed following PRR activation. Exaggerated inflammatory responses
      dictated by persistence of receptors in aberrant endosomal compartments could
      therefore contribute to symptoms of ARC syndrome, a disease linked to loss of
      Vps33B.

AB  - Although tumor-specific T cells recognize cancer cells, they are often rendered
      dysfunctional due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here we showed that T
      cells demonstrated persistent loss of mitochondrial function and mass when
      infiltrating murine and human tumors, an effect specific to the tumor
      microenvironment and not merely caused by activation. Tumor-infiltrating T cells 
      showed a progressive loss of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha), which
      programs mitochondrial biogenesis, induced by chronic Akt signaling in
      tumor-specific T cells. Reprogramming tumor-specific T cells through enforced
      expression of PGC1alpha resulted in superior intratumoral metabolic and effector 
      function. Our data support a model in which signals in the tumor microenvironment
      repress T cell oxidative metabolism, resulting in effector cells with metabolic
      needs that cannot be met. Our studies also suggest that modulation or
      reprogramming of the altered metabolism of tumor-infiltrating T cells might
      represent a potential strategy to reinvigorate dysfunctional T cells for cancer
      treatment.

AB  - Detection of intracellular DNA triggers activation of the STING-dependent
      interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD) pathway, which is essential for antiviral
      responses. Multiple DNA sensors have been proposed to activate this pathway,
      including AIM2-like receptors (ALRs). Whether the ALRs are essential for
      activation of this pathway remains unknown. To rigorously explore the function of
      ALRs, we generated mice lacking all 13 ALR genes. We found that ALRs are
      dispensable for the type I interferon (IFN) response to transfected DNA ligands, 
      DNA virus infection, and lentivirus infection. We also found that ALRs do not
      contribute to autoimmune disease in the Trex1(-/-) mouse model of
      Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome. Finally, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the human
      AIM2-like receptor IFI16 in primary fibroblasts revealed that IFI16 is not
      essential for the IFN response to human cytomegalovirus infection. Our findings
      indicate that ALRs are dispensable for the ISD response and suggest that
      alternative functions for these receptors should be explored.

AB  - The effector potential of NK cells is counterbalanced by their sensitivity to
      inhibition by "self" MHC class I molecules in a process called "education." In
      humans, interactions between inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors
      (KIR) and human MHC (HLA) mediate NK cell education. In HLA-B( *)27:05(+)
      transgenic mice and in patients undergoing HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT), NK cells derived from human CD34(+) stem cells were
      educated by HLA from both donor hematopoietic cells and host stromal cells.
      Furthermore, mature human KIR3DL1(+) NK cells gained reactivity after adoptive
      transfer to HLA-B( *)27:05(+) mice or bone marrow chimeric mice where HLA-B(
      *)27:05 was restricted to either the hematopoietic or stromal compartment.
      Silencing of HLA in primary NK cells diminished NK cell reactivity, while
      acquisition of HLA from neighboring cells increased NK cell reactivity.
      Altogether, these findings reveal roles for cell-extrinsic HLA in driving NK cell
      reactivity upward, and cell-intrinsic HLA in maintaining NK cell education.

AB  - Dynamic reprogramming of metabolism is essential for T cell effector function and
      memory formation. However, the regulation of metabolism in exhausted CD8(+) T
      (Tex) cells is poorly understood. We found that during the first week of chronic 
      lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, before severe dysfunction
      develops, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were already unable to match the
      bioenergetics of effector T cells generated during acute infection. Suppression
      of T cell bioenergetics involved restricted glucose uptake and use, despite
      persisting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and upregulation of
      many anabolic pathways. PD-1 regulated early glycolytic and mitochondrial
      alterations and repressed transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha. Improving
      bioenergetics by overexpression of PGC-1alpha enhanced function in developing Tex
      cells. Therapeutic reinvigoration by anti-PD-L1 reprogrammed metabolism in a
      subset of Tex cells. These data highlight a key metabolic control event early in 
      exhaustion and suggest that manipulating glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism 
      might enhance checkpoint blockade outcomes.

AB  - Humoral immunity consists of pre-existing antibodies expressed by long-lived
      plasma cells and rapidly reactive memory B cells (MBC). Recent studies of MBC
      development and function after protein immunization have uncovered significant
      MBC heterogeneity. To clarify functional roles for distinct MBC subsets during
      malaria infection, we generated tetramers that identify Plasmodium-specific MBCs 
      in both humans and mice. Long-lived murine Plasmodium-specific MBCs consisted of 
      three populations: somatically hypermutated immunoglobulin M(+) (IgM(+)) and
      IgG(+) MBC subsets and an unmutated IgD(+) MBC population. Rechallenge
      experiments revealed that high affinity, somatically hypermutated
      Plasmodium-specific IgM(+) MBCs proliferated and gave rise to antibody-secreting 
      cells that dominated the early secondary response to parasite rechallenge. IgM(+)
      MBCs also gave rise to T cell-dependent IgM(+) and IgG(+)B220(+)CD138(+)
      plasmablasts or T cell-independent B220(-)CD138(+) IgM(+) plasma cells. Thus,
      even in competition with IgG(+) MBCs, IgM(+) MBCs are rapid, plastic, early
      responders to a secondary Plasmodium rechallenge and should be targeted by
      vaccine strategies.

AB  - CD95 ligand (CD95L) is expressed by immune cells and triggers apoptotic death.
      Metalloprotease-cleaved CD95L (cl-CD95L) is released into the bloodstream but
      does not trigger apoptotic signaling. Hence, the pathophysiological role of
      cl-CD95L remains unclear. We observed that skin-derived endothelial cells from
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients expressed CD95L and that after
      cleavage, cl-CD95L promoted T helper 17 (Th17) lymphocyte transmigration across
      the endothelial barrier at the expense of T regulatory cells. T cell migration
      relied on a direct interaction between the CD95 domain called calcium-inducing
      domain (CID) and the Src homology 3 domain of phospholipase Cgamma1. Th17 cells
      stimulated with cl-CD95L produced sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which promoted
      endothelial transmigration by activating the S1P receptor 3. We generated a
      cell-penetrating CID peptide that prevented Th17 cell transmigration and
      alleviated clinical symptoms in lupus mice. Therefore, neutralizing the CD95
      non-apoptotic signaling pathway could be an attractive therapeutic approach for
      SLE treatment.

AB  - Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) expressing the transcription factor (TF)
      RORgammat are important for the defense and homeostasis of host intestinal
      tissues. The zinc finger TF Ikaros, encoded by Ikzf1, is essential for the
      development of RORgammat(+) fetal lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and
      lymphoid organogenesis, but its role in postnatal ILC3s is unknown. Here, we show
      that small-intestinal ILC3s had lower Ikaros expression than ILC precursors and
      other ILC subsets. Ikaros inhibited ILC3s in a cell-intrinsic manner through
      zinc-finger-dependent inhibition of transcriptional activity of the aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor, a key regulator of ILC3 maintenance and function. Ablation 
      of Ikzf1 in RORgammat(+) ILC3s resulted in increased expansion and cytokine
      production of intestinal ILC3s and protection against infection and colitis.
      Therefore, in contrast to being required for LTi development, Ikaros inhibits
      postnatal ILC3 development and function to regulate gut immune responses at
      steady state and in disease.

      Expansion and Migration during Infection and Inflammation.

AB  - Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of inflammation and
      infection. However, patients with allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis
      show a paucity of skin neutrophils and are prone to bacterial skin infections,
      suggesting that allergic inflammation curtails neutrophil responses. Here we have
      shown that the type 2 cell signature cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) hampers
      neutrophil expansion and migration by antagonizing granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) and chemokine receptor-mediated signals. Cutaneous bacterial
      infection in mice was exacerbated by IL-4 signaling and improved with IL-4
      inhibition, each outcome inversely correlating with neutrophil migration to skin.
      Likewise, systemic bacterial infection was worsened by heightened IL-4 activity, 
      with IL-4 restricting G-CSF-induced neutrophil expansion and migration to tissues
      by affecting CXCR2-CXCR4 chemokine signaling in neutrophils. These effects were
      dependent on IL-4 acting through type 2 IL-4 receptors on neutrophils. Thus,
      targeting IL-4 might be beneficial in neutropenic conditions with increased
      susceptibility to bacterial infections.

TI  - Antimicrobial Peptide LL37 and MAVS Signaling Drive Interferon-beta Production by

AB  - Type 1 interferons (IFNs) promote inflammation in the skin but the mechanisms
      responsible for inducing these cytokines are not well understood. We found that
      IFN-beta was abundantly produced by epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) in psoriasis
      and during wound repair. KC IFN-beta production depended on stimulation of
      mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) by the antimicrobial peptide
      LL37 and double stranded-RNA released from necrotic cells. MAVS activated
      downstream TBK1 (TANK-Binding Kinase 1)-AKT (AKT serine/threonine kinase 1)-IRF3 
      (interferon regulatory factor 3) signaling cascade leading to IFN-beta production
      and then promoted maturation of dendritic cells. In mice, the production of
      epidermal IFN-beta by LL37 required MAVS, and human wounded and/or psoriatic skin
      showed activation of MAVS-associated IRF3 and induction of MAVS and IFN-beta gene
      signatures. These findings show that KCs are an important source of IFN-beta and 
      MAVS is critical to this function, and demonstrates how the epidermis triggers
      unwanted skin inflammation under disease conditions.

AB  - Although the intracellular trafficking system is integral to most physiologic
      activities, its role in mediating immune responses to infection has remained
      elusive. Here, we report that infected bladder epithelial cells (BECs) mobilized 
      the exocyst complex, a powerful exporter of subcellular vesicles, to rapidly
      expel intracellular bacteria back for clearance. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4
      signals emanating from bacteria-containing vesicles (BCVs) were found to trigger 
      K33-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 at Lys168, which was then detected by
      RalGDS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that precipitated the assembly
      of the exocyst complex. Although this distinct modification of TRAF3 served to
      connect innate immune signaling to the cellular trafficking apparatus, it
      crucially ensured temporal and spatial accuracy in determining which among the
      many subcellular vesicles was recognized and selected for expulsion in response
      to innate immune signaling.

TI  - MicroRNA-17 Modulates Regulatory T Cell Function by Targeting Co-regulators of
      the Foxp3 Transcription Factor.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells are important in maintaining self-tolerance and immune 
      homeostasis. The Treg cell transcription factor Foxp3 works in concert with other
      co-regulatory molecules, including Eos, to determine the transcriptional
      signature and characteristic suppressive phenotype of Treg cells. Here, we report
      that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) actively repressed Eos
      expression through microRNA-17 (miR-17). miR-17 expression increased in Treg
      cells in the presence of IL-6, and its expression negatively correlated with that
      of Eos. Treg cell suppressive activity was diminished upon overexpression of
      miR-17 in vitro and in vivo, which was mitigated upon co-expression of an Eos
      mutant lacking miR-17 target sites. Also, RNAi of miR-17 resulted in enhanced
      suppressive activity. Ectopic expression of miR-17 imparted effector-T-cell-like 
      characteristics to Treg cells via the de-repression of genes encoding effector
      cytokines. Thus, miR-17 provides a potent layer of Treg cell control through
      targeting Eos and additional Foxp3 co-regulators.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are important in host defense against pathogens, and
      they can subsequently differentiate into memory NK cells. The Ly49 and KIR gene
      families in rodents and humans encode both inhibitory and activating receptors
      for MHC class I. The physiological role of activating KIR or Ly49 receptors that 
      recognize self-MHC class I during immune response to viral infections is unknown.
      Here, we address how the activating Ly49D receptor impacts the NK cell response
      to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection by comparing the activation and
      differentiation of Ly49D-bearing NK cells in mice lacking or expressing H-2D(d), 
      the cognate MHC class I ligand of Ly49D. After MCMV infection, Ly49D augmented
      IFN-gamma production by MCMV-specific Ly49H(+) NK cells and preferentially
      promoted the generation of memory Ly49H(+) NK cells. Thus, activating receptors
      for self-MHC class I modulate the differentiation of MCMV-specific NK cells and
      are beneficial for host defense against MCMV infection.

AB  - The dense patch of high-mannose-type glycans surrounding the N332 glycan on the
      HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) is targeted by multiple broadly neutralizing
      antibodies (bnAbs). This region is relatively conserved, implying functional
      importance, the origins of which are not well understood. Here we describe the
      isolation of new bnAbs targeting this region. Examination of these and previously
      described antibodies to Env revealed that four different bnAb families targeted
      the (324)GDIR(327) peptide stretch at the base of the gp120 V3 loop and its
      nearby glycans. We found that this peptide stretch constitutes part of the CCR5
      co-receptor binding site, with the high-mannose patch glycans serving to
      camouflage it from most antibodies. GDIR-glycan bnAbs, in contrast, bound both
      (324)GDIR(327) peptide residues and high-mannose patch glycans, which enabled
      broad reactivity against diverse HIV isolates. Thus, as for the CD4 binding site,
      bnAb effectiveness relies on circumventing the defenses of a critical functional 
      region on Env.

AB  - A coordinated balance between the positive and negative regulation of
      pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-initiated innate inflammatory responses is
      required to ensure the most favorable outcome for the host. Post-translational
      modifications (PTMs) of innate sensors and downstream signaling molecules
      influence their activity and function by inducing their covalent linkage to new
      functional groups. PTMs including phosphorylation and polyubiquitination have
      been shown to potently regulate innate inflammatory responses through the
      activation, cellular translocation, and interaction of innate receptors,
      adaptors, and downstream signaling molecules in response to infectious and
      dangerous signals. Other PTMs such as methylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, and 
      succinylation are increasingly implicated in the regulation of innate immunity
      and inflammation. In this review, we focus on the roles of PTMs in controlling
      PRR-triggered innate immunity and inflammatory responses. The emerging roles of
      PTMs in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of infectious and inflammatory
      immune diseases are also discussed.

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are known as first responders to infections and as
      instructors of subsequent CD4(+) T cell cytokine profiles. In this issue of
      Immunity, Fan and colleagues now demonstrate that even earlier responding
      innate-like B cells (NKB) induce these protective ILC responses.

AB  - The skin barrier is essential for host defense, but how the skin provides
      protection when the barrier is breached is not well understood. In this issue of 
      Immunity, Gallo and colleagues report that keratinocytes integrate signals from
      antimicrobial peptides via MAVS signaling to amplify their antiviral immune

AB  - Long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) are durable antibody-producing cells that are key
      to immunity. Bhattacharya and colleagues find that LLPCs derive their enhanced
      survival capacity from a higher rate of glucose import. Some of this glucose
      sustains the cells through glycolysis, while the bulk is required for antibody
      glycosylation.

AB  - Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the lung are stimulated by inhaled
      allergens. ILC2s do not directly recognize allergens but they are stimulated by
      cytokines including interleukin (IL)-33 released by damaged epithelium. In
      response to allergens, lung ILC2s produce T helper 2 cell type cytokines inducing
      T cell-independent allergic lung inflammation. Here we examined the fate of lung 
      ILC2s upon allergen challenges. ILC2s proliferated and secreted cytokines upon
      initial stimulation with allergen or IL-33, and this phase was followed by a
      contraction phase as cytokine production ceased. Some ILC2s persisted long after 
      the resolution of the inflammation as allergen-experienced ILC2s and responded to
      unrelated allergens more potently than naive ILC2s, mediating severe allergic
      inflammation. The allergen-experienced ILC2s exhibited a gene expression profile 
      similar to that of memory T cells. The memory-like properties of
      allergen-experienced ILC2s may explain why asthma patients are often sensitized
      to multiple allergens.

AB  - Highly functional CD8(+) effector T (Teff) cells can persist in large numbers
      during controlled persistent infections, as exemplified by rare HIV-infected
      individuals who control the virus. Here we examined the cellular mechanisms that 
      maintain ongoing T effector responses using a mouse model for persistent
      Toxoplasma gondii infection. In mice expressing the protective MHC-I molecule,
      H-2L(d), a dominant T effector response against a single parasite antigen was
      maintained without a contraction phase, correlating with ongoing presentation of 
      the dominant antigen. Large numbers of short-lived Teff cells were continuously
      produced via a proliferative, antigen-dependent intermediate (Tint) population
      with a memory-effector hybrid phenotype. During an acute, resolved infection,
      decreasing antigen load correlated with a sharp drop in the Tint cell population 
      and subsequent loss of the ongoing effector response. Vaccination approaches
      aimed at the development of Tint populations might prove effective against
      pathogens that lead to chronic infection.

AB  - Fibroproliferative diseases are driven by dysregulated tissue repair responses
      and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality because they affect nearly every
      organ system. Type 2 cytokine responses are critically involved in tissue repair;
      however, the mechanisms that regulate beneficial regeneration versus pathological
      fibrosis are not well understood. Here, we have shown that the type 2 effector
      cytokine interleukin-13 simultaneously, yet independently, directed hepatic
      fibrosis and the compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes and biliary cells in
      progressive models of liver disease induced by interleukin-13 overexpression or
      after infection with Schistosoma mansoni. Using transgenic mice with
      interleukin-13 signaling genetically disrupted in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, or
      resident tissue fibroblasts, we have revealed direct and distinct roles for
      interleukin-13 in fibrosis, steatosis, cholestasis, and ductular reaction.
      Together, these studies show that these mechanisms are simultaneously controlled 
      but distinctly regulated by interleukin-13 signaling. Thus, it may be possible to
      promote interleukin-13-dependent hepatobiliary expansion without generating
      pathological fibrosis. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells and non-cytotoxic interferon-gamma
      (IFN-gamma)-producing group I innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) produce large amounts
      of IFN-gamma and cause activation of innate and adaptive immunity. However, how
      NKs and ILC1s are primed during infection remains elusive. Here we have shown
      that a lymphocyte subpopulation natural killer-like B (NKB) cells existed in
      spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). NKBs had unique features that differed 
      from T and B cells, and produced interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-12 at an early
      phase of infection. NKB cells played a critical role in eradication of microbial 
      infection via secretion of IL-18 and IL-12. Moreover, IL-18 deficiency abrogated 
      the antibacterial effect of NKBs. Upon bacterial challenge, NKB precursors
      (NKBPs) rapidly differentiated to NKBs that activated NKs and ILC1s against
      microbial infection. Our findings suggest that NKBs might be exploited to develop
      effective therapies for treatment of infectious diseases.

      Anti-Bacterial Innate Immunity.

AB  - The ATM kinase is a central component of the DNA damage repair machinery and
      redox balance. ATM dysfunction results in the multisystem disease
      ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). A major cause of mortality in AT is respiratory
      bacterial infections. Whether ATM deficiency causes innate immune defects that
      might contribute to bacterial infections is not known. Here we have shown that
      loss of ATM impairs inflammasome-dependent anti-bacterial innate immunity. Cells 
      from AT patients or Atm(-/-) mice exhibited diminished interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) production in response to bacteria. In vivo, Atm(-/-) mice were more
      susceptible to pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection in a manner consistent with
      inflammasome defects. Our data indicate that such defects were due to oxidative
      inhibition of inflammasome complex assembly. This study reveals an unanticipated 
      function of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in negative regulation of inflammasomes
      and proposes a theory for the notable susceptibility of AT patients to pulmonary 
      bacterial infection.

AB  - Macrophages are a crucial component of the innate immune system in sensing
      pathogens and promoting local and systemic inflammation. RIPK1 and RIPK3 are
      homologous kinases, previously linked to activation of necroptotic death. In this
      study, we have described roles for these kinases as master regulators of
      pro-inflammatory gene expression induced by lipopolysaccharide, independent of
      their well-documented cell death functions. In primary macrophages, this
      regulation was elicited in the absence of caspase-8 activity, required the
      adaptor molecule TRIF, and proceeded in a cell autonomous manner. RIPK1 and RIPK3
      kinases promoted sustained activation of Erk, cFos, and NF-kappaB, which were
      required for inflammatory changes. Utilizing genetic and pharmacologic tools, we 
      showed that RIPK1 and RIPK3 account for acute inflammatory responses induced by
      lipopolysaccharide in vivo; notably, this regulation did not require exogenous
      manipulation of caspases. These findings identified a new pharmacologically
      accessible pathway that may be relevant to inflammatory pathologies.

AB  - Durable antibody production after vaccination or infection is mediated by
      long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Pathways that specifically allow LLPCs to
      persist remain unknown. Through bioenergetic profiling, we found that human and
      mouse LLPCs could robustly engage pyruvate-dependent respiration, whereas their
      short-lived counterparts could not. LLPCs took up more glucose than did
      short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs) in vivo, and this glucose was essential for the 
      generation of pyruvate. Glucose was primarily used to glycosylate antibodies, but
      glycolysis could be promoted by stimuli such as low ATP levels and the resultant 
      pyruvate used for respiration by LLPCs. Deletion of Mpc2, which encodes an
      essential component of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, led to a progressive
      loss of LLPCs and of vaccine-specific antibodies in vivo. Thus, glucose uptake
      and mitochondrial pyruvate import prevent bioenergetic crises and allow LLPCs to 
      persist. Immunizations that maximize these plasma cell metabolic properties might
      thus provide enduring antibody-mediated immunity.

AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting many medically
      important viruses such as those that cause Zika and dengue. The inoculation of
      viruses into mosquito bite sites is an important and common stage of all
      mosquito-borne virus infections. We show, using Semliki Forest virus and
      Bunyamwera virus, that these viruses use this inflammatory niche to aid their
      replication and dissemination in vivo. Mosquito bites were characterized by an
      edema that retained virus at the inoculation site and an inflammatory influx of
      neutrophils that coordinated a localized innate immune program that inadvertently
      facilitated virus infection by encouraging the entry and infection of
      virus-permissive myeloid cells. Neutrophil depletion and therapeutic blockade of 
      inflammasome activity suppressed inflammation and abrogated the ability of the
      bite to promote infection. This study identifies facets of mosquito bite
      inflammation that are important determinants of the subsequent systemic course
      and clinical outcome of virus infection.

AB  - Genetically modified T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
      demonstrate robust responses against lineage restricted, non-essential targets in
      hematologic cancers. However, in solid tumors, the full potential of CAR T cell
      therapy is limited by the availability of cell surface antigens with sufficient
      cancer-specific expression. The majority of CAR targets have been normal
      self-antigens on dispensable hematopoietic tissues or overexpressed shared
      antigens. Here, we established that abnormal self-antigens can serve as targets
      for tumor rejection. We developed a CAR that recognized cancer-associated Tn
      glycoform of MUC1, a neoantigen expressed in a variety of cancers. Anti-Tn-MUC1
      CAR T cells demonstrated target-specific cytotoxicity and successfully controlled
      tumor growth in xenograft models of T cell leukemia and pancreatic cancer. These 
      findings demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells directed against
      Tn-MUC1 and present aberrantly glycosylated antigens as a novel class of targets 
      for tumor therapy with engineered T cells.

AB  - Greater understanding of the complex host responses induced by type 1 interferon 
      (IFN) cytokines could allow new therapeutic approaches for diseases in which
      these cytokines are implicated. We found that in response to the Toll-like
      receptor-9 agonist CpGA, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) produced type 1 IFNs,
      which, through an autocrine type 1 IFN receptor-dependent pathway, induced
      changes in cellular metabolism characterized by increased fatty acid oxidation
      (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Direct inhibition of FAO and of
      pathways that support this process, such as fatty acid synthesis, prevented full 
      pDC activation. Type 1 IFNs also induced increased FAO and OXPHOS in
      non-hematopoietic cells and were found to be responsible for increased FAO and
      OXPHOS in virus-infected cells. Increased FAO and OXPHOS in response to type 1
      IFNs was regulated by PPARalpha. Our findings reveal FAO, OXPHOS and PPARalpha as
      potential targets to therapeutically modulate downstream effects of type 1 IFNs.

TI  - The MicroRNA-183-96-182 Cluster Promotes T Helper 17 Cell Pathogenicity by
      Negatively Regulating Transcription Factor Foxo1 Expression.

AB  - T helper 17 (Th17) cells are key players in autoimmune diseases. However, the
      roles of non-coding RNAs in Th17 cell development and function are largely
      unknown. We found that deletion of the endoribonuclease-encoding Dicer1
      specifically in Th17 cells protected mice from experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis. We found that the Dicer1-regulated microRNA (miR)-183-96-182
      cluster (miR-183C) was highly expressed in Th17 cells and was induced by cytokine
      IL-6-STAT3 signaling. miR-183C expression enhanced pathogenic cytokine production
      from Th17 cells during their development and promoted autoimmunity.
      Mechanistically, miR-183C in Th17 cells directly repressed expression of the
      transcription factor Foxo1. Foxo1 negatively regulated the pathogenicity of Th17 
      cells in part by inhibiting expression of cytokine receptor IL-1R1. These
      findings indicate that the miR-183C drives Th17 pathogenicity in autoimmune
      diseases via inhibition of Foxo1 and present promising therapeutic targets.

AB  - Inhibition of immune regulatory checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and the PD-1-PD-L1
      axis, is at the forefront of immunotherapy for cancers of various histological
      types. However, such immunotherapies fail to control neoplasia in a significant
      proportion of patients. Here, we review how a range of cancer-cell-autonomous
      cues, tumor-microenvironmental factors, and host-related influences might account
      for the heterogeneous responses and failures often encountered during therapies
      using immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, we describe the emerging evidence 
      of how the strong interrelationship between the immune system and the host
      microbiota can determine responses to cancer therapies, and we introduce a
      concept by which prior or concomitant modulation of the gut microbiome could
      optimize therapeutic outcomes upon immune-checkpoint blockade.

AB  - Effective pathogens are successful, by definition, because they can defeat our
      immune response. Pingen et al. (2016) in this issue of Immunity demonstrate that 
      some mosquito-transmitted viruses depend upon a strong host immune response
      triggered by the innate immune response to the bite to promote dissemination
      through the body.

AB  - Sepsis is a host inflammatory response to severe infection associated with high
      mortality that is caused by lymphopenia-associated immunodeficiency. However, it 
      is unknown how lymphopenia persists after the accelerated lymphocyte apoptosis
      subsides. Here we show that sepsis rapidly ablated osteoblasts, which reduced the
      number of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). Osteoblast ablation or inducible
      deletion of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in osteoblasts recapitulated the lymphopenic
      phenotype together with a lower CLP number without affecting hematopoietic stem
      cells (HSCs). Pharmacological activation of osteoblasts improved sepsis-induced
      lymphopenia. This study demonstrates a reciprocal interaction between the immune 
      and bone systems, in which acute inflammation induces a defect in bone cells
      resulting in lymphopenia-associated immunodeficiency, indicating that bone cells 
      comprise a therapeutic target in certain life-threatening immune reactions.

AB  - Obesity has been shown to increase the morbidity of infections, however, the
      underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that obesity
      caused adiponectin deficiency in the bone marrow (BM), which led to an inflamed
      BM characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production from bone
      marrow macrophages. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) chronically
      exposed to excessive TNF in obese marrow aberrantly expressed cytokine signaling 
      suppressor SOCS3, impairing JAK-STAT mediated signal transduction and
      cytokine-driven cell proliferation. Accordingly, both obese and
      adiponectin-deficient mice showed attenuated clearance of infected Listeria
      monocytogenes, indicating that obesity or loss of adiponectin is critical for
      exacerbation of infection. Adiponectin treatment restored the defective HSPC
      proliferation and bacterial clearance of obese and adiponectin-deficient mice,
      affirming the importance of adiponectin against infection. Taken together, our
      findings demonstrate that obesity impairs hematopoietic response against
      infections through a TNF-SOCS3-STAT3 axis, highlighting adiponectin as a
      legitimate target against obesity-related infections.

AB  - Distinct metabolic programs support the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into
      separate functional subsets. In this study, we investigated metabolic mechanisms 
      underlying the differentiation of IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cells (Th9) in allergic
      airway inflammation and cancerous tumors. We found that histone deacetylase SIRT1
      negatively regulated Th9 cell differentiation. A deficiency of SIRT1 induced by
      either conditional deletion in mouse CD4(+) T cells or the use of small
      interfering RNA (siRNA) in mouse or human T cells increased IL-9 production,
      whereas ectopic SIRT1 expression inhibited it. Notably, SIRT1 inhibited Th9 cell 
      differentiation that regulated anti-tumor immunity and allergic pulmonary
      inflammation. Glycolytic activation through the mTOR-hypoxia-inducible
      factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) was required for the differentiation of Th9 cells that 
      conferred protection against tumors and is involved in allergic airway
      inflammation. Our results define the essential features of SIRT1-mTOR-HIF1alpha
      signaling-coupled glycolytic pathway in inducing Th9 cell differentiation, with
      implications for metabolic reprogramming as an immunotherapeutic approach.

AB  - T helper 17 (Th17) cells are prominently featured in multiple autoimmune
      diseases, but the regulatory mechanisms that control Th17 cell responses are
      poorly defined. Here we found that stimulation of OX40 triggered a robust
      chromatin remodeling response and produced a "closed" chromatin structure at
      interleukin-17 (IL-17) locus to inhibit Th17 cell function. OX40 activated the
      NF-kappaB family member RelB, and RelB recruited the histone methyltransferases
      G9a and SETDB1 to the Il17 locus to deposit "repressive" chromatin marks at H3K9 
      sites, and consequently repressing IL-17 expression. Unlike its transcriptional
      activities, RelB acted independently of both p52 and p50 in the suppression of
      IL-17. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease model, we
      found that OX40 stimulation inhibited IL-17 and reduced EAE. Conversely,
      RelB-deficient CD4(+) T cells showed enhanced IL-17 induction and exacerbated the
      disease. Our data uncover a mechanism in the control of Th17 cells that might
      have important clinic implications.

AB  - Although numerous polymorphisms have been associated with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), identifying the function of these genetic factors has proved
      challenging. Here we identified a role for nine genes in IBD susceptibility loci 
      in antibacterial autophagy and characterized a role for one of these genes,
      GPR65, in maintaining lysosome function. Mice lacking Gpr65, a proton-sensing G
      protein-coupled receptor, showed increased susceptibly to bacteria-induced
      colitis. Epithelial cells and macrophages lacking GPR65 exhibited impaired
      clearance of intracellular bacteria and accumulation of aberrant lysosomes.
      Similarly, IBD patient cells and epithelial cells expressing an IBD-associated
      missense variant, GPR65 I231L, displayed aberrant lysosomal pH resulting in
      lysosomal dysfunction, impaired bacterial restriction, and altered lipid droplet 
      formation. The GPR65 I231L polymorphism was sufficient to confer decreased GPR65 
      signaling. Collectively, these data establish a role for GPR65 in IBD
      susceptibility and identify lysosomal dysfunction as a potentially causative
      element in IBD pathogenesis with effects on cellular homeostasis and defense.

AB  - Monobenzone is a pro-hapten that is exclusively metabolized by melanocytes,
      thereby haptenizing melanocyte-specific antigens, which results in cytotoxic
      autoimmunity specifically against pigmented cells. Studying monobenzone in a
      setting of contact hypersensitivity (CHS), we observed that monobenzone induced a
      long-lasting, melanocyte-specific immune response that was dependent on NK cells,
      yet fully intact in the absence of T- and B cells. Consistent with the concept of
      "memory NK cells," monobenzone-induced NK cells resided in the liver and transfer
      of these cells conferred melanocyte-specific immunity to naive animals.
      Monobenzone-exposed skin displayed macrophage infiltration and cutaneous lymph
      nodes showed an inflammasome-dependent influx of macrophages with a
      tissue-resident phenotype, coinciding with local NK cell activation. Indeed,
      macrophage depletion or the absence of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the adaptor
      protein ASC or interleukin-18 (IL-18) abolished monobenzone CHS, thereby
      establishing a non-redundant role for the NLRP3 inflammasome as a critical
      proinflammatory checkpoint in the induction of hapten-dependent memory NK cells.

AB  - Two zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs)-SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-have crossed species to
      cause severe human respiratory disease. Here, we showed that induction of airway 
      memory CD4(+) T cells specific for a conserved epitope shared by SARS-CoV and
      MERS-CoV is a potential strategy for developing pan-coronavirus vaccines. Airway 
      memory CD4(+) T cells differed phenotypically and functionally from lung-derived 
      cells and were crucial for protection against both CoVs in mice. Protection was
      dependent on interferon-gamma and required early induction of robust innate and
      virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized
      in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic
      mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this
      epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many
      human CoVs. Vaccine strategies that induce airway memory CD4(+) T cells targeting
      conserved epitopes might have broad applicability in the context of new CoVs and 
      other respiratory virus outbreaks.

AB  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells promote affinity maturation of B cells in
      germinal centers (GCs), whereas T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells limit the GC 
      reaction. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) through Ca(2+) release-activated
      Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels mediated by STIM and ORAI proteins is a fundamental
      signaling pathway in T lymphocytes. Conditional deletion of Stim1 and Stim2 genes
      in T cells abolished SOCE and strongly reduced antibody-mediated immune responses
      following viral infection caused by impaired differentiation and function of Tfh 
      cells. Conversely, aging Stim1Stim2-deficient mice developed humoral autoimmunity
      with spontaneous autoantibody production due to abolished Tfr cell
      differentiation in the presence of residual Tfh cells. Mechanistically, SOCE
      controlled Tfr and Tfh cell differentiation through NFAT-mediated IRF4, BATF, and
      Bcl-6 transcription-factor expression. SOCE had a dual role in controlling the GC
      reaction by regulating both Tfh and Tfr cell differentiation, thus enabling
      protective B cell responses and preventing humoral autoimmunity.

AB  - Receptor CD300b is implicated in regulating the immune response to bacterial
      infection by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identified CD300b as a
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding receptor and determined the mechanism underlying
      CD300b augmentation of septic shock. In vivo depletion and adoptive transfer
      studies identified CD300b-expressing macrophages as the key cell type augmenting 
      sepsis. We showed that CD300b, and its adaptor DAP12, associated with Toll-like
      receptor 4 (TLR4) upon LPS binding, thereby enhancing TLR4-adaptor MyD88- and
      TRIF-dependent signaling that resulted in an elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine
      storm. LPS engagement of the CD300b-TLR4 complex led to the recruitment and
      activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K). This resulted in an
      inhibition of the ERK1/2 protein kinase- and NF-kappaB transcription
      factor-mediated signaling pathways, which subsequently led to a reduced
      interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Collectively, our data describe a mechanism of
      TLR4 signaling regulated by CD300b in myeloid cells in response to LPS.

TI  - Fine-Tuning of CD8(+) T Cell Mitochondrial Metabolism by the Respiratory Chain
      Repressor MCJ Dictates Protection to Influenza Virus.

AB  - Mitochondrial respiration is regulated in CD8(+) T cells during the transition
      from naive to effector and memory cells, but mechanisms controlling this process 
      have not been defined. Here we show that MCJ (methylation-controlled J protein)
      acted as an endogenous break for mitochondrial respiration in CD8(+) T cells by
      interfering with the formation of electron transport chain respiratory
      supercomplexes. Metabolic profiling revealed enhanced mitochondrial metabolism in
      MCJ-deficient CD8(+) T cells. Increased oxidative phosphorylation and subcellular
      ATP accumulation caused by MCJ deficiency selectively increased the secretion,
      but not expression, of interferon-gamma. MCJ also adapted effector CD8(+) T cell 
      metabolism during the contraction phase. Consequently, memory CD8(+) T cells
      lacking MCJ provided superior protection against influenza virus infection. Thus,
      MCJ offers a mechanism for fine-tuning CD8(+) T cell mitochondrial metabolism as 
      an alternative to modulating mitochondrial mass, an energetically expensive
      process. MCJ could be a therapeutic target to enhance CD8(+) T cell responses.

TI  - Memory CD8(+) T Cells Require Increased Concentrations of Acetate Induced by
      Stress for Optimal Function.

AB  - How systemic metabolic alterations during acute infections impact immune cell
      function remains poorly understood. We found that acetate accumulates in the
      serum within hours of systemic bacterial infections and that these increased
      acetate concentrations are required for optimal memory CD8(+) T cell function in 
      vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, upon uptake by memory CD8(+) T cells, stress 
      levels of acetate expanded the cellular acetyl-coenzyme A pool via ATP citrate
      lyase and promoted acetylation of the enzyme GAPDH. This context-dependent
      post-translational modification enhanced GAPDH activity, catalyzing glycolysis
      and thus boosting rapid memory CD8(+) T cell responses. Accordingly, in a murine 
      Listeria monocytogenes model, transfer of acetate-augmented memory CD8(+) T cells
      exerted superior immune control compared to control cells. Our results
      demonstrate that increased systemic acetate concentrations are functionally
      integrated by CD8(+) T cells and translate into increased glycolytic and
      functional capacity. The immune system thus directly relates systemic metabolism 
      with immune alertness.

TI  - Early Antibody Lineage Diversification and Independent Limb Maturation Lead to

AB  - The high-mannose patch on HIV Env is a preferred target for broadly neutralizing 
      antibodies (bnAbs), but to date, no vaccination regimen has elicited bnAbs
      against this region. Here, we present the development of a bnAb lineage targeting
      the high-mannose patch in an HIV-1 subtype-C-infected donor from sub-Saharan
      Africa. The Abs first acquired autologous neutralization, then gradually matured 
      to achieve breadth. One Ab neutralized >47% of HIV-1 strains with only
      approximately 11% somatic hypermutation and no insertions or deletions. By
      sequencing autologous env, we determined key residues that triggered the lineage 
      and participated in Ab-Env coevolution. Next-generation sequencing of the Ab
      repertoire showed an early expansive diversification of the lineage followed by
      independent maturation of individual limbs, several of them developing notable
      breadth and potency. Overall, the findings are encouraging from a vaccine
      standpoint and suggest immunization strategies mimicking the evolution of the
      entire high-mannose patch and promoting maturation of multiple diverse Ab
      pathways.

AB  - Chronic viruses and cancers thwart immune responses in humans by inducing T cell 
      dysfunction. Using a murine chronic virus that models human infections, we
      investigated the function of the adhesion molecule, P-selectin glycoprotein
      ligand-1 (PSGL-1), that is upregulated on responding T cells. PSGL-1-deficient
      mice cleared the virus due to increased intrinsic survival of multifunctional
      effector T cells that had downregulated PD-1 as well as other inhibitory
      receptors. Notably, this response resulted in CD4(+)-T-cell-dependent
      immunopathology. Mechanistically, PSGL-1 ligation on exhausted CD8(+) T cells
      inhibited T cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling and
      upregulated PD-1, leading to diminished survival with TCR stimulation. In models 
      of melanoma cancer in which T cell dysfunction occurs, PSGL-1 deficiency led to
      PD-1 downregulation, improved T cell responses, and tumor control. Thus, PSGL-1
      plays a fundamental role in balancing viral control and immunopathology and also 
      functions to regulate T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing Foxp3 transcripton factor are essential for 
      immune homeostasis. They arise in the thymus as a separate lineage from
      conventional CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T (Tconv) cells. Here, we show that the thymic
      development of Treg cells depends on the expression of their endogenous cognate
      self-antigen. The formation of these cells was impaired in mice lacking this
      self-antigen, while Tconv cell development was not negatively affected.
      Thymus-derived Treg cells were selected by self-antigens in a specific manner,
      while autoreactive Tconv cells were produced through degenerate recognition of
      distinct antigens. These distinct modes of development were associated with the
      expression of T cell receptor of higher functional avidity for self-antigen by
      Treg cells than Tconv cells, a difference subsequently essential for the control 
      of autoimmunity. Our study documents how self-antigens define the repertoire of
      thymus-derived Treg cells to subsequently endow this cell type with the capacity 
      to undermine autoimmune attack.

AB  - Signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) controls adaptive immune responses.
      Antigen binding to TCRalphabeta transmits signals through the plasma membrane to 
      induce phosphorylation of the CD3 cytoplasmic tails by incompletely understood
      mechanisms. Here we show that cholesterol bound to the TCRbeta transmembrane
      region keeps the TCR in a resting, inactive conformation that cannot be
      phosphorylated by active kinases. Only TCRs that spontaneously detached from
      cholesterol could switch to the active conformation (termed primed TCRs) and then
      be phosphorylated. Indeed, by modulating cholesterol binding genetically or
      enzymatically, we could switch the TCR between the resting and primed states. The
      active conformation was stabilized by binding to peptide-MHC, which thus
      controlled TCR signaling. These data are explained by a model of reciprocal
      allosteric regulation of TCR phosphorylation by cholesterol and ligand binding.
      Our results provide both a molecular mechanism and a conceptual framework for how
      lipid-receptor interactions regulate signal transduction.

AB  - Vaccines against HIV most likely need to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. 
      In this issue of Immunity, Poignard and colleagues describe the co-evolution of a
      broadly neutralizing antibody and the virus that triggered it, providing a
      template for HIV vaccine design.

AB  - Pregnancy uniquely allows genetically discordant tissues of the mother and child 
      to intimately coexist in harmony. In this issue of Immunity, Ou and colleagues
      show that hepatitis B virus exploits these naturally occurring immune tolerance
      pathways to establish persistent postnatal infection in offspring.

AB  - Although regulatory T cells protect people from autoimmunity, two recent papers
      in Immunity (Malchow et al., 2016; Kieback et al., 2016) demonstrate that these
      cells are also a crisis averted. Without the proper education in the thymus,
      these cells will turn on their host and cause autoimmunity.

AB  - Checkpoint-blocking antibodies can generate potent anti-tumor responses by
      encouraging the immune system to seek and destroy cancer cells. At this time, the
      United States Food and Drug Administration has approved three checkpoint-blocking
      antibodies in three disease indications, and additional approvals are expected to
      broaden the clinical scope of immunotherapy. Herein, we review the clinical
      development of CTLA-4-, PD-1-, and PD-L1-blocking antibodies across tumor types
      and briefly discuss areas of active investigation of potential biomarkers.

AB  - Costimulatory and inhibitory receptors play a key role in regulating immune
      responses to infections. Recent translation of knowledge about inhibitory
      receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 into the cancer clinic highlights the
      opportunities to manipulate these pathways to treat human disease. Studies in
      infectious disease have provided key insights into the specific roles of these
      pathways and the effects of their manipulation. Here, recent studies are
      discussed that have addressed how major inhibitory and costimulatory pathways
      play a role in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic infections.
      Mechanistic insights from studies of infectious disease provide opportunities to 
      further expand our toolkit to treat cancer and chronic infections in the clinic.

AB  - The immune system is guided by a series of checks and balances, a major component
      of which is a large array of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory pathways that
      modulate the host response. Although co-stimulation is essential for boosting and
      shaping the initial response following signaling through the antigen receptor,
      inhibitory pathways are also critical for modulating the immune response.
      Excessive co-stimulation and/or insufficient co-inhibition can lead to a
      breakdown of self-tolerance and thus to autoimmunity. In this review, we will
      focus on the role of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory pathways in two systemic
      (systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis) and two organ-specific
      (multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes) emblematic autoimmune diseases. We will 
      also discuss how mechanistic analysis of these pathways has led to the
      identification of potential therapeutic targets and initiation of clinical trials
      for autoimmune diseases, as well as outline some of the challenges that lie
      ahead.

AB  - The ultimate outcome of alloreactivity versus tolerance following transplantation
      is potently influenced by the constellation of cosignaling molecules expressed by
      immune cells during priming with alloantigen, and the net sum of costimulatory
      and coinhibitory signals transmitted via ligation of these molecules. Intense
      investigation over the last two decades has yielded a detailed understanding of
      the kinetics, cellular distribution, and intracellular signaling networks of
      cosignaling molecules such as the CD28, TNF, and TIM families of receptors in
      alloimmunity. More recent work has better defined the cellular and molecular
      mechanisms by which engagement of cosignaling networks serve to either dampen or 
      augment alloimmunity. These findings will likely aid in the rational development 
      of novel immunomodulatory strategies to prolong graft survival and improve
      outcomes following transplantation.

AB  - Cytokines related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) provide a communication network 
      essential for coordinating multiple cell types into an effective host defense
      system against pathogens and malignant cells. The pathways controlled by the TNF 
      superfamily differentiate both innate and adaptive immune cells and modulate
      stromal cells into microenvironments conducive to host defenses. Members of the
      TNF receptor superfamily activate diverse cellular functions from the production 
      of type 1 interferons to the modulation of survival of antigen-activated T cells.
      Here, we focus attention on the subset of TNF superfamily receptors encoded in
      the immune response locus in chromosomal region 1p36. Recent studies have
      revealed that these receptors use diverse mechanisms to either co-stimulate or
      restrict immune responses. Translation of the fundamental mechanisms of TNF
      superfamily is leading to the design of therapeutics that can alter pathogenic
      processes in several autoimmune diseases or promote immunity to tumors.

AB  - Co-inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, have an important role in
      regulating T cell responses and have proven to be effective targets in the
      setting of chronic diseases where constitutive co-inhibitory receptor expression 
      on T cells dampens effector T cell responses. Unfortunately, many patients still 
      fail to respond to therapies that target CTLA-4 and PD-1. The next wave of
      co-inhibitory receptor targets that are being explored in clinical trials include
      Lag-3, Tim-3, and TIGIT. These receptors, although they belong to the same class 
      of receptors as PD-1 and CTLA-4, exhibit unique functions, especially at tissue
      sites where they regulate distinct aspects of immunity. Increased understanding
      of the specialized functions of these receptors will inform the rational
      application of therapies that target these receptors to the clinic.

AB  - Ligation of the CD28 receptor on T cells provides a critical second signal
      alongside T cell receptor (TCR) ligation for naive T cell activation. Here, we
      discuss the expression, structure, and biochemistry of CD28 and its ligands. CD28
      signals play a key role in many T cell processes, including cytoskeletal
      remodeling, production of cytokines, survival, and differentiation. CD28 ligation
      leads to unique epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-translational changes in T 
      cells that cannot be recapitulated by TCR ligation alone. We discuss the function
      of CD28 and its ligands in both effector and regulatory T cells. CD28 is critical
      for regulatory T cell survival and the maintenance of immune homeostasis. We
      outline the roles that CD28 and its family members play in human disease and we
      review the clinical efficacy of drugs that block CD28 ligands. Despite the
      centrality of CD28 and its family members and ligands to immune function, many
      aspects of CD28 biology remain unclear. Translation of a basic understanding of
      CD28 function into immunomodulatory therapeutics has been uneven, with both
      successes and failures. Such real-world results might stem from multiple factors,
      including complex receptor-ligand interactions among CD28 family members,
      differences between the mouse and human CD28 families, and cell-type specific
      roles of CD28 family members.

AB  - Immune responses need to be controlled for optimal protective immunity and
      tolerance. Coinhibitory pathways in the B7-CD28 family provide critical
      inhibitory signals that regulate immune homeostasis and defense and protect
      tissue integrity. These coinhibitory signals limit the strength and duration of
      immune responses, thereby curbing immune-mediated tissue damage, regulating
      resolution of inflammation, and maintaining tolerance to prevent autoimmunity.
      Tumors and microbes that cause chronic infections can exploit these coinhibitory 
      pathways to establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment, hindering their
      eradication. Advances in understanding T cell coinhibitory pathways have
      stimulated a new era of immunotherapy with effective drugs to treat cancer,
      autoimmune and infectious diseases, and transplant rejection. In this review we
      discuss the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the coinhibitory
      functions of pathways in the B7-CD28 family, the diverse functional consequences 
      of these inhibitory signals on immune responses, and the overlapping and unique
      functions of these key immunoregulatory pathways.

AB  - Inflammatory intestinal diseases are characterized by abnormal immune responses
      and affect distinct locations of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the role of
      several immune subsets in driving intestinal pathology has been studied, a
      system-wide approach that simultaneously interrogates all major lineages on a
      single-cell basis is lacking. We used high-dimensional mass cytometry to generate
      a system-wide view of the human mucosal immune system in health and disease. We
      distinguished 142 immune subsets and through computational applications found
      distinct immune subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal
      biopsies that distinguished patients from controls. In addition, mucosal lymphoid
      malignancies were readily detected as well as precursors from which these likely 
      derived. These findings indicate that an integrated high-dimensional analysis of 
      the entire immune system can identify immune subsets associated with the
      pathogenesis of complex intestinal disorders. This might have implications for
      diagnostic procedures, immune-monitoring, and treatment of intestinal diseases
      and mucosal malignancies.

AB  - Self-DNA is present in the cytosol of many cancer cells and can promote effective
      immune rejection of tumor cells, but the mechanisms leading to the presence of
      cytosolic DNA are unknown. Here, we report that the cleavage of genomic DNA by
      DNA structure-specific endonuclease MUS81 and PARP-dependent DNA repair pathways 
      leads to the accumulation of cytosolic DNA in prostate cancer cells. The number
      of nuclear MUS81 foci and the amount of cytosolic dsDNA increased in tandem from 
      hyperplasia to clinical stage II prostate cancers and decreased at stage III.
      Cytosolic DNA generated by MUS81 stimulated DNA sensor STING-dependent type I
      interferon (IFN) expression and promoted phagocytic and T cell responses,
      resulting in type I and II IFN-mediated rejection of prostate tumor cells via
      mechanisms that partly depended on macrophages. Our results demonstrate that the 
      tumor suppressor MUS81 alerts the immune system to the presence of transformed
      host cells.

      Pathway that Protects Mice from Viral Pathogenesis.

AB  - The transcription factor IRF-3 mediates cellular antiviral response by inducing
      the expression of interferon and other antiviral proteins. In RNA-virus infected 
      cells, IRF-3's transcriptional activation is triggered primarily by RIG-I-like
      receptors (RLR), which can also activate the RLR-induced IRF-3-mediated pathway
      of apoptosis (RIPA). Here, we have reported that the pathway of IRF-3 activation 
      in RIPA was independent of and distinct from the known pathway of transcriptional
      activation of IRF-3. It required linear polyubiquitination of two specific lysine
      residues of IRF-3 by LUBAC, the linear polyubiquitinating enzyme complex, which
      bound IRF-3 in signal-dependent fashion. To evaluate the role of RIPA in viral
      pathogenesis, we engineered a genetically targeted mouse, which expressed a
      mutant IRF-3 that was RIPA-competent but transcriptionally inert; this
      single-action IRF-3 could protect mice from lethal viral infection. Our
      observations indicated that IRF-3-mediated apoptosis of virus-infected cells
      could be an effective antiviral mechanism, without expression of the
      interferon-stimulated genes.

AB  - The current model of murine innate lymphoid cell (ILC) development holds that
      mouse ILCs are derived downstream of the common lymphoid progenitor through
      lineage-restricted progenitors. However, corresponding lineage-restricted
      progenitors in humans have yet to be discovered. Here we identified a progenitor 
      population in human secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) that expressed the
      transcription factor RORgammat and was unique in its ability to generate all
      known ILC subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, but not other leukocyte
      populations. In contrast to murine fate-mapping data, which indicate that only
      ILC3s express Rorgammat, these human progenitor cells as well as human peripheral
      blood NK cells and all mature ILC populations expressed RORgammat. Thus, all
      human ILCs can be generated through an RORgammat(+) developmental pathway from a 
      common progenitor in SLTs. These findings help establish the developmental
      signals and pathways involved in human ILC development.

AB  - The signals guiding differentiation of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) within
      tissues are not well understood. Salivary gland (SG) ILCs as well as liver and
      intestinal intraepithelial ILC1 have markers that denote tissue residency and
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) imprinting. We deleted Tgfbr2 in cells
      expressing the ILC and NK marker NKp46 and found that SG ILCs were reduced in
      number. They lost distinct tissue markers, such as CD49a, and the effector
      molecules TRAIL and CD73. Expression of the transcription factor Eomes, which
      promotes NK cell differentiation, was elevated. Conversely, Eomes deletion in
      NKp46(+) cells enhanced TGF-beta-imprinting of SG ILCs. Thus, TGF-beta induces SG
      ILC differentiation by suppressing Eomes. TGF-beta acted through a JNK-dependent,
      Smad4-independent pathway. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that SG ILCs had
      characteristic of both NK cells and ILC1. Finally, TGF-beta imprinting of SG ILCs
      was synchronized with SG development, highlighting the impact of tissue
      microenvironment on ILC development.

AB  - In contrast to horizontal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) between adults,
      which often leads to self-limited acute infection, vertical transmission of HBV
      from mother to child often leads to chronic infection. However, the mechanisms
      linking vertical transmission with chronic infection are not known. We developed 
      a mouse model to study the effect of maternal HBV infection on HBV persistence in
      offspring and found that HBV carried by the mother impaired CD8(+) T cell
      responses to HBV in her offspring, resulting in HBV persistence. This impairment 
      of CD8(+) T cell responses was mediated by hepatic macrophages, which were
      predisposed by maternal HBV e antigen (HBeAg) to support HBV persistence by
      upregulation of inhibitory ligand PD-L1 and altered polarization upon
      restimulation with HBeAg. Depletion of hepatic macrophages led to CD8(+) T cell
      activation and HBV clearance in the offspring, raising the possibility of
      targeting macrophages to treat chronic HBV patients.

AB  - Hemorrhagic stroke and brain microbleeds are caused by cerebrovascular ruptures. 
      Fast repair of such ruptures is the most promising therapeutic approach. Due to a
      lack of high-resolution in vivo real-time studies, the dynamic cellular events
      involved in cerebrovascular repair remain unknown. Here, we have developed a
      cerebrovascular rupture system in zebrafish by using multi-photon laser, which
      generates a lesion with two endothelial ends. In vivo time-lapse imaging showed
      that a macrophage arrived at the lesion and extended filopodia or lamellipodia to
      physically adhere to both endothelial ends. This macrophage generated mechanical 
      traction forces to pull the endothelial ends and facilitate their ligation, thus 
      mediating the repair of the rupture. Both depolymerization of microfilaments and 
      inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase or Rac1 activity disrupted
      macrophage-endothelial adhesion and impaired cerebrovascular repair. Our study
      reveals a hitherto unexpected role for macrophages in mediating repair of
      cerebrovascular ruptures through direct physical adhesion and mechanical
      traction.

AB  - The promiscuous expression of tissue-restricted antigens in the thymus, driven in
      part by autoimmune regulator (Aire), is critical for the protection of peripheral
      tissues from autoimmune attack. Aire-dependent processes are thought to promote
      both clonal deletion and the development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells,
      suggesting that autoimmunity associated with Aire deficiency results from two
      failed tolerance mechanisms. Here, examination of autoimmune lesions in Aire(-/-)
      mice revealed an unexpected third possibility. We found that the predominant
      conventional T cell clonotypes infiltrating target lesions express antigen
      receptors that were preferentially expressed by Foxp3(+) Treg cells in Aire(+/+) 
      mice. Thus, Aire enforces immune tolerance by ensuring that distinct autoreactive
      T cell specificities differentiate into the Treg cell lineage; dysregulation of
      this process results in the diversion of Treg cell-biased clonotypes into
      pathogenic conventional T cells.

TI  - Expansion and Activation of CD103(+) Dendritic Cell Progenitors at the Tumor Site
      Enhances Tumor Responses to Therapeutic PD-L1 and BRAF Inhibition.

AB  - Large numbers of melanoma lesions develop resistance to targeted inhibition of
      mutant BRAF or fail to respond to checkpoint blockade. We explored whether
      modulation of intratumoral antigen-presenting cells (APCs) could increase
      responses to these therapies. Using mouse melanoma models, we found that CD103(+)
      dendritic cells (DCs) were the only APCs transporting intact antigens to the
      lymph nodes and priming tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. CD103(+) DCs were required
      to promote anti-tumoral effects upon blockade of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1;
      however, PD-L1 inhibition only led to partial responses. Systemic administration 
      of the growth factor FLT3L followed by intratumoral poly I:C injections expanded 
      and activated CD103(+) DC progenitors in the tumor, enhancing responses to BRAF
      and PD-L1 blockade and protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. Thus, the paucity 
      of activated CD103(+) DCs in tumors limits checkpoint-blockade efficacy and
      combined FLT3L and poly I:C therapy can enhance tumor responses to checkpoint and
      BRAF blockade.

LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2016.04.003 [doi]
AB  - The participation of a specific subset of B cells and how they are regulated in
      cancer is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the proportion of CD5(+) relative to
      interleukin-6 receptor alpha (IL-6Ralpha)-expressing B cells was greatly
      increased in tumors. CD5(+) B cells responded to IL-6 in the absence of
      IL-6Ralpha. IL-6 directly bound to CD5, leading to activation of the
      transcription factor STAT3 via gp130 and its downstream kinase JAK2. STAT3
      upregulated CD5 expression, thereby forming a feed-forward loop in the B cells.
      In mouse tumor models, CD5(+) but not CD5(-) B cells promoted tumor growth.
      CD5(+) B cells also showed activation of STAT3 in multiple types of human tumor
      tissues. Thus, our findings demonstrate a critical role of CD5(+) B cells in
      promoting cancer.

AB  - Sickness behavior and cognitive dysfunction occur frequently by unknown
      mechanisms in virus-infected individuals with malignancies treated with type I
      interferons (IFNs) and in patients with autoimmune disorders. We found that
      during sickness behavior, single-stranded RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA
      ligands, and IFNs shared pathways involving engagement of melanoma
      differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1
      (RIG-I), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), and subsequently
      induced IFN responses specifically in brain endothelia and epithelia of mice.
      Behavioral alterations were specifically dependent on brain endothelial and
      epithelial IFN receptor chain 1 (IFNAR). Using gene profiling, we identified that
      the endothelia-derived chemokine ligand CXCL10 mediated behavioral changes
      through impairment of synaptic plasticity. These results identified brain
      endothelial and epithelial cells as natural gatekeepers for virus-induced
      sickness behavior, demonstrated tissue specific IFNAR engagement, and established
      the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis as target for the treatment of behavioral changes during
      virus infection and type I IFN therapy.

AB  - Gut microbiota profoundly affect gut and systemic diseases, but the mechanism
      whereby microbiota affect systemic diseases is unclear. It is not known whether
      specific microbiota regulate T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, whose excessive
      responses can inflict antibody-mediated autoimmunity. Using the K/BxN autoimmune 
      arthritis model, we demonstrated that Peyer's patch (PP) Tfh cells were essential
      for gut commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB)-induced systemic arthritis
      despite the production of auto-antibodies predominantly occurring in systemic
      lymphoid tissues, not PPs. We determined that SFB, by driving differentiation and
      egress of PP Tfh cells into systemic sites, boosted systemic Tfh cell and
      auto-antibody responses that exacerbated arthritis. SFB induced PP Tfh cell
      differentiation by limiting the access of interleukin 2 to CD4(+) T cells,
      thereby enhancing Tfh cell master regulator Bcl-6 in a dendritic cell-dependent
      manner. These findings showed that gut microbiota remotely regulated a systemic
      disease by driving the induction and egress of gut Tfh cells.

AB  - Recognition of DNA and RNA by endosomal and cytosolic sensors constitutes a
      central element in the detection of microbial invaders by the innate immune
      system. However, the capacity of these sensors to discriminate between microbial 
      and endogenous nucleic acids is limited. Over the past few years, evidence has
      accumulated to suggest that endogenous DNA or RNA species can engage
      nucleic-acid-sensing pattern-recognition receptors that can trigger or sustain
      detrimental pathology. Here, we review principles of how the activation of innate
      sensors by host nucleic acids is prevented in the steady state and discuss four
      important determinants of whether a nucleic-acid-driven innate response is
      mounted. These include structural features of the ligand being sensed, the
      subcellular location and quantity of pathogen-derived or endogenous nucleic
      acids, and the regulation of sensor-activation thresholds. Furthermore, we
      emphasize disease mechanisms initiated by failure to discriminate self from
      non-self in nucleic acid detection.

AB  - Allergic disease affects millions. Despite many advances in our understanding of 
      the immune system in the past century, the physiologic underpinning for the
      existence of allergy remains largely mysterious. Food allergies, in particular,
      have increased dramatically in recent years, adding a new sense of urgency to
      unraveling this mystery. The concurrence of significant lifestyle changes in
      Western societies with increasing disease prevalence implies a causal link.
      Demographic variables that influence the composition and function of the
      commensal microbiota early in life seem to be most important. Identifying the
      evolutionary and physiologic foundations of allergic disease and defining what
      about our modern environment is responsible for its increased incidence will
      provide insights critical to the development of new approaches to prevention and 
      treatment.

AB  - Metagenomic studies show that diverse resident viruses inhabit the healthy gut;
      however, little is known about the role of these viruses in the maintenance of
      gut homeostasis. We found that mice treated with antiviral cocktail displayed
      more severe dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis compared with untreated 
      mice. DSS-induced colitis was associated with altered enteric viral abundance and
      composition. When wild-type mice were reconstituted with Toll-like receptor 3
      (TLR3) or TLR7 agonists or inactivated rotavirus, colitis symptoms were
      significantly ameliorated. Mice deficient in both TLR3 and TLR7 were more
      susceptible to DSS-induced experimental colitis. In humans, combined TLR3 and
      TLR7 genetic variations significantly influenced the severity of ulcerative
      colitis. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells isolated from inflamed mouse colon produced
      interferon-beta in a TLR3 and TLR7-dependent manner. These results imply that
      recognition of resident viruses by TLR3 and TLR7 is required for protective
      immunity during gut inflammation.

AB  - Eosinophils are now recognized as multifunctional leukocytes that provide
      critical homeostatic signals to maintain other immune cells and aid tissue
      repair. Paradoxically, eosinophils also express an armory of granule-localized
      toxins and hydrolases believed to contribute to pathology in inflammatory
      disease. How eosinophils deliver their supporting functions while avoiding
      self-inflicted injury is poorly understood. We have demonstrated that cystatin F 
      (CF) is a critical survival factor for eosinophils. Eosinophils from CF null mice
      had reduced lifespan, reduced granularity, and disturbed granule morphology. In
      vitro, cysteine protease inhibitors restored granularity, demonstrating that
      control of cysteine protease activity by CF is critical for normal eosinophil
      development. CF null mice showed reduced pulmonary pathology in a model of
      allergic lung inflammation but also reduced ability to combat infection by the
      nematode Brugia malayi. These data identify CF as a "cytoprotectant" that
      promotes eosinophil survival and function by ensuring granule integrity. VIDEO

AB  - The role of dendritic cells (DCs) in intestinal immune homeostasis remains
      incompletely defined. Here we show that mice lacking IRF8
      transcription-factor-dependent DCs had reduced numbers of T cells in the small
      intestine (SI), but not large intestine (LI), including an almost complete
      absence of SI CD8alphabeta(+) and CD4(+)CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells; the latter
      requiring beta8 integrin expression by migratory IRF8 dependent CD103(+)CD11b(-) 
      DCs. SI homing receptor induction was impaired during T cell priming in
      mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), which correlated with a reduction in aldehyde
      dehydrogenase activity by SI-derived MLN DCs, and inefficient T cell localization
      to the SI. These mice also lacked intestinal T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and failed
      to support Th1 cell differentiation in MLN and mount Th1 cell responses to
      Trichuris muris infection. Collectively these results highlight multiple
      non-redundant roles for IRF8 dependent DCs in the maintenance of intestinal T
      cell homeostasis.

TI  - Key gp120 Glycans Pose Roadblocks to the Rapid Development of VRC01-Class
      Antibodies in an HIV-1-Infected Chinese Donor.

AB  - VRC01-class antibodies neutralize diverse HIV-1 strains by targeting the
      conserved CD4-binding site. Despite extensive investigations, crucial events in
      the early stage of VRC01 development remain elusive. We demonstrated how
      VRC01-class antibodies emerged in a Chinese donor by antigen-specific single B
      cell sorting, structural and functional studies, and longitudinal antibody and
      virus repertoire analyses. A monoclonal antibody DRVIA7 with modest neutralizing 
      breadth was isolated that displayed a subset of VRC01 signatures. X-ray and EM
      structures revealed a VRC01-like angle of approach, but less favorable
      interactions between the DRVIA7 light-chain CDR1 and the N terminus with N276 and
      V5 glycans of gp120. Although the DRVIA7 lineage was unable to acquire broad
      neutralization, longitudinal analysis revealed a repertoire-encoded VRC01
      light-chain CDR3 signature and VRC01-like neutralizing heavy-chain precursors
      that rapidly matured within 2 years. Thus, light chain accommodation of the
      glycan shield should be taken into account in vaccine design targeting this
      conserved site of vulnerability.

AB  - Activation of T cells is mediated by the engagement of T cell receptors (TCRs)
      followed by calcium entry via store-operated calcium channels. Here we have shown
      an additional route for calcium entry into T cells-through the
      low-voltage-activated T-type CaV3.1 calcium channel. CaV3.1 mediated a
      substantial current at resting membrane potentials, and its deficiency had no
      effect on TCR-initiated calcium entry. Mice deficient for CaV3.1 were resistant
      to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and had reduced
      productions of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by
      central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells. CaV3.1
      deficiency led to decreased secretion of GM-CSF from in vitro polarized Th1 and
      Th17 cells. Nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cell
      (NFAT) was also reduced in CaV3.1-deficient T cells. These data provide evidence 
      for T-type channels in immune cells and their potential role in shaping the
      autoimmune response.

AB  - Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a cytokine whose bioactivity is controlled by
      activation of the inflammasome. However, in response to lipopolysaccharide, human
      monocytes secrete IL-1beta independently of classical inflammasome stimuli. Here,
      we report that this constituted a species-specific response that is not observed 
      in the murine system. Indeed, in human monocytes, lipopolysaccharide triggered an
      "alternative inflammasome" that relied on NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 signaling, yet was 
      devoid of any classical inflammasome characteristics including pyroptosome
      formation, pyroptosis induction, and K(+) efflux dependency. Genetic dissection
      of the underlying signaling pathway in a monocyte transdifferentiation system
      revealed that alternative inflammasome activation was propagated by
      TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-CASP8 signaling upstream of NLRP3. Importantly, involvement 
      of this signaling cascade was limited to alternative inflammasome activation and 
      did not extend to classical NLRP3 activation. Because alternative inflammasome
      activation embraces both sensitivity and promiscuity of TLR4, we propose a
      pivotal role for this signaling cascade in TLR4-driven, IL-1beta-mediated immune 
      responses and immunopathology in humans.

AB  - Few apoptotic corpses are seen even in tissues with high cellular turnover,
      leading to the notion that the capacity for engulfment in vivo is vast. Whether
      corpse clearance can be enhanced in vivo for potential benefit is not known. In a
      colonic inflammation model, we noted that the expression of the phagocytic
      receptor Bai1 was progressively downmodulated. Consistent with this,
      BAI1-deficient mice had more pronounced colitis and lower survival, with many
      uncleared apoptotic corpses and inflammatory cytokines within the colonic
      epithelium. When we engineered and tested transgenic mice overexpressing BAI1,
      these had fewer apoptotic cells, reduced inflammation, and attenuated disease.
      Boosting BAI1-mediated uptake by intestinal epithelial cells (rather than myeloid
      cells) was important in attenuating inflammation. A signaling-deficient BAI1
      transgene could not provide a similar benefit. Collectively, these complementary 
      genetic approaches showed that cell clearance could be boosted in vivo, with
      potential to regulate tissue inflammation in specific contexts.

AB  - Although antigen recognition mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR) influences
      many facets of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cell biology, including development
      and function, the cell types that present antigen to Treg cells in vivo remain
      largely undefined. By tracking a clonal population of Aire-dependent,
      prostate-specific Treg cells in mice, we demonstrated an essential role for
      dendritic cells (DCs) in regulating organ-specific Treg cell biology. We have
      shown that the thymic development of prostate-specific Treg cells required
      antigen presentation by DCs. Moreover, Batf3-dependent CD8alpha(+) DCs were
      dispensable for the development of this clonotype and had negligible impact on
      the polyclonal Treg cell repertoire. In the periphery, CCR7-dependent migratory
      DCs coordinated the activation of organ-specific Treg cells in the
      prostate-draining lymph nodes. Our results demonstrate that the development and
      peripheral regulation of organ-specific Treg cells are dependent on antigen
      presentation by DCs, implicating DCs as key mediators of organ-specific immune
      tolerance.

AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages can derive from yolk sac macrophages (YS-Macs), fetal
      liver monocytes (FL-MOs), or adult bone-marrow monocytes (BM-MOs). The relative
      capacity of these precursors to colonize a niche, self-maintain, and perform
      tissue-specific functions is unknown. We simultaneously transferred traceable
      YS-Macs, FL-MOs, and BM-MOs into the empty alveolar macrophage (AM) niche of
      neonatal Csf2rb(-/-) mice. All subsets produced AMs, but in competition
      preferential outgrowth of FL-MOs was observed, correlating with their superior
      granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reactivity and
      proliferation capacity. When transferred separately, however, all precursors
      efficiently colonized the alveolar niche and generated AMs that were
      transcriptionally almost identical, self-maintained, and durably prevented
      alveolar proteinosis. Mature liver, peritoneal, or colon macrophages could not
      efficiently colonize the empty AM niche, whereas mature AMs could. Thus,
      precursor origin does not affect the development of functional self-maintaining
      tissue-resident macrophages and the plasticity of the mononuclear phagocyte
      system is largest at the precursor stage.

AB  - Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) increase the
      affinity and diversify the effector functions of antibodies during immune
      responses. Although SHM and CSR are fundamentally different, their independent
      roles in regulating B cell fate have been difficult to uncouple because a single 
      enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (encoded by Aicda), initiates both 
      reactions. Here, we used a combination of Aicda and antibody mutant alleles that 
      separate the effects of CSR and SHM on polyclonal immune responses. We found that
      class-switching to IgG1 biased the fate choice made by B cells, favoring the
      plasma cell over memory cell fate without significantly affecting clonal
      expansion in the germinal center (GC). In contrast, SHM reduced the longevity of 
      memory B cells by creating polyreactive specificities that were selected against 
      over time. Our data define the independent contributions of SHM and CSR to the
      generation and persistence of memory in the antibody system.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate decisions in immune
      responses. They act by coordinate repression of multiple target genes, a property
      that we exploited to uncover regulatory networks that govern T helper-2 (Th2)
      cells. A functional screen of individual miRNAs in primary T cells uncovered
      multiple miRNAs that inhibited Th2 cell differentiation. Among these were miR-24 
      and miR-27, miRNAs coexpressed from two genomic clusters, which each functioned
      independently to limit interleukin-4 (IL-4) production. Mice lacking both
      clusters in T cells displayed increased Th2 cell responses and tissue pathology
      in a mouse model of asthma. Gene expression and pathway analyses placed miR-27
      upstream of genes known to regulate Th2 cells. They also identified targets not
      previously associated with Th2 cell biology which regulated IL-4 production in
      unbiased functional testing. Thus, elucidating the biological function and target
      repertoire of miR-24 and miR-27 reveals regulators of Th2 cell biology.

AB  - Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer predicts favorable outcomes.
      However, the mechanistic relationship between microsatellite instability,
      tumor-infiltrating immune cells, Immunoscore, and their impact on patient
      survival remains to be elucidated. We found significant differences in mutational
      patterns, chromosomal instability, and gene expression that correlated with
      patient microsatellite instability status. A prominent immune gene expression was
      observed in microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors, as well as in a subgroup of
      microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. MSI tumors had increased frameshift
      mutations, showed genetic evidence of immunoediting, had higher densities of Th1,
      effector-memory T cells, in situ proliferating T cells, and inhibitory PD1-PDL1
      cells, had high Immunoscores, and were infiltrated with mutation-specific
      cytotoxic T cells. Multivariate analysis revealed that Immunoscore was superior
      to microsatellite instability in predicting patients' disease-specific recurrence
      and survival. These findings indicate that assessment of the immune status via
      Immunoscore provides a potent indicator of tumor recurrence beyond
      microsatellite-instability staging that could be an important guide for
      immunotherapy strategies.

TI  - Intestinal Interleukin-17 Receptor Signaling Mediates Reciprocal Control of the
      Gut Microbiota and Autoimmune Inflammation.

AB  - Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) signaling are essential for
      regulating mucosal host defense against many invading pathogens. Commensal
      bacteria, especially segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), are a crucial factor
      that drives T helper 17 (Th17) cell development in the gastrointestinal tract. In
      this study, we demonstrate that Th17 cells controlled SFB burden. Disruption of
      IL-17R signaling in the enteric epithelium resulted in SFB dysbiosis due to
      reduced expression of alpha-defensins, Pigr, and Nox1. When subjected to
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, IL-17R-signaling-deficient mice
      demonstrated earlier disease onset and worsened severity that was associated with
      increased intestinal Csf2 expression and elevated systemic GM-CSF cytokine
      concentrations. Conditional deletion of IL-17R in the enteric epithelium
      demonstrated that there was a reciprocal relationship between the gut microbiota 
      and enteric IL-17R signaling that controlled dysbiosis, constrained Th17 cell
      development, and regulated the susceptibility to autoimmune inflammation.

AB  - Physical separation between the mammalian immune system and commensal bacteria is
      necessary to limit chronic inflammation. However, selective species of commensal 
      bacteria can reside within intestinal lymphoid tissues of healthy mammals. Here, 
      we demonstrate that lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria (LRC) colonized
      murine dendritic cells and modulated their cytokine production. In germ-free and 
      antibiotic-treated mice, LRCs colonized intestinal lymphoid tissues and induced
      multiple members of the IL-10 cytokine family, including dendritic-cell-derived
      IL-10 and group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3)-derived IL-22. Notably, IL-10
      limited the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cell responses, and IL-22
      production enhanced LRC colonization in the steady state. Furthermore, LRC
      colonization protected mice from lethal intestinal damage in an
      IL-10-IL-10R-dependent manner. Collectively, our data reveal a unique
      host-commensal-bacteria dialog whereby selective subsets of commensal bacteria
      interact with dendritic cells to facilitate tissue-specific responses that are
      mutually beneficial for both the host and the microbe.

AB  - Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) regulate gut immune homeostasis, and impaired 
      epithelial responses are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). IEC-specific ablation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)
      essential modulator (NEMO) caused Paneth cell apoptosis and impaired
      antimicrobial factor expression in the ileum, as well as colonocyte apoptosis and
      microbiota-driven chronic inflammation in the colon. Combined RelA, c-Rel, and
      RelB deficiency in IECs caused Paneth cell apoptosis but not colitis, suggesting 
      that NEMO prevents colon inflammation by NF-kappaB-independent functions.
      Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) kinase activity or
      combined deficiency of Fas-associated via death domain protein (FADD) and RIPK3
      prevented epithelial cell death, Paneth cell loss, and colitis development in
      mice with epithelial NEMO deficiency. Therefore, NEMO prevents intestinal
      inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity-mediated IEC death, suggesting
      that RIPK1 inhibitors could be effective in the treatment of colitis in patients 
      with NEMO mutations and possibly in IBD.

AB  - Lymphopoiesis requires the activation of lineage-specific genes embedded in
      naive, inaccessible chromatin or in primed, accessible chromatin. The mechanisms 
      responsible for de novo gain of chromatin accessibility, known as "pioneer"
      function, remain poorly defined. Here, we showed that the EBF1 C-terminal domain 
      (CTD) is required for the regulation of a specific gene set involved in B cell
      fate decision and differentiation, independently of activation and repression
      functions. Using genome-wide analysis of DNaseI hypersensitivity and DNA
      methylation in multipotent Ebf1(-/-) progenitors and derivative EBF1wt- or
      EBF1DeltaC-expressing cells, we found that the CTD promoted chromatin
      accessibility and DNA demethylation in previously naive chromatin. The CTD
      allowed EBF1 to bind at inaccessible genomic regions that offer limited
      co-occupancy by other transcription factors, whereas the CTD was dispensable for 
      EBF1 binding at regions that are occupied by multiple transcription factors.
      Thus, the CTD enables EBF1 to confer permissive lineage-specific changes in
      progenitor chromatin landscape.

AB  - Microglia originate from erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the yolk sac and
      develop in the forming CNS. Microglia are fundamental for the development and
      function of a healthy brain. By contrast, their role in immune host defense of
      the CNS remains speculative, given the immune privilege of this organ.
      Alterations in microglia functionality are involved in brain aging, as well as in
      neurodegenerative disease severity and progression. The combination of their
      ontogeny with the influence of the complex environment of the CNS makes microglia
      a unique cell population. Recent observations about microglia ontogeny combined
      with extensive gene expression profiling allow us to better capture the variety
      of nuances that microglia can manifest. Here, we provide a contemporary appraisal
      of microglial uniqueness based on their origin, functions, and expression
      profiles. Furthermore, we give an overview of the impact of aging and
      neurodegenerative diseases on microglia transcriptomes.

AB  - Iron is a transition metal that due to its inherent ability to exchange electrons
      with a variety of molecules is essential to support life. In mammals, iron exists
      mostly in the form of heme, enclosed within an organic protoporphyrin ring and
      functioning primarily as a prosthetic group in proteins. Paradoxically, free iron
      also has the potential to become cytotoxic when electron exchange with oxygen is 
      unrestricted and catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. These
      biological properties demand that iron metabolism is tightly regulated such that 
      iron is available for core biological functions while preventing its cytotoxic
      effects. Macrophages play a central role in establishing this delicate balance.
      Here, we review the impact of macrophages on heme-iron metabolism and,
      reciprocally, how heme-iron modulates macrophage function.

AB  - Phagocytes are crucial for host defense against bacterial pathogens. As first
      demonstrated by Metchnikoff, neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes share the
      capacity to engulf, kill, and digest microbial invaders. Generally, neutrophils
      focus on extracellular, and mononuclear phagocytes on intracellular, pathogens.
      Reciprocally, extracellular pathogens often capitalize on hindering phagocytosis 
      and killing of phagocytes, whereas intracellular bacteria frequently allow their 
      engulfment and then block intracellular killing. As foreseen by Metchnikoff,
      phagocytes become highly versatile by acquiring diverse phenotypes, but still
      retaining some plasticity. Further, phagocytes engage in active crosstalk with
      parenchymal and immune cells to promote adjunctive reactions, including
      inflammation, tissue healing, and remodeling. This dynamic network allows the
      host to cope with different types of microbial invaders. Here we present an
      update of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying phagocyte functions in
      antibacterial defense. We focus on four exemplary bacteria ranging from an
      opportunistic extracellular to a persistent intracellular pathogen.

AB  - It has been a century since the death of Elie Metchnikoff, who championed the
      role of phagocytosis in cellular immunity. Whereas others had observed the uptake
      of particles by cells from simple to complex organisms, he grasped its
      significance in the host response to injury and infection and established a firm 
      basis for our understanding of inflammation and tissue homeostasis. The past
      century has brought improved tools of cellular and molecular biology to the study
      of phagocytosis and its contribution to physiological and pathological processes,
      including receptor function in innate and acquired immunity. In this review, I
      assess our present knowledge and consider opportunities for future research and
      therapeutic targeting.

AB  - Inflammatory monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages are key regulators of
      tissue repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. After tissue injury, monocytes and
      macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical
      roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair.
      Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that
      uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient
      generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between
      macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or
      tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this 
      could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we
      discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory,
      pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving,
      and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of
      these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited
      therapeutically.

AB  - Defining the origins and developmental pathways of tissue-resident macrophages
      should help refine our understanding of the role of these cells in various
      disease settings and enable the design of novel macrophage-targeted therapies. In
      recent years the long-held belief that macrophage populations in the adult are
      continuously replenished by monocytes from the bone marrow (BM) has been
      overturned with the advent of new techniques to dissect cellular ontogeny. The
      new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are
      seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of
      BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic
      progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated,
      and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are
      undefined. Here, we review the emergence of these concepts and discuss current
      controversies and future directions in macrophage biology.

AB  - Signals controlling the generation of regulatory B (Breg) cells remain
      ill-defined. Here we report an "auto"-regulatory feedback mechanism between
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and Breg cells. In healthy individuals, pDCs 
      drive the differentiation of CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) (immature) B cells into
      IL-10-producing CD24(+)CD38(hi) Breg cells and plasmablasts, via the release of
      IFN-alpha and CD40 engagement. CD24(+)CD38(hi) Breg cells conversely restrained
      IFN-alpha production by pDCs via IL-10 release. In systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE), this cross-talk was compromised; pDCs promoted plasmablast differentiation
      but failed to induce Breg cells. This defect was recapitulated in healthy B cells
      upon exposure to a high concentration of IFN-alpha. Defective pDC-mediated
      expansion of CD24(+)CD38(hi) Breg cell numbers in SLE was associated with altered
      STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Both altered pDC-CD24(+)CD38(hi) Breg cell
      interactions and STAT1-STAT3 activation were normalized in SLE patients
      responding to rituximab. We propose that alteration in pDC-CD24(+)CD38(hi) Breg
      cell interaction contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE.

AB  - Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric regulatory cytokine of the IL-12
      family, which is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells upon
      stimulation through innate immune receptors. Here, we described regulatory CD4(+)
      T cells that produce IL-27 in response to T cell receptor stimulation during
      malaria infection, inhibiting IL-2 production and clonal expansion of other T
      cells in an IL-27-dependent manner. IL-27-producing CD4(+) T cells were
      Foxp3(-)CD11a(+)CD49d(+) malaria antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and were
      distinct from interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) producing Th1 or IL-10 producing Tr1
      cells. In mice lacking IL-27 in T cells, IL-2 production was restored and clonal 
      expansion and IFN-gamma production by specific CD4(+) T cells were improved,
      culminating in reduced parasite burden. This study highlights a unique population
      of IL-27 producing regulatory CD4(+) T cells and their critical role in the
      regulation of the protective immune response against malaria parasites.

AB  - Germinal center (GC) B cells evolve toward increased affinity by a Darwinian
      process that has been studied primarily in genetically restricted,
      hapten-specific responses. We explored the population dynamics of genetically
      diverse GC responses to two complex antigens-Bacillus anthracis protective
      antigen and influenza hemagglutinin-in which B cells competed both intra- and
      interclonally for distinct epitopes. Preferred VH rearrangements among
      antigen-binding, naive B cells were similarly abundant in early GCs but, unlike
      responses to haptens, clonal diversity increased in GC B cells as early "winners"
      were replaced by rarer, high-affinity clones. Despite affinity maturation, inter-
      and intraclonal avidities varied greatly, and half of GC B cells did not bind the
      immunogen but nonetheless exhibited biased VH use, V(D)J mutation, and clonal
      expansion comparable to antigen-binding cells. GC reactions to complex antigens
      permit a range of specificities and affinities, with potential advantages for
      broad protection.

AB  - Targeted inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) can
      induce regression of tumors bearing activating mutations in the Ras pathway but
      rarely leads to tumor eradication. Although combining MEK inhibition with
      T-cell-directed immunotherapy might lead to more durable efficacy, T cell
      responses are themselves at least partially dependent on MEK activity. We show
      here that MEK inhibition did profoundly block naive CD8(+) T cell priming in
      tumor-bearing mice, but actually increased the number of effector-phenotype
      antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells within the tumor. MEK inhibition protected
      tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells from death driven by chronic TCR stimulation
      while sparing cytotoxic activity. Combining MEK inhibition with anti-programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) resulted in synergistic and durable tumor regression even 
      where either agent alone was only modestly effective. Thus, despite the central
      importance of the MAP kinase pathway in some aspects of T cell function,
      MEK-targeted agents can be compatible with T-cell-dependent immunotherapy.

AB  - The cationic polysaccharide chitosan is an attractive candidate adjuvant capable 
      of driving potent cell-mediated immunity, but the mechanism by which it acts is
      not clear. We show that chitosan promotes dendritic cell maturation by inducing
      type I interferons (IFNs) and enhances antigen-specific T helper 1 (Th1)
      responses in a type I IFN receptor-dependent manner. The induction of type I
      IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and dendritic cell maturation by chitosan required the
      cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and STING, implicating this pathway in dendritic cell
      activation. Additionally, this process was dependent on mitochondrial reactive
      oxygen species and the presence of cytoplasmic DNA. Chitosan-mediated enhancement
      of antigen specific Th1 and immunoglobulin G2c responses following vaccination
      was dependent on both cGAS and STING. These findings demonstrate that a cationic 
      polymer can engage the STING-cGAS pathway to trigger innate and adaptive immune
      responses.

AB  - The gut microbiota is compartmentalized in the intestinal lumen and induces local
      immune responses, but it remains unknown whether the gut microbiota can induce
      systemic response and contribute to systemic immunity. We report that selective
      gut symbiotic gram-negative bacteria were able to disseminate systemically to
      induce immunoglobulin G (IgG) response, which primarily targeted gram-negative
      bacterial antigens and conferred protection against systemic infections by E.
      coli and Salmonella by directly coating bacteria to promote killing by
      phagocytes. T cells and Toll-like receptor 4 on B cells were important in the
      generation of microbiota-specific IgG. We identified murein lipoprotein (MLP), a 
      highly conserved gram-negative outer membrane protein, as a major antigen that
      induced systemic IgG homeostatically in both mice and humans. Administration of
      anti-MLP IgG conferred crucial protection against systemic Salmonella infection. 
      Thus, our findings reveal an important function for the gut microbiota in
      combating systemic infection through the induction of protective IgG.

AB  - Upon antigen engagement, augmented cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
      needed to achieve optimal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. However, uncontrolled 
      ROS production is a prominent cause of necrosis, which elicits hyper-inflammation
      and tissue damage. Hence, it is critical to program activated T cells to achieve 
      ROS equilibrium. Here, we determined that miR-23a is indispensable for effector
      CD4(+) T cell expansion, particularly by providing early protection from
      excessive necrosis. Mechanistically, miR-23a targeted PPIF, gatekeeper of the
      mitochondria permeability transition pore, thereby restricting ROS flux and
      maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Upon acute Listeria monocytogenes infection,
      deleting miR-23a in T cells resulted in excessive inflammation, massive liver
      damage, and a marked mortality increase, which highlights the essential role of
      miR-23a in maintaining immune homeostasis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disorder with
      increasing incidence. Mitochondrial oxidative stress in alveolar macrophages is
      directly linked to pulmonary fibrosis. Mitophagy, the selective engulfment of
      dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagasomes, is important for cellular
      homeostasis and can be induced by mitochondrial oxidative stress. Here, we show
      Akt1 induced macrophage mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
      mitophagy. Mice harboring a conditional deletion of Akt1 in macrophages
      (Akt1(-/-)Lyz2-cre) and Park2(-/-) mice had impaired mitophagy and reduced active
      transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Although Akt1 increased TGF-beta1
      expression, mitophagy inhibition in Akt1-overexpressing macrophages abrogated
      TGF-beta1 expression and fibroblast differentiation. Importantly, conditional
      Akt1(-/-)Lyz2-cre mice and Park2(-/-) mice had increased macrophage apoptosis and
      were protected from pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, IPF alveolar macrophages had
      evidence of increased mitophagy and displayed apoptosis resistance. These
      observations suggest that Akt1-mediated mitophagy contributes to alveolar
      macrophage apoptosis resistance and is required for pulmonary fibrosis
      development.

AB  - Stromal cells generate a complex cellular scaffold that provides specialized
      microenvironments for lymphocyte activation in secondary lymphoid organs. Here,
      we assessed whether local activation of stromal cells in the central nervous
      system (CNS) is mandatory to transfer immune recognition from secondary lymphoid 
      organs into the infected tissue. We report that neurotropic virus infection in
      mice triggered the establishment of such stromal cell niches in the CNS. CNS
      stromal cell activation was dominated by a rapid and vigorous production of
      CC-motif chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 by vascular
      endothelial cells and adjacent fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-like cells in
      the perivascular space. Moreover, CCR7 ligands produced by CNS stromal cells were
      crucial to support recruitment and local re-activation of antiviral CD8(+) T
      cells and to protect the host from lethal neuroinflammatory disease, indicating
      that CNS stromal cells generate confined microenvironments that control
      protective T cell immunity.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate complex membrane trafficking through an
      interconnected transportation network linked together by Rab GTPases. Through a
      tandem affinity purification strategy and mass spectrometry, we depicted an
      interactomic landscape of major members of the mammalian Rab GTPase family. When 
      complemented with imaging tools, this proteomic analysis provided a global view
      of intracellular membrane organization. Driven by this analysis, we investigated 
      dynamic changes to the Rab32 subnetwork in DCs induced by L. monocytogenes
      infection and uncovered an essential role of this subnetwork in controlling the
      intracellular proliferation of L. monocytogenes. Mechanistically, Rab32 formed a 
      persistent complex with two interacting proteins, PHB and PHB2, to encompass
      bacteria both during early phagosome formation and after L. monocytogenes escaped
      the original containment vacuole. Collectively, we have provided a functional
      compartmentalization overview and an organizational framework of intracellular
      Rab-mediated vesicle trafficking that can serve as a resource for future
      investigations.

AB  - Human CD4(+)CD25(hi)Foxp3(+)CD127(-) Treg and CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(-) Tconv cell
      functions are governed by their metabolic requirements. Here we report a
      comprehensive comparative analysis between ex vivo human Treg and Tconv cells
      that comprises analyses of the proteomic networks in subcellular compartments. We
      identified a dominant proteomic signature at the metabolic level that primarily
      impacted the highly-tuned balance between glucose and fatty-acid oxidation in the
      two cell types. Ex vivo Treg cells were highly glycolytic while Tconv cells used 
      predominantly fatty-acid oxidation (FAO). When cultured in vitro, Treg cells
      engaged both glycolysis and FAO to proliferate, while Tconv cell proliferation
      mainly relied on glucose metabolism. Our unbiased proteomic analysis provides a
      molecular picture of the impact of metabolism on ex vivo human Treg versus Tconv 
      cell functions that might be relevant for therapeutic manipulations of these
      cells.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) redirect T cell cytotoxicity against cancer
      cells, providing a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy. Despite extensive 
      clinical use, the attributes of CAR co-stimulatory domains that impact
      persistence and resistance to exhaustion of CAR-T cells remain largely undefined.
      Here, we report the influence of signaling domains of coreceptors CD28 and 4-1BB 
      on the metabolic characteristics of human CAR T cells. Inclusion of 4-1BB in the 
      CAR architecture promoted the outgrowth of CD8(+) central memory T cells that had
      significantly enhanced respiratory capacity, increased fatty acid oxidation and
      enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. In contrast, CAR T cells with CD28 domains
      yielded effector memory cells with a genetic signature consistent with enhanced
      glycolysis. These results provide, at least in part, a mechanistic insight into
      the differential persistence of CAR-T cells expressing 4-1BB or CD28 signaling
      domains in clinical trials and inform the design of future CAR T cell therapies.

AB  - Humans that are heterozygous for the common S180L polymorphism in the Toll-like
      receptor (TLR) adaptor Mal (encoded by TIRAP) are protected from a number of
      infectious diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), whereas those homozygous for
      the allele are at increased risk. The reason for this difference in
      susceptibility is not clear. We report that Mal has a TLR-independent role in
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor signaling. Mal-dependent IFN-gamma receptor
      (IFNGR) signaling led to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38
      phosphorylation and autophagy. IFN-gamma signaling via Mal was required for
      phagosome maturation and killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      (Mtb). The S180L polymorphism, and its murine equivalent S200L, reduced the
      affinity of Mal for the IFNGR, thereby compromising IFNGR signaling in
      macrophages and impairing responses to TB. Our findings highlight a role for Mal 
      outside the TLR system and imply that genetic variation in TIRAP may be linked to
      other IFN-gamma-related diseases including autoimmunity and cancer.

AB  - Lymphocyte homing to draining lymph nodes is critical for the initiation of
      immune responses. Secondary lymphoid organs of germ-free mice are underdeveloped.
      How gut commensal microbes remotely regulate cellularity and volume of secondary 
      lymphoid organs remains unknown. We report here that, driven by commensal fungi, 
      a wave of CD45(+)CD103(+)RALDH(+) cells migrates to the peripheral lymph nodes
      after birth. The arrival of these cells introduces high amounts of retinoic acid,
      mediates the neonatal to adult addressin switch on endothelial cells, and directs
      the homing of lymphocytes to both gut-associated lymphoid tissues and peripheral 
      lymph nodes. In adult mice, a small number of these RALDH(+) cells might serve to
      maintain the volume of secondary lymphoid organs. Homing deficiency of these
      cells was associated with lymph node attrition in vitamin-A-deficient mice,
      suggesting a perpetual dependence on retinoic acid signaling for structural and
      functional maintenance of peripheral immune organs.

AB  - Recruitment of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
      differentiation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major factors
      contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. We demonstrated that
      differentiation of TAMs in tumor site from monocytic precursors was controlled by
      downregulation of the activity of the transcription factor STAT3. Decreased STAT3
      activity was caused by hypoxia and affected all myeloid cells but was not
      observed in tumor cells. Upregulation of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity in
      MDSCs exposed to hypoxia in tumor site was responsible for downregulation of
      STAT3. This effect was mediated by the disruption of CD45 protein dimerization
      regulated by sialic acid. Thus, STAT3 has a unique function in the tumor
      environment in controlling the differentiation of MDSC into TAM, and its
      regulatory pathway could be a potential target for therapy.

      Co-receptor PD-1 to Enhance CD8(+) Cytolytic T Cell Responses.

AB  - Despite the importance of the co-receptor PD-1 in T cell immunity, the upstream
      signaling pathway that regulates PD-1 expression has not been defined. Glycogen
      synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3, isoforms alpha and beta) is a serine-threonine kinase
      implicated in cellular processes. Here, we identified GSK-3 as a key upstream
      kinase that regulated PD-1 expression in CD8(+) T cells. GSK-3 siRNA
      downregulation, or inhibition by small molecules, blocked PD-1 expression,
      resulting in increased CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function.
      Mechanistically, GSK-3 inactivation increased Tbx21 transcription, promoting
      enhanced T-bet expression and subsequent suppression of Pdcd1 (encodes PD-1)
      transcription in CD8(+) CTLs. Injection of GSK-3 inhibitors in mice increased in 
      vivo CD8(+) OT-I CTL function and the clearance of murine gamma-herpesvirus 68
      and lymphocytic choriomeningitis clone 13 and reversed T cell exhaustion. Our
      findings identify GSK-3 as a regulator of PD-1 expression and demonstrate the
      applicability of GSK-3 inhibitors in the modulation of PD-1 in immunotherapy.

AB  - Some forms of regulated cell death, such as apoptosis, are precipitated by the
      activation of cysteine proteases of the caspase family, including caspase 8, 9,
      and 3. Other caspases, such as caspase 1 and 4, are well known for their
      pro-inflammatory functions but regulate cell death in a limited number of
      pathophysiological settings. Accumulating evidence suggests that the most
      conserved function of mammalian caspases is not to control cell death sensu
      stricto, but to regulate inflammatory and immune reactions to dying cells and
      infectious challenges. Here, we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms
      though which mammalian caspases connect cell-death signaling to the maintenance
      of organismal homeostasis.

AB  - Two new studies published in The American Journal of Human Genetics (Dannemann et
      al., 2016; Deschamps et al., 2016) show that introgression of innate immune genes
      from Neandertals and Denisovans contributed to the modern genome of European and 
      Asian, but not African, populations, and this might partly explain differences in
      susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases.

AB  - Loss of IL-17-producing cells in the gut during HIV infection is linked to GI
      barrier damage. Kloverpris et al. (2016) find that circulating ILCs are lost
      early and irreversibly during HIV infection. Early ART administration protects
      against the ILC loss, and this might be clinically beneficial to HIV-infected
      individuals.

AB  - Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) have long been believed to be extremely
      efficient killers. Forster and colleagues (Halle et al., 2016) used in vivo
      imaging to tell a different story, in which each CTL killed only 2-16 targets a
      day, and several CTLs per target were needed to get the job done.

AB  - Normal repair of skeletal muscle requires local expansion of a special population
      of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Such cells failed to accumulate in
      acutely injured muscle of old mice, known to undergo ineffectual repair. This
      defect reflected reduced recruitment of Treg cells to injured muscle, as well as 
      less proliferation and retention therein. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) regulated muscle
      Treg cell homeostasis in young mice, and its administration to old mice
      ameliorated their deficits in Treg cell accumulation and muscle regeneration. The
      major IL-33-expressing cells in skeletal muscle displayed a constellation of
      markers diagnostic of fibro/adipogenic progenitor cells and were often associated
      with neural structures, including nerve fibers, nerve bundles, and muscle
      spindles, which are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors important for
      proprioception. IL-33(+) cells were more frequent after muscle injury and were
      reduced in old mice. IL-33 is well situated to relay signals between the nervous 
      and immune systems within the muscle context.

AB  - Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies can be extraordinarily effective, but might
      benefit only the minority of patients whose tumors are pre-infiltrated by T
      cells. Here, using lung adenocarcinoma mouse models, including genetic models, we
      show that autochthonous tumors that lacked T cell infiltration and resisted
      current treatment options could be successfully sensitized to host antitumor T
      cell immunity when appropriately selected immunogenic drugs (e.g., oxaliplatin
      combined with cyclophosphamide for treatment against tumors expressing oncogenic 
      Kras and lacking Trp53) were used. The antitumor response was triggered by direct
      drug actions on tumor cells, relied on innate immune sensing through toll-like
      receptor 4 signaling, and ultimately depended on CD8(+) T cell antitumor
      immunity. Furthermore, instigating tumor infiltration by T cells sensitized
      tumors to checkpoint inhibition and controlled cancer durably. These findings
      indicate that the proportion of cancers responding to checkpoint therapy can be
      feasibly and substantially expanded by combining checkpoint blockade with
      immunogenic drugs.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells pose a major barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity. 
      Although Treg cell depletion enhances tumor rejection, the ensuing autoimmune
      sequelae limits its utility in the clinic and highlights the need for limiting
      Treg cell activity within the tumor microenvironment. Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a
      Treg cell-secreted cytokine that inhibits T cell proliferation and function.
      Using an IL-35 reporter mouse, we observed substantial enrichment of IL-35(+)
      Treg cells in tumors. Neutralization with an IL-35-specific antibody or Treg
      cell-restricted deletion of IL-35 production limited tumor growth in multiple
      murine models of human cancer. Limiting intratumoral IL-35 enhanced T cell
      proliferation, effector function, antigen-specific responses, and long-term T
      cell memory. Treg cell-derived IL-35 promoted the expression of multiple
      inhibitory receptors (PD1, TIM3, LAG3), thereby facilitating intratumoral T cell 
      exhaustion. These findings reveal previously unappreciated roles for IL-35 in
      limiting anti-tumor immunity and contributing to T cell dysfunction in the tumor 
      microenvironment.

AB  - The failure of apoptotic cell clearance is linked to autoimmune diseases,
      nonresolving inflammation, and developmental abnormalities; however, pathways
      that regulate phagocytes for efficient apoptotic cell clearance remain poorly
      known. Apoptotic cells release find-me signals to recruit phagocytes to initiate 
      their clearance. Here we found that find-me signal sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 
      activated macrophage erythropoietin (EPO) signaling promoted apoptotic cell
      clearance and immune tolerance. Dying cell-released S1P activated macrophage EPO 
      signaling. Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)-deficient macrophages exhibited
      impaired apoptotic cell phagocytosis. EPO enhanced apoptotic cell clearance
      through peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). Moreover,
      macrophage-specific Epor(-/-) mice developed lupus-like symptoms, and
      interference in EPO signaling ameliorated the disease progression in lupus-like
      mice. Thus, we have identified a pathway that regulates macrophages to clear
      dying cells, uncovered the priming function of find-me signal S1P, and found a
      role of the erythropoiesis regulator EPO in apoptotic cell disposal, with
      implications for harnessing dying cell clearance.

AB  - Exposure to a plethora of environmental challenges commonly triggers pathological
      type 2 cell-mediated inflammation. Here we report the pathological role of the
      Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) upon allergen challenge or non-healing
      parasitic infection. The increased circulating amounts of Dkk-1 polarized T cells
      to T helper 2 (Th2) cells, stimulating a marked simultaneous induction of the
      transcription factors c-Maf and Gata-3, mediated by the kinases p38 MAPK and
      SGK-1, resulting in Th2 cell cytokine production. Circulating Dkk-1 was primarily
      from platelets, and the increase of Dkk-1 resulted in formation of
      leukocyte-platelet aggregates (LPA) that facilitated leukocyte infiltration to
      the affected tissue. Functional inhibition of Dkk-1 impaired Th2 cell cytokine
      production and leukocyte infiltration, protecting mice from house dust mite
      (HDM)-induced asthma or Leishmania major infection. These results highlight that 
      Dkk-1 from thrombocytes is an important regulator of leukocyte infiltration and
      polarization of immune responses in pathological type 2 cell-mediated
      inflammation.

AB  - According to in vitro assays, T cells are thought to kill rapidly and
      efficiently, but the efficacy and dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated killing of virus-infected cells in vivo remains elusive. We used
      two-photon microscopy to quantify CTL-mediated killing in mice infected with
      herpesviruses or poxviruses. On average, one CTL killed 2-16 virus-infected cells
      per day as determined by real-time imaging and by mathematical modeling. In
      contrast, upon virus-induced MHC class I downmodulation, CTLs failed to destroy
      their targets. During killing, CTLs remained migratory and formed motile kinapses
      rather than static synapses with targets. Viruses encoding the calcium sensor
      GCaMP6s revealed strong heterogeneity in individual CTL functional capacity.
      Furthermore, the probability of death of infected cells increased for those
      contacted by more than two CTLs, indicative of CTL cooperation. Thus, direct
      visualization of CTLs during killing of virus-infected cells reveals crucial
      parameters of CD8(+) T cell immunity.

TI  - Innate Lymphoid Cells Are Depleted Irreversibly during Acute HIV-1 Infection in
      the Absence of Viral Suppression.

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a central role in the response to infection by 
      secreting cytokines crucial for immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and
      repair. Although dysregulation of these systems is central to pathology, the
      impact of HIV-1 on ILCs remains unknown. We found that human blood ILCs were
      severely depleted during acute viremic HIV-1 infection and that ILC numbers did
      not recover after resolution of peak viremia. ILC numbers were preserved by
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only if initiated during acute infection.
      Transcriptional profiling during the acute phase revealed upregulation of genes
      associated with cell death, temporally linked with a strong IFN acute-phase
      response and evidence of gut barrier breakdown. We found no evidence of tissue
      redistribution in chronic disease and remaining circulating ILCs were activated
      but not apoptotic. These data provide a potential mechanistic link between acute 
      HIV-1 infection, lymphoid tissue breakdown, and persistent immune dysfunction.

AB  - Exposure to environmental antigens, such as house dust mite (HDM), often leads to
      T helper 2 (Th2) cell-driven allergic responses. However, the mechanisms
      underlying the development of these responses are incompletely understood. We
      found that the initial exposure to HDM did not lead to Th2 cell development but
      instead promoted the formation of interleukin-4 (IL-4)-committed T follicular
      helper (Tfh) cells. Following challenge exposure to HDM, Tfh cells differentiated
      into IL-4 and IL-13 double-producing Th2 cells that accumulated in the lung and
      recruited eosinophils. B cells were required to expand IL-4-committed Tfh cells
      during the sensitization phase, but did not directly contribute to disease.
      Impairment of Tfh cell responses during the sensitization phase or Tfh cell
      depletion prevented Th2 cell-mediated responses following challenge. Thus, our
      data demonstrate that Tfh cells are precursors of HDM-specific Th2 cells and
      reveal an unexpected role of B cells and Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of
      allergic asthma.

AB  - The role of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in promoting cell death versus
      survival remains controversial. We report that the loss of AIF in fibroblasts led
      to mitochondrial electron transport chain defects and loss of proliferation that 
      could be restored by ectopic expression of the yeast NADH dehydrogenase Ndi1.
      Aif-deficiency in T cells led to decreased peripheral T cell numbers and
      defective homeostatic proliferation, but thymic T cell development was
      unaffected. In contrast, Aif-deficient B cells developed and functioned normally.
      The difference in the dependency of T cells versus B cells on AIF for function
      and survival correlated with their metabolic requirements. Ectopic Ndi1
      expression rescued homeostatic proliferation of Aif-deficient T cells. Despite
      its reported roles in cell death, fibroblasts, thymocytes and B cells lacking AIF
      underwent normal death. These studies suggest that the primary role of AIF
      relates to complex I function, with differential effects on T and B cells.

      Facilitates Differential Antigen Recognition.

AB  - A characteristic of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells is the expression
      of TRAV1-2(+) T cell receptors (TCRs) that are activated by riboflavin
      metabolite-based antigens (Ag) presented by the MHC-I related molecule, MR1.
      Whether the MR1-restricted T cell repertoire and associated Ag responsiveness
      extends beyond these cells remains unclear. Here, we describe MR1 autoreactivity 
      and folate-derivative reactivity in a discrete subset of TRAV1-2(+) MAIT cells.
      This recognition was attributable to CDR3beta loop-mediated effects within a
      consensus TRAV1-2(+) TCR-MR1-Ag footprint. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
      differential folate- and riboflavin-derivative reactivity by a diverse population
      of "atypical" TRAV1-2(-) MR1-restricted T cells. We have shown that TRAV1-2(-) T 
      cells are phenotypically heterogeneous and largely distinct from TRAV1-2(+) MAIT 
      cells. A TRAV1-2(-) TCR docks more centrally on MR1, thereby adopting a markedly 
      different molecular footprint to the TRAV1-2(+) TCR. Accordingly, diversity
      within the MR1-restricted T cell repertoire leads to differing MR1-restricted Ag 
      specificity.

AB  - Gene-expression profiling has become a mainstay in immunology, but subtle changes
      in gene networks related to biological processes are hard to discern when
      comparing various datasets. For instance, conservation of the transcriptional
      response to sepsis in mouse models and human disease remains controversial. To
      improve transcriptional analysis in immunology, we created ImmuneSigDB: a
      manually annotated compendium of approximately 5,000 gene-sets from diverse cell 
      states, experimental manipulations, and genetic perturbations in immunology.
      Analysis using ImmuneSigDB identified signatures induced in activated myeloid
      cells and differentiating lymphocytes that were highly conserved between humans
      and mice. Sepsis triggered conserved patterns of gene expression in humans and
      mouse models. However, we also identified species-specific biological processes
      in the sepsis transcriptional response: although both species upregulated
      phagocytosis-related genes, a mitosis signature was specific to humans.
      ImmuneSigDB enables granular analysis of transcriptomic data to improve
      biological understanding of immune processes of the human and mouse immune
      systems.

AB  - A central effort in HIV vaccine development is to generate protective broadly
      neutralizing antibodies, a process dependent on T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. 
      The feasibility of using peripheral blood counterparts of lymph node Tfh cells to
      assess the immune response and the influence of viral and vaccine antigens on
      their helper functions remain obscure. We assessed circulating HIV-specific
      IL-21(+)CD4(+) T cells and showed transcriptional and phenotypic similarities to 
      lymphoid Tfh cells, and hence representing peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cells. pTfh
      cells were functionally active and B cell helper quality differed depending on
      antigen specificity. Furthermore, we found higher frequency of pTfh cells in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens from the ALVAC+AIDSVAX (RV144) HIV
      vaccine trial associated with protective antibody responses compared to the
      non-protective DNA+Ad5 vaccine trial. Together, we identify IL-21(+)CD4(+) T
      cells as pTfh cells, implicating them as key populations in the generation of
      vaccine-evoked antibody responses.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a curative
      treatment for hematologic malignancies, relies on donor cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      (CTL)-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Major complications of HSCT
      are graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that targets specific tissues and tumor
      relapses. However, the mechanisms dictating the anatomical features of GVHD and
      GVL remain unclear. Here, we show that after HSCT, CTLs exhibited different
      killing activity in distinct tissues, being highest in the liver and lowest in
      lymph nodes. Differences were imposed by the microenvironment, partly through
      differential PD-1 ligand expression, which was strongly elevated in lymph nodes. 
      Two-photon imaging revealed that PD-1 blockade restored CTL sensitivity to
      antigen and killing in lymph nodes. Weak CTL activity in lymph nodes promoted
      local tumor escape but could be reversed by anti-PD-1 treatment. Our results
      uncover a mechanism generating an anatomical segregation of CTL activity that
      might dictate sites of GVHD and create niches for tumor escape.

AB  - There is little insight into or agreement about the signals that control
      differentiation of memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). By 
      performing BrdU pulse-labeling studies, we found that MBC formation preceded the 
      formation of LLPCs in an adoptive transfer immunization system, which allowed for
      a synchronized Ag-specific response with homogeneous Ag-receptor, yet at natural 
      precursor frequencies. We confirmed these observations in wild-type (WT) mice and
      extended them with germinal center (GC) disruption experiments and variable
      region gene sequencing. We thus show that the GC response undergoes a temporal
      switch in its output as it matures, revealing that the reaction engenders both
      MBC subsets with different immune effector function and, ultimately, LLPCs at
      largely separate points in time. These data demonstrate the kinetics of the
      formation of the cells that provide stable humoral immunity and therefore have
      implications for autoimmunity, for vaccine development, and for understanding
      long-term pathogen resistance.

AB  - The inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is essential for natural killer (NK) cell
      development with its canonical role being to antagonize E-protein function and
      alternate lineage fate. Here we have identified a key role for Id2 in regulating 
      interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor signaling and homeostasis of NK cells by
      repressing multiple E-protein target genes including Socs3. Id2 deletion in
      mature NK cells was incompatible with their homeostasis due to impaired IL-15
      receptor signaling and metabolic function and this could be rescued by strong
      IL-15 receptor stimulation or genetic ablation of Socs3. During NK cell
      maturation, we observed an inverse correlation between E-protein target genes and
      Id2. These results shift the current paradigm on the role of ID2, indicating that
      it is required not only to antagonize E-proteins during NK cell commitment, but
      constantly required to titrate E-protein activity to regulate NK cell fitness and
      responsiveness to IL-15.

AB  - Current approaches to cancer immunotherapy aim to engage the natural T cell
      response against tumors. One limitation is the elimination of
      self-antigen-specific T cells from the immune repertoire. Using a system in which
      precursor frequency can be manipulated in a murine melanoma model, we
      demonstrated that the clonal abundance of CD4(+) T cells specific for self-tumor 
      antigen positively correlated with antitumor efficacy. At elevated precursor
      frequencies, intraclonal competition impaired initial activation and overall
      expansion of the tumor-specific CD4(+) T cell population. However, through
      clonally derived help, this population acquired a polyfunctional effector
      phenotype and antitumor immunity was enhanced. Conversely, development of
      effector function was attenuated at low precursor frequencies due to irreversible
      T cell exhaustion. Our findings assert that the differential effects of T cell
      clonal abundance on phenotypic outcome should be considered during the design of 
      adoptive T cell therapies, including use of engineered T cells.

AB  - Host defense depends on orchestrated cell migration guided by chemokines that
      elicit selective but biased signaling pathways to control chemotaxis. Here, we
      showed that different inflammatory stimuli provoked oligomerization of the
      chemokine receptor CCR7, enabling human dendritic cells and T cell subpopulations
      to process guidance cues not only through classical G protein-dependent signaling
      but also by integrating an oligomer-dependent Src kinase signaling pathway.
      Efficient CCR7-driven migration depends on a hydrophobic oligomerization
      interface near the conserved NPXXY motif of G protein-coupled receptors as shown 
      by mutagenesis screen and a CCR7-SNP demonstrating super-oligomer characteristics
      leading to enhanced Src activity and superior chemotaxis. Furthermore, Src
      phosphorylates oligomeric CCR7, thereby creating a docking site for
      SH2-domain-bearing signaling molecules. Finally, we identified CCL21-biased
      signaling that involved the phosphatase SHP2 to control efficient cell migration.
      Collectively, our data showed that CCR7 oligomers serve as molecular hubs
      regulating distinct signaling pathways.

AB  - Viruses are obligate parasites and thus require the machinery of the host cell to
      replicate. Inhibition of host factors co-opted during active infection is a
      strategy hosts use to suppress viral replication and a potential pan-antiviral
      therapy. To define the cellular proteins and processes required for a virus
      during infection is thus crucial to understanding the mechanisms of virally
      induced disease. In this report, we generated fully infectious tagged influenza
      viruses and used infection-based proteomics to identify pivotal arms of cellular 
      signaling required for influenza virus growth and infectivity. Using mathematical
      modeling and genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we revealed that modulation of
      Sec61-mediated cotranslational translocation selectively impaired glycoprotein
      proteostasis of influenza as well as HIV and dengue viruses and led to inhibition
      of viral growth and infectivity. Thus, by studying virus-human protein-protein
      interactions in the context of active replication, we have identified targetable 
      host factors for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.

AB  - AIF has been known to have both apoptotic and metabolic roles. Green and
      colleagues show that T cells, but not B cells, rely on AIF to maintain
      mitochondrial electron transport and that metabolic, rather than apoptotic,
      pathways mediate this dependence.

AB  - Chemokine receptors are known to signal through heterotrimeric G proteins. In
      this issue, Hauser et al. (2016) report that inflammatory cues can induce
      tetramers of the chemokine receptor CCR7 that serve as scaffolds integrating G
      protein with Src kinase signaling.

AB  - Neutrophils are recruited from the blood to sites of sterile inflammation, where 
      they are involved in wound healing but can also cause tissue damage. During
      sterile inflammation, necrotic cells release pro-inflammatory molecules including
      formylated peptides. However, the signaling pathway triggered by formylated
      peptides to integrin activation and leukocyte recruitment is unknown. By using
      spinning-disk confocal intravital microscopy, we examined the molecular
      mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to sites of focal hepatic necrosis in vivo.
      We demonstrated that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) was required for multiple
      Mac-1 activation events involved in neutrophil recruitment and functions during
      sterile inflammation triggered by fMLF. The Src family kinase Hck,
      Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein, and phospholipase Cgamma2 were also involved in
      this pathway required for fMLF-triggered Mac-1 activation and neutrophil
      recruitment. Thus, we have identified a neutrophil Btk signalosome that is
      involved in a signaling pathway triggered by formylated peptides leading to the
      selective activation of Mac-1 and neutrophil recruitment during sterile
      inflammation.

AB  - Numerous studies of the anti-HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 41 (gp41) broadly
      neutralizing antibody 4E10 suggest that 4E10 also interacts with membrane lipids,
      but the antibody regions contacting lipids and its orientation with respect to
      the viral membrane are unknown. Vaccine immunogens capable of re-eliciting these 
      membrane proximal external region (MPER)-like antibodies may require a lipid
      component to be successful. We performed a systematic crystallographic study of
      lipid binding to 4E10 to identify lipids bound by the antibody and the
      lipid-interacting regions. We identified phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol,
      and glycerol phosphate as specific ligands for 4E10 in the crystal structures.
      4E10 used its CDRH1 loop to bind the lipid head groups, while its CDRH3
      interacted with the hydrophobic lipid tails. Identification of the lipid binding 
      sites on 4E10 may aid design of immunogens for vaccines that include a lipid
      component in addition to the MPER on gp41 for generation of broadly neutralizing 
      antibodies.

AB  - Exposure to inhaled allergens generates T helper 2 (Th2) CD4(+) T cells that
      contribute to episodes of inflammation associated with asthma. Little is known
      about allergen-specific Th2 memory cells and their contribution to airway
      inflammation. We generated reagents to understand how endogenous CD4(+) T cells
      specific for a house dust mite (HDM) allergen form and function. After allergen
      exposure, HDM-specific memory cells persisted as central memory cells in the
      lymphoid organs and tissue-resident memory cells in the lung. Experimental
      blockade of lymphocyte migration demonstrated that lung-resident cells were
      sufficient to induce airway hyper-responsiveness, which depended upon CD4(+) T
      cells. Investigation into the differentiation of pathogenic Trm cells revealed
      that interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling was required for residency and directed a
      program of tissue homing migrational cues. These studies thus identify
      IL-2-dependent resident Th2 memory cells as drivers of lung allergic responses.

TI  - Interleukin-23-Induced Transcription Factor Blimp-1 Promotes Pathogenicity of T
      Helper 17 Cells.

AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine required for the
      pathogenicity of T helper 17 (Th17) cells but the molecular mechanisms governing 
      this process remain unclear. We identified the transcription factor Blimp-1
      (Prdm1) as a key IL-23-induced factor that drove the inflammatory function of
      Th17 cells. In contrast to thymic deletion of Blimp-1, which causes T cell
      development defects and spontaneous autoimmunity, peripheral deletion of this
      transcription factor resulted in reduced Th17 activation and reduced severity of 
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, genome-wide occupancy and
      overexpression studies in Th17 cells revealed that Blimp-1 co-localized with
      transcription factors RORgammat, STAT-3, and p300 at the Il23r, Il17a/f, and Csf2
      cytokine loci to enhance their expression. Blimp-1 also directly bound to and
      repressed cytokine loci Il2 and Bcl6. Taken together, our results demonstrate
      that Blimp-1 is an essential transcription factor downstream of IL-23 that acts
      in concert with RORgammat to activate the Th17 inflammatory program.

AB  - Respiratory viral infections are a significant burden to healthcare worldwide.
      Many whole genome expression profiles have identified different respiratory viral
      infection signatures, but these have not translated to clinical practice. Here,
      we performed two integrated, multi-cohort analyses of publicly available
      transcriptional data of viral infections. First, we identified a common host
      signature across different respiratory viral infections that could distinguish
      (1) individuals with viral infections from healthy controls and from those with
      bacterial infections, and (2) symptomatic from asymptomatic subjects prior to
      symptom onset in challenge studies. Second, we identified an influenza-specific
      host response signature that (1) could distinguish influenza-infected samples
      from those with bacterial and other respiratory viral infections, (2) was a
      diagnostic and prognostic marker in influenza-pneumonia patients and influenza
      challenge studies, and (3) was predictive of response to influenza vaccine. Our
      results have applications in the diagnosis, prognosis, and identification of drug
      targets in viral infections.

AB  - Systems approaches have been used to describe molecular signatures driving
      immunity to influenza vaccination in humans. Whether such signatures are similar 
      across multiple seasons and in diverse populations is unknown. We applied systems
      approaches to study immune responses in young, elderly, and diabetic subjects
      vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine across five consecutive seasons.
      Signatures of innate immunity and plasmablasts correlated with and predicted
      influenza antibody titers at 1 month after vaccination with >80% accuracy across 
      multiple seasons but were not associated with the longevity of the response.
      Baseline signatures of lymphocyte and monocyte inflammation were positively and
      negatively correlated, respectively, with antibody responses at 1 month. Finally,
      integrative analysis of microRNAs and transcriptomic profiling revealed potential
      regulators of vaccine immunity. These results identify shared vaccine-induced
      signatures across multiple seasons and in diverse populations and might help
      guide the development of next-generation vaccines that provide persistent
      immunity against influenza.

AB  - Tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) have been observed in the meninges of multiple
      sclerosis (MS) patients, but the stromal cells and molecular signals that support
      TLTs remain unclear. Here, we show that T helper 17 (Th17) cells induced robust
      TLTs within the brain meninges that were associated with local demyelination
      during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Th17-cell-induced TLTs were
      underpinned by a network of stromal cells producing extracellular matrix proteins
      and chemokines, enabling leukocytes to reside within, rather than simply transit 
      through, the meninges. Within the CNS, interactions between lymphotoxin alphabeta
      (LTalphabeta) on Th17 cells and LTbetaR on meningeal radio-resistant cells were
      necessary for the propagation of de novo interleukin-17 responses, and activated 
      T cells from MS patients expressed elevated levels of LTbetaR ligands. Therefore,
      input from both Th17 cells and the lymphotoxin pathway induce the formation of an
      immune-competent stromal cell niche in the meninges.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), its adaptor MyD88, the downstream transcription
      factor interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), and type I interferons (IFN-I) are 
      all required for resistance to infection with ectromelia virus (ECTV). However,
      it is not known how or in which cells these effectors function to promote
      survival. Here, we showed that after infection with ECTV, the TLR9-MyD88-IRF7
      pathway was necessary in CD11c(+) cells for the expression of proinflammatory
      cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (iMos) to the draining
      lymph node (dLN). In the dLN, the major producers of IFN-I were infected iMos,
      which used the DNA sensor-adaptor STING to activate IRF7 and nuclear factor
      kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling to induce the expression of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, 
      respectively. Thus, in vivo, two pathways of DNA pathogen sensing act
      sequentially in two distinct cell types to orchestrate resistance to a viral
      disease.

AB  - The interleukin-1 receptor I (IL-1RI) is critical for host resistance to
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), yet the mechanisms of IL-1RI-mediated pathogen 
      control remain unclear. Here, we show that without IL-1RI, Mtb-infected newly
      recruited Ly6G(hi) myeloid cells failed to upregulate tumor necrosis factor
      receptor I (TNF-RI) and to produce reactive oxygen species, resulting in
      compromised pathogen control. Furthermore, simultaneous ablation of IL-1RI and
      TNF-RI signaling on either stroma or hematopoietic cells led to early lethality, 
      indicating non-redundant and synergistic roles of IL-1 and TNF in mediating
      macrophage-stroma cross-talk that was critical for optimal control of Mtb
      infection. Finally, we show that even in the presence of functional Mtb-specific 
      adaptive immunity, the lack of IL-1alpha and not IL-1beta led to an exuberant
      intracellular pathogen replication and progressive non-resolving inflammation.
      Our study reveals functional interdependence between IL-1 and TNF in enabling Mtb
      control mechanisms that are critical for host survival.

AB  - Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells contribute to local immune protection in
      non-lymphoid tissues such as skin and mucosa, but little is known about their
      transcriptional regulation. Here we showed that CD8(+)CD103(+) Trm cells,
      independent of circulating memory T cells, were sufficient for protection against
      infection and described molecular elements that were crucial for their
      development in skin and lung. We demonstrated that the T-box transcription
      factors (TFs) Eomes and T-bet combined to control CD8(+)CD103(+) Trm cell
      formation, such that their coordinate downregulation was crucial for TGF-beta
      cytokine signaling. TGF-beta signaling, in turn, resulted in reciprocal T-box TF 
      downregulation. However, whereas extinguishment of Eomes was necessary for
      CD8(+)CD103(+) Trm cell development, residual T-bet expression maintained cell
      surface interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor beta-chain (CD122) expression and thus
      IL-15 responsiveness. These findings indicate that the T-box TFs control the two 
      cytokines, TGF-beta and IL-15, which are pivotal for CD8(+)CD103(+) Trm cell
      development and survival.

TI  - Toll-like Receptor 4 Engagement on Dendritic Cells Restrains Phago-Lysosome
      Fusion and Promotes Cross-Presentation of Antigens.
PG  - 1087-100

AB  - The initiation of cytotoxic immune responses by dendritic cells (DCs) requires
      the presentation of antigenic peptides derived from phagocytosed microbes and
      infected or dead cells to CD8(+) T cells, a process called cross-presentation.
      Antigen cross-presentation by non-activated DCs, however, is not sufficient for
      the effective induction of immune responses. Additionally, DCs need to be
      activated through innate receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs). During DC
      maturation, cross-presentation efficiency is first upregulated and then turned
      off. Here we show that during this transient phase of enhanced
      cross-presentation, phago-lysosome fusion was blocked by the topological
      re-organization of lysosomes into perinuclear clusters. LPS-induced lysosomal
      clustering, inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion and enhanced cross-presentation, 
      all required expression of the GTPase Rab34. We conclude that TLR4 engagement
      induces a Rab34-dependent re-organization of lysosomal distribution that delays
      antigen degradation to transiently enhance cross-presentation, thereby optimizing
      the priming of CD8(+) T cell responses against pathogens.

AB  - The high-mannose patch on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein is the epicenter 
      for binding of the potent broadly neutralizing PGT121 family of antibodies, but
      strategies for generating such antibodies by vaccination have not been defined.
      We generated structures of inferred antibody intermediates by X-ray
      crystallography and electron microscopy to elucidate the molecular events that
      occurred during evolution of this family. Binding analyses revealed that affinity
      maturation was primarily focused on avoiding, accommodating, or binding the N137 
      glycan. The overall antibody approach angle to Env was defined very early in the 
      maturation process, yet some variation evolved in the PGT121 family branches that
      led to differences in glycan specificities in their respective epitopes.
      Furthermore, we determined a crystal structure of the recombinant BG505 SOSIP.664
      HIV-1 trimer with a PGT121 family member at 3.0 A that, in concert with these
      antibody intermediate structures, provides insights to advance design of HIV
      vaccine candidates.

AB  - The T helper 17 (Th17) cell pathway has been linked by genome-wide association
      studies to multiple autoimmune diseases. Identification of the genetic causes of 
      primary immunodeficiency diseases revealed that Th17 cells are also critical in
      host immunity to mucocutaneous candida infections and Staphylococcus aureus.
      Therapeutic interventions with inhibitors of the different components of the
      pathway such as interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-23, IL-17A, and IL-17RA have variably 
      beneficial effects in psoriasis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
      arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-infectious uveitis, and multiple
      sclerosis. Thus, whereas Th17 cells are protective against Candida albicans and
      to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus, they are pathogenic in many autoimmune 
      diseases. Here, we compare and contrast the effects of human genetic mutations of
      and therapeutic interventions targeted at Th17 cell molecules. We discuss that
      although there are similarities when Th17 cell pathway molecules are modulated,
      each molecule has unique non-Th17 cell features that lead to different functional
      outcomes.

      tissue inducer cells and stromal cells. In this issue of Immunity, Pikor and
      colleagues (2015) find that signals from IL-17-producing T helper cells can alter
      the stromal microenvironment of the inflamed brain to generate a neo-lymphoid
      organ that drives further inflammation.

AB  - The central nervous system (CNS) is an immunologically privileged site protected 
      from uncontrolled access of T cells by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is
      breached upon autoimmune inflammation. Here we have shown that receptor activator
      of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) on T cells regulates C-C type
      chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) production by astrocytes and T cell localization in
      the CNS. Importantly, mice specifically lacking RANKL in T cells were resistant
      to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) due to altered T cell
      trafficking. Pharmacological inhibition of RANKL prevented the development of EAE
      without affecting the peripheral immune response, indicating that RANKL is a
      potential therapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases in the CNS.

AB  - Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of arterial wall. Mitochondrial
      DNA (mtDNA) and human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (Cramp in mice) are involved in
      atherosclerosis. Recently, mtDNA has been found to escape from autophagy and
      cause inflammation. Normally, mtDNA as an inflammatogenic factor cannot escape
      from autophagy and degradation by DNase II. In this study, we found elevated
      amounts of LL37-mtDNA complex in atherosclerotic plasma and plaques. The complex 
      was resistant to DNase II degradation and escaped from autophagic recognition,
      leading to activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-mediated inflammatory
      responses. Mouse model studies indicated that Cramp-mtDNA complex aggravated
      atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and antibody 
      treatment against the complex alleviated the lesion. These findings suggest that 
      the LL-37-mtDNA complex acts as a key mediator of atherosclerosis formation, and 
      thus represents a promising therapeutic target.

TI  - The Inhibitory Receptor NKG2A Sustains Virus-Specific CD8(+) T Cells in Response 
      to a Lethal Poxvirus Infection.
PG  - 1112-24
LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.11.005 [doi]
LID - S1074-7613(15)00457-4 [pii]
AB  - CD8(+) T cells and NK cells protect from viral infections by killing virally
      infected cells and secreting interferon-gamma. Several inhibitory receptors limit
      the magnitude and duration of these anti-viral responses. NKG2A, which is encoded
      by Klrc1, is a lectin-like inhibitory receptor that is expressed as a heterodimer
      with CD94 on NK cells and activated CD8(+) T cells. Previous studies on the
      impact of CD94/NKG2A heterodimers on anti-viral responses have yielded
      contrasting results and the in vivo function of NKG2A remains unclear. Here, we
      generated Klrc1(-/-) mice and found that NKG2A is selectively required for
      resistance to ectromelia virus (ECTV). NKG2A functions intrinsically within
      ECTV-specific CD8(+) T cells to limit excessive activation, prevent apoptosis,
      and preserve the specific CD8(+) T cell response. Thus, although inhibitory
      receptors often cause T cell exhaustion and viral spreading during chronic viral 
      infections, NKG2A optimizes CD8(+) T cell responses during an acute poxvirus
      infection.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3' OH kinase (PI3K) signaling and FOXO transcription factors
      play opposing roles at several B cell developmental stages. We show here abundant
      nuclear FOXO1 expression in the proliferative compartment of the germinal center 
      (GC), its dark zone (DZ), and PI3K activity, downregulating FOXO1, in the light
      zone (LZ), where cells are selected for further differentiation. In the LZ,
      however, FOXO1 was expressed in a fraction of cells destined for DZ reentry. Upon
      FOXO1 ablation or induction of PI3K activity, GCs lost their DZ, owing at least
      partly to downregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Although this prevented
      proper cyclic selection of cells in GCs, somatic hypermutation and proliferation 
      were maintained. Class switch recombination was partly lost due to a failure of
      switch region targeting by activation-induced deaminase (AID).

AB  - The pathways regulating formation of the germinal center (GC) dark zone (DZ) and 
      light zone (LZ) are unknown. In this study we show that FOXO1 transcription
      factor expression was restricted to the GC DZ and was required for DZ formation, 
      since its absence in mice led to the loss of DZ gene programs and the formation
      of LZ-only GCs. FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation 
      but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of
      FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine
      receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the
      trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma
      cell differentiation. These results also have implications for the role of FOXO1 
      in lymphomagenesis because they suggest that constitutive FOXO1 activity might be
      required for the oncogenic activity of deregulated BCL6 expression.

TI  - A Wave of Regulatory T Cells into Neonatal Skin Mediates Tolerance to Commensal
      Microbes.

AB  - The skin is a site of constant dialog between the immune system and commensal
      bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow us to tolerate the
      presence of skin commensals without eliciting destructive inflammation are
      unknown. Using a model system to study the antigen-specific response to S.
      epidermidis, we demonstrated that skin colonization during a defined period of
      neonatal life was required for establishing immune tolerance to commensal
      microbes. This crucial window was characterized by an abrupt influx of highly
      activated regulatory T (Treg) cells into neonatal skin. Selective inhibition of
      this Treg cell wave completely abrogated tolerance. Thus, the host-commensal
      relationship in the skin relied on a unique Treg cell population that mediated
      tolerance to bacterial antigens during a defined developmental window. This
      suggests that the cutaneous microbiome composition in neonatal life is crucial in
      shaping adaptive immune responses to commensals, and disrupting these
      interactions might have enduring health implications.

AB  - Tissue damage caused by viral hepatitis is a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. Using a mouse model of viral hepatitis, we identified
      virus-induced early transcriptional changes in the redox pathways in the liver,
      including downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1). Sod1(-/-) mice
      exhibited increased inflammation and aggravated liver damage upon viral
      infection, which was independent of T and NK cells and could be ameliorated by
      antioxidant treatment. Type I interferon (IFN-I) led to a downregulation of Sod1 
      and caused oxidative liver damage in Sod1(-/-) and wild-type mice. Genetic and
      pharmacological ablation of the IFN-I signaling pathway protected against
      virus-induced liver damage. These results delineate IFN-I mediated oxidative
      stress as a key mediator of virus-induced liver damage and describe a mechanism
      of innate-immunity-driven pathology, linking IFN-I signaling with antioxidant
      host defense and infection-associated tissue damage. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) directed to the V2 apex of the HIV
      envelope (Env) trimer isolated from individual HIV-infected donors potently
      neutralize diverse HIV strains, but strategies for designing immunogens to elicit
      bnAbs have not been identified. Here, we compared four prototypes (PG9, CH01,
      PGT145, and CAP256.VRC26.09) of V2 apex bnAbs and showed that all recognized a
      core epitope of basic V2 residues and the glycan-N160. Two prototype bnAbs were
      derived from VH-germlines that were 99% identical and used a common germline
      D-gene encoded YYD-motif to interact with the V2-epitope. We identified isolates 
      that were neutralized by inferred germline (iGL) versions of three of the
      prototype bnAbs. Soluble Env derived from one of these isolates was shown to form
      a well-ordered Env trimer that could serve as an immunogen to initiate a V2-apex 
      bnAb response. These studies illustrate a strategy to transition from panels of
      bnAbs to vaccine candidates.

AB  - Epithelial cells orchestrate pulmonary homeostasis and pathogen defense and play 
      a crucial role in the initiation of allergic immune responses. Maintaining the
      balance between homeostasis and inappropriate immune activation and associated
      pathology is particularly complex at mucosal sites that are exposed to billions
      of potentially antigenic particles daily. We demonstrated that epithelial
      cell-derived cytokine TGF-beta had a central role in the generation of the
      pulmonary immune response. Mice that specifically lacked epithelial cell-derived 
      TGF-beta1 displayed a reduction in type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), resulting
      in suppression of interleukin-13 and hallmark features of the allergic response
      including airway hyperreactivity. ILCs in the airway lumen were primed to respond
      to TGF-beta by expressing the receptor TGF-betaRII and ILC chemoactivity was
      enhanced by TGF-beta. These data demonstrate that resident epithelial cells
      instruct immune cells, highlighting the central role of the local environmental
      niche in defining the nature and magnitude of immune reactions.

      MDA5-Driven Autoimmunity and Multi-organ Development.

AB  - Mutations in ADAR, which encodes the ADAR1 RNA-editing enzyme, cause
      Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a severe autoimmune disease associated with an 
      aberrant type I interferon response. How ADAR1 prevents autoimmunity remains
      incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that ADAR1 is a specific and essential
      negative regulator of the MDA5-MAVS RNA sensing pathway. Moreover, we uncovered a
      MDA5-MAVS-independent function for ADAR1 in the development of multiple organs.
      We showed that the p150 isoform of ADAR1 uniquely regulated the MDA5 pathway,
      whereas both the p150 and p110 isoforms contributed to development. Abrupt
      deletion of ADAR1 in adult mice revealed that both of these functions were
      required throughout life. Our findings delineate genetically separable roles for 
      both ADAR1 isoforms in vivo, with implications for the human diseases caused by
      ADAR mutations.

AB  - We are exposed to a wide spectrum of fungi including innocuous environmental
      organisms, opportunistic pathogens, commensal organisms, and fungi that can
      actively and explicitly cause disease. Much less is understood about effective
      host immunity to fungi than is generally known about immunity to bacterial and
      viral pathogens. Innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are required for
      effective host defense against Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and others,
      with specific elements of the host response regulating specific types of fungal
      infections (e.g., mucocutaneous versus systemic). Here we will review themes and 
      controversies that are currently shaping investigation of antifungal immunity
      (primarily to Candida and Aspergillus) and will also examine the emerging field
      of the role of fungi in the gut microbiome.

AB  - How immune tolerance is maintained in the skin remains unclear. In this issue of 
      Immunity, Rosenblum and colleagues demonstrate that tolerance to commensal
      bacteria is established during the neonatal period via regulatory T cells.
      Defining the crucial window during which commensal-specific tolerance is achieved
      has strategic implications for the induction of tolerance in allergic diseases.

AB  - Parasitic helminths are potent regulators of host immunity, including inhibition 
      of allergic inflammation. In this issue of Immunity, Zaiss et al. (2015) reveal
      that microbiota compositional shifts during helminth infection contribute to the 
      multifaceted ways that helminths modulate host immunity.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes on the apex of the 
      HIV-1 envelope spike are an attractive vaccine target, yet engineering immunogens
      that recapitulate such epitopes has proven difficult. In this issue of Immunity, 
      Andrabi and colleagues (2015) identify an exciting new candidate immunogen that
      could initiate the production of these types of antibodies through vaccination.

AB  - How inflammatory caspases trigger pyroptotic cell death is mostly unexplained. In
      this issue of Immunity, Nunez and colleagues report that caspase-11 cleaves the
      transmembrane channel pannexin-1, causing an efflux of cellular ATP that promotes
      a P2X7 receptor-dependent pyroptosis.

AB  - Defective neutrophils in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) cause 
      susceptibility to extracellular and intracellular infections. Microbes must first
      be ejected from intracellular niches to expose them to neutrophil attack, so we
      hypothesized that inflammasomes detect certain CGD pathogens upstream of
      neutrophil killing. Here, we identified one such ubiquitous environmental
      bacterium, Chromobacterium violaceum, whose extreme virulence was fully
      counteracted by the NLRC4 inflammasome. Caspase-1 protected via two parallel
      pathways that eliminated intracellular replication niches. Pyroptosis was the
      primary bacterial clearance mechanism in the spleen, but both pyroptosis and
      interleukin-18 (IL-18)-driven natural killer (NK) cell responses were required
      for liver defense. NK cells cleared hepatocyte replication niches via
      perforin-dependent cytotoxicity, whereas interferon-gamma was not required. These
      insights suggested a therapeutic approach: exogenous IL-18 restored
      perforin-dependent cytotoxicity during infection by the inflammasome-evasive
      bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Therefore, inflammasomes can trigger
      complementary programmed cell death mechanisms, directing sterilizing immunity
      against intracellular bacterial pathogens.

      Mediate Pyroptosis and Endotoxic Shock.

AB  - The noncanonical inflammasome induced by intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      leads to caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis, which is critical for induction of
      endotoxic shock in mice. However, the signaling pathway downstream of caspase-11 
      is unknown. We found that cytosolic LPS stimulation induced caspase-11-dependent 
      cleavage of the pannexin-1 channel followed up by ATP release, which in turn
      activated the purinergic P2X7 receptor to mediate cytotoxicity. In the absence of
      P2X7 or pannexin-1, pyroptosis induced by cytosolic LPS was abrogated. Cleavage
      of pannexin-1 required the catalytic activity of caspase-11 and was essential for
      ATP release and P2X7-mediated pyroptosis. Priming the caspase-11 pathway in vivo 
      with LPS or Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3) agonist resulted in high mortality in
      wild-type mice after secondary LPS challenge, but not in Casp11(-/-), Panx1(-/-),
      or P2x7(-/-) mice. These results reveal a critical role for pannexin-1 and P2X7
      downstream of caspase-11 for pyroptosis and susceptibility to sepsis induced by
      the noncanonical inflammasome.

TI  - CD4+ T Cell Tolerance to Tissue-Restricted Self Antigens Is Mediated by
      Antigen-Specific Regulatory T Cells Rather Than Deletion.

AB  - Deletion of self-antigen-specific T cells during thymic development provides
      protection from autoimmunity. However, it is unclear how efficiently this occurs 
      for tissue-restricted self antigens, or how immune tolerance is maintained for
      self-antigen-specific T cells that routinely escape deletion. Here we show that
      endogenous CD4+ T cells with specificity for a set of tissue-restricted self
      antigens were not deleted at all. For pancreatic self antigen, this resulted in
      an absence of steady-state tolerance, while for the lung and intestine, tolerance
      was maintained by the enhanced presence of thymically-derived antigen-specific
      Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. Unlike deletional tolerance, Treg cell-mediated
      tolerance was broken by successive antigen challenges. These findings reveal that
      for some tissue-restricted self antigens, tolerance relies entirely on
      nondeletional mechanisms that are less durable than T cell deletion. This might
      explain why autoimmunity is often tissue-specific, and it offers a rationale for 
      cancer vaccine strategies targeting tissue-restricted tumor antigens.

AB  - Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme-mediating class-switch
      recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes, is
      essential for the removal of developing autoreactive B cells. How AID mediates
      central B cell tolerance remains unknown. We report that AID enzymes were
      produced in a discrete population of immature B cells that expressed
      recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG2), suggesting that they undergo secondary
      recombination to edit autoreactive antibodies. However, most AID+ immature B
      cells lacked anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and were deleted by apoptosis. AID inhibition
      using lentiviral-encoded short hairpin (sh)RNA in B cells developing in humanized
      mice resulted in a failure to remove autoreactive clones. Hence, B cell intrinsic
      AID expression mediates central B cell tolerance potentially through its
      RAG-coupled genotoxic activity in self-reactive immature B cells.

AB  - Microbe-induced receptor trafficking has emerged as an essential means to promote
      innate immune signal transduction. Upon detection of bacterial
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS), CD14 induces an inflammatory endocytosis pathway that 
      delivers Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to endosomes. Although several regulators of
      CD14-dependent TLR4 endocytosis have been identified, the cargo-selection
      mechanism during this process remains unknown. We reveal that, in contrast to
      classic cytosolic interactions that promoted the endocytosis of transmembrane
      receptors, TLR4 was selected as cargo for inflammatory endocytosis entirely
      through extracellular interactions. Mechanistically, the extracellular protein
      MD-2 bound to and dimerized TLR4 in order to promote this endocytic event. Our
      analysis of LPS variants from human pathogens and gut commensals revealed a
      common mechanism by which bacteria prevent inflammatory endocytosis. We suggest
      that evasion of CD14-dependent endocytosis is an attribute that transcends the
      concept of pathogenesis and might be a fundamental feature of bacteria that
      inhabit eukaryotic hosts.

AB  - Intestinal helminths are potent regulators of their host's immune system and can 
      ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma. In the present study we
      have assessed whether this anti-inflammatory activity was purely intrinsic to
      helminths, or whether it also involved crosstalk with the local microbiota. We
      report that chronic infection with the murine helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus 
      bakeri (Hpb) altered the intestinal habitat, allowing increased short chain fatty
      acid (SCFA) production. Transfer of the Hpb-modified microbiota alone was
      sufficient to mediate protection against allergic asthma. The helminth-induced
      anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and regulatory T cell suppressor activity
      that mediated the protection required the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)-41. A 
      similar alteration in the metabolic potential of intestinal bacterial communities
      was observed with diverse parasitic and host species, suggesting that this
      represents an evolutionary conserved mechanism of host-microbe-helminth
      interactions.

AB  - The precise impact of thymic positive and negative selection on the T cell
      receptor (TCR) repertoire remains controversial. Here, we used unbiased,
      high-throughput cloning and retroviral expression of individual pre-selection
      TCRs to provide a direct assessment of these processes at the clonal level in
      vivo. We found that 15% of random TCRs induced signaling and directed positive
      (7.5%) or negative (7.5%) selection, depending on strength of signal, whereas the
      remaining 85% failed to induce signaling or selection. Most negatively selected
      TCRs exhibited promiscuous crossreactivity toward multiple other major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes. In contrast, TCRs that were
      positively selected or non-selected were minimally crossreactive. Negative
      selection of crossreactive TCRs led to clonal deletion but also recycling into
      intestinal CD4(-)CD8beta(-) intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs). Thus, broadly
      crossreactive TCRs arise at low frequency in the pre-selection repertoire but
      constitute the primary drivers of thymic negative selection and iIEL lineage
      differentiation.

TI  - The PIAS-like Coactivator Zmiz1 Is a Direct and Selective Cofactor of Notch1 in T
      Cell Development and Leukemia.

AB  - Pan-NOTCH inhibitors are poorly tolerated in clinical trials because NOTCH
      signals are crucial for intestinal homeostasis. These inhibitors might also
      promote cancer because NOTCH can act as a tumor suppressor. We previously
      reported that the PIAS-like coactivator ZMIZ1 is frequently co-expressed with
      activated NOTCH1 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we show
      that similar to Notch1, Zmiz1 was important for T cell development and controlled
      the expression of certain Notch target genes, such as Myc. However, unlike Notch,
      Zmiz1 had no major role in intestinal homeostasis or myeloid suppression.
      Deletion of Zmiz1 impaired the initiation and maintenance of Notch-induced T-ALL.
      Zmiz1 directly interacted with Notch1 via a tetratricopeptide repeat domain at a 
      special class of Notch-regulatory sites. In contrast to the Notch cofactor Maml, 
      which is nonselective, Zmiz1 was selective. Thus, targeting the NOTCH1-ZMIZ1
      interaction might combat leukemic growth while avoiding the intolerable
      toxicities of NOTCH inhibitors.

TI  - Dietary Fatty Acids Directly Impact Central Nervous System Autoimmunity via the
      Small Intestine.

AB  - Growing empirical evidence suggests that nutrition and bacterial metabolites
      might impact the systemic immune response in the context of disease and
      autoimmunity. We report that long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) enhanced
      differentiation and proliferation of T helper 1 (Th1) and/or Th17 cells and
      impaired their intestinal sequestration via p38-MAPK pathway. Alternatively,
      dietary short-chain FAs (SCFAs) expanded gut T regulatory (Treg) cells by
      suppression of the JNK1 and p38 pathway. We used experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model of T cell-mediated autoimmunity to show that
      LCFAs consistently decreased SCFAs in the gut and exacerbated disease by
      expanding pathogenic Th1 and/or Th17 cell populations in the small intestine.
      Treatment with SCFAs ameliorated EAE and reduced axonal damage via long-lasting
      imprinting on lamina-propria-derived Treg cells. These data demonstrate a direct 
      dietary impact on intestinal-specific, and subsequently central nervous
      system-specific, Th cell responses in autoimmunity, and thus might have
      therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Ubiquitin Ligase TRIM62 Regulates CARD9-Mediated Anti-fungal Immunity and
      Intestinal Inflammation.

AB  - CARD9 is a central component of anti-fungal innate immune signaling via C-type
      lectin receptors, and several immune-related disorders are associated with CARD9 
      alterations. Here, we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection against
      inflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation.
      We showed that the protective variant of CARD9, which is C-terminally truncated, 
      acted in a dominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production,
      indicating an important role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified
      TRIM62 as a CARD9 binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked
      poly-ubiquitination of CARD9. We identified K125 as the ubiquitinated residue on 
      CARD9 and demonstrated that this ubiquitination was essential for CARD9 activity.
      Furthermore, we showed that similar to Card9-deficient mice, Trim62-deficient
      mice had increased susceptibility to fungal infection. In this study, we utilized
      a rare protective allele to uncover a TRIM62-mediated mechanism for regulation of
      CARD9 activation.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells have historically been considered short-lived cytolytic
      cells that can rapidly respond against pathogens and tumors in an
      antigen-independent manner and then undergo cell death. Recently, however, NK
      cells have been shown to possess traits of adaptive immunity and can acquire
      immunological memory in a manner similar to that of T and B cells. In this
      review, we discuss evidence of NK cell memory and the mechanisms involved in the 
      generation and survival of these innate lymphocytes.

AB  - Predicting cancer patients' response to therapy is essential for curing disease
      and improving quality of life. Garraway and colleagues demonstrate that the
      frequency and number of neoantigens, non-synonymous mutations, and adaptive
      immune genes, but not the assessment of individual recurrent neoantigens or
      mutations, predicts patient responses to immunotherapy.

AB  - In this issue of Immunity, Haghikia and colleagues (2015) demonstrate that
      dietary fatty acids, by modulating gut microbes and their metabolism, regulate
      mucosal immune cells to impact systemic immunity. Using this mechanism, dietary
      and bacteria-derived medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids exacerbate, whereas 
      short-chain fatty acids ameliorate, autoimmunity in the brain.

AB  - Food-specific IgE is central to the pathobiology of food allergy, but not
      sufficient to induce disease. Chen et al. (2015) demonstrate that food-elicited
      reactions require an immature mast cell that generates IL-9 to induce its own
      maturation.

AB  - Long studied as modulators of insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue immune cells
      have recently been implicated in regulating fat mass and weight gain. In this
      issue of Immunity, Reisner and colleagues (2015) report that ablation of
      perforin-expressing dendritic cells induces T cell expansion, worsening
      autoimmunity and surprisingly increasing adiposity.

AB  - Whereas dendritic cells (DCs) can be activated in many ways to trigger immunity, 
      hardly anything is known about the mechanisms that counterbalance DC activation. 
      Cyster and colleagues now demonstrate that the "self" molecule CD47 on
      erythrocytes critically restricts splenic DC activation.

AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is considered a critical regulator of IL-17 in
      lymphocytes. Whereas antibodies targeting IL-23 ameliorate colitis, IL-17
      neutralization exacerbates disease. In this issue, Cua and colleagues and Maxwell
      and colleagues show that IL-17 maintains intestinal barrier integrity, helping
      explain this dichotomy (Lee et al., 2015; Maxwell et al., 2015).

AB  - Activation of the immune response during injury is a critical early event that
      determines whether the outcome of tissue restoration is regeneration or
      replacement of the damaged tissue with a scar. The mechanisms by which immune
      signals control these fundamentally different regenerative pathways are largely
      unknown. We have demonstrated that, during skin repair in mice, interleukin-4
      receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha)-dependent macrophage activation controlled collagen
      fibril assembly and that this process was important for effective repair while
      having adverse pro-fibrotic effects. We identified Relm-alpha as one important
      player in the pathway from IL-4Ralpha signaling in macrophages to the induction
      of lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2), an enzyme that directs persistent pro-fibrotic
      collagen cross-links, in fibroblasts. Notably, Relm-beta induced LH2 in human
      fibroblasts, and expression of both factors was increased in
      lipodermatosclerosis, a condition of excessive human skin fibrosis. Collectively,
      our findings provide mechanistic insights into the link between type 2 immunity
      and initiation of pro-fibrotic pathways.

AB  - Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like
      receptors, and cytoplasmic DNA receptors are essential for protection against
      pathogens but require tight control to avert inflammatory diseases. The
      mechanisms underlying this strict regulation are unclear. MYSM1 was previously
      described as a key component of epigenetic signaling machinery. We found that in 
      response to microbial stimuli, MYSM1 accumulated in the cytoplasm where it
      interacted with and inactivated TRAF3 and TRAF6 complexes to terminate PRR
      pathways for pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses. Consequently,
      Mysm1 deficiency in mice resulted in hyper-inflammation and enhanced viral
      clearance but also susceptibility to septic shock. We identified two motifs in
      MYSM1 that were essential for innate immune suppression: the SWIRM domain that
      interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6 and the metalloproteinase domain that removed K63
      polyubiquitins. This study identifies MYSM1 as a key negative regulator of the
      innate immune system that guards against an overzealous self-destructive immune
      response.

TI  - Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Interacting Protein Deficiency Uncovers the Role of the 
      Co-receptor CD19 as a Generic Hub for PI3 Kinase Signaling in B Cells.

AB  - Humans with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome display a progressive immunological disorder
      associated with compromised Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Interacting Protein (WIP)
      function. Mice deficient in WIP recapitulate such an immunodeficiency that has
      been attributed to T cell dysfunction; however, any contribution of B cells is as
      yet undefined. Here we have shown that WIP deficiency resulted in defects in B
      cell homing, chemotaxis, survival, and differentiation, ultimately leading to
      diminished germinal center formation and antibody production. Furthermore, in the
      absence of WIP, several receptors, namely the BCR, BAFFR, CXCR4, CXCR5, CD40, and
      TLR4, were impaired in promoting CD19 co-receptor activation and subsequent PI3
      kinase (PI3K) signaling. The underlying mechanism was due to a distortion in the 
      actin and tetraspanin networks that lead to altered CD19 cell surface dynamics.
      In conclusion, our findings suggest that, by regulating the cortical actin
      cytoskeleton, WIP influences the function of CD19 as a general hub for PI3K
      signaling.

AB  - Development of dendritic cells (DCs) commences in the bone marrow, from where
      pre-DCs migrate to peripheral organs to differentiate into mature DCs in situ.
      However, the factors that regulate organ-specific differentiation to give rise to
      tissue-specific DC subsets remain unclear. Here we show that the
      Ras-PI3Kgamma-Akt-mTOR signaling axis acted downstream of FLT3L signaling and was
      required for development of lung CD103(+) DCs and, to a smaller extent, for lung 
      CD11b(+) DCs, but not related DC populations in other non-lymphoid organs.
      Furthermore, we show that in lymphoid organs such as the spleen, DCs depended on 
      a similar signaling network to respond to FLT3 ligand with overlapping and
      partially redundant roles for kinases PI3Kgamma and PI3Kdelta. Thus we identified
      PI3Kgamma as an essential organ-specific regulator of lung DC development and
      discovered a signaling network regulating tissue-specific DC development mediated
      by FLT3.

AB  - Sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) have long been used as a model antigen for
      eliciting systemic immune responses, yet the basis for their adjuvant activity
      has been unknown. Here, we show that SRBCs failed to engage the inhibitory mouse 
      SIRPalpha receptor on splenic CD4(+) dendritic cells (DCs), and this failure led 
      to DC activation. Removal of the SIRPalpha ligand, CD47, from self-RBCs was
      sufficient to convert them into an adjuvant for adaptive immune responses. DC
      capture of Cd47(-/-) RBCs and DC activation occurred within minutes in a
      Src-family-kinase- and CD18-integrin-dependent manner. These findings provide an 
      explanation for the adjuvant mechanism of SRBCs and reveal that splenic DCs
      survey blood cells for missing self-CD47, a process that might contribute to
      detecting and mounting immune responses against pathogen-infected RBCs.

AB  - Epigenetic changes, including histone methylation, control T cell differentiation
      and memory formation, though the enzymes that mediate these processes are not
      clear. We show that UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, supports T
      follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses that are essential for B cell antibody
      generation and the resolution of chronic viral infections. Mice with a T
      cell-specific UTX deletion had fewer Tfh cells, reduced germinal center
      responses, lacked virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), and were unable to
      resolve chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections. UTX-deficient T
      cells showed decreased expression of interleukin-6 receptor-alpha and other Tfh
      cell-related genes that were associated with increased H3K27 methylation.
      Additionally, Turner Syndrome subjects, who are predisposed to chronic ear
      infections, had reduced UTX expression in immune cells and decreased circulating 
      CD4(+) CXCR5(+) T cell frequency. Thus, we identify a critical link between UTX
      in T cells and immunity to infection.

AB  - Whether interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has pathogenic and/or protective roles in the
      gut mucosa is controversial and few studies have analyzed specific cell
      populations for protective functions within the inflamed colonic tissue. Here we 
      have provided evidence for IL-17A-dependent regulation of the tight junction
      protein occludin during epithelial injury that limits excessive permeability and 
      maintains barrier integrity. Analysis of epithelial cells showed that in the
      absence of signaling via the IL-17 receptor adaptor protein Act-1, the protective
      effect of IL-17A was abrogated and inflammation was enhanced. We have
      demonstrated that after acute intestinal injury, IL-23R(+) gammadelta T cells in 
      the colonic lamina propria were the primary producers of early, gut-protective
      IL-17A, and this production of IL-17A was IL-23 independent, leaving protective
      IL-17 intact in the absence of IL-23. These results suggest that IL-17-producing 
      gammadelta T cells are important for the maintenance and protection of epithelial
      barriers in the intestinal mucosa.

AB  - Interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17 are cytokines currently being targeted in
      clinical trials. Although inhibition of both of these cytokines is effective for 
      treating psoriasis, IL-12 and IL-23 p40 inhibition attenuates Crohn's disease,
      whereas IL-17A or IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) inhibition exacerbates Crohn's
      disease. This dichotomy between IL-23 and IL-17 was effectively modeled in the
      multidrug resistance-1a-ablated (Abcb1a(-/-)) mouse model of colitis. IL-23
      inhibition attenuated disease by decreasing colonic inflammation while enhancing 
      regulatory T (Treg) cell accumulation. Exacerbation of colitis by IL-17A or
      IL-17RA inhibition was associated with severe weakening of the intestinal
      epithelial barrier, culminating in increased colonic inflammation and accelerated
      mortality. These data show that IL-17A acts on intestinal epithelium to promote
      barrier function and provide insight into mechanisms underlying exacerbation of
      Crohn's disease when IL-17A or IL-17RA is inhibited.

AB  - Experimental IgE-mediated food allergy depends on intestinal anaphylaxis driven
      by interleukin-9 (IL-9). However, the primary cellular source of IL-9 and the
      mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to food-induced intestinal anaphylaxis
      remain unclear. Herein, we have reported the identification of multifunctional
      IL-9-producing mucosal mast cells (MMC9s) that can secrete prodigious amounts of 
      IL-9 and IL-13 in response to IL-33, and mast cell protease-1 (MCPt-1) in
      response to antigen and IgE complex crosslinking, respectively. Repeated
      intragastric antigen challenge induced MMC9 development that required T cells,
      IL-4, and STAT6 transcription factor, but not IL-9 signals. Mice ablated of MMC9 
      induction failed to develop intestinal mastocytosis, which resulted in decreased 
      food allergy symptoms that could be restored by adoptively transferred MMC9s.
      Finally, atopic patients that developed food allergy displayed increased
      intestinal expression of Il9- and MC-specific transcripts. Thus, the induction of
      MMC9s is a pivotal step to acquire the susceptibility to IgE-mediated food
      allergy.

AB  - The differentiation of CD4(+) helper T cell subsets with diverse effector
      functions is accompanied by changes in metabolism required to meet their
      bioenergetic demands. We find that follicular B helper T (Tfh) cells exhibited
      less proliferation, glycolysis, and mitochondrial respiration, accompanied by
      reduced mTOR kinase activity compared to T helper 1 (Th1) cells in response to
      acute viral infection. IL-2-mediated activation of the Akt kinase and mTORc1
      signaling was both necessary and sufficient to shift differentiation away from
      Tfh cells, instead promoting that of Th1 cells. These findings were not the
      result of generalized signaling attenuation in Tfh cells, because they retained
      the ability to flux calcium and activate NFAT-transcription-factor-dependent
      cytokine production. These data identify the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-mTORc1 axis as 
      a critical orchestrator of the reciprocal balance between Tfh and Th1 cell fates 
      and their respective metabolic activities after acute viral infection.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that immunological mechanisms underlie metabolic
      control of adipose tissue. Here, we have shown the regulatory impact of a rare
      subpopulation of dendritic cells, rich in perforin-containing granules
      (perf-DCs). Using bone marrow transplantation to generate animals selectively
      lacking perf-DCs, we found that these chimeras progressively gained weight and
      exhibited features of metabolic syndrome. This phenotype was associated with an
      altered repertoire of T cells residing in adipose tissue and could be completely 
      prevented by T cell depletion in vivo. A similar impact of perf-DCs on
      inflammatory T cells was also found in a well-defined model of multiple
      sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephlalomyelitis (EAE). Thus, perf-DCs
      probably represent a regulatory cell subpopulation critical for protection from
      metabolic syndrome and autoimmunity.

AB  - The crosstalk between inflammation and tumorigenesis is now clearly established. 
      However, how inflammation is elicited in the metastatic environment and the
      corresponding contribution of innate immunity pathways in suppressing tumor
      growth at secondary sites are poorly understood. Here, we show that mice
      deficient in Nlrp3 inflammasome components had exacerbated liver colorectal
      cancer metastatic growth, which was mediated by impaired interleukin-18 (IL-18)
      signaling. Control of tumor growth was independent of differential cancer cell
      colonization or proliferation, intestinal microbiota effects, or tumoricidal
      activity by the adaptive immune system. Instead, the inflammasome-IL-18 pathway
      impacted maturation of hepatic NK cells, surface expression of the death ligand
      FasL, and capacity to kill FasL-sensitive tumors. Our results define a regulatory
      signaling circuit within the innate immune system linking inflammasome activation
      to effective NK-cell-mediated tumor attack required to suppress colorectal cancer
      growth in the liver.

AB  - Innate resistance to Candida albicans in mucosal tissues requires the production 
      of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) by tissue-resident cells early during infection, but 
      the mechanism of cytokine production has not been precisely defined. In the skin,
      we found that dermal gammadelta T cells were the dominant source of IL-17A during
      C. albicans infection and were required for pathogen resistance. Induction of
      IL-17A from dermal gammadelta T cells and resistance to C. albicans required
      IL-23 production from CD301b(+) dermal dendritic cells (dDCs). In addition, we
      found that sensory neurons were directly activated by C. albicans. Ablation of
      sensory neurons increased susceptibility to C. albicans infection, which could be
      rescued by exogenous addition of the neuropeptide CGRP. These data define a model
      in which nociceptive pathways in the skin drive production of IL-23 by CD301b(+) 
      dDCs resulting in IL-17A production from gammadelta T cells and resistance to
      cutaneous candidiasis.

AB  - Immune cells play a key role in host defense against infection and cancer. Upon
      encountering danger signals, these cells undergo activation leading to a
      modulation in their immune functions. However, recent studies reveal that immune 
      cells upon activation also show distinct metabolic changes that impact their
      immune functions. Such metabolic reprogramming and its functional effects are
      well known for cancer cells. Given that immune cells have emerged as crucial
      players in cancer progression, it is important to understand whether immune cells
      also undergo metabolic reprogramming in tumors and how this might affect their
      contribution in cancer progression. This emerging aspect of tumor-associated
      immune cells is reviewed here, discussing metabolic reprogramming of different
      immune cell types, the key pathways involved, and its impact on tumor
      progression.

AB  - The immune response requires major changes to metabolic processes, and indeed,
      energy metabolism and functional activation are fully integrated in immune cells 
      to determine their ability to divide, differentiate, and carry out effector
      functions. Immune cell metabolism has therefore become an attractive target area 
      for therapeutic purposes. A neglected aspect in the translation of
      immunometabolism is the critical connection between systemic and cellular
      metabolism. Here, we discuss the importance of understanding and manipulating the
      integration of systemic and immune cell metabolism through in-depth analysis of
      immune cell phenotype and function in human metabolic diseases and, in parallel, 
      of the effects of conventional metabolic drugs on immune cell differentiation and
      function. We examine how the recent identification of selective metabolic
      programs operating in distinct immune cell subsets and functions has the
      potential to deliver tools for cell- and function-specific immunometabolic
      targeting.

AB  - Elucidating the function of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T (Treg) cells has been
      difficult. In this issue of Immunity, Joshi et al. (2015) demonstrate that Treg
      cells associated with murine lung cancers are found within tertiary lymphoid
      structures and actively restrain effector T cells at the tumor site.

AB  - IgA is induced through T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways. In this issue,
      Bunker et al. (2015) now show that the T-cell-independent pathway is sufficient
      to coat most small intestinal microbes specifically, and Fransen et al. (2015)
      find that IgA coating promotes uptake of microbes into Peyer's patches and drives
      further induction in a positive-feedback loop.

AB  - Sensory neurons are important in controlling cutaneous inflammation, but the role
      of neurons in host antimicrobial defense was relatively unknown. Kaplan and
      colleagues now demonstrate that nociceptive fibers within the dermis play a
      crucial role in antifungal defenses through their influence on dermal dendritic
      cells and induction of IL-17A.

AB  - Many functionally important interactions between genes and proteins involved in
      immunological diseases and processes are unknown. The exponential growth in
      public high-throughput data offers an opportunity to expand this knowledge. To
      unlock human-immunology-relevant insight contained in the global biomedical
      research effort, including all public high-throughput datasets, we performed
      immunological-pathway-focused Bayesian integration of a comprehensive,
      heterogeneous compendium comprising 38,088 genome-scale experiments. The
      distillation of this knowledge into immunological networks of functional
      relationships between molecular entities (ImmuNet), and tools to mine this
      resource, are accessible to the public at http://immunet.princeton.edu. The
      predictive capacity of ImmuNet, established by rigorous statistical validation,
      is easily accessed by experimentalists to generate data-driven hypotheses. We
      demonstrate the power of this approach through the identification of unique
      host-virus interaction responses, and we show how ImmuNet complements genetic
      studies by predicting disease-associated genes. ImmuNet should be widely
      beneficial for investigating the mechanisms of the human immune system and
      immunological diseases.

      Impact Viral Set Point.

AB  - CD8(+) T cells contribute to the control of HIV, but it is not clear whether
      initial immune responses modulate the viral set point. We screened high-risk
      uninfected women twice a week for plasma HIV RNA and identified 12 hyperacute
      infections. Onset of viremia elicited a massive HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell
      response, with limited bystander activation of non-HIV memory CD8(+) T cells.
      HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells secreted little interferon-gamma, underwent rapid
      apoptosis, and failed to upregulate the interleukin-7 receptor, known to be
      important for T cell survival. The rapidity to peak CD8(+) T cell activation and 
      the absolute magnitude of activation induced by the exponential rise in viremia
      were inversely correlated with set point viremia. These data indicate that rapid,
      high magnitude HIV-induced CD8(+) T cell responses are crucial for subsequent
      immune control of acute infection, which has important implications for HIV
      vaccine design.

AB  - Three subsets of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells have been identified,
      NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17, which produce distinct cytokines when stimulated, but
      little is known about their localization. Here, we have defined the anatomic
      localization and systemic distribution of these subsets and measured their
      cytokine production. Thymic NKT2 cells that produced interleukin-4 (IL-4) at
      steady state were located in the medulla and conditioned medullary thymocytes.
      NKT2 cells were abundant in the mesenteric lymph node (LN) of BALB/c mice and
      produced IL-4 in the T cell zone that conditioned other lymphocytes. Intravenous 
      injection of alpha-galactosylceramide activated NKT1 cells with vascular access, 
      but not LN or thymic NKT cells, resulting in systemic interferon-gamma and IL-4
      production, while oral alpha-galactosylceramide activated NKT2 cells in the
      mesenteric LN, resulting in local IL-4 release. These findings indicate that the 
      localization of iNKT cells governs their cytokine response both at steady state
      and upon activation.

TI  - BALB/c and C57BL/6 Mice Differ in Polyreactive IgA Abundance, which Impacts the
      Generation of Antigen-Specific IgA and Microbiota Diversity.

AB  - The interrelationship between IgAs and microbiota diversity is still unclear.
      Here we show that BALB/c mice had higher abundance and diversity of IgAs than
      C57BL/6 mice and that this correlated with increased microbiota diversity. We
      show that polyreactive IgAs mediated the entrance of non-invasive bacteria to
      Peyer's patches, independently of CX3CR1(+) phagocytes. This allowed the
      induction of bacteria-specific IgA and the establishment of a positive feedback
      loop of IgA production. Cohousing of mice or fecal transplantation had little or 
      no influence on IgA production and had only partial impact on microbiota
      composition. Germ-free BALB/c, but not C57BL/6, mice already had polyreactive
      IgAs that influenced microbiota diversity and selection after colonization.
      Together, these data suggest that genetic predisposition to produce polyreactive 
      IgAs has a strong impact on the generation of antigen-specific IgAs and the
      selection and maintenance of microbiota diversity.

AB  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has emerged as a
      crucial cytokine produced by auto-reactive T helper (Th) cells that initiate
      tissue inflammation. Multiple cell types can sense GM-CSF, but the identity of
      the pathogenic GM-CSF-responsive cells is unclear. By using conditional gene
      targeting, we systematically deleted the GM-CSF receptor (Csf2rb) in specific
      subpopulations throughout the myeloid lineages. Experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) progressed normally when either classical dendritic cells
      (cDCs) or neutrophils lacked GM-CSF responsiveness. The development of
      tissue-invading monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) was also unperturbed
      upon Csf2rb deletion. Instead, deletion of Csf2rb in CCR2(+)Ly6C(hi) monocytes
      phenocopied the EAE resistance seen in complete Csf2rb-deficient mice.
      High-dimensional analysis of tissue-infiltrating moDCs revealed that GM-CSF
      initiates a combination of inflammatory mechanisms. These results indicate that
      GM-CSF signaling controls a pathogenic expression signature in CCR2(+)Ly6C(hi)
      monocytes and their progeny, which was essential for tissue damage.

AB  - Infiltration of regulatory T (Treg) cells into many tumor types correlates with
      poor patient prognoses. However, mechanisms of intratumoral Treg cell function
      remain to be elucidated. We investigated Treg cell function in a genetically
      engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma and found that Treg cells
      suppressed anti-tumor responses in tumor-associated tertiary lymphoid structures 
      (TA-TLSs). TA-TLSs have been described in human lung cancers, but their function 
      remains to be determined. TLSs in this model were spatially associated with >90% 
      of tumors and facilitated interactions between T cells and
      tumor-antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). Costimulatory ligand expression
      by DCs and T cell proliferation rates increased in TA-TLSs upon Treg cell
      depletion, leading to tumor destruction. Thus, we propose that Treg cells in
      TA-TLSs can inhibit endogenous immune responses against tumors, and targeting
      these cells might provide therapeutic benefit for cancer patients.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is observed in many human diseases, often
      associated with inflammation. ER stress can trigger inflammation through
      nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLRP3)
      inflammasome, which might stimulate inflammasome formation by association with
      damaged mitochondria. How ER stress triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and
      inflammasome activation is ill defined. Here we have used an infection model to
      show that the IRE1alpha ER stress sensor regulates regulated mitochondrial
      dysfunction through an NLRP3-mediated feed-forward loop, independently of ASC.
      IRE1alpha activation increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, promoting
      NLRP3 association with mitochondria. NLRP3 was required for ER stress-induced
      cleavage of caspase-2 and the pro-apoptotic factor, Bid, leading to subsequent
      release of mitochondrial contents. Caspase-2 and Bid were necessary for
      activation of the canonical inflammasome by infection-associated or general ER
      stress. These data identify an NLRP3-caspase-2-dependent mechanism that relays ER
      stress to the mitochondria to promote inflammation, integrating cellular stress
      and innate immunity.

AB  - Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is prominently secreted at mucosal surfaces and coats a
      fraction of the intestinal microbiota. However, the commensal bacteria bound by
      IgA are poorly characterized and the type of humoral immunity they elicit remains
      elusive. We used bacterial flow cytometry coupled with 16S rRNA gene sequencing
      (IgA-Seq) in murine models of immunodeficiency to identify IgA-bound bacteria and
      elucidate mechanisms of commensal IgA targeting. We found that residence in the
      small intestine, rather than bacterial identity, dictated induction of specific
      IgA. Most commensals elicited strong T-independent (TI) responses that originated
      from the orphan B1b lineage and from B2 cells, but excluded natural antibacterial
      B1a specificities. Atypical commensals including segmented filamentous bacteria
      and Mucispirillum evaded TI responses but elicited T-dependent IgA. These data
      demonstrate exquisite targeting of distinct commensal bacteria by multiple layers
      of humoral immunity and reveal a specialized function of the B1b lineage in TI
      mucosal IgA responses.

TI  - Cytosolic Nuclease TREX1 Regulates Oligosaccharyltransferase Activity Independent
      of Nuclease Activity to Suppress Immune Activation.
PG  - 463-74

AB  - TREX1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated negative regulator of innate
      immunity. TREX1 mutations are associated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory
      diseases. Biallelic mutations abrogating DNase activity cause autoimmunity by
      allowing immunogenic self-DNA to accumulate, but it is unknown how dominant
      frameshift (fs) mutations that encode DNase-active but mislocalized proteins
      cause disease. We found that the TREX1 C terminus suppressed immune activation by
      interacting with the ER oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and stabilizing
      its catalytic integrity. C-terminal truncation of TREX1 by fs mutations
      dysregulated the OST complex, leading to free glycan release from dolichol
      carriers, as well as immune activation and autoantibody production. A connection 
      between OST dysregulation and immune disorders was demonstrated in Trex1(-/-)
      mice, TREX1-V235fs patient lymphoblasts, and TREX1-V235fs knock-in mice.
      Inhibiting OST with aclacinomycin corrects the glycan and immune defects
      associated with Trex1 deficiency or fs mutation. This function of the TREX1 C
      terminus suggests a potential therapeutic option for TREX1-fs mutant-associated
      diseases.

      Signaling and Inflammation.

AB  - Interleukin-17 (IL-17) induces pathology in autoimmunity and infections;
      therefore, constraint of this pathway is an essential component of its
      regulation. We demonstrate that the signaling intermediate MCPIP1 (also termed
      Regnase-1, encoded by Zc3h12a) is a feedback inhibitor of IL-17 receptor signal
      transduction. MCPIP1 knockdown enhanced IL-17-mediated signaling, requiring
      MCPIP1's endoribonuclease but not deubiquitinase domain. MCPIP1 haploinsufficient
      mice showed enhanced resistance to disseminated Candida albicans infection, which
      was reversed in an Il17ra(-/-) background. Conversely, IL-17-dependent pathology 
      in Zc3h12a(+/-) mice was exacerbated in both EAE and pulmonary inflammation.
      MCPIP1 degraded Il6 mRNA directly but only modestly downregulated the IL-6
      promoter. However, MCPIP1 strongly inhibited the Lcn2 promoter by regulating the 
      mRNA stability of Nfkbiz, encoding the IkappaBzeta transcription factor.
      Unexpectedly, MCPIP1 degraded Il17ra and Il17rc mRNA, independently of the 3'
      UTR. The cumulative impact of MCPIP1 on IL-6, IkappaBzeta, and possibly IL-17R
      subunits results in a biologically relevant inhibition of IL-17 signaling.

AB  - The intestinal epithelial barrier plays a critical role in the mucosal immunity. 
      However, it remains largely unknown how the epithelial barrier is maintained
      after damage. Here we show that growth factor FGF2 synergized with interleukin-17
      (IL-17) to induce genes for repairing of damaged epithelium. FGF2 or IL-17
      deficiency resulted in impaired epithelial proliferation, increased
      pro-inflammatory microbiota outgrowth, and consequently worse pathology in a
      DSS-induced colitis model. The dysregulated microbiota in the model induced
      transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) expression, which in turn induced
      FGF2 expression mainly in regulatory T cells. Act1, an essential adaptor in IL-17
      signaling, suppressed FGF2-induced ERK activation through binding to adaptor
      molecule GRB2 to interfere with its association with guanine nucleotide exchange 
      factor SOS1. Act1 preferentially bound to IL-17 receptor complex, releasing its
      suppressive effect on FGF2 signaling. Thus, microbiota-driven FGF2 and IL-17
      cooperate to repair the damaged intestinal epithelium through Act1-mediated
      direct signaling cross-talk.

AB  - The dynamics of when and where CD4(+) T cells provide help for CD8(+) T cell
      priming and which dendritic cells (DCs) activate CD4(+) T cells in vivo after
      localized infection are poorly understood. By using a cutaneous herpes simplex
      virus infection model combined with intravital 2-photon imaging of the draining
      lymph node (LN) to concurrently visualize pathogen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T
      cells, we found that early priming of CD4(+) T cells involved clustering with
      migratory skin DCs. CD8(+) T cells did not interact with migratory DCs and their 
      activation was delayed, requiring later clustering interactions with LN-resident 
      XCR1(+) DCs. CD4(+) T cells interacted with these late CD8(+) T cell clusters on 
      resident XCR1(+) DCs. Together, these data reveal asynchronous T cell activation 
      by distinct DC subsets and highlight the key role of XCR1(+) DCs as the central
      platform for cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation and the delivery of CD4(+) T cell 
      help.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes and play a vital role in
      controlling viral infections and cancer. In contrast to B and T lymphopoiesis
      where cellular and regulatory pathways have been extensively characterized, the
      cellular stages of early human NK cell commitment remain poorly understood. Here 
      we demonstrate that a Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(+)CD123(-)CD45RA(+)CD7(+)CD10(+)CD127(-) 
      population represents a NK lineage-restricted progenitor (NKP) in fetal
      development, umbilical cord blood, and adult tissues. The newly identified NKP
      has robust NK cell potential both in vitro and in vivo, generates functionally
      cytotoxic NK cells, and lacks the ability to produce T cells, B cells, myeloid
      cells, and innate lymphoid-like cells (ILCs). Our findings identify an early step
      to human NK cell commitment and provide new insights into the human hematopoietic
      hierarchy.

AB  - Macrophages are one of the most diverse cell populations in terms of their
      anatomical location and functional specialization during both homeostasis and
      disease. Although it has been shown in different fate mapping models that some
      macrophages present in adult tissues are already established during fetal
      development, their exact origins are still under debate. In the current study, we
      developed a fate mapping strain, based on the Kit locus, which allowed us to
      readdress "the origins" question. Different types of macrophages from various
      adult tissues were traced to their fetal or adult sources by inducing labeling in
      precursors at several time points either during fetal development or in adult
      mice. We show that all adult macrophages, resident or infiltrating, are progenies
      of classical hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with the exception of microglia and, 
      partially epidermal Langerhans cells, which are yolk sac (YS)-derived.

AB  - Activated retina-specific T cells that have acquired the ability to break through
      the blood-retinal barrier are thought to be causally involved in autoimmune
      uveitis, a major cause of human blindness. It is unclear where these autoreactive
      T cells first become activated, given that their cognate antigens are sequestered
      within the immune-privileged eye. We demonstrate in a novel mouse model of
      spontaneous uveitis that activation of retina-specific T cells is dependent on
      gut commensal microbiota. Retina-specific T cell activation involved signaling
      through the autoreactive T cell receptor (TCR) in response to non-cognate antigen
      in the intestine and was independent of the endogenous retinal autoantigen. Our
      findings not only have implications for the etiology of human uveitis, but also
      raise the possibility that activation of autoreactive TCRs by commensal microbes 
      might be a more common trigger of autoimmune diseases than is currently
      appreciated.

AB  - Asthma is a T helper 2 (Th2)-cell-mediated disease; however, recent findings
      implicate Th17 and innate lymphoid cells also in regulating airway inflammation. 
      Herein, we have demonstrated profound interleukin-21 (IL-21) production after
      house dust mite (HDM)-driven asthma by using T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic
      mice reactive to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 and an IL-21GFP reporter mouse.
      IL-21-producing cells in the mediastinal lymph node (mLN) bore characteristics of
      T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, whereas IL-21(+) cells in the lung did not
      express CXCR5 (a chemokine receptor expressed by Tfh cells) and were distinct
      from effector Th2 or Th17 cells. Il21r(-/-) mice developed reduced type 2
      responses and the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) enhanced Th2 cell function in a
      cell-intrinsic manner. Finally, administration of recombinant IL-21 and IL-25
      synergistically promoted airway eosinophilia primarily via effects on CD4(+)
      lymphocytes. This highlights an important Th2-cell-amplifying function of
      IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells in allergic airway inflammation.

AB  - In response to infections and tissue damage, ASC-containing inflammasome protein 
      complexes are assembled that promote caspase-1 activation, IL-1beta and IL-18
      processing and release, pyroptosis, and the release of ASC particles. However,
      excessive or persistent activation of the inflammasome causes inflammatory
      diseases. Therefore, a well-balanced inflammasome response is crucial for the
      maintenance of homeostasis. We show that the PYD-only protein POP1 inhibited
      ASC-dependent inflammasome assembly by preventing inflammasome nucleation, and
      consequently interfered with caspase-1 activation, IL-1beta and IL-18 release,
      pyroptosis, and the release of ASC particles. There is no mouse ortholog for
      POP1, but transgenic expression of human POP1 in monocytes, macrophages, and
      dendritic cells protected mice from systemic inflammation triggered by molecular 
      PAMPs, inflammasome component NLRP3 mutation, and ASC danger particles. POP1
      expression was regulated by TLR and IL-1R signaling, and we propose that POP1
      provides a regulatory feedback loop that shuts down excessive inflammatory
      responses and thereby prevents systemic inflammation.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintenance of immune homeostasis.
      Here we found that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was required for Foxp3(+) Treg cell
      differentiation and function and that H2S deficiency led to systemic autoimmune
      disease. H2S maintained expression of methylcytosine dioxygenases Tet1 and Tet2
      by sulfhydrating nuclear transcription factor Y subunit beta (NFYB) to facilitate
      its binding to Tet1 and Tet2 promoters. Transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta)-activated Smad3 and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated Stat5 facilitated
      Tet1 and Tet2 binding to Foxp3. Tet1 and Tet2 catalyzed conversion of
      5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in Foxp3 to establish a 
      Treg-cell-specific hypomethylation pattern and stable Foxp3 expression.
      Consequently, Tet1 and Tet2 deletion led to Foxp3 hypermethylation, impaired Treg
      cell differentiation and function, and autoimmune disease. Thus, H2S promotes
      Tet1 and Tet2 expression, which are recruited to Foxp3 by TGF-beta and IL-2
      signaling to maintain Foxp3 demethylation and Treg-cell-associated immune
      homeostasis.

TI  - Pancreatic beta-Cells Limit Autoimmune Diabetes via an Immunoregulatory
      Antimicrobial Peptide Expressed under the Influence of the Gut Microbiota.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) expressed by epithelial and immune cells are
      largely described for the defense against invading microorganisms. Recently,
      their immunomodulatory functions have been highlighted in various contexts.
      However how AMPs expressed by non-immune cells might influence autoimmune
      responses in peripheral tissues, such as the pancreas, is unknown. Here, we found
      that insulin-secreting beta-cells produced the cathelicidin related antimicrobial
      peptide (CRAMP) and that this production was defective in non-obese diabetic
      (NOD) mice. CRAMP administrated to prediabetic NOD mice induced regulatory immune
      cells in the pancreatic islets, dampening the incidence of autoimmune diabetes.
      Additional investigation revealed that the production of CRAMP by beta-cells was 
      controlled by short-chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota.
      Accordingly, gut microbiota manipulations in NOD mice modulated CRAMP production 
      and inflammation in the pancreatic islets, revealing that the gut microbiota
      directly shape the pancreatic immune environment and autoimmune diabetes
      development.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that possess traits of adaptive 
      immunity, such as clonal expansion, contraction, and generation of long-lived
      "memory" cells, processes poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we
      found that as proliferating NK cells accumulated dysfunctional mitochondria
      during viral infection, a protective mitophagy pathway was induced during the
      contraction phase to promote their survival in a reactive oxygen species
      (ROS)-dependent manner. Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) or
      activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) during the
      contraction-to-memory phase transition of the antiviral response increased
      autophagic activity and enhanced memory NK cell numbers through an Atg3-dependent
      mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrated a temporally regulated role for
      mitophagy-inducing proteins BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3
      (BNIP3) and BNIP3-like (BNIP3L) in the generation of robust NK cell memory. Thus,
      our study reveals the functional importance of mitophagy during the dynamic
      response of these cytolytic innate lymphocytes.

TI  - Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPRS Is an Inhibitory Receptor on Human and Murine 
      Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells.

AB  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are primary producers of type I interferon
      (IFN) in response to viruses. The IFN-producing capacity of pDCs is regulated by 
      specific inhibitory receptors, yet none of the known receptors are conserved in
      evolution. We report that within the human immune system, receptor protein
      tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) is expressed specifically on pDCs. Surface
      PTPRS was rapidly downregulated after pDC activation, and only PTPRS(-) pDCs
      produced IFN-alpha. Antibody-mediated PTPRS crosslinking inhibited pDC
      activation, whereas PTPRS knockdown enhanced IFN response in a pDC cell line.
      Similarly, murine Ptprs and the homologous receptor phosphatase Ptprf were
      specifically co-expressed in murine pDCs. Haplodeficiency or DC-specific deletion
      of Ptprs on Ptprf-deficient background were associated with enhanced IFN response
      of pDCs, leukocyte infiltration in the intestine and mild colitis. Thus, PTPRS
      represents an evolutionarily conserved pDC-specific inhibitory receptor, and is
      required to prevent spontaneous IFN production and immune-mediated intestinal
      inflammation.

AB  - The eight-subunit T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex is the primary determinant
      for T cell fate decisions. Yet how it relays ligand-specific information across
      the cell membrane for conversion to chemical signals remains unresolved. We
      hypothesized that TCR engagement triggers a change in the spatial relationship
      between the associated CD3zetazeta subunits at the junction where they emerge
      from the membrane into the cytoplasm. Using three in situ proximity assays based 
      on ID-PRIME, FRET, and EPOR activity, we determined that the cytosolic
      juxtamembrane regions of the CD3zetazeta subunits are spread apart upon assembly 
      into the TCR-CD3 complex. TCR engagement then triggered their apposition. This
      mechanical switch resides upstream of the CD3zetazeta intracellular motifs that
      initiate chemical signaling, as well as the polybasic stretches that regulate
      signal potentiation. These findings provide a framework from which to examine
      triggering events for activating immune receptors and other complex molecular
      machines.

AB  - Commensal microbiota promote mucosal tolerance in part by engaging regulatory T
      (Treg) cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We report that Treg-cell-specific
      deletion of the TLR adaptor MyD88 resulted in deficiency of intestinal Treg
      cells, a reciprocal increase in T helper 17 (Th17) cells and heightened
      interleukin-17 (IL-17)-dependent inflammation in experimental colitis. It also
      precipitated dysbiosis with overgrowth of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB)
      and increased microbial loads in deep tissues. The Th17 cell dysregulation and
      bacterial dysbiosis were linked to impaired anti-microbial intestinal IgA
      responses, related to defective MyD88 adaptor- and Stat3 transcription
      factor-dependent T follicular regulatory and helper cell differentiation in the
      Peyer's patches. These findings establish an essential role for MyD88-dependent
      microbial sensing by Treg cells in enforcing mucosal tolerance and maintaining
      commensalism by promoting intestinal Treg cell formation and anti-commensal IgA
      responses.

AB  - Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) promote anti-helminth responses and
      contribute to allergies. Here, we report that Bcl11b, previously considered a
      T-cell-specific transcription factor, acted directly upstream of the key ILC2
      transcription factor Gfi1 to maintain its expression in mature ILC2s.
      Consequently, Bcl11b(-/-) ILC2s downregulated Gata3 and downstream genes,
      including Il1rl1 (encoding IL-33 receptor), and upregulated Rorc and type 3 ILC
      (ILC3) genes. Additionally, independent of Gfi1, Bcl11b directly repressed
      expression of the gene encoding the ILC3 transcription factor Ahr, further
      contributing to silencing of ILC3 genes in ILC2s. Thus, Bcl11b(-/-) ILC2s lost
      their functions and gained ILC3 functions, and although they expanded in response
      to the protease allergen papain, they produced ILC3 but not ILC2 cytokines and
      caused increased airway infiltration of neutrophils instead of eosinophils. Our
      results demonstrate that Bcl11b is more than just a T-cell-only transcription
      factor and establish that Bcl11b sustains mature ILC2 genetic and functional
      programs and lineage fidelity.

AB  - Primary T cell activation involves the integration of three distinct signals
      delivered in sequence: (1) antigen recognition, (2) costimulation, and (3)
      cytokine-mediated differentiation and expansion. Strong immunostimulatory events 
      such as immunotherapy or infection induce profound cytokine release causing
      "bystander" T cell activation, thereby increasing the potential for
      autoreactivity and need for control. We show that during strong stimulation, a
      profound suppression of primary CD4(+) T-cell-mediated immune responses ensued
      and was observed across preclinical models and patients undergoing high-dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy. This suppression targeted naive CD4(+) but not
      CD8(+) T cells and was mediated through transient suppressor of cytokine
      signaling-3 (SOCS3) inhibition of the STAT5b transcription factor signaling
      pathway. These events resulted in complete paralysis of primary CD4(+) T cell
      activation, affecting memory generation and induction of autoimmunity as well as 
      impaired viral clearance. These data highlight the critical regulation of naive
      CD4(+) T cells during inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Langerhans cells (LCs) populate the mucosal epithelium, a major entry portal for 
      pathogens, yet their ontogeny remains unclear. We found that, in contrast to skin
      LCs originating from self-renewing radioresistant embryonic precursors, oral
      mucosal LCs derive from circulating radiosensitive precursors. Mucosal LCs can be
      segregated into CD103(+)CD11b(lo) (CD103(+)) and CD11b(+)CD103(-) (CD11b(+))
      subsets. We further demonstrated that similar to non-lymphoid dendritic cells
      (DCs), CD103(+) LCs originate from pre-DCs, whereas CD11b(+) LCs differentiate
      from both pre-DCs and monocytic precursors. Despite this ontogenetic discrepancy 
      between skin and mucosal LCs, the transcriptomic signature and immunological
      function of oral LCs highly resemble those of skin LCs but not DCs. These
      findings, along with the epithelial position, morphology, and expression of the
      LC-associated phenotype strongly suggest that oral mucosal LCs are genuine LCs.
      Collectively, in a tissue-dependent manner, murine LCs differentiate from at
      least three distinct precursors (embryonic, pre-DC, and monocytic) in steady
      state.

AB  - The role of intestinal eosinophils in immune homeostasis is enigmatic and the
      molecular signals that drive them from protective to tissue damaging are unknown.
      Most commonly associated with Th2 cell-mediated diseases, we describe a role for 
      eosinophils as crucial effectors of the interleukin-23 (IL-23)-granulocyte
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) axis in colitis. Chronic intestinal
      inflammation was characterized by increased bone marrow eosinopoiesis and
      accumulation of activated intestinal eosinophils. IL-5 blockade or eosinophil
      depletion ameliorated colitis, implicating eosinophils in disease pathogenesis.
      GM-CSF was a potent activator of eosinophil effector functions and intestinal
      accumulation, and GM-CSF blockade inhibited chronic colitis. By contrast
      neutrophil accumulation was GM-CSF independent and dispensable for colitis. In
      addition to TNF secretion, release of eosinophil peroxidase promoted colitis
      identifying direct tissue-toxic mechanisms. Thus, eosinophils are key
      perpetrators of chronic inflammation and tissue damage in IL-23-mediated immune
      diseases and it suggests the GM-CSF-eosinophil axis as an attractive therapeutic 
      target.

      Inflammation by Promoting Regulatory T Cell Numbers.

AB  - House dust mite-derived proteases contribute to allergic disorders in part by
      disrupting epithelial barrier function. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), produced by lung 
      cells after exposure to protease allergens, can induce innate-type airway
      eosinophilia by activating natural helper (NH) cells, a member of group 2 innate 
      lymphoid cells (ILC2), to secrete Th2 type-cytokines. Because IL-33 also can
      induce mast cells (MCs) to secrete Th2 type-cytokines, MCs are thought to
      cooperate with NH cells in enhancing protease or IL-33-mediated innate-type
      airway eosinophilia. However, we found that MC-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice
      exhibited exacerbated protease-induced lung inflammation associated with reduced 
      numbers of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Moreover, IL-2 produced by IL-33-stimulated
      MCs promoted expansion of numbers of Treg cells, thereby suppressing development 
      of papain- or IL-33-induced airway eosinophilia. We have thus identified a unique
      anti-inflammatory pathway that can limit induction of innate-type allergic airway
      inflammation mediated by NH cells.

TI  - Orphan Nuclear Receptor ERRalpha Controls Macrophage Metabolic Signaling and A20 
      Expression to Negatively Regulate TLR-Induced Inflammation.

AB  - The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha; NR3B1) is 
      a key metabolic regulator, but its function in regulating inflammation remains
      largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ERRalpha negatively regulates
      Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced inflammation by promoting Tnfaip3 transcription 
      and fine-tuning of metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. ERRalpha-deficient
      (Esrra(-/-)) mice showed increased susceptibility to endotoxin-induced septic
      shock, leading to more severe pro-inflammatory responses than control mice.
      ERRalpha regulated macrophage inflammatory responses by directly binding the
      promoter region of Tnfaip3, a deubiquitinating enzyme in TLR signaling. In
      addition, Esrra(-/-) macrophages showed an increased glycolysis, but impaired
      mitochondrial respiratory function and biogenesis. Further, ERRalpha was required
      for the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling by controlling p65 acetylation via
      maintenance of NAD(+) levels and sirtuin 1 activation. These findings unravel a
      previously unappreciated role for ERRalpha as a negative regulator of TLR-induced
      inflammatory responses through inducing Tnfaip3 transcription and controlling the
      metabolic reprogramming.

AB  - Type-2-cell-mediated immunity, rich in eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, CD4(+)
      T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), protects the
      host from helminth infection but also drives chronic allergic diseases like
      asthma and atopic dermatitis. Barrier epithelial cells (ECs) represent the very
      first line of defense and express pattern recognition receptors to recognize
      type-2-cell-mediated immune insults like proteolytic allergens or helminths.
      These ECs mount a prototypical response made up of chemokines, innate cytokines
      such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin
      (TSLP), as well as the alarmins uric acid, ATP, HMGB1, and S100 proteins. These
      signals program dendritic cells (DCs) to mount Th2-cell-mediated immunity and in 
      so doing boost ILC2, basophil, and mast cell function. Here we review the general
      mechanisms of how different stimuli trigger type-2-cell-mediated immunity at
      mucosal barriers and how this leads to protection or disease.

AB  - When type III interferon (IFN-lambda; also known as interleukin-28 [IL-28] and
      IL-29) was discovered in 2003, its antiviral function was expected to be
      analogous to that of type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) via the induction of
      IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although IFN-lambda stimulates expression of
      antiviral ISGs preferentially in cells of epithelial origin, recent studies have 
      defined additional antiviral mechanisms in other cell types and tissues. Viral
      infection models using mice lacking IFN-lambda signaling and SNP associations
      with human disease have expanded our understanding of the contribution of
      IFN-lambda to the antiviral response at anatomic barriers and the immune response
      beyond these barriers. In this review, we highlight recent insights into
      IFN-lambda functions, including its ability to restrict virus spread into the
      brain and to clear chronic viral infections in the gastrointestinal tract. We
      also discuss how IFN-lambda modulates innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity,
      and tumor progression and its possible therapeutic applications in human disease.

AB  - The cytosolic helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) initiates immune
      responses to most RNA viruses by detecting viral 5'-triphosphorylated RNA
      (pppRNA). Although endogenous mRNA is also 5'-triphosphorylated, backbone
      modifications and the 5'-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent
      immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped 
      mRNA at the 5'-terminal nucleotide (N1) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. 
      Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA
      binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N1-2'O-methylated RNA.
      H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N1-2'O-methylated pppRNA.
      Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type
      RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N1-2'O-methyltransferase led to
      considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies
      involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2'O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A)
      revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a
      new role for cap N1-2'O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA.

AB  - Human group 1 ILCs consist of at least three phenotypically distinct subsets,
      including NK cells, CD127(+) ILC1, and intraepithelial CD103(+) ILC1. In inflamed
      intestinal tissues from Crohn's disease patients, numbers of CD127(+) ILC1
      increased at the cost of ILC3. Here we found that differentiation of ILC3 to
      CD127(+) ILC1 is reversible in vitro and in vivo. CD127(+) ILC1 differentiated to
      ILC3 in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-23, and IL-1beta dependent on
      the transcription factor RORgammat, and this process was enhanced in the presence
      of retinoic acid. Furthermore, we observed in resection specimen from Crohn's
      disease patients a higher proportion of CD14(+) dendritic cells (DC), which in
      vitro promoted polarization from ILC3 to CD127(+) ILC1. In contrast, CD14(-) DCs 
      promoted differentiation from CD127(+) ILC1 toward ILC3. These observations
      suggest that environmental cues determine the composition, function, and
      phenotype of CD127(+) ILC1 and ILC3 in the gut.

AB  - Antibody responses to viral infections are sustained for decades by long-lived
      plasma cells (LLPCs). However, LLPCs have yet to be characterized in humans. Here
      we used CD19, CD38, and CD138 to identify four PC subsets in human bone marrow
      (BM). We found that the CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) subset was morphologically
      distinct, differentially expressed PC-associated genes, and exclusively contained
      PCs specific for viral antigens to which the subjects had not been exposed for
      more than 40 years. Protein sequences of measles- and mumps-specific circulating 
      antibodies were encoded for by CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs in the BM. Finally, we
      found that CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs had a distinct RNA transcriptome signature
      and human immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) repertoire that was relatively
      uncoupled from other BM PC subsets and probably represents the B cell response's 
      "historical record" of antigenic exposure. Thus, our studies define human LLPCs
      and provide a mechanism for the life-long maintenance of anti-viral antibodies in
      the serum.

AB  - The B cell response to Salmonella typhimurium (STm) occurs massively at
      extrafollicular sites, without notable germinal centers (GCs). Little is known in
      terms of its specificity. To expand the knowledge of antigen targets, we screened
      plasmablast (PB)-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for Salmonella specificity,
      using ELISA, flow cytometry, and antigen microarray. Only a small fraction
      (0.5%-2%) of the response appeared to be Salmonella-specific. Yet, infection of
      mice with limited B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires impaired the response,
      suggesting that BCR specificity was important. We showed, using laser
      microdissection, that somatic hypermutation (SHM) occurred efficiently at
      extrafollicular sites leading to affinity maturation that in turn led to
      detectable STm Ag-binding. These results suggest a revised vision of how clonal
      selection and affinity maturation operate in response to Salmonella. Clonal
      selection initially is promiscuous, activating cells with virtually undetectable 
      affinity, yet SHM and selection occur during the extrafollicular response
      yielding higher affinity, detectable antibodies.

AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA)-dependent regulation of gene expression confers robustness to
      cellular phenotypes and controls responses to extracellular stimuli. Although a
      single miRNA can regulate expression of hundreds of target genes, it is unclear
      whether any of its distinct biological functions can be due to the regulation of 
      a single target. To explore in vivo the function of a single miRNA-mRNA
      interaction, we mutated the 3' UTR of a major miR-155 target (SOCS1) to
      specifically disrupt its regulation by miR-155. We found that under physiologic
      conditions and during autoimmune inflammation or viral infection, some
      immunological functions of miR-155 were fully or largely attributable to the
      regulation of SOCS1, whereas others could be accounted only partially or not at
      all by this interaction. Our data suggest that the role of a single miRNA-mRNA
      interaction is dependent on cell type and biological context.

AB  - During early embryogenesis, microglia arise from yolk sac progenitors that
      populate the developing central nervous system (CNS), but how the tissue-resident
      macrophages are maintained throughout the organism's lifespan still remains
      unclear. Here, we describe a system that allows specific, conditional ablation of
      microglia in adult mice. We found that the microglial compartment was
      reconstituted within 1 week of depletion. Microglia repopulation relied on
      CNS-resident cells, independent from bone-marrow-derived precursors. During
      repopulation, microglia formed clusters of highly proliferative cells that
      migrated apart once steady state was achieved. Proliferating microglia expressed 
      high amounts of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), and treatment with an IL-1R
      antagonist during the repopulation phase impaired microglia proliferation. Hence,
      microglia have the potential for efficient self-renewal without the contribution 
      of peripheral myeloid cells, and IL-1R signaling participates in this restorative
      proliferation process.

AB  - Targeted mutagenesis in mice is a powerful tool for functional analysis of genes.
      However, genetic variation between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) used for targeting
      (previously almost exclusively 129-derived) and recipient strains (often
      C57BL/6J) typically results in congenic mice in which the targeted gene is
      flanked by ESC-derived passenger DNA potentially containing mutations.
      Comparative genomic analysis of 129 and C57BL/6J mouse strains revealed indels
      and single nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in alternative or aberrant amino
      acid sequences in 1,084 genes in the 129-strain genome. Annotating these
      passenger mutations to the reported genetically modified congenic mice that were 
      generated using 129-strain ESCs revealed that nearly all these mice possess
      multiple passenger mutations potentially influencing the phenotypic outcome. We
      illustrated this phenotypic interference of 129-derived passenger mutations with 
      several case studies and developed a Me-PaMuFind-It web tool to estimate the
      number and possible effect of passenger mutations in transgenic mice of interest.

AB  - Distinct groups of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) such as ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3
      populate the intestine, but how these ILCs develop tissue tropism for this organ 
      is unclear. We report that prior to migration to the intestine ILCs first undergo
      a "switch" in their expression of homing receptors from lymphoid to gut homing
      receptors. This process is regulated by mucosal dendritic cells and the
      gut-specific tissue factor retinoic acid (RA). This change in homing receptors is
      required for long-term population and effector function of ILCs in the intestine.
      Only ILC1 and ILC3, but not ILC2, undergo the RA-dependent homing receptor switch
      in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In contrast, ILC2 acquire gut homing
      receptors in a largely RA-independent manner during their development in the bone
      marrow and can migrate directly to the intestine. Thus, distinct programs
      regulate the migration of ILC subsets to the intestine for regulation of innate
      immunity.

AB  - Colonization with a mixture of Clostridium species has been shown to induce
      accumulation of induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells in the colon. Transforming
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is an essential factor for iTreg cell induction;
      however, the relationship between Clostridium species and TGF-beta remains to be 
      clarified. Here we demonstrated that a gram-positive probiotic bacterial strain, 
      Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum), promoted iTreg cell generation in the
      intestine through induction of TGF-beta1 from lamina propria dendritic cells
      (LPDCs). C. butyricum-mediated TGF-beta1 induction was mainly Toll-like receptor 
      2 (TLR2) dependent, and the ERK-AP-1 kinase pathway played an important role. In 
      addition, the autocrine TGF-beta-Smad3 transcription factor signal was necessary 
      for robust TGF-beta expression in DCs, whereas Smad2 negatively regulated
      TGF-beta expression. Smad2-deficient DCs expressed higher concentrations of
      TGF-beta and were tolerogenic for colitis models. This study reveals a novel
      mechanism of TGF-beta induction by Clostridia through a cooperation between
      TLR2-AP-1 and TGF-beta-Smad signaling pathways.

      Activation during Immune Perturbation.

AB  - Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and regulatory T (Treg) cells are
      systemically induced by helminth infection but also sustain metabolic homeostasis
      in adipose tissue and contribute to tissue repair during injury. Here we show
      that interleukin-33 (IL-33) mediates activation of ILC2s and Treg cells in
      resting adipose tissue, but also after helminth infection or treatment with IL-2.
      Unexpectedly, ILC2-intrinsic IL-33 activation was required for Treg cell
      accumulation in vivo and was independent of ILC2 type 2 cytokines but partially
      dependent on direct co-stimulatory interactions via ICOSL-ICOS. IFN-gamma
      inhibited ILC2 activation and Treg cell accumulation by IL-33 in infected tissue,
      as well as adipose tissue, where repression increased with aging and high-fat
      diet-induced obesity. IL-33 and ILC2s are central mediators of type 2 immune
      responses that promote tissue and metabolic homeostasis, and IFN-gamma suppresses
      this pathway, likely to promote inflammatory responses and divert metabolic
      resources necessary to protect the host.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in the immune system. Much of their biology
      has been elucidated via culture systems in which hematopoietic precursors
      differentiate into DCs under the aegis of cytokines. A widely used protocol
      involves the culture of murine bone marrow (BM) cells with granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to generate BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). BMDCs
      express CD11c and MHC class II (MHCII) molecules and share with DCs isolated from
      tissues the ability to present exogenous antigens to T cells and to respond to
      microbial stimuli by undergoing maturation. We demonstrate that CD11c(+)MHCII(+) 
      BMDCs are in fact a heterogeneous group of cells that comprises conventional DCs 
      and monocyte-derived macrophages. DCs and macrophages in GM-CSF cultures both
      undergo maturation upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide but respond
      differentially to the stimulus and remain separable entities. These results have 
      important implications for the interpretation of a vast array of data obtained
      with DC culture systems.

AB  - The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene is crucial for establishing central
      immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Mutations in AIRE cause a
      rare autosomal-recessive disease, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1
      (APS-1), distinguished by multi-organ autoimmunity. We have identified multiple
      cases and families with mono-allelic mutations in the first plant homeodomain
      (PHD1) zinc finger of AIRE that followed dominant inheritance, typically
      characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared 
      to classical APS-1. These missense PHD1 mutations suppressed gene expression
      driven by wild-type AIRE in a dominant-negative manner, unlike CARD or truncated 
      AIRE mutants that lacked such dominant capacity. Exome array analysis revealed
      that the PHD1 dominant mutants were found with relatively high frequency
      (>0.0008) in mixed populations. Our results provide insight into the molecular
      action of AIRE and demonstrate that disease-causing mutations in the AIRE locus
      are more common than previously appreciated and cause more variable autoimmune
      phenotypes.

AB  - Research on the human microbiome has established that commensal and pathogenic
      bacteria can influence obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity through mechanisms
      mostly unknown. We found that a component of bacterial biofilms, the amyloid
      protein curli, irreversibly formed fibers with bacterial DNA during biofilm
      formation. This interaction accelerated amyloid polymerization and created potent
      immunogenic complexes that activated immune cells, including dendritic cells, to 
      produce cytokines such as type I interferons, which are pathogenic in systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE). When given systemically, curli-DNA composites
      triggered immune activation and production of autoantibodies in lupus-prone and
      wild-type mice. We also found that the infection of lupus-prone mice with
      curli-producing bacteria triggered higher autoantibody titers compared to
      curli-deficient bacteria. These data provide a mechanism by which the microbiome 
      and biofilm-producing enteric infections may contribute to the progression of SLE
      and point to a potential molecular target for treatment of autoimmunity.

AB  - Immune memory cells are poised to rapidly expand and elaborate effector functions
      upon reinfection yet exist in a functionally quiescent state. The paradigm is
      that memory T cells remain inactive due to lack of T cell receptor (TCR) stimuli.
      Here, we report that regulatory T (Treg) cells orchestrate memory T cell
      quiescence by suppressing effector and proliferation programs through inhibitory 
      receptor, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4). Loss of Treg
      cells resulted in activation of genome-wide transcriptional programs
      characteristic of effector T cells and drove transitioning as well as established
      memory CD8(+) T cells toward terminally differentiated
      KLRG-1(hi)IL-7Ralpha(lo)GzmB(hi) phenotype, with compromised metabolic fitness,
      longevity, polyfunctionality, and protective efficacy. CTLA-4 functionally
      replaced Treg cells in trans to rescue memory T cell defects and restore
      homeostasis. These studies present the CTLA-4-CD28-CD80/CD86 axis as a potential 
      target to accelerate vaccine-induced immunity and improve T cell memory quality
      in current cancer immunotherapies proposing transient Treg cell ablation.

AB  - Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) emerge during nonresolving peripheral
      inflammation, but their impact on disease progression remains unknown. We have
      found in aged Apoe(-/-) mice that artery TLOs (ATLOs) controlled highly
      territorialized aorta T cell responses. ATLOs promoted T cell recruitment, primed
      CD4(+) T cells, generated CD4(+), CD8(+), T regulatory (Treg) effector and
      central memory cells, converted naive CD4(+) T cells into induced Treg cells, and
      presented antigen by an unusual set of dendritic cells and B cells. Meanwhile,
      vascular smooth muscle cell lymphotoxin beta receptors (VSMC-LTbetaRs) protected 
      against atherosclerosis by maintaining structure, cellularity, and size of ATLOs 
      though VSMC-LTbetaRs did not affect secondary lymphoid organs: Atherosclerosis
      was markedly exacerbated in Apoe(-/-)Ltbr(-/-) and to a similar extent in aged
      Apoe(-/-)Ltbr(fl/fl)Tagln-cre mice. These data support the conclusion that the
      immune system employs ATLOs to organize aorta T cell homeostasis during aging and
      that VSMC-LTbetaRs participate in atherosclerosis protection via ATLOs.

AB  - Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in immune homeostasis;
      however, the mechanisms to maintain their function remain unclear. Here, we
      report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL is essential for Treg cell function. Mice
      with Foxp3-restricted VHL deletion displayed massive inflammation associated with
      excessive Treg cell interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. VHL-deficient Treg
      cells failed to prevent colitis induction, but converted into Th1-like effector T
      cells. VHL intrinsically orchestrated such conversion under both steady and
      inflammatory conditions followed by Foxp3 downregulation, which was reversed by
      IFN-gamma deficiency. Augmented hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha
      (HIF-1alpha)-induced glycolytic reprogramming was required for IFN-gamma
      production. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha bound directly to the Ifng promoter.
      HIF-1alpha knockdown or knockout could reverse the increased IFN-gamma by
      VHL-deficient Treg cells and restore their suppressive function in vivo. These
      findings indicate that regulation of HIF-1alpha pathway by VHL is crucial to
      maintain the stability and suppressive function of Foxp3(+) T cells.

AB  - Expansion and acquisition of Th1 cell effector function requires metabolic
      reprogramming; however, the signals instructing these adaptations remain poorly
      defined. Here we found that in activated human T cells, autocrine stimulation of 
      the complement receptor CD46, and specifically its intracellular domain CYT-1,
      was required for induction of the amino acid (AA) transporter LAT1 and enhanced
      expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Furthermore, CD46 activation
      simultaneously drove expression of LAMTOR5, which mediated assembly of the
      AA-sensing Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 complex and increased glycolysis and oxidative
      phosphorylation (OXPHOS), required for cytokine production. T cells from
      CD46-deficient patients, characterized by defective Th1 cell induction, failed to
      upregulate the molecular components of this metabolic program as well as
      glycolysis and OXPHOS, but IFN-gamma production could be reinstated by
      retrovirus-mediated CD46-CYT-1 expression. These data establish a critical link
      between the complement system and immunometabolic adaptations driving human
      CD4(+) T cell effector function.

TI  - The MicroRNA-132 and MicroRNA-212 Cluster Regulates Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Maintenance and Survival with Age by Buffering FOXO3 Expression.

AB  - MicroRNAs are critical post-transcriptional regulators of hematopoietic cell-fate
      decisions, though little remains known about their role in aging hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSCs). We found that the microRNA-212/132 cluster (Mirc19) is
      enriched in HSCs and is upregulated during aging. Both overexpression and
      deletion of microRNAs in this cluster leads to inappropriate hematopoiesis with
      age. Enforced expression of miR-132 in the bone marrow of mice led to rapid HSC
      cycling and depletion. A genetic deletion of Mirc19 in mice resulted in HSCs that
      had altered cycling, function, and survival in response to growth factor
      starvation. We found that miR-132 exerted its effect on aging HSCs by targeting
      the transcription factor FOXO3, a known aging associated gene. Our data
      demonstrate that Mirc19 plays a role in maintaining balanced hematopoietic output
      by buffering FOXO3 expression. We have thus identified it as a potential target
      that might play a role in age-related hematopoietic defects.

AB  - Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a nuclear-associated cytokine of the IL-1 family
      originally described as a potent inducer of allergic type 2 immunity. IL-33
      signals via the receptor ST2, which is highly expressed on group 2 innate
      lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thus underpinning its
      association with helminth infection and allergic pathology. Recent studies have
      revealed ST2 expression on subsets of regulatory T cells, and for a role for
      IL-33 in tissue homeostasis and repair that suggests previously unrecognized
      interactions within these cellular networks. IL-33 can participate in pathologic 
      fibrotic reactions, or, in the setting of microbial invasion, can cooperate with 
      inflammatory cytokines to promote responses by cytotoxic NK cells, Th1 cells, and
      CD8(+) T cells. Here, we highlight the regulation and function of IL-33 and ST2
      and review their roles in homeostasis, damage, and inflammation, suggesting a
      conceptual framework for future studies.

AB  - Members of the extended interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine family, such as IL-1,
      IL-18, IL-33, and IL-36, play a pivotal role in the initiation and amplification 
      of immune responses. However, deregulated production and/or activation of these
      cytokines can lead to the development of multiple inflammatory disorders. IL-1
      family members share a broadly similar domain organization and receptor signaling
      pathways. Another striking similarity between IL-1 family members is the
      requirement for proteolytic processing in order to unlock their full biological
      potential. Although much emphasis has been put on the role of caspase-1, another 
      emerging theme is the involvement of neutrophil- and mast cell-derived proteases 
      in IL-1 family cytokine processing. Elucidating the regulation of IL-1 family
      members by proteolytic processing is of great interest for understanding
      inflammation and immunity. Here, we review the identity of the proteases involved
      in the proteolytic processing of IL-1 family cytokines and the therapeutic
      implications in inflammatory disease.

AB  - Autoimmunity is often familial, suggesting that inborn genetic variations might
      underlie its development. Curiously, autoimmunity has long been thought to be
      typically polygenic. Contrary to this prediction and consistent with growing
      discoveries of monogenic autoimmunity, Oftedal et al. discovered heterozygous
      dominant-negative AIRE mutations in patients with certain forms of autoimmunity.

AB  - Increased activity of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells plays a major pathogenic
      role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the mechanisms that cause
      aberrant Tfh cell responses in SLE remain elusive. Here we showed the OX40 ligand
      (OX40L)-OX40 axis contributes to the aberrant Tfh response in SLE. OX40L was
      expressed by myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APCs), but not B cells, in blood
      and in inflamed tissues in adult and pediatric SLE patients. The frequency of
      circulating OX40L-expressing myeloid APCs positively correlated with disease
      activity and the frequency of ICOS(+) blood Tfh cells in SLE. OX40 signals
      promoted naive and memory CD4(+) T cells to express multiple Tfh cell molecules
      and were sufficient to induce them to become functional B cell helpers. Immune
      complexes containing RNA induced OX40L expression on myeloid APCs via TLR7
      activation. Our study provides a rationale to target the OX40L-OX40 axis as a
      therapeutic modality for SLE.

AB  - Tissue effector cells of the monocyte lineage can differentiate into different
      cell types with specific cell function depending on their environment. The
      phenotype, developmental requirements, and functional mechanisms of immune
      protective macrophages that mediate the induction of transplantation tolerance
      remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that costimulatory blockade favored
      accumulation of DC-SIGN-expressing macrophages that inhibited CD8(+) T cell
      immunity and promoted CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cell expansion in numbers.
      Mechanistically, that simultaneous DC-SIGN engagement by fucosylated ligands and 
      TLR4 signaling was required for production of immunoregulatory IL-10 associated
      with prolonged allograft survival. Deletion of DC-SIGN-expressing macrophages in 
      vivo, interfering with their CSF1-dependent development, or preventing the
      DC-SIGN signaling pathway abrogated tolerance. Together, the results provide new 
      insights into the tolerogenic effects of costimulatory blockade and identify
      DC-SIGN(+) suppressive macrophages as crucial mediators of immunological
      tolerance with the concomitant therapeutic implications in the clinic.

AB  - Tissue-infiltrating Ly6C(hi) monocytes play diverse roles in immunity, ranging
      from pathogen killing to immune regulation. How and where this diversity of
      function is imposed remains poorly understood. Here we show that during acute
      gastrointestinal infection, priming of monocytes for regulatory function preceded
      systemic inflammation and was initiated prior to bone marrow egress. Notably,
      natural killer (NK) cell-derived IFN-gamma promoted a regulatory program in
      monocyte progenitors during development. Early bone marrow NK cell activation was
      controlled by systemic interleukin-12 (IL-12) produced by Batf3-dependent
      dendritic cells (DCs) in the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). This work
      challenges the paradigm that monocyte function is dominantly imposed by local
      signals after tissue recruitment, and instead proposes a sequential model of
      differentiation in which monocytes are pre-emptively educated during development 
      in the bone marrow to promote their tissue-specific function.

TI  - Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor c-Met Instructs T Cell Cardiotropism and
      Promotes T Cell Migration to the Heart via Autocrine Chemokine Release.

AB  - Effector-T-cell-mediated immunity depends on the efficient localization of
      antigen-primed lymphocytes to antigen-rich non-lymphoid tissue, which is
      facilitated by the expression of a unique set of "homing" receptors acquired by
      memory T cells. We report that engagement of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
      receptor c-Met by heart-produced HGF during priming in the lymph nodes instructs 
      T cell cardiotropism, which was associated with a specialized homing "signature" 
      (c-Met(+)CCR4(+)CXCR3(+)). c-Met signals facilitated T cell recruitment to the
      heart via the chemokine receptor CCR5 by inducing autocrine CCR5 ligand release. 
      c-Met triggering was sufficient to support cardiotropic T cell recirculation,
      while CCR4 and CXCR3 sustained recruitment during heart inflammation. Transient
      pharmacological blockade of c-Met during T cell priming led to enhanced survival 
      of heart, but not skin, allografts associated with impaired localization of
      alloreactive T cells to heart grafts. These findings suggest c-Met as a target
      for development of organ-selective immunosuppressive therapies.

AB  - Thymic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells and medullary
      thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) use distinct strategies of self-antigen
      expression and presentation to mediate central tolerance. The thymus also harbors
      B cells; whether they also display unique tolerogenic features and how they
      genealogically relate to peripheral B cells is unclear. Here, we found that Aire 
      is expressed in thymic but not peripheral B cells. Aire expression in thymic B
      cells coincided with major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) and CD80
      upregulation and immunoglobulin class-switching. These features were
      recapitulated upon immigration of naive peripheral B cells into the thymus,
      whereby this intrathymic licensing required CD40 signaling in the context of
      cognate interactions with autoreactive CD4(+) thymocytes. Moreover, a
      licensing-dependent neo-antigen selectively upregulated in immigrating B cells
      mediated negative selection through direct presentation. Thus, autoreactivity
      within the nascent T cell repertoire fuels a feed forward loop that endows thymic
      B cells with tolerogenic features.

TI  - Leukotriene B4-Neutrophil Elastase Axis Drives Neutrophil Reverse
      Transendothelial Cell Migration In Vivo.

AB  - Breaching endothelial cells (ECs) is a decisive step in the migration of
      leukocytes from the vascular lumen to the extravascular tissue, but fundamental
      aspects of this response remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that
      neutrophils can exhibit abluminal-to-luminal migration through EC junctions
      within mouse cremasteric venules and that this response is elicited following
      reduced expression and/or functionality of the EC junctional adhesion molecule-C 
      (JAM-C). Here we demonstrate that the lipid chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4)
      was efficacious at causing loss of venular JAM-C and promoting neutrophil reverse
      transendothelial cell migration (rTEM) in vivo. Local proteolytic cleavage of EC 
      JAM-C by neutrophil elastase (NE) drove this cascade of events as supported by
      presentation of NE to JAM-C via the neutrophil adhesion molecule Mac-1. The
      results identify local LTB4-NE axis as a promoter of neutrophil rTEM and provide 
      evidence that this pathway can propagate a local sterile inflammatory response to
      become systemic.

AB  - Colonization by Lactobacillus in the female genital tract is thought to be
      critical for maintaining genital health. However, little is known about how
      genital microbiota influence host immune function and modulate disease
      susceptibility. We studied a cohort of asymptomatic young South African women and
      found that the majority of participants had genital communities with low
      Lactobacillus abundance and high ecological diversity. High-diversity communities
      strongly correlated with genital pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in both
      cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Transcriptional profiling suggested
      that genital antigen-presenting cells sense gram-negative bacterial products in
      situ via Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, contributing to genital inflammation
      through activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and recruitment of
      lymphocytes by chemokine production. Our study proposes a mechanism by which
      cervicovaginal microbiota impact genital inflammation and thereby might affect a 
      woman's reproductive health, including her risk of acquiring HIV.

AB  - Defining specific cellular and molecular mechanisms in most obesity-related
      diseases remains an important challenge. Here we report a serendipitous finding
      that consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) greatly increased the occurrence of
      skin lesions in C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrated that HFD induced the accumulation
      of a specific type of CD11c(+) macrophages in skin preceding detectable lesions. 
      These cells primed skin to induce IL-1beta and IL-18 signaling, which further
      promoted the cytokines IFN-gamma- and IL-17-mediated skin inflammation.
      Mechanistically, epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) was significantly 
      upregulated in skin of obese mice, which coupled lipid droplet formation and
      NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Deficiency of E-FABP in obese mice decreased
      recruitment of CD11c(+) macrophages in skin tissues, reduced production of
      IL-1beta and IL-18, and consequently dampened activation of effector T cells.
      Furthermore, E-FABP-deficient mice are completely resistant to HFD-induced skin
      lesions. Collectively, E-FABP represents a molecular sensor triggering
      HFD-induced skin inflammation.

TI  - Clonal Deletion Prunes but Does Not Eliminate Self-Specific alphabeta CD8(+) T
      Lymphocytes.

AB  - It has long been thought that clonal deletion efficiently removes almost all
      self-specific T cells from the peripheral repertoire. We found that self-peptide 
      MHC-specific CD8(+) T cells in the blood of healthy humans were present in
      frequencies similar to those specific for non-self antigens. For the Y
      chromosome-encoded SMCY antigen, self-specific T cells exhibited only a 3-fold
      lower average frequency in males versus females and were anergic with respect to 
      peptide activation, although this inhibition could be overcome by a stronger
      stimulus. We conclude that clonal deletion prunes but does not eliminate
      self-specific T cells and suggest that to do so would create holes in the
      repertoire that pathogens could readily exploit. In support of this hypothesis,
      we detected T cells specific for all 20 amino acid variants at the p5 position of
      a hepatitis C virus epitope in a random group of blood donors.

AB  - The two major lineages of classical dendritic cells (cDCs) express and require
      either IRF8 or IRF4 transcription factors for their development and function.
      IRF8-dependent cDCs promote anti-viral and T-helper 1 (Th1) cell responses,
      whereas IRF4-expressing cDCs have been implicated in controlling both Th2 and
      Th17 cell responses. Here, we have provided evidence that Kruppel-like factor 4
      (Klf4) is required in IRF4-expressing cDCs to promote Th2, but not Th17, cell
      responses in vivo. Conditional Klf4 deletion within cDCs impaired Th2 cell
      responses during Schistosoma mansoni infection, Schistosoma egg antigen (SEA)
      immunization, and house dust mite (HDM) challenge without affecting cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL), Th1 cell, or Th17 cell responses to herpes simplex virus,
      Toxoplasma gondii, and Citrobacter rodentium infections. Further, Klf4 deletion
      reduced IRF4 expression in pre-cDCs and resulted in selective loss of
      IRF4-expressing cDCs subsets in several tissues. These results indicate that Klf4
      guides a transcriptional program promoting IRF4-expressing cDCs heterogeneity.

AB  - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-27 signal through a shared receptor subunit and
      employ the same downstream STAT transcription proteins, but yet are ascribed
      unique and overlapping functions. To evaluate the specificity and redundancy for 
      these cytokines, we quantified their global transcriptomic changes and determined
      the relative contributions of STAT1 and STAT3 using genetic models and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) approaches. We found an extensive
      overlap of the transcriptomes induced by IL-6 and IL-27 and few examples in which
      the cytokines acted in opposition. Using STAT-deficient cells and T cells from
      patients with gain-of-function STAT1 mutations, we demonstrated that STAT3 is
      responsible for the overall transcriptional output driven by both cytokines,
      whereas STAT1 is the principal driver of specificity. STAT1 cannot compensate in 
      the absence of STAT3 and, in fact, much of STAT1 binding to chromatin is STAT3
      dependent. Thus, STAT1 shapes the specific cytokine signature superimposed upon
      STAT3's action.

AB  - Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) use polarized secretion to rapidly destroy virally
      infected and tumor cells. To understand the temporal relationships between key
      events leading to secretion, we used high-resolution 4D imaging. CTLs approached 
      targets with actin-rich projections at the leading edge, creating an initially
      actin-enriched contact with rearward-flowing actin. Within 1 min, cortical actin 
      reduced across the synapse, T cell receptors (TCRs) clustered centrally to form
      the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), and centrosome
      polarization began. Granules clustered around the moving centrosome within 2.5
      min and reached the synapse after 6 min. TCR-bearing intracellular vesicles were 
      delivered to the cSMAC as the centrosome docked. We found that the centrosome and
      granules were delivered to an area of membrane with reduced cortical actin
      density and phospholipid PIP2. These data resolve the temporal order of events
      during synapse maturation in 4D and reveal a critical role for actin depletion in
      regulating secretion.

AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) regulates lymphocyte function by signaling through
      heterodimerization of the IL-2Rbeta and gammac receptor subunits. IL-2 is of
      considerable therapeutic interest, but harnessing its actions in a controllable
      manner remains a challenge. Previously, we have engineered an IL-2 "superkine"
      with enhanced affinity for IL-2Rbeta. Here, we describe next-generation IL-2
      variants that function as "receptor signaling clamps." They retained high
      affinity for IL-2Rbeta, inhibiting binding of endogenous IL-2, but their
      interaction with gammac was weakened, attenuating IL-2Rbeta-gammac
      heterodimerization. These IL-2 analogs acted as partial agonists and
      differentially affected lymphocytes poised at distinct activation thresholds.
      Moreover, one variant, H9-RETR, antagonized IL-2 and IL-15 better than blocking
      antibodies against IL-2Ralpha or IL-2Rbeta. Furthermore, this mutein prolonged
      survival in a model of graft-versus-host disease and blocked spontaneous
      proliferation of smoldering adult T cell leukemia (ATL) T cells. This
      receptor-clamping approach might be a general mechanism-based strategy for
      engineering cytokine partial agonists for therapeutic immunomodulation.

AB  - Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates immune cell
      homeostasis and has been used to treat a range of disorders including cancer and 
      autoimmune disease. IL-2 signals via interleukin-2 receptor-beta
      (IL-2Rbeta):IL-2Rgamma heterodimers on cells expressing high (regulatory T cells,
      Treg) or low (effector cells) amounts of IL-2Ralpha (CD25). When complexed with
      IL-2, certain anti-cytokine antibodies preferentially stimulate expansion of Treg
      (JES6-1) or effector (S4B6) cells, offering a strategy for targeted disease
      therapy. We found that JES6-1 sterically blocked the IL-2:IL-2Rbeta and
      IL-2:IL-2Rgamma interactions, but also allosterically lowered the IL-2:IL-2Ralpha
      affinity through a "triggered exchange" mechanism favoring IL-2Ralpha(hi) Treg
      cells, creating a positive feedback loop for IL-2Ralpha(hi) cell activation.
      Conversely, S4B6 sterically blocked the IL-2:IL-2Ralpha interaction, while also
      conformationally stabilizing the IL-2:IL-2Rbeta interaction, thus stimulating all
      IL-2-responsive immune cells, particularly IL-2Rbeta(hi) effector cells. These
      insights provide a molecular blueprint for engineering selectively potentiating
      therapeutic antibodies.

AB  - The mammalian virome includes diverse commensal and pathogenic viruses that evoke
      a broad range of immune responses from the host. Sustained viral immunomodulation
      is implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases, but also confers unexpected 
      benefits to the host. These outcomes of viral infections are often dependent on
      host genotype. Moreover, it is becoming clear that the virome is part of a
      dynamic network of microorganisms that inhabit the body. Therefore, viruses can
      be viewed as a component of the microbiome, and interactions with commensal
      bacteria and other microbial agents influence their behavior. This piece is a
      review of our current understanding of how the virome, together with other
      components of the microbiome, affects the function of the host immune system to
      regulate health and disease.

AB  - Dynamic gene expression during cellular differentiation is tightly coordinated by
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. An emerging theme is the
      central role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of this
      specificity. Recent advances demonstrate that lncRNAs are expressed in a
      lineage-specific manner and control the development of several cell types in the 
      hematopoietic system. Moreover, specific lncRNAs are induced to modulate innate
      and adaptive immune responses. lncRNAs can function via RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and
      RNA-protein target interactions. As a result, they affect several stages of gene 
      regulation, including chromatin modification, mRNA biogenesis, and protein
      signaling. We discuss recent advances, future prospects, and challenges in
      understanding the roles of lncRNAs in immunity and immune-mediated diseases.

TI  - The Autoimmunity-Associated Gene CLEC16A Modulates Thymic Epithelial Cell
      Autophagy and Alters T Cell Selection.

AB  - CLEC16A variation has been associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases,
      including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
      celiac disease, Crohn's disease, Addison's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and alopecia areata. Despite
      strong genetic evidence implicating CLEC16A in autoimmunity, this gene's broad
      association with disease remains unexplained. We generated Clec16a knock-down
      (KD) mice in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) model for type 1 diabetes and found that
      Clec16a silencing protected against autoimmunity. Disease protection was
      attributable to T cell hyporeactivity, which was secondary to changes in thymic
      epithelial cell (TEC) stimuli that drive thymocyte selection. Our data indicate
      that T cell selection and reactivity were impacted by Clec16a variation in thymic
      epithelium owing to Clec16a's role in TEC autophagy. These findings provide a
      functional link between human CLEC16A variation and the immune dysregulation that
      underlies the risk of autoimmunity.

TI  - Integrin alphavbeta8-Mediated TGF-beta Activation by Effector Regulatory T Cells 
      Is Essential for Suppression of T-Cell-Mediated Inflammation.

LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.04.012 [doi]

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a pivotal role in suppressing self-harmful T cell 
      responses, but how Treg cells mediate suppression to maintain immune homeostasis 
      and limit responses during inflammation is unclear. Here we show that effector
      Treg cells express high amounts of the integrin alphavbeta8, which enables them
      to activate latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Treg-cell-specific
      deletion of integrin alphavbeta8 did not result in a spontaneous inflammatory
      phenotype, suggesting that this pathway is not important in Treg-cell-mediated
      maintenance of immune homeostasis. However, Treg cells lacking expression of
      integrin alphavbeta8 were unable to suppress pathogenic T cell responses during
      active inflammation. Thus, our results identify a mechanism by which Treg cells
      suppress exuberant immune responses, highlighting a key role for effector
      Treg-cell-mediated activation of latent TGF-beta in suppression of self-harmful T
      cell responses during active inflammation.

TI  - FAS Inactivation Releases Unconventional Germinal Center B Cells that Escape
      Antigen Control and Drive IgE and Autoantibody Production.

AB  - The mechanistic links between genetic variation and autoantibody production in
      autoimmune disease remain obscure. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)
      is caused by inactivating mutations in FAS or FASL, with autoantibodies thought
      to arise through failure of FAS-mediated removal of self-reactive germinal center
      (GC) B cells. Here we show that FAS is in fact not required for this process.
      Instead, FAS inactivation led to accumulation of a population of unconventional
      GC B cells that underwent somatic hypermutation, survived despite losing antigen 
      reactivity, and differentiated into a large population of plasma cells that
      included autoantibody-secreting clones. IgE(+) plasma cell numbers, in
      particular, increased after FAS inactivation and a major cohort of ALPS-affected 
      patients were found to have hyper-IgE. We propose that these previously
      unidentified cells, designated "rogue GC B cells," are a major driver of
      autoantibody production and provide a mechanistic explanation for the linked
      production of IgE and autoantibodies in autoimmune disease.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms regulating antigen translocation into the cytosol for
      cross-presentation are under controversial debate, mainly because direct data is 
      lacking. Here, we have provided direct evidence that the activity of the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon protein Sec61 is essential for
      endosome-to-cytosol translocation. We generated a Sec61-specific intrabody, a
      crucial tool that trapped Sec61 in the ER and prevented its recruitment into
      endosomes without influencing Sec61 activity and antigen presentation in the ER. 
      Expression of this ER intrabody inhibited antigen translocation and
      cross-presentation, demonstrating that endosomal Sec61 indeed mediates antigen
      transport across endosomal membranes. Moreover, we showed that the recruitment of
      Sec61 toward endosomes, and hence antigen translocation and cross-presentation,
      is dependent on dendritic cell activation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.
      These data shed light on a long-lasting question regarding antigen
      cross-presentation and point out a role of the ER-associated degradation
      machinery in compartments distinct from the ER.

TI  - Structure of the Complex of F-Actin and DNGR-1, a C-Type Lectin Receptor Involved
      in Dendritic Cell Cross-Presentation of Dead Cell-Associated Antigens.
PG  - 839-849
LID - 10.1016/j.immuni.2015.04.009 [doi]
AB  - DNGR-1 is a C-type lectin receptor that binds F-actin exposed by dying cells and 
      facilitates cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by dendritic
      cells. Here we present the structure of DNGR-1 bound to F-actin at 7.7 A
      resolution. Unusually for F-actin binding proteins, the DNGR-1 ligand binding
      domain contacts three actin subunits helically arranged in the actin filament,
      bridging over two protofilaments, as well as two neighboring actin subunits along
      one protofilament. Mutation of residues predicted to mediate ligand binding led
      to loss of DNGR-1-dependent cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens, 
      formally demonstrating that the latter depends on F-actin recognition. Notably,
      DNGR-1 has relatively modest affinity for F-actin but multivalent interactions
      allow a marked increase in binding strength. Our findings shed light on modes of 
      actin binding by cellular proteins and reveal how extracellular detection of
      cytoskeletal components by dedicated receptors allows immune monitoring of loss
      of cellular integrity.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization is universal in atopic dermatitis and
      common in cancer patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor
      inhibitors. However, the causal relationship of dysbiosis and eczema has yet to
      be clarified. Herein, we demonstrate that Adam17(fl/fl)Sox9-(Cre) mice, generated
      to model ADAM17-deficiency in human, developed eczematous dermatitis with
      naturally occurring dysbiosis, similar to that observed in atopic dermatitis.
      Corynebacterium mastitidis, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis sequentially
      emerged during the onset of eczematous dermatitis, and antibiotics specific for
      these bacterial species almost completely reversed dysbiosis and eliminated skin 
      inflammation. Whereas S. aureus prominently drove eczema formation, C. bovis
      induced robust T helper 2 cell responses. Langerhans cells were required for
      eliciting immune responses against S. aureus inoculation. These results
      characterize differential contributions of dysbiotic flora during eczema
      formation, and highlight the microbiota-host immunity axis as a possible target
      for future therapeutics in eczematous dermatitis.

AB  - Microbiota-mediated effects on the host immune response facilitate colonization
      resistance against pathogens. However, it is unclear whether and how the host
      immune response can regulate the microbiota to mediate colonization resistance.
      ID2, an essential transcriptional regulator for the development of innate
      lymphoid cell (ILC) progenitors, remains highly expressed in differentiated ILCs 
      with unknown function. Using conditionally deficient mice in which ID2 is deleted
      from differentiated ILC3s, we observed that these mutant mice exhibited greatly
      impaired gut colonization resistance against Citrobacter rodentium. Utilizing
      gnotobiotic hosts, we showed that the ID2-dependent early colonization resistance
      was mediated by interleukin-22 (IL-22) regulation of the microbiota. In addition 
      to regulating development, ID2 maintained homeostasis of ILC3s and controlled
      IL-22 production through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and IL-23 receptor
      pathway. Thus, ILC3s can mediate immune surveillance, which constantly maintains 
      a proper microbiota, to facilitate early colonization resistance through an
      ID2-dependent regulation of IL-22.

AB  - Within secondary lymphoid tissues, stromal reticular cells support lymphocyte
      function, and targeting reticular cells is a potential strategy for controlling
      pathogenic lymphocytes in disease. However, the mechanisms that regulate
      reticular cell function are not well understood. Here we found that during an
      immune response in lymph nodes, dendritic cells (DCs) maintain reticular cell
      survival in multiple compartments. DC-derived lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR)
      ligands were critical mediators, and LTbetaR signaling on reticular cells
      mediated cell survival by modulating podoplanin (PDPN). PDPN modulated
      integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which maintained cell survival. This DC-stromal 
      axis maintained lymphocyte survival and the ongoing immune response. Our findings
      provide insight into the functions of DCs, LTbetaR, and PDPN and delineate a
      DC-stromal axis that can potentially be targeted in autoimmune or
      lymphoproliferative diseases.

AB  - Mutations in MECP2, encoding the epigenetic regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 
      2, are the predominant cause of Rett syndrome, a disease characterized by both
      neurological symptoms and systemic abnormalities. Microglial dysfunction is
      thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis, and here we found microglia become
      activated and subsequently lost with disease progression in Mecp2-null mice.
      Mecp2 was found to be expressed in peripheral macrophage and monocyte
      populations, several of which also became depleted in Mecp2-null mice. RNA-seq
      revealed increased expression of glucocorticoid- and hypoxia-induced transcripts 
      in Mecp2-deficient microglia and peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, Mecp2 was
      found to regulate inflammatory gene transcription in response to TNF stimulation.
      Postnatal re-expression of Mecp2 using Cx3cr1(creER) increased the lifespan of
      otherwise Mecp2-null mice. These data suggest that Mecp2 regulates microglia and 
      macrophage responsiveness to environmental stimuli to promote homeostasis.
      Dysfunction of tissue-resident macrophages might contribute to the systemic
      pathologies observed in Rett syndrome.

AB  - Although classified as hematopoietic cells, tissue-resident macrophages (MFs)
      arise from embryonic precursors that seed the tissues prior to birth to generate 
      a self-renewing population, which is maintained independently of adult
      hematopoiesis. Here we reveal the identity of these embryonic precursors using an
      in utero MF-depletion strategy and fate-mapping of yolk sac (YS) and fetal liver 
      (FL) hematopoiesis. We show that YS MFs are the main precursors of microglia,
      while most other MFs derive from fetal monocytes (MOs). Both YS MFs and fetal MOs
      arise from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) generated in the YS. In the YS,
      EMPs gave rise to MFs without monocytic intermediates, while EMP seeding the FL
      upon the establishment of blood circulation acquired c-Myb expression and gave
      rise to fetal MOs that then seeded embryonic tissues and differentiated into MFs.
      Thus, adult tissue-resident MFs established from hematopoietic stem
      cell-independent embryonic precursors arise from two distinct developmental
      programs.

AB  - Regulatory B (Breg) cells are immunosuppressive cells that support immunological 
      tolerance. Through the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-35, and
      transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), Breg cells suppress immunopathology
      by prohibiting the expansion of pathogenic T cells and other pro-inflammatory
      lymphocytes. Recent work has shown that different inflammatory environments
      induce distinct Breg cell populations. Although these findings highlight the
      relevance of inflammatory signals in the differentiation of Breg cells, they also
      raise other questions about Breg cell biology and phenotype. For example, what
      are the functional properties and phenotype of Breg cells? Can a Breg cell arise 
      at every stage in B cell development? Is inflammation the primary requisite for
      Breg cell differentiation? Here, we use these questions to discuss the advances
      in understanding Breg cell biology, with a particular emphasis on their ontogeny;
      we propose that multiple Breg cell subsets can be induced in response to
      inflammation at different stages in development.

AB  - The organism needs to tailor the intestinal inflammatory response to pathogenic
      bacteria and to pathobionts that are only occasionally pathogenic. In this issue 
      of Immunity, Seo et al. (2015) show that the pathobiont Proteus mirabilis induces
      NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) release from CCR2(+)
      Ly6C(high) inflammatory monocytes.

AB  - NLRP12 is an innate immune receptor whose regulation of NF-kappaB signaling in
      myeloid cells is critical in preventing multiple auto-inflammatory diseases. In
      this issue of Immunity, Lukens et al. (2015) show that a similar NLRP12-mediated 
      mechanism is functionally important in T cells.

AB  - It has been unclear whether alteration in DNA methylation at cytokine genes
      during T helper (Th) cell differentiation is a cause or consequence of gene
      expression. In this issue of Immunity, Ichiyama et al. (2015) show that oxidation
      of 5-methylcytosine by the methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet2 regulates cytokine
      production in Th cells.

AB  - Radiotherapy induces DNA damage and cell death, but recent data suggest that
      concomitant immune stimulation is an integral part of the therapeutic action of
      ionizing radiation. It is poorly understood how radiotherapy supports
      tumor-specific immunity. Here we report that radiotherapy induced tumor cell
      death and transiently activated complement both in murine and human tumors. The
      local production of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a was crucial to
      the tumor response to radiotherapy and concomitant stimulation of tumor-specific 
      immunity. Dexamethasone, a drug frequently given during radiotherapy, limited
      complement activation and the anti-tumor effects of the immune system. Overall,
      our findings indicate that anaphylatoxins are key players in radiotherapy-induced
      tumor-specific immunity and the ensuing clinical responses.

AB  - The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of cytokines has emerged as a critical player
      in inflammatory diseases. Among them, IL-25 has been shown to be important in
      allergic inflammation and protection against parasitic infection. Here we have
      demonstrated that IL-17B, a poorly understood cytokine, functions to inhibit
      IL-25-driven inflammation. IL-17B and IL-25, both binding to the interleukin-17
      receptor B (IL-17RB), were upregulated in their expression after acute colonic
      inflammation. Individual inhibition of these cytokines revealed opposing
      functions in colon inflammation: IL-25 was pathogenic but IL-17B was protective. 
      Similarly opposing phenotypes were observed in Citrobacter rodentium infection
      and allergic asthma. Moreover, IL-25 was found to promote IL-6 production from
      colon epithelial cells, which was inhibited by IL-17B. Therefore, our data
      demonstrate that IL-17B is an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the IL-17 family.

AB  - Missense mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
      receptor pyrin domain containing family of gene 12 (Nlrp12) are associated with
      periodic fever syndromes and atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we have
      demonstrated a crucial role for NLRP12 in negatively regulating pathogenic T cell
      responses. Nlrp12(-/-) mice responded to antigen immunization with
      hyperinflammatory T cell responses. Furthermore, transfer of
      CD4(+)CD45RB(hi)Nlrp12(-/-) T cells into immunodeficient mice led to more severe 
      colitis and atopic dermatitis. NLRP12 deficiency did not, however, cause
      exacerbated ascending paralysis during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
      (EAE); instead, Nlrp12(-/-) mice developed atypical neuroinflammatory symptoms
      that were characterized by ataxia and loss of balance. Enhanced T-cell-mediated
      interleukin-4 (IL-4) production promotes the development of atypical EAE disease 
      in Nlrp12(-/-) mice. These results define an unexpected role for NLRP12 as an
      intrinsic negative regulator of T-cell-mediated immunity and identify altered
      NF-kappaB regulation and IL-4 production as key mediators of NLRP12-associated
      disease.

AB  - The microbiota stimulates inflammation, but the signaling pathways and the
      members of the microbiota involved remain poorly understood. We found that the
      microbiota induces interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) release upon intestinal injury
      and that this is mediated via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Enterobacteriaceae and in
      particular the pathobiont Proteus mirabilis, induced robust IL-1beta release that
      was comparable to that induced by the pathogen Salmonella. Upon epithelial
      injury, production of IL-1beta in the intestine was largely mediated by
      intestinal Ly6C(high) monocytes, required chemokine receptor CCR2 and was
      abolished by deletion of IL-1beta in CCR2(+) blood monocytes. Furthermore,
      colonization with P. mirabilis promoted intestinal inflammation upon intestinal
      injury via the production of hemolysin, which required NLRP3 and IL-1 receptor
      signaling in vivo. Thus, upon intestinal injury, selective members of the
      microbiota stimulate newly recruited monocytes to induce NLRP3-dependent IL-1beta
      release, which promotes inflammation in the intestine.

AB  - Epigenetic regulation of lineage-specific genes is important for the
      differentiation and function of T cells. Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins 
      catalyze 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) to
      mediate DNA demethylation. However, the roles of Tet proteins in the immune
      response are unknown. Here, we characterized the genome-wide distribution of 5
      hmC in CD4(+) T cells and found that 5 hmC marks putative regulatory elements in 
      signature genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Moreover, Tet2
      protein was recruited to 5 hmC-containing regions, dependent on lineage-specific 
      transcription factors. Deletion of Tet2 in T cells decreased their cytokine
      expression, associated with reduced p300 recruitment. In vivo, Tet2 plays a
      critical role in the control of cytokine gene expression in autoimmune disease.
      Collectively, our findings suggest that Tet2 promotes DNA demethylation and
      activation of cytokine gene expression in T cells.

AB  - Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a serious health issue with little improvement in
      our understanding of the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches. We
      investigated the mechanism that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces early neutrophil
      recruitment to lungs and increases pulmonary vascular permeability during ALI.
      Intratracheal LPS induced release of pro-interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) from
      necrotic alveolar macrophages (AM), which activated endothelial cells (EC) to
      induce vascular leakage via loss of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. LPS
      triggered the AM purinergic receptor P2X7(R) to induce Ca(2+) influx and ATP
      depletion, which led to necrosis. P2X7R deficiency significantly reduced necrotic
      death of AM and release of pro-IL-1alpha into the lung. CD14 was required for LPS
      binding to P2X7R, as CD14 neutralization significantly diminished LPS induced
      necrotic death of AM and pro-IL-1alpha release. These results demonstrate a key
      role for pro-IL-1alpha from necrotic alveolar macrophages in LPS-mediated ALI, as
      a critical initiator of increased vascular permeability and early neutrophil
      infiltration.

AB  - Migratory non-lymphoid tissue dendritic cells (NLT-DCs) transport antigens to
      lymph nodes (LNs) and are required for protective immune responses in the context
      of inflammation and to promote tolerance to self-antigens in steady-state.
      However, the molecular mechanisms that elicit steady-state NLT-DC maturation and 
      migration are unknown. By comparing the transcriptome of NLT-DCs in the skin with
      their migratory counterparts in draining LNs, we have identified a novel
      NF-kappaB-regulated gene network specific to migratory DCs. We show that targeted
      deletion of IKKbeta in DCs, a major activator of NF-kappaB, prevents NLT-DC
      accumulation in LNs and compromises regulatory T cell conversion in vivo. This
      was associated with impaired tolerance and autoimmunity. NF-kappaB is generally
      considered the prototypical pro-inflammatory transcription factor, but this study
      describes a role for NF-kappaB signaling in DCs for immune homeostasis and
      tolerance that could have implications in autoimmune diseases and immunity.

AB  - B helper follicular T (Tfh) cells are critical for long-term humoral immunity.
      However, it remains unclear how these cells are recruited and contribute to
      secondary immune responses. Here we show that primary Tfh cells segregate into
      follicular mantle (FM) and germinal center (GC) subpopulations that display
      distinct gene expression signatures. Restriction of the primary Tfh cell
      subpopulation in the GC was mediated by downregulation of chemotactic receptor
      EBI2. Following collapse of the GC, memory T cells persisted in the outer
      follicle where they scanned CD169(+) subcapsular sinus macrophages. Reactivation 
      and intrafollicular expansion of these follicular memory T cells in the
      subcapsular region was followed by their extrafollicular dissemination via the
      lymphatic flow. These data suggest that Tfh cells integrate their
      antigen-experience history to focus T cell help within the GC during primary
      responses but act rapidly to provide systemic T cell help after re-exposure to
      the antigen.

AB  - Antibodies play major roles in immunity to malaria; however, a limited
      understanding of mechanisms mediating protection is a major barrier to vaccine
      development. We have demonstrated that acquired human anti-malarial antibodies
      promote complement deposition on the merozoite to mediate inhibition of
      erythrocyte invasion through C1q fixation and activation of the classical
      complement pathway. Antibody-mediated complement-dependent (Ab-C') inhibition was
      the predominant invasion-inhibitory activity of human antibodies; most antibodies
      were non-inhibitory without complement. Inhibitory activity was mediated
      predominately via C1q fixation, and merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were
      identified as major targets. Complement fixation by antibodies was very strongly 
      associated with protection from both clinical malaria and high-density
      parasitemia in a prospective longitudinal study of children. Ab-C' inhibitory
      activity could be induced by human immunization with a candidate merozoite
      surface-protein vaccine. Our findings demonstrate that human anti-malarial
      antibodies have evolved to function by fixing complement for potent
      invasion-inhibitory activity and protective immunity.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease and is presumed to be central to the altered responsiveness to recurrent 
      infection in these patients. We examined the effects of smoke priming underlying 
      the exacerbated response to viral infection in mice. Lack of interleukin-33
      (IL-33) signaling conferred complete protection during exacerbation and prevented
      enhanced inflammation and exaggerated weight loss. Mechanistically, smoke was
      required to upregulate epithelial-derived IL-33 and simultaneously alter the
      distribution of the IL-33 receptor ST2. Specifically, smoke decreased ST2
      expression on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) while elevating ST2
      expression on macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, thus altering IL-33
      responsiveness within the lung. Consequently, upon infection and release,
      increased local IL-33 significantly amplified type I proinflammatory responses
      via synergistic modulation of macrophage and NK cell function. Therefore, in
      COPD, smoke alters the lung microenvironment to facilitate an alternative
      IL-33-dependent exaggerated proinflammatory response to infection, exacerbating
      disease.

AB  - The inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) is a potent promoter of organ
      inflammation in murine lupus. ICOS stimulates T follicular helper cell
      differentiation in lymphoid tissue, suggesting that it might drive autoimmunity
      by enhancing autoantibody production. Yet the pathogenic relevance of this
      mechanism remains unclear. It is also unknown whether other ICOS-induced
      processes might contribute to lupus pathology. Here we show that selective
      ablation of ICOS ligand (ICOSL) in CD11c(+) cells, but not in B cells,
      dramatically ameliorates kidney and lung inflammation in lupus-prone MRL.Fas(lpr)
      mice. Autoantibody formation was largely unaffected by ICOSL deficiency in
      CD11c(+) cells. However, ICOSL display by CD11c(+) cells in inflamed organs had a
      nonredundant role in protecting invading T cells from apoptosis by elevating
      activity of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby facilitating T cell accrual. 
      These findings reveal a mechanism that locally sustains organ inflammation in
      lupus.

AB  - Self-reactive T cells can escape thymic deletion and therefore some of these
      potentially autoaggressive T cells need to convert into regulatory T (Treg) cells
      to help control responses against self. However, it remains unknown how
      peripheral self-reactive T cells are specifically instructed to become Treg
      cells. We report that CD5, whose expression is upregulated in T cells by self and
      tolerizing antigens in the thymus and periphery, governed extrathymic Treg cell
      development. CD5 modified effector cell-differentiating signals that inhibit Treg
      cell induction. Treg cell conversion of Cd5(-/-) and CD5(lo) T cells was
      inhibited by even small amounts of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) produced by bystander lymphocytes, while CD5(hi) T
      cells resisted this inhibition of Treg cell induction. Our findings further
      revealed that CD5 promoted Treg cell induction by blocking mechanistic target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR) activation. Therefore CD5 instructs extrathymic Treg cell
      development in response to self and tolerizing antigens.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying human natural killer (NK) cell phenotypic and
      functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse 
      subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins
      after human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid
      cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated
      with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were
      strikingly similar between HCMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic
      effector T cells but differed from those of canonical NK cells. Functional
      interrogation demonstrated altered cytokine responsiveness in adaptive NK cells
      that was linked to reduced expression of the transcription factor PLZF.
      Furthermore, subsets of adaptive NK cells demonstrated significantly reduced
      functional responses to activated autologous T cells. The present results uncover
      a spectrum of epigenetically unique adaptive NK cell subsets that diversify in
      response to viral infection and have distinct functional capabilities compared to
      canonical NK cell subsets.

AB  - Long-lived "memory-like" NK cells have been identified in individuals infected by
      human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), but little is known about how the memory-like NK
      cell pool is formed. Here, we have shown that HCMV-infected individuals have
      several distinct subsets of memory-like NK cells that are often deficient for
      multiple transcription factors and signaling proteins, including tyrosine kinase 
      SYK, for which the reduced expression was stable over time and correlated with
      epigenetic modification of the gene promoter. Deficient expression of these
      proteins was largely confined to the recently discovered FcRgamma-deficient NK
      cells that display enhanced antibody-dependent functional activity. Importantly, 
      FcRgamma-deficient NK cells exhibited robust preferential expansion in response
      to virus-infected cells (both HCMV and influenza) in an antibody-dependent
      manner. These findings suggest that the memory-like NK cell pool is shaped and
      maintained by a mechanism that involves both epigenetic modification of gene
      expression and antibody-dependent expansion.

AB  - Macrophage polarization involves a coordinated metabolic and transcriptional
      rewiring that is only partially understood. By using an integrated
      high-throughput transcriptional-metabolic profiling and analysis pipeline, we
      characterized systemic changes during murine macrophage M1 and M2 polarization.
      M2 polarization was found to activate glutamine catabolism and
      UDP-GlcNAc-associated modules. Correspondingly, glutamine deprivation or
      inhibition of N-glycosylation decreased M2 polarization and production of
      chemokine CCL22. In M1 macrophages, we identified a metabolic break at Idh, the
      enzyme that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, providing mechanistic
      explanation for TCA cycle fragmentation. (13)C-tracer studies suggested the
      presence of an active variant of the aspartate-arginosuccinate shunt that
      compensated for this break. Consistently, inhibition of
      aspartate-aminotransferase, a key enzyme of the shunt, inhibited nitric oxide and
      interleukin-6 production in M1 macrophages, while promoting mitochondrial
      respiration. This systems approach provides a highly integrated picture of the
      physiological modules supporting macrophage polarization, identifying potential
      pharmacologic control points for both macrophage phenotypes.

AB  - Mitochondria are well appreciated for their role as biosynthetic and bioenergetic
      organelles. In the past two decades, mitochondria have emerged as signaling
      organelles that contribute critical decisions about cell proliferation, death,
      and differentiation. Mitochondria not only sustain immune cell phenotypes but
      also are necessary for establishing immune cell phenotype and their function.
      Mitochondria can rapidly switch from primarily being catabolic organelles
      generating ATP to anabolic organelles that generate both ATP and building blocks 
      for macromolecule synthesis. This enables them to fulfill appropriate metabolic
      demands of different immune cells. Mitochondria have multiple mechanisms that
      allow them to activate signaling pathways in the cytosol including altering in
      AMP/ATP ratio, the release of ROS and TCA cycle metabolites, as well as the
      localization of immune regulatory proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane.
      In this Review, we discuss the evidence and mechanisms that mitochondrial
      dependent signaling controls innate and adaptive immune responses.

AB  - Allergic asthma is caused by Th2-cell-type cytokines in response to allergen
      exposure. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a newly identified subset of
      immune cells that, along with Th2 cells, contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma
      by producing copious amounts of IL-5 and IL-13, which cause eosinophilia and
      airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. ILC2s express ICOS, a
      T cell costimulatory molecule with a currently unknown function. Here we showed
      that a lack of ICOS on murine ILC2s and blocking the ICOS:ICOS-ligand interaction
      in human ILC2s reduced AHR and lung inflammation. ILC2s expressed both ICOS and
      ICOS-ligand, and the ICOS:ICOS-ligand interaction promoted cytokine production
      and survival in ILC2s through STAT5 signaling. Thus, ICOS:ICOS-ligand signaling
      pathway is critically involved in ILC2 function and homeostasis.

AB  - CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in limiting peripheral virus replication, yet
      how they locate virus-infected cells within tissues is unknown. Here, we have
      examined the environmental signals that CD8(+) T cells use to localize and
      eliminate virus-infected skin cells. Epicutaneous vaccinia virus (VV) infection, 
      mimicking human smallpox vaccination, greatly increased expression of the CXCR3
      chemokine receptor ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 in VV-infected skin. Despite normal T
      cell numbers in the skin, Cxcr3(-/-) mice exhibited dramatically impaired
      CD8(+)-T-cell-dependent virus clearance. Intravital microscopy revealed that
      Cxcr3(-/-) T cells were markedly deficient in locating, engaging, and killing
      virus-infected cells. Further, transfer of wild-type CD8(+) T cells restored
      viral clearance in Cxcr3(-/-) animals. These findings demonstrate a function for 
      CXCR3 in enhancing the ability of tissue-localized CD8(+) T cells to locate
      virus-infected cells and thereby exert anti-viral effector functions.

AB  - Oral immunotherapy has had limited success in establishing tolerance in food
      allergy, reflecting failure to elicit an effective regulatory T (Treg) cell
      response. We show that disease-susceptible (Il4ra(F709)) mice with enhanced
      interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) signaling exhibited STAT6-dependent impaired
      generation and function of mucosal allergen-specific Treg cells. This failure was
      associated with the acquisition by Treg cells of a T helper 2 (Th2)-cell-like
      phenotype, also found in peripheral-blood allergen-specific Treg cells of
      food-allergic children. Selective augmentation of IL-4R signaling in Treg cells
      induced their reprogramming into Th2-like cells and disease susceptibility,
      whereas Treg-cell-lineage-specific deletion of Il4 and Il13 was protective. IL-4R
      signaling impaired the capacity of Treg cells to suppress mast cell activation
      and expansion, which in turn drove Th2 cell reprogramming of Treg cells.
      Interruption of Th2 cell reprogramming of Treg cells might thus provide candidate
      therapeutic strategies in food allergy.

AB  - CD4(+) T cells differentiate into phenotypically distinct T helper cells upon
      antigenic stimulation. Regulation of plasticity between these CD4(+) T-cell
      lineages is critical for immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmune disease.
      However, the factors that regulate lineage stability are largely unknown. Here we
      investigate a role for retinoic acid (RA) in the regulation of lineage stability 
      using T helper 1 (Th1) cells, traditionally considered the most phenotypically
      stable Th subset. We found that RA, through its receptor RARalpha, sustains
      stable expression of Th1 lineage specifying genes, as well as repressing genes
      that instruct Th17-cell fate. RA signaling is essential for limiting Th1-cell
      conversion into Th17 effectors and for preventing pathogenic Th17 responses in
      vivo. Our study identifies RA-RARalpha as a key component of the regulatory
      network governing maintenance and plasticity of Th1-cell fate and defines an
      additional pathway for the development of Th17 cells.

AB  - Little is known about the role of negative regulators in controlling natural
      killer (NK) cell development and effector functions. Foxo1 is a multifunctional
      transcription factor of the forkhead family. Using a mouse model of conditional
      deletion in NK cells, we found that Foxo1 negatively controlled NK cell
      differentiation and function. Immature NK cells expressed abundant Foxo1 and
      little Tbx21 relative to mature NK cells, but these two transcription factors
      reversed their expression as NK cells proceeded through development. Foxo1
      promoted NK cell homing to lymph nodes by upregulating CD62L expression and
      inhibited late-stage maturation and effector functions by repressing Tbx21
      expression. Loss of Foxo1 rescued the defect in late-stage NK cell maturation in 
      heterozygous Tbx21(+/-) mice. Collectively, our data reveal a regulatory pathway 
      by which the negative regulator Foxo1 and the positive regulator Tbx21 play
      opposing roles in controlling NK cell development and effector functions.

AB  - Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection.
      Despite studies in mice, the cellular and molecular basis of human sepsis remains
      unclear and effective therapies are lacking. Blood monocytes serve as the first
      line of host defense and are equipped to recognize and respond to infection by
      triggering an immune-inflammatory response. However, the response of these cells 
      in human sepsis and their contribution to sepsis pathogenesis is poorly
      understood. To investigate this, we performed a transcriptomic, functional, and
      mechanistic analysis of blood monocytes from patients during sepsis and after
      recovery. Our results revealed the functional plasticity of monocytes during
      human sepsis, wherein they transited from a pro-inflammatory to an
      immunosuppressive phenotype, while enhancing protective functions like
      phagocytosis, anti-microbial activity, and tissue remodeling. Mechanistically,
      hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha) mediated this functional
      re-programming of monocytes, revealing a potential mechanism for their
      therapeutic targeting to regulate human sepsis.

AB  - Dysfunction in Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a central component of the
      DNA repair machinery, results in Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), a cancer-prone
      disease with a variety of inflammatory manifestations. By analyzing AT patient
      samples and Atm(-/-) mice, we found that unrepaired DNA lesions induce type I
      interferons (IFNs), resulting in enhanced anti-viral and anti-bacterial responses
      in Atm(-/-) mice. Priming of the type I interferon system by DNA damage involved 
      release of DNA into the cytoplasm where it activated the cytosolic DNA sensing
      STING-mediated pathway, which in turn enhanced responses to innate stimuli by
      activating the expression of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors,
      cytoplasmic DNA sensors, and their downstream signaling partners. This study
      provides a potential explanation for the inflammatory phenotype of AT patients
      and establishes damaged DNA as a cell intrinsic danger signal that primes the
      innate immune system for a rapid and amplified response to microbial and
      environmental threats.

AB  - The epidermis constantly encounters invasions that disrupt its architecture, yet 
      whether the epidermal immune system utilizes damaged structures as danger signals
      to activate self-defense is unclear. Here, we used a C. elegans epidermis model
      in which skin-penetrating infection or injury activates immune defense and
      antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production. By systemically disrupting each
      architectural component, we found that only disturbance of the apical
      hemidesmosomes triggered an immune response and robust AMP expression. The
      epidermis recognized structural damage through hemidesmosomes associated with a
      STAT-like protein, whose disruption led to detachment of STA-2 molecules from
      hemidesmosomes and transcription of AMPs. This machinery enabled the epidermis to
      bypass certain signaling amplification and directly trigger AMP production when
      subjected to extensive architectural damage. Together, our findings uncover an
      evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the epithelial barriers to detect danger
      and activate immune defense.

AB  - Memory CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells provide long-term protection against pathogens 
      and are essential for the development of vaccines; however, some antigen-specific
      memory Th cells also drive immune-related pathology, including asthma. The
      mechanisms regulating the pathogenicity of memory Th cells remain poorly
      understood. We found that interleukin-33 (IL-33)-ST2 signals selectively licensed
      memory Th2 cells to induce allergic airway inflammation via production of IL-5
      and that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was a central downstream target of IL-33-ST2 
      in memory Th2 cells. In addition, we found that IL-33 induced upregulation of
      IL-5 by memory CD4(+) T cells isolated from nasal polyps of patients with
      eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus, IL-33-ST2-p38 signaling appears to
      directly instruct pathogenic memory Th2 cells to produce IL-5 and induce
      eosinophilic inflammation.

AB  - Crosslinking of the immunoglobulin receptor FcepsilonRI activates basophils and
      mast cells to induce immediate and chronic allergic inflammation. However, it
      remains unclear how the chronic allergic inflammation is regulated. Here, we
      showed that ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase-phosphodiesterase 3 (E-NPP3), also
      known as CD203c, rapidly induced by FcepsilonRI crosslinking, negatively
      regulated chronic allergic inflammation. Basophil and mast cell numbers increased
      in Enpp3(-/-) mice with augmented serum ATP concentrations. Enpp3(-/-) mice were 
      highly sensitive to chronic allergic pathologies, which was reduced by ATP
      blockade. FcepsilonRI crosslinking induced ATP secretion from basophils and mast 
      cells, and ATP activated both cells. ATP clearance was impaired in Enpp3(-/-)
      cells. Enpp3(-/-)P2rx7(-/-) mice showed decreased responses to FcepsilonRI
      crosslinking. Thus, ATP released by FcepsilonRI crosslinking stimulates basophils
      and mast cells for further activation causing allergic inflammation. E-NPP3
      decreases ATP concentration and suppresses basophil and mast cell activity.

AB  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential for efficient B cell responses, yet
      the factors that regulate differentiation of this CD4(+) T cell subset are
      incompletely understood. Here we found that the KLF2 transcription factor serves 
      to restrain Tfh cell generation. Induced KLF2 deficiency in activated CD4(+) T
      cells led to increased Tfh cell generation and B cell priming, whereas KLF2
      overexpression prevented Tfh cell production. KLF2 promotes expression of the
      trafficking receptor S1PR1, and S1PR1 downregulation is essential for efficient
      Tfh cell production. However, KLF2 also induced expression of the transcription
      factor Blimp-1, which repressed transcription factor Bcl-6 and thereby impaired
      Tfh cell differentiation. Furthermore, KLF2 induced expression of the
      transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 and enhanced Th1 differentiation. Hence,
      our data indicate KLF2 is pivotal for coordinating CD4(+) T cell differentiation 
      through two distinct and complementary mechanisms: via control of T cell
      localization and by regulation of lineage-defining transcription factors.

AB  - T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential in the induction of high-affinity, 
      class-switched antibodies. The differentiation of Tfh cells is a multi-step
      process that depends upon the co-receptor ICOS and the activation of
      phosphoinositide-3 kinase leading to the expression of key Tfh cell genes. We
      report that ICOS signaling inactivates the transcription factor FOXO1, and a
      Foxo1 genetic deletion allowed for generation of Tfh cells with reduced
      dependence on ICOS ligand. Conversely, enforced nuclear localization of FOXO1
      inhibited Tfh cell development even though ICOS was overexpressed. FOXO1
      regulated Tfh cell differentiation through a broad program of gene expression
      exemplified by its negative regulation of Bcl6. Final differentiation to germinal
      center Tfh cells (GC-Tfh) was instead FOXO1 dependent as the Foxo1(-/-) GC-Tfh
      cell population was substantially reduced. We propose that ICOS signaling
      transiently inactivates FOXO1 to initiate a Tfh cell contingency that is
      completed in a FOXO1-dependent manner.

AB  - Type 2 inflammatory responses can be elicited by diverse stimuli, including
      toxins, venoms, allergens, and infectious agents, and play critical roles in
      resistance and tolerance associated with infection, wound healing, tissue repair,
      and tumor development. Emerging data suggest that in addition to characteristic
      type 2-associated cytokines, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like molecule
      Amphiregulin (AREG) might be a critical component of type 2-mediated resistance
      and tolerance. Notably, numerous studies demonstrate that in addition to the
      established role of epithelial- and mesenchymal-derived AREG, multiple leukocyte 
      populations including mast cells, basophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells
      (ILC2s), and a subset of tissue-resident regulatory CD4(+) T cells can express
      AREG. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the
      AREG-EGF receptor pathway and its involvement in infection and inflammation and
      propose a model for the function of this pathway in the context of resistance and
      tissue tolerance.

      (2015) find that high amounts of IgG-antigen complexes formed during chronic

AB  - Understanding how viruses subvert host immunity and persist is essential for
      developing strategies to eliminate infection. T cell exhaustion during chronic
      viral infection is well described, but effects on antibody-mediated effector
      activity are unclear. Herein, we show that increased amounts of immune complexes 
      generated in mice persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
      (LCMV) suppressed multiple Fcgamma-receptor (FcgammaR) functions. The high
      amounts of immune complexes suppressed antibody-mediated cell depletion,
      therapeutic antibody-killing of LCMV infected cells and human CD20-expressing
      tumors, as well as reduced immune complex-mediated cross-presentation to T cells.
      Suppression of FcgammaR activity was not due to inhibitory FcgammaRs or high
      concentrations of free antibody, and proper FcgammaR functions were restored when
      persistently infected mice specifically lacked immune complexes. Thus, we
      identify a mechanism of immunosuppression during viral persistence with
      implications for understanding effective antibody activity aimed at pathogen
      control.

AB  - T cell dysfunction is well documented during chronic viral infections but little 
      is known about functional abnormalities in humoral immunity. Here we report that 
      mice persistently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) exhibit
      a severe defect in Fcgamma-receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated antibody effector
      functions. Using transgenic mice expressing human CD20, we found that chronic
      LCMV infection impaired the depletion of B cells with rituximab, an anti-CD20
      antibody widely used for the treatment of B cell lymphomas. In addition,
      FcgammaR-dependent activation of dendritic cells by agonistic anti-CD40 antibody 
      was compromised in chronically infected mice. These defects were due to viral
      antigen-antibody complexes and not the chronic infection per se, because
      FcgammaR-mediated effector functions were normal in persistently infected mice
      that lacked LCMV-specific antibodies. Our findings have implications for the
      therapeutic use of antibodies and suggest that high levels of pre-existing immune
      complexes could limit the effectiveness of antibody therapy in humans.

AB  - Candida albicans is a dimorphic fungus responsible for chronic mucocutaneous and 
      systemic infections. Mucocutaneous immunity to C. albicans requires T helper 17
      (Th17) cell differentiation that is thought to depend on recognition of
      filamentous C. albicans. Systemic immunity is considered T cell independent.
      Using a murine skin infection model, we compared T helper cell responses to yeast
      and filamentous C. albicans. We found that only yeast induced Th17 cell responses
      through a mechanism that required Dectin-1-mediated expression of interleukin-6
      (IL-6) by Langerhans cells. Filamentous forms induced Th1 without Th17 cell
      responses due to the absence of Dectin-1 ligation. Notably, Th17 cell responses
      provided protection against cutaneous infection while Th1 cell responses provided
      protection against systemic infection. Thus, C. albicans morphology drives
      distinct T helper cell responses that provide tissue-specific protection. These
      findings provide insight into compartmentalization of Th cell responses and C.
      albicans pathogenesis and have critical implications for vaccine strategies.

AB  - Bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, are present in the tumor
      microenvironment. However, the immunological consequences of intra-tumoral
      bacteria remain unclear. Here, we have shown that natural killer (NK) cell
      killing of various tumors is inhibited in the presence of various F. nucleatum
      strains. Our data support that this F. nucleatum-mediated inhibition is mediated 
      by human, but not by mouse TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor present on all human NK 
      cells and on various T cells. Using a library of F. nucleatum mutants, we found
      that the Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum directly interacted with TIGIT, leading to 
      the inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity. We have further demonstrated that
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed TIGIT and that T cell activities were
      also inhibited by F. nucleatum via Fap2. Our results identify a
      bacterium-dependent, tumor-immune evasion mechanism in which tumors exploit the
      Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum to inhibit immune cell activity via TIGIT.

AB  - T helper 1 (Th1) cell-associated immunity exacerbates ileitis induced by oral
      Toxoplasma gondii infection. We show here that attenuated ileitis observed in
      interleukin-22 (IL-22)-deficient mice was associated with reduced production of
      Th1-cell-promoting IL-18. IL-22 not only augmented the expression of Il18 mRNA
      and inactive precursor protein (proIL-18) in intestinal epithelial cells after T.
      gondii or Citrobacter rodentium infection, but also maintained the homeostatic
      amount of proIL-18 in the ileum. IL-22, however, did not induce the processing to
      active IL-18, suggesting a two-step regulation of IL-18 in these cells. Although 
      IL-18 exerted pathogenic functions during ileitis triggered by T. gondii, it was 
      required for host defense against C. rodentium. Conversely, IL-18 was required
      for the expression of IL-22 in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) upon T. gondii
      infection. Our results define IL-18 as an IL-22 target gene in epithelial cells
      and describe a complex mutual regulation of both cytokines during intestinal
      infection.

AB  - During persistent antigen stimulation, CD8(+) T cells show a gradual decrease in 
      effector function, referred to as exhaustion, which impairs responses in the
      setting of tumors and infections. Here we demonstrate that the transcription
      factor NFAT controls the program of T cell exhaustion. When expressed in cells,
      an engineered form of NFAT1 unable to interact with AP-1 transcription factors
      diminished T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, increased the expression of
      inhibitory cell surface receptors, and interfered with the ability of CD8(+) T
      cells to protect against Listeria infection and attenuate tumor growth in vivo.
      We defined the genomic regions occupied by endogenous and engineered NFAT1 in
      primary CD8(+) T cells and showed that genes directly induced by the engineered
      NFAT1 overlapped with genes expressed in exhausted CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Our
      data show that NFAT promotes T cell anergy and exhaustion by binding at sites
      that do not require cooperation with AP-1.

AB  - Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are required for immune homeostasis. Chromatin
      remodeling is essential for establishing diverse cellular identities, but how the
      epigenetic program in Treg cells is maintained throughout the dynamic activation 
      process remains unclear. Here we have shown that CD28 co-stimulation, an
      extracellular cue intrinsically required for Treg cell maintenance, induced the
      chromatin-modifying enzyme, Ezh2. Treg-specific ablation of Ezh2 resulted in
      spontaneous autoimmunity with reduced Foxp3(+) cells in non-lymphoid tissues and 
      impaired resolution of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Utilizing a
      model designed to selectively deplete wild-type Treg cells in adult mice
      co-populated with Ezh2-deficient Treg cells, Ezh2-deficient cells were
      destabilized and failed to prevent autoimmunity. After activation, the
      transcriptome of Ezh2-deficient Treg cells was disrupted, with altered expression
      of Treg cell lineage genes in a pattern similar to Foxp3-deficient Treg cells.
      These studies reveal a critical role for Ezh2 in the maintenance of Treg cell
      identity during cellular activation.

      construct pathogenic regulatory circuits in B-cell lymphoma.

AB  - Most B-cell lymphomas arise in the germinal center (GC), where humoral immune
      responses evolve from potentially oncogenic cycles of mutation, proliferation,
      and clonal selection. Although lymphoma gene expression diverges significantly
      from GC B cells, underlying mechanisms that alter the activities of corresponding
      regulatory elements (REs) remain elusive. Here we define the complete pathogenic 
      circuitry of human follicular lymphoma (FL), which activates or decommissions REs
      from normal GC B cells and commandeers enhancers from other lineages. Moreover,
      independent sets of transcription factors, whose expression was deregulated in
      FL, targeted commandeered versus decommissioned REs. Our approach revealed two
      distinct subtypes of low-grade FL, whose pathogenic circuitries resembled GC B or
      activated B cells. FL-altered enhancers also were enriched for sequence variants,
      including somatic mutations, which disrupt transcription-factor binding and
      expression of circuit-linked genes. Thus, the pathogenic regulatory circuitry of 
      FL reveals distinct genetic and epigenetic etiologies for GC B-cell
      transformation.

AB  - Upon infection, adaptive immune responses play catch-up with rapidly replicating 
      pathogens. While mechanisms for efficient humoral responses to lymph-borne
      antigens have been characterized, the current paradigm for T cell responses to
      infections and particulate vaccines involves delayed migration of peripheral
      antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) to lymph nodes (LNs), where they elicit
      effector T cell responses. Utilizing whole LN 3D imaging, histo-cytometry, and
      intravital 2-photon microscopy, we have identified a specialized population of
      DCs, enriched in the LN-resident CD11b(+) subset, which resides within the
      lymphatic sinus endothelium and scans lymph with motile dendrites. These DCs
      capture draining particles and present associated antigens to T lymphocytes,
      inducing T cell responses much sooner than and independently of migratory DCs.
      Thus, strategic DC subset positioning in LNs limits a potentially costly delay in
      generation of T cell responses to lymph-borne antigens, contributing to effective
      host defense. These findings are also highly relevant to vaccine design.

AB  - The probabilistic expression of cytokine genes in differentiated T helper (Th)
      cell populations remains ill defined. By single-cell analyses and mathematical
      modeling, we show that one stimulation featured stable cytokine nonproducers as
      well as stable producers with wide cell-to-cell variability in the magnitude of
      expression. Focusing on interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression by Th1 cells,
      mathematical modeling predicted that this behavior reflected different
      cell-intrinsic capacities and not mere gene-expression noise. In vivo, Th1 cells 
      sort purified by secreted IFN-gamma amounts preserved a quantitative memory for
      both probability and magnitude of IFN-gamma re-expression for at least 1 month.
      Mechanistically, this memory resulted from quantitatively distinct transcription 
      of individual alleles and was controlled by stable expression differences of the 
      Th1 cell lineage-specifying transcription factor T-bet. Functionally, Th1 cells
      with graded IFN-gamma production competence differentially activated
      Salmonella-infected macrophages for bacterial killing. Thus, individual Th cells 
      commit to produce distinct amounts of a given cytokine, thereby generating
      functional intrapopulation heterogeneity.

AB  - Adaptive immune responses begin when naive CD4(+) T cells engage peptide+major
      histocompatibility complex class II and co-stimulatory molecules on
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Notch signaling can influence effector functions
      in differentiated CD4(+) T helper and T regulatory cells. Whether and how
      ligand-induced Notch signaling influences the initial priming of CD4(+) T cells
      has not been addressed. We have found that Delta Like Ligand 4 (DLL4)-induced
      Notch signaling potentiates phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-dependent
      signaling downstream of the T cell receptor+CD28, allowing naive CD4(+) T cells
      to respond to lower doses of antigen. In vitro, DLL4-deficient APCs were less
      efficient stimulators of CD4(+) T cell activation, metabolism, proliferation, and
      cytokine secretion. With deletion of DLL4 from CD11c(+) APCs in vivo, these
      deficits translated to an impaired ability to mount an effective CD4(+)-dependent
      anti-tumor response. These data implicate Notch signaling as an important
      regulator of adaptive immune responses.

AB  - Inappropriate inflammasome activation contributes to multiple human diseases, but
      the mechanisms by which inflammasomes are suppressed are poorly understood. The
      NF-kappaB inhibitor A20 is a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme that might be critical in
      preventing human inflammatory diseases. Here, we report that A20-deficient
      macrophages, unlike normal cells, exhibit spontaneous NLRP3 inflammasome activity
      to LPS alone. The kinase RIPK3, but not the adaptor MyD88, is required for this
      response. In normal cells, A20 constitutively associates with caspase-1 and
      pro-IL-1beta, and NLRP3 activation further promotes A20 recruitment to the
      inflammasome. Pro-IL-1beta also co-immunoprecipitates with RIPK1, RIPK3,
      caspase-1, and caspase-8 in a complex that is modified with K63-linked and
      unanchored polyubiquitin. In A20-deficient macrophages, this
      pro-IL-1beta-associated ubiquitination is markedly increased in a RIPK3-dependent
      manner. Mass spectrometric and mutational analyses reveal that K133 of
      pro-IL-1beta is a physiological ubiquitination site that supports processing. Our
      study reveals a mechanism by which A20 prevents inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Naive T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support the increased energetic 
      and biosynthetic demands of effector T cell function. However, how nutrient
      availability influences T cell metabolism and function remains poorly understood.
      Here we report plasticity in effector T cell metabolism in response to changing
      nutrient availability. Activated T cells were found to possess a
      glucose-sensitive metabolic checkpoint controlled by the energy sensor
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that regulated mRNA translation and
      glutamine-dependent mitochondrial metabolism to maintain T cell bioenergetics and
      viability. T cells lacking AMPKalpha1 displayed reduced mitochondrial
      bioenergetics and cellular ATP in response to glucose limitation in vitro or
      pathogenic challenge in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that AMPKalpha1 is
      essential for T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell development and primary T cell
      responses to viral and bacterial infections in vivo. Our data highlight
      AMPK-dependent regulation of metabolic homeostasis as a key regulator of T
      cell-mediated adaptive immunity.

AB  - The mammalian gastrointestinal tract is home to a dense community of resident
      bacteria and is also exposed to microorganisms from the external environment. The
      epithelial surface of the intestine plays a critical role in host protection by
      producing a diverse repertoire of antimicrobial proteins that directly kill or
      hinder the growth of microorganisms. Here we discuss the general principles that 
      govern the mechanisms of action of epithelial antimicrobial proteins, regulation 
      of antimicrobial protein expression and activity, and in vivo functions of
      intestinal antimicrobial proteins. We also consider how altered antimicrobial
      protein expression and function can contribute to disease and how these
      endogenous antibiotics might be harnessed for the benefit of human health.

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas9)
      technology has proven a formidable addition to our armory of approaches for
      genomic editing. Derived from pathways in archaea and bacteria that mediate the
      resistance to exogenous genomic material, the CRISPR-Cas9 system utilizes a short
      single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct the endonuclease Cas9 to virtually anywhere in
      the genome. Upon targeting, Cas9 generates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
      facilitates the repair or insertion of mutations, insertion of recombinase
      recognition sites, or large DNA elements. Here, we discuss the practical
      advantages of the CRISPR-Cas9 system over conventional and other nuclease-based
      targeting technologies and provide suggestions for the use of this technology to 
      address immunological questions.

TI  - T cell receptor cross-reactivity between similar foreign and self peptides
      influences naive cell population size and autoimmunity.
PG  - 95-107
AB  - T cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity between major histocompatibility complex
      II (MHCII)-binding self and foreign peptides could influence the naive CD4(+) T
      cell repertoire and autoimmunity. We found that nonamer peptides that bind to the
      same MHCII molecule only need to share five amino acids to cross-react on the
      same TCR. This property was biologically relevant because systemic expression of 
      a self peptide reduced the size of a naive cell population specific for a related
      foreign peptide by deletion of cells with cross-reactive TCRs. Reciprocally, an
      incompletely deleted naive T cell population specific for a tissue-restricted
      self peptide could be triggered by related microbial peptides to cause
      autoimmunity. Thus, TCR cross-reactivity between similar self and foreign
      peptides can reduce the size of certain foreign peptide-specific T cell
      populations and might allow T cell populations specific for tissue-restricted
      self peptides to cause autoimmunity after infection.

TI  - Macrophage-derived upd3 cytokine causes impaired glucose homeostasis and reduced 
      lifespan in Drosophila fed a lipid-rich diet.
PG  - 133-44
AB  - Long-term consumption of fatty foods is associated with obesity, macrophage
      activation and inflammation, metabolic imbalance, and a reduced lifespan. We took
      advantage of Drosophila genetics to investigate the role of macrophages and the
      pathway(s) that govern their response to dietary stress. Flies fed a lipid-rich
      diet presented with increased fat storage, systemic activation of JAK-STAT
      signaling, reduced insulin sensitivity, hyperglycemia, and a shorter lifespan.
      Drosophila macrophages produced the JAK-STAT-activating cytokine upd3, in a
      scavenger-receptor (crq) and JNK-dependent manner. Genetic depletion of
      macrophages or macrophage-specific silencing of upd3 decreased JAK-STAT
      activation and rescued insulin sensitivity and the lifespan of Drosophila, but
      did not decrease fat storage. NF-kappaB signaling made no contribution to the
      phenotype observed. These results identify an evolutionarily conserved "scavenger
      receptor-JNK-type 1 cytokine" cassette in macrophages, which controls glucose
      metabolism and reduces lifespan in Drosophila maintained on a lipid-rich diet via
      activation of the JAK-STAT pathway.

AB  - The cellular mechanisms controlling infection-induced emergency granulopoiesis
      are poorly defined. Here we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      concentrations in the bone marrow (BM) were elevated during acute infection in a 
      phagocytic NADPH oxidase-dependent manner in myeloid cells. Gr1(+) myeloid cells 
      were uniformly distributed in the BM, and all c-kit(+) progenitor cells were
      adjacent to Gr1(+) myeloid cells. Inflammation-induced ROS production in the BM
      played a critical role in myeloid progenitor expansion during emergency
      granulopoiesis. ROS elicited oxidation and deactivation of phosphatase and tensin
      homolog (PTEN), resulting in upregulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling in BM
      myeloid progenitors. We further revealed that BM myeloid cell-produced ROS
      stimulated proliferation of myeloid progenitors via a paracrine mechanism. Taken 
      together, our results establish that phagocytic NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS
      production by BM myeloid cells plays a critical role in mediating emergency
      granulopoiesis during acute infection.

AB  - Kupffer cells, the phagocytes of fetal origin that line the liver sinusoids, are 
      key contributors of host defense against enteroinvasive bacteria. Here, we found 
      that infection by Listeria monocytogenes induced the early necroptotic death of
      Kupffer cells, which was followed by monocyte recruitment and an anti-bacterial
      type 1 inflammatory response. Kupffer cell death also triggered a type 2 response
      that involved the hepatocyte-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) and
      basophil-derived interleukin-4 (IL-4). This led to the alternative activation of 
      the monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the liver, which thereby replaced
      ablated Kupffer cells and restored liver homeostasis. Kupffer cell death is
      therefore a key signal orchestrating type 1 microbicidal inflammation and
      type-2-mediated liver repair upon infection. This indicates that beyond the
      classical dichotomy of type 1 and type 2 responses, these responses can develop
      sequentially in the context of a bacterial infection and act interdependently,
      orchestrating liver immune responses and return to homeostasis, respectively.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) suppresses T cell function to maintain
      self-tolerance and to promote tumor immune evasion. Yet how Smad4, a
      transcription factor component of TGF-beta signaling, regulates T cell function
      remains unclear. Here we have demonstrated an essential role for Smad4 in
      promoting T cell function during autoimmunity and anti-tumor immunity. Smad4
      deletion rescued the lethal autoimmunity resulting from transforming growth
      factor-beta receptor (TGF-betaR) deletion and compromised T-cell-mediated tumor
      rejection. Although Smad4 was dispensable for T cell generation, homeostasis, and
      effector function, it was essential for T cell proliferation after activation in 
      vitro and in vivo. The transcription factor Myc was identified to mediate
      Smad4-controlled T cell proliferation. This study thus reveals a requirement of
      Smad4 for T-cell-mediated autoimmunity and tumor rejection, which is beyond the
      current paradigm. It highlights a TGF-betaR-independent role for Smad4 in
      promoting T cell function, autoimmunity, and anti-tumor immunity.

AB  - Host innate recognition triggers key immune responses for viral elimination. The 
      sensing mechanism of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus, and the subsequent
      downstream signaling events remain to be fully clarified. Here we found that type
      III but not type I interferons are predominantly induced in human primary
      hepatocytes in response to HBV infection, through retinoic acid-inducible gene-I 
      (RIG-I)-mediated sensing of the 5'-epsilon region of HBV pregenomic RNA. In
      addition, RIG-I could also counteract the interaction of HBV polymerase (P
      protein) with the 5'-epsilon region in an RNA-binding dependent manner, which
      consistently suppressed viral replication. Liposome-mediated delivery and
      vector-based expression of this epsilon region-derived RNA in liver abolished the
      HBV replication in human hepatocyte-chimeric mice. These findings identify an
      innate-recognition mechanism by which RIG-I dually functions as an HBV sensor
      activating innate signaling and to counteract viral polymerase in human
      hepatocytes.
