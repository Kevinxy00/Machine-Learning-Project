TI  - Targeting hepatic glutaminase activity to ameliorate hyperglycemia.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4514 [doi]
AB  - Glucagon levels increase under homeostatic, fasting conditions, promoting the
      release of glucose from the liver by accelerating the breakdown of glycogen (also
      known as glycogenolysis). Glucagon also enhances gluconeogenic flux, including
      from an increase in the hepatic consumption of amino acids. In type 2 diabetes,
      dysregulated glucagon signaling contributes to the elevated hepatic glucose
      output and fasting hyperglycemia that occur in this condition. Yet, the mechanism
      by which glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis remains incompletely understood.
      Contrary to the prevailing belief that glucagon acts primarily on cytoplasmic and
      nuclear targets, we find glucagon-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial
      anaplerotic flux from glutamine that increases the contribution of this amino
      acid to the carbons of glucose generated during gluconeogenesis. This enhanced
      glucose production is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and is associated with 
      glucagon-stimulated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, activation of
      mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and increased glutaminolysis.
      Mice with reduced levels of hepatic glutaminase 2 (GLS2), the enzyme that
      catalyzes the first step in glutamine metabolism, show lower glucagon-stimulated 
      glutamine-to-glucose flux in vivo, and GLS2 knockout results in higher fasting
      plasma glucagon and glutamine levels with lower fasting blood glucose levels in
      insulin-resistant conditions. As found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
      human genetic variation in the region of GLS2 is associated with higher fasting
      plasma glucose; here we show in human cryopreserved primary hepatocytes in vitro 
      that these natural gain-of-function missense mutations in GLS2 result in higher
      glutaminolysis and glucose production. These data emphasize the importance of
      gluconeogenesis from glutamine, particularly in pathological states of increased 
      glucagon signaling, while suggesting a possible new therapeutic avenue to treat
      hyperglycemia.

TI  - Combinatorial inhibition of PTPN12-regulated receptors leads to a broadly
      effective therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4507 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer
      diagnosed in more than 200,000 women each year and is recalcitrant to targeted
      therapies. Although TNBCs harbor multiple hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases
      (RTKs), RTK inhibitors have been largely ineffective in TNBC patients thus far.
      We developed a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC that is based on
      combined inhibition of receptors that share the negative regulator PTPN12.
      Previously, we and others identified the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 as a tumor
      suppressor that is frequently inactivated in TNBC. PTPN12 restrains several RTKs,
      suggesting that PTPN12 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of multiple RTKs
      and a co-dependency on these receptors. This in turn leads to the therapeutic
      hypothesis that PTPN12-deficient TNBCs may be responsive to combined RTK
      inhibition. However, the repertoire of RTKs that are restrained by PTPN12 in
      human cells has not been systematically explored. By methodically identifying the
      suite of RTK substrates (MET, PDGFRbeta, EGFR, and others) inhibited by PTPN12,
      we rationalized a combination RTK-inhibitor therapy that induced potent tumor
      regression across heterogeneous models of TNBC. Orthogonal approaches revealed
      that PTPN12 was recruited to and inhibited these receptors after ligand
      stimulation, thereby serving as a feedback mechanism to limit receptor signaling.
      Cancer-associated mutation of PTPN12 or reduced PTPN12 protein levels diminished 
      this feedback mechanism, leading to aberrant activity of these receptors.
      Restoring PTPN12 protein levels restrained signaling from RTKs, including
      PDGFRbeta and MET, and impaired TNBC survival. In contrast with single agents,
      combined inhibitors targeting the PDGFRbeta and MET receptors induced the
      apoptosis in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic strategy resulted 
      in tumor regressions in chemo-refractory patient-derived TNBC models. Notably,
      response correlated with PTPN12 deficiency, suggesting that impaired receptor
      feedback may establish a combined addiction to these proto-oncogenic receptors.
      Taken together, our data provide a rationale for combining RTK inhibitors in TNBC
      and other malignancies that lack receptor-activating mutations.

TI  - A public antibody lineage that potently inhibits malaria infection through dual
      binding to the circumsporozoite protein.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4513 [doi]
AB  - Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZs) has been 
      shown to be protective against malaria, but the features of the antibody response
      induced by this treatment remain unclear. To investigate this response in detail,
      we isolated IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies from Tanzanian volunteers who were 
      immunized with repeated injection of Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine and who were found to 
      be protected from controlled human malaria infection with infectious homologous
      PfSPZs. All isolated IgG monoclonal antibodies bound to P. falciparum
      circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in its N
      terminus, NANP-repeat region, and C terminus. Strikingly, the most effective
      antibodies, as determined in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the
      repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction
      that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were isolated
      from different donors and were encoded by VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles that encode
      tryptophan or arginine at position 52. Using structural and mutational data, we
      describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity maturation. 
      Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant information for
      lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies.

TI  - A human monoclonal antibody prevents malaria infection by targeting a new site of
      vulnerability on the parasite.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4512 [doi]
AB  - Development of a highly effective vaccine or antibodies for the prevention and
      ultimately elimination of malaria is urgently needed. Here we report the
      isolation of a number of human monoclonal antibodies directed against the
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) from several subjects
      immunized with an attenuated Pf whole-sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine (Sanaria PfSPZ
      Vaccine). Passive transfer of one of these antibodies, monoclonal antibody CIS43,
      conferred high-level, sterile protection in two different mouse models of malaria
      infection. The affinity and stoichiometry of CIS43 binding to PfCSP indicate that
      there are two sequential multivalent binding events encompassing the repeat
      domain. The first binding event is to a unique 'junctional' epitope positioned
      between the N terminus and the central repeat domain of PfCSP. Moreover, CIS43
      prevented proteolytic cleavage of PfCSP on PfSPZ. Analysis of crystal structures 
      of the CIS43 antigen-binding fragment in complex with the junctional epitope
      determined the molecular interactions of binding, revealed the epitope's
      conformational flexibility and defined Asn-Pro-Asn (NPN) as the structural repeat
      motif. The demonstration that CIS43 is highly effective for passive prevention of
      malaria has potential application for use in travelers, military personnel and
      elimination campaigns and identifies a new and conserved site of vulnerability on
      PfCSP for next-generation rational vaccine design.

TI  - Dentate granule cell recruitment of feedforward inhibition governs engram
      maintenance and remote memory generalization.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4491 [doi]
AB  - Memories become less precise and generalized over time as memory traces
      reorganize in hippocampal-cortical networks. Increased time-dependent loss of
      memory precision is characterized by an overgeneralization of fear in individuals
      with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or age-related cognitive impairments. 
      In the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), memories are thought to be encoded by
      so-called 'engram-bearing' dentate granule cells (eDGCs). Here we show, using
      rodents, that contextual fear conditioning increases connectivity between eDGCs
      and inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the downstream hippocampal CA3 region. We
      identify actin-binding LIM protein 3 (ABLIM3) as a mossy-fiber-terminal-localized
      cytoskeletal factor whose levels decrease after learning. Downregulation of
      ABLIM3 expression in DGCs was sufficient to increase connectivity with CA3
      stratum lucidum INs (SLINs), promote parvalbumin (PV)-expressing SLIN activation,
      enhance feedforward inhibition onto CA3 and maintain a fear memory engram in the 
      DG over time. Furthermore, downregulation of ABLIM3 expression in DGCs conferred 
      conditioned context-specific reactivation of memory traces in
      hippocampal-cortical and amygdalar networks and decreased fear memory
      generalization at remote (i.e., distal) time points. Consistent with the
      observation of age-related hyperactivity of CA3, learning failed to increase
      DGC-SLIN connectivity in 17-month-old mice, whereas downregulation of ABLIM3
      expression was sufficient to restore DGC-SLIN connectivity, increase PV+ SLIN
      activation and improve the precision of remote memories. These studies exemplify 
      a connectivity-based strategy that targets a molecular brake of feedforward
      inhibition in DG-CA3 and may be harnessed to decrease time-dependent memory
      generalization in individuals with PTSD and improve memory precision in aging
      individuals.

TI  - Microenvironmental control of breast cancer subtype elicited through paracrine
      platelet-derived growth factor-CC signaling.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4494 [doi]
AB  - Breast tumors of the basal-like, hormone receptor-negative subtype remain an
      unmet clinical challenge, as there is high rate of recurrence and poor survival
      in patients following treatment. Coevolution of the malignant mammary epithelium 
      and its underlying stroma instigates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to
      support most, if not all, hallmarks of cancer progression. Here we delineate a
      previously unappreciated role for CAFs as determinants of the molecular subtype
      of breast cancer. We identified paracrine crosstalk between cancer cells
      expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-CC and CAFs expressing the
      cognate receptors in human basal-like mammary carcinomas. Genetic or
      pharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity in mouse models of cancer
      resulted in conversion of basal-like breast cancers into a hormone
      receptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy in
      previously resistant tumors. We conclude that specification of breast cancer to
      the basal-like subtype is under microenvironmental control and is therapeutically
      actionable.

TI  - Bone marrow niche trafficking of miR-126 controls the self-renewal of leukemia
      stem cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4499 [doi]
AB  - Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
      (hereafter referred to as CML LSCs) are responsible for initiating and
      maintaining clonal hematopoiesis. These cells persist in the bone marrow (BM)
      despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs). Here we show that although the microRNA (miRNA) miR-126
      supported the quiescence, self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs,
      miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells 
      (LT-HSCs) from healthy individuals. Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs 
      was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 (SPRED1)
      by BCR-ABL, which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that
      mediates miRNA maturation. Endothelial cells (ECs) in the BM supply miR-126 to
      CML LSCs to support quiescence and leukemia growth, as shown using mouse models
      of CML in which Mir126a (encoding miR-126) was conditionally knocked out in ECs
      and/or LSCs. Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase 
      in endogenous miR-126 levels, which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence.
      Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs, or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that
      targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs, enhanced the in vivo
      anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC
      leukemia-initiating capacity, providing a new strategy for the elimination of
      LSCs in individuals with CML.

TI  - SHP2 inhibition restores sensitivity in ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer
      resistant to ALK inhibitors.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4497 [doi]
AB  - Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung tumors
      initially respond to small-molecule ALK inhibitors, but drug resistance often
      develops. Of tumors that develop resistance to highly potent second-generation
      ALK inhibitors, approximately half harbor resistance mutations in ALK, while the 
      other half have other mechanisms underlying resistance. Members of the latter
      group often have activation of at least one of several different tyrosine kinases
      driving resistance. Such tumors are not expected to respond to lorlatinib-a
      third-generation inhibitor targeting ALK that is able to overcome all clinically 
      identified resistant mutations in ALK-and further therapeutic options are
      limited. Herein, we deployed a shRNA screen of 1,000 genes in multiple
      ALK-inhibitor-resistant patient-derived cells (PDCs) to discover those that
      confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition. This approach identified SHP2, a
      nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a common targetable resistance node 
      in multiple PDCs. SHP2 provides a parallel survival input downstream of multiple 
      tyrosine kinases that promote resistance to ALK inhibitors. Treatment with
      SHP099, the recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of SHP2, in combination 
      with the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ceritinib halted the growth of
      resistant PDCs through preventing compensatory RAS and ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2)
      reactivation. These findings suggest that combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition may be
      a promising therapeutic strategy for resistant cancers driven by several
      different ALK-independent mechanisms underlying resistance.

TI  - Single-cell developmental classification of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
      leukemia at diagnosis reveals predictors of relapse.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4505 [doi]
AB  - Insight into the cancer cell populations that are responsible for relapsed
      disease is needed to improve outcomes. Here we report a single-cell-based study
      of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis that reveals hidden
      developmentally dependent cell signaling states that are uniquely associated with
      relapse. By using mass cytometry we simultaneously quantified 35 proteins
      involved in B cell development in 60 primary diagnostic samples. Each leukemia
      cell was then matched to its nearest healthy B cell population by a developmental
      classifier that operated at the single-cell level. Machine learning identified
      six features of expanded leukemic populations that were sufficient to predict
      patient relapse at diagnosis. These features implicated the pro-BII subpopulation
      of B cells with activated mTOR signaling, and the pre-BI subpopulation of B cells
      with activated and unresponsive pre-B cell receptor signaling, to be associated
      with relapse. This model, termed 'developmentally dependent predictor of relapse'
      (DDPR), significantly improves currently established risk stratification methods.
      DDPR features exist at diagnosis and persist at relapse. By leveraging a
      data-driven approach, we demonstrate the predictive value of single-cell 'omics' 
      for patient stratification in a translational setting and provide a framework for
      its application to human cancer.

TI  - Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and gammadelta T cell responses in
      bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4501 [doi]
AB  - Lung-innervating nociceptor sensory neurons detect noxious or harmful stimuli and
      consequently protect organisms by mediating coughing, pain, and
      bronchoconstriction. However, the role of sensory neurons in pulmonary host
      defense is unclear. Here, we found that TRPV1(+) nociceptors suppressed
      protective immunity against lethal Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Targeted
      TRPV1(+)-neuron ablation increased survival, cytokine induction, and lung
      bacterial clearance. Nociceptors suppressed the recruitment and surveillance of
      neutrophils, and altered lung gammadelta T cell numbers, which are necessary for 
      immunity. Vagal ganglia TRPV1(+) afferents mediated immunosuppression through
      release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Targeting
      neuroimmunological signaling may be an effective approach to treat lung
      infections and bacterial pneumonia.

TI  - Selective modulation of the androgen receptor AF2 domain rescues degeneration in 
      spinal bulbar muscular atrophy.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4500 [doi]
AB  - Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by toxic
      gain of function of the androgen receptor (AR). Previously, we found that
      co-regulator binding through the activation function-2 (AF2) domain of AR is
      essential for pathogenesis, suggesting that AF2 may be a potential drug target
      for selective modulation of toxic AR activity. We screened previously identified 
      AF2 modulators for their ability to rescue toxicity in a Drosophila model of
      SBMA. We identified two compounds, tolfenamic acid (TA) and
      1-[2-(4-methylphenoxy)ethyl]-2-[(2-phenoxyethyl)sulfanyl]-1H-benzimidazole
      (MEPB), as top candidates for rescuing lethality, locomotor function and
      neuromuscular junction defects in SBMA flies. Pharmacokinetic analyses in mice
      revealed a more favorable bioavailability and tissue retention of MEPB compared
      with TA in muscle, brain and spinal cord. In a preclinical trial in a new mouse
      model of SBMA, MEPB treatment yielded a dose-dependent rescue from loss of body
      weight, rotarod activity and grip strength. In addition, MEPB ameliorated
      neuronal loss, neurogenic atrophy and testicular atrophy, validating AF2
      modulation as a potent androgen-sparing strategy for SBMA therapy.

PG  - 262-270
LID - 10.1038/nm.4496 [doi]
AB  - Immunotherapy offers new options for cancer treatment, but efficacy varies across
      cancer types. Colorectal cancers (CRCs) are largely refractory to
      immune-checkpoint blockade, which suggests the presence of yet uncharacterized
      immune-suppressive mechanisms. Here we report that the loss of adenomatosis
      polyposis coli (APC) in intestinal tumor cells or of the tumor suppressor PTEN in
      melanoma cells upregulates the expression of Dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2),
      which, together with its receptor LRP5, provides an unconventional mechanism for 
      tumor immune evasion. DKK2 secreted by tumor cells acts on cytotoxic lymphocytes,
      inhibiting STAT5 signaling by impeding STAT5 nuclear localization via LRP5, but
      independently of LRP6 and the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway. Genetic or
      antibody-mediated ablation of DKK2 activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8(+)
      T cells in tumors, impedes tumor progression, and enhances the effects of PD-1
      blockade. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown tumor immune-suppressive 
      mechanism and immunotherapeutic targets particularly relevant for CRCs and a
      subset of melanomas.

AB  - Deficits in Schwann cell-mediated remyelination impair functional restoration
      after nerve damage, contributing to peripheral neuropathies. The mechanisms
      mediating block of remyelination remain elusive. Here, through small-molecule
      screening focusing on epigenetic modulators, we identified histone deacetylase 3 
      (HDAC3; a histone-modifying enzyme) as a potent inhibitor of peripheral
      myelinogenesis. Inhibition of HDAC3 enhanced myelin growth and regeneration and
      improved functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury in mice. HDAC3
      antagonizes the myelinogenic neuregulin-PI3K-AKT signaling axis. Moreover,
      genome-wide profiling analyses revealed that HDAC3 represses promyelinating
      programs through epigenetic silencing while coordinating with p300 histone
      acetyltransferase to activate myelination-inhibitory programs that include the
      HIPPO signaling effector TEAD4 to inhibit myelin growth. Schwann cell-specific
      deletion of either Hdac3 or Tead4 in mice resulted in an elevation of myelin
      thickness in sciatic nerves. Thus, our findings identify the HDAC3-TEAD4 network 
      as a dual-function switch of cell-intrinsic inhibitory machinery that counters
      myelinogenic signals and maintains peripheral myelin homeostasis, highlighting
      the therapeutic potential of transient HDAC3 inhibition for improving peripheral 
      myelin repair.

TI  - Sorafenib promotes graft-versus-leukemia activity in mice and humans through
      IL-15 production in FLT3-ITD-mutant leukemia cells.
PG  - 282-291
LID - 10.1038/nm.4484 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an internal tandem
      duplication (ITD) in the gene encoding Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) who
      relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a
      1-year survival rate below 20%. We observed that sorafenib, a multitargeted
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increased IL-15 production by FLT3-ITD(+) leukemia
      cells. This synergized with the allogeneic CD8(+) T cell response, leading to
      long-term survival in six mouse models of FLT3-ITD(+) AML. Sorafenib-related
      IL-15 production caused an increase in CD8(+)CD107a(+)IFN-gamma(+) T cells with
      features of longevity (high levels of Bcl-2 and reduced PD-1 levels), which
      eradicated leukemia in secondary recipients. Mechanistically, sorafenib reduced
      expression of the transcription factor ATF4, thereby blocking negative regulation
      of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activation, which enhanced IL-15
      transcription. Both IRF7 knockdown and ATF4 overexpression in leukemia cells
      antagonized sorafenib-induced IL-15 production in vitro. Human FLT3-ITD(+) AML
      cells obtained from sorafenib responders following sorafenib therapy showed
      increased levels of IL-15, phosphorylated IRF7, and a transcriptionally active
      IRF7 chromatin state. The mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity and glycolytic
      capacity of CD8(+) T cells increased upon sorafenib treatment in sorafenib
      responders but not in nonresponders. Our findings indicate that the synergism of 
      T cells and sorafenib is mediated via reduced ATF4 expression, causing activation
      of the IRF7-IL-15 axis in leukemia cells and thereby leading to metabolic
      reprogramming of leukemia-reactive T cells in humans. Therefore, sorafenib
      treatment has the potential to contribute to an immune-mediated cure of
      FLT3-ITD-mutant AML relapse, an otherwise fatal complication after allo-HCT.

LID - 10.1038/nm.4479 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression in response to environmental cues, but
      the molecular events governing the cell type specificity of nuclear receptors
      remain poorly understood. Here we outline a role for a long noncoding RNA
      (lncRNA) in modulating the cell type-specific actions of liver X receptors
      (LXRs), sterol-activated nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes 
      involved in cholesterol homeostasis and that have been causally linked to the
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We identify the lncRNA MeXis as an amplifier of 
      LXR-dependent transcription of the gene Abca1, which is critical for regulation
      of cholesterol efflux. Mice lacking the MeXis gene show reduced Abca1 expression 
      in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, loss of MeXis in mouse bone marrow
      cells alters chromosome architecture at the Abca1 locus, impairs cellular
      responses to cholesterol overload, and accelerates the development of
      atherosclerosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that MeXis interacts with and guides 
      promoter binding of the transcriptional coactivator DDX17. The identification of 
      MeXis as a lncRNA modulator of LXR-dependent gene expression expands
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell type-selective actions of nuclear
      receptors in physiology and disease.

TI  - Haploinsufficiency leads to neurodegeneration in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD human induced
      motor neurons.
PG  - 313-325
LID - 10.1038/nm.4490 [doi]
AB  - An intronic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common cause of
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the
      pathogenic mechanism of this repeat remains unclear. Using human induced motor
      neurons (iMNs), we found that repeat-expanded C9ORF72 was haploinsufficient in
      ALS. We found that C9ORF72 interacted with endosomes and was required for normal 
      vesicle trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis in motor neurons. Repeat expansion
      reduced C9ORF72 expression, triggering neurodegeneration through two mechanisms: 
      accumulation of glutamate receptors, leading to excitotoxicity, and impaired
      clearance of neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins derived from the repeat
      expansion. Thus, cooperativity between gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms led 
      to neurodegeneration. Restoring C9ORF72 levels or augmenting its function with
      constitutively active RAB5 or chemical modulators of RAB5 effectors rescued
      patient neuron survival and ameliorated neurodegenerative processes in both gain-
      and loss-of-function C9ORF72 mouse models. Thus, modulating vesicle trafficking
      was able to rescue neurodegeneration caused by the C9ORF72 repeat expansion.
      Coupled with rare mutations in ALS2, FIG4, CHMP2B, OPTN and SQSTM1, our results
      reveal mechanistic convergence on vesicle trafficking in ALS and FTD.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue thermogenic adaptation requires Nrf1-mediated proteasomal
      activity.
PG  - 292-303
LID - 10.1038/nm.4481 [doi]
AB  - Adipocytes possess remarkable adaptive capacity to respond to nutrient excess,
      fasting or cold exposure, and they are thus an important cell type for the
      maintenance of proper metabolic health. Although the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      is a critical organelle for cellular homeostasis, the mechanisms that mediate
      adaptation of the ER to metabolic challenges in adipocytes are unclear. Here we
      show that brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic function requires an adaptive
      increase in proteasomal activity to secure cellular protein quality control, and 
      we identify the ER-localized transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-like
      1 (Nfe2l1, also known as Nrf1) as a critical driver of this process. We show that
      cold adaptation induces Nrf1 in BAT to increase proteasomal activity and that
      this is crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis and cellular integrity,
      specifically when the cells are in a state of high thermogenic activity. In mice,
      under thermogenic conditions, brown-adipocyte-specific deletion of Nfe2l1 (Nrf1) 
      resulted in ER stress, tissue inflammation, markedly diminished mitochondrial
      function and whitening of the BAT. In mouse models of both genetic and dietary
      obesity, stimulation of proteasomal activity by exogenously expressing Nrf1 or by
      treatment with the proteasome activator PA28alpha in BAT resulted in improved
      insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, Nrf1 emerges as a novel guardian of brown
      adipocyte function, providing increased proteometabolic quality control for
      adapting to cold or to obesity.

TI  - Noncanonical hedgehog pathway activation through SRF-MKL1 promotes drug
      resistance in basal cell carcinomas.
PG  - 271-281
LID - 10.1038/nm.4476 [doi]
AB  - Hedgehog pathway-dependent cancers can escape Smoothened (SMO) inhibition through
      mutations in genes encoding canonical hedgehog pathway components; however,
      around 50% of drug-resistant basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) lack additional
      variants of these genes. Here we use multidimensional genomics analysis of human 
      and mouse drug-resistant BCCs to identify a noncanonical hedgehog activation
      pathway driven by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Active
      SRF along with its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) binds DNA near 
      hedgehog target genes and forms a previously unknown protein complex with the
      hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1
      (GLI1), causing amplification of GLI1 transcriptional activity. We show that
      cytoskeletal activation through Rho and the formin family member Diaphanous
      (mDia) is required for SRF-MKL-driven GLI1 activation and for tumor cell
      viability. Remarkably, nuclear MKL1 staining served as a biomarker in tumors from
      mice and human subjects to predict tumor responsiveness to MKL inhibitors,
      highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. Thus, our study
      illuminates, for the first time, cytoskeletal-activation-driven transcription as 
      a personalized therapeutic target for combatting drug-resistant malignancies.

TI  - Pericyte degeneration causes white matter dysfunction in the mouse central
      nervous system.
PG  - 326-337
LID - 10.1038/nm.4482 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease and dementia is
      prevalent in the elderly. The biological mechanisms, however, remain elusive.
      Using pericyte-deficient mice, magnetic resonance imaging, viral-based
      tract-tracing, and behavior and tissue analysis, we found that pericyte
      degeneration disrupted white-matter microcirculation, resulting in an
      accumulation of toxic blood-derived fibrin(ogen) deposits and blood-flow
      reductions, which triggered a loss of myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes. This
      disrupted brain circuits, leading to white-matter functional deficits before
      neuronal loss occurs. Fibrinogen and fibrin fibrils initiated autophagy-dependent
      cell death in oligodendrocyte and pericyte cultures, whereas pharmacological and 
      genetic manipulations of systemic fibrinogen levels in pericyte-deficient, but
      not control mice, influenced the degree of white-matter fibrin(ogen) deposition, 
      pericyte degeneration, vascular pathology and white-matter changes. Thus, our
      data indicate that pericytes control white-matter structure and function, which
      has implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of human white-matter disease
      associated with small-vessel disease.

TI  - A novel chimeric antigen receptor containing a JAK-STAT signaling domain mediates
      superior antitumor effects.
PG  - 352-359
LID - 10.1038/nm.4478 [doi]
AB  - The adoptive transfer of T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR) (hereafter referred to as CAR-T cells) specific for the B lymphocyte
      antigen CD19 has shown impressive clinical responses in patients with refractory 
      B cell malignancies. However, the therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells that target 
      other malignancies have not yet resulted in significant clinical benefit.
      Although inefficient tumor trafficking and various immunosuppressive mechanisms
      can impede CAR-T cell effector responses, the signals delivered by the current
      CAR constructs may still be insufficient to fully activate antitumor T cell
      functions. Optimal T cell activation and proliferation requires multiple signals,
      including T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2) 
      and cytokine engagement (signal 3). However, CAR constructs currently being
      tested in the clinic contain a CD3z (TCR signaling) domain and co-stimulatory
      domain(s) but not a domain that transmits signal 3 (refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
      18). Here we have developed a novel CAR construct capable of inducing cytokine
      signaling after antigen stimulation. This new-generation CD19 CAR encodes a
      truncated cytoplasmic domain from the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor beta-chain
      (IL-2Rbeta) and a STAT3-binding tyrosine-X-X-glutamine (YXXQ) motif, together
      with the TCR signaling (CD3z) and co-stimulatory (CD28) domains (hereafter
      referred to as 28-DeltaIL2RB-z(YXXQ)). The 28-DeltaIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T cells
      showed antigen-dependent activation of the JAK kinase and of the STAT3 and STAT5 
      transcription factors signaling pathways, which promoted their proliferation and 
      prevented terminal differentiation in vitro. The 28-DeltaIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T
      cells demonstrated superior in vivo persistence and antitumor effects in models
      of liquid and solid tumors as compared with CAR-T cells expressing a CD28 or
      4-1BB co-stimulatory domain alone. Taken together, these results suggest that our
      new-generation CAR has the potential to demonstrate superior antitumor effects
      with minimal toxicity in the clinic and that clinical translation of this novel
      CAR is warranted.

TI  - Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic
      output in the fetal brain.
PG  - 368-374
LID - 10.1038/nm.4485 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but
      the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when
      ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina)
      model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain
      is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to
      detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, 
      including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical 
      brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and
      (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone
      (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with
      dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output
      demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV
      infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children
      exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive
      deficits, regardless of head size at birth.

TI  - Antagonism of PPAR-gamma signaling expands human hematopoietic stem and
      progenitor cells by enhancing glycolysis.
PG  - 360-367
LID - 10.1038/nm.4477 [doi]
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) quiescently reside in bone marrow niches and have
      the capacity to self-renew or differentiate to form all of the blood cells
      throughout the lifespan of an animal. Allogeneic HSC transplantation is a
      life-saving treatment for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. HSCs isolated
      from umbilical cord blood (CB) are used for hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT), but due to the limited numbers of HSCs in single units of umbilical CB, a 
      number of methods have been proposed for ex vivo expansion of human HSCs. We show
      here that antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma
      promotes ex vivo expansion of phenotypically and functionally defined subsets of 
      human CB HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HSPCs). PPAR-gamma antagonism
      in CB HSPCs strongly downregulated expression of several
      differentiation-associated genes, as well as fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1;
      which encodes a negative regulator of glycolysis), and enhanced glycolysis
      without compromising mitochondrial metabolism. The expansion of CB HSPCs by
      PPAR-gamma antagonism was completely suppressed by removal of glucose or
      inhibition of glycolysis. Moreover, knockdown of FBP1 expression promoted
      glycolysis and ex vivo expansion of long-term repopulating CB HSPCs, whereas
      overexpression of FBP1 suppressed the expansion of CB HSPCs that was induced by
      PPAR-gamma antagonism. Our study suggests the possibility for a new and simple
      means for metabolic reprogramming of CB HSPCs to improve the efficacy of HCT.

TI  - Genital inflammation undermines the effectiveness of tenofovir gel in preventing 
      HIV acquisition in women.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4506 [doi]
AB  - Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs taken
      as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can prevent HIV infection, with the magnitude 
      of protection ranging from -49 to 86% (refs. ). Although these divergent outcomes
      are thought to be due primarily to differences in product adherence, biological
      factors likely contribute. Despite selective recruitment of higher-risk
      participants for prevention trials, HIV risk is heterogeneous even within
      higher-risk groups. To determine whether this heterogeneity could influence
      patient outcomes following PrEP, we undertook a post hoc prospective analysis of 
      results from the CAPRISA 004 trial for 1% tenofovir gel (n = 774 patients), one
      of the first trials to demonstrate protection against HIV infection.
      Concentrations of nine proinflammatory cytokines were measured in cervicovaginal 
      lavages at >2,000 visits, and a graduated cytokine score was used to define
      genital inflammation. In women without genital inflammation, tenofovir was 57%
      protective against HIV (95% confidence interval (CI): 7-80%) but was 3%
      protective (95% CI: -104-54%) if genital inflammation was present. Among women
      who highly adhered to the gel, tenofovir protection was 75% (95% CI: 25-92%) in
      women without inflammation compared to -10% (95% CI: -184-57%) in women with
      inflammation. Immunological predictors of HIV risk may modify the effectiveness
      of tools for HIV prevention; reducing genital inflammation in women may augment
      HIV prevention efforts.

TI  - Restorative effects of human neural stem cell grafts on the primate spinal cord.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4502 [doi]
AB  - We grafted human spinal cord-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into sites of
      cervical spinal cord injury in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Under three-drug 
      immunosuppression, grafts survived at least 9 months postinjury and expressed
      both neuronal and glial markers. Monkey axons regenerated into grafts and formed 
      synapses. Hundreds of thousands of human axons extended out from grafts through
      monkey white matter and synapsed in distal gray matter. Grafts gradually matured 
      over 9 months and improved forelimb function beginning several months after
      grafting. These findings in a 'preclinical trial' support translation of NPC
      graft therapy to humans with the objective of reconstituting both a neuronal and 
      glial milieu in the site of spinal cord injury.

TI  - H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, induces
      lethality in spliceosome-mutant cancers.
LID - 10.1038/nm.4493 [doi]
AB  - Genomic analyses of cancer have identified recurrent point mutations in the RNA
      splicing factor-encoding genes SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 that confer an alteration 
      of function. Cancer cells bearing these mutations are preferentially dependent on
      wild-type (WT) spliceosome function, but clinically relevant means to
      therapeutically target the spliceosome do not currently exist. Here we describe
      an orally available modulator of the SF3b complex, H3B-8800, which potently and
      preferentially kills spliceosome-mutant epithelial and hematologic tumor cells.
      These killing effects of H3B-8800 are due to its direct interaction with the SF3b
      complex, as evidenced by loss of H3B-8800 activity in drug-resistant cells
      bearing mutations in genes encoding SF3b components. Although H3B-8800 modulates 
      WT and mutant spliceosome activity, the preferential killing of
      spliceosome-mutant cells is due to retention of short, GC-rich introns, which are
      enriched for genes encoding spliceosome components. These data demonstrate the
      therapeutic potential of splicing modulation in spliceosome-mutant cancers.

TI  - Positively selected enhancer elements endow osteosarcoma cells with metastatic
      competence.
PG  - 176-185
LID - 10.1038/nm.4475 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis results from a complex set of traits acquired by tumor cells, distinct
      from those necessary for tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the contribution of 
      enhancer elements to the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma. Through epigenomic
      profiling, we identify substantial differences in enhancer activity between
      primary and metastatic human tumors and between near isogenic pairs of highly
      lung metastatic and nonmetastatic osteosarcoma cell lines. We term these regions 
      metastatic variant enhancer loci (Met-VELs). Met-VELs drive coordinated waves of 
      gene expression during metastatic colonization of the lung. Met-VELs cluster
      nonrandomly in the genome, indicating that activity of these enhancers and
      expression of their associated gene targets are positively selected. As evidence 
      of this causal association, osteosarcoma lung metastasis is inhibited by global
      interruptions of Met-VEL-associated gene expression via pharmacologic BET
      inhibition, by knockdown of AP-1 transcription factors that occupy Met-VELs, and 
      by knockdown or functional inhibition of individual genes activated by Met-VELs, 
      such as that encoding coagulation factor III/tissue factor (F3). We further show 
      that genetic deletion of a single Met-VEL at the F3 locus blocks metastatic cell 
      outgrowth in the lung. These findings indicate that Met-VELs and the genes they
      regulate play a functional role in metastasis and may be suitable targets for
      antimetastatic therapies.

      treatment.
PG  - 186-193
LID - 10.1038/nm.4474 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) comprises a network of enzymes that is
      responsible for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. The therapeutic
      potential of this pathway has been validated by the clinical successes of a
      number of UPS modulators, including proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory
      imide drugs (IMiDs). Here we identified TAK-243 (formerly known as MLN7243) as a 
      potent, mechanism-based small-molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating
      enzyme (UAE), the primary mammalian E1 enzyme that regulates the ubiquitin
      conjugation cascade. TAK-243 treatment caused depletion of cellular ubiquitin
      conjugates, resulting in disruption of signaling events, induction of proteotoxic
      stress, and impairment of cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair pathways. 
      TAK-243 treatment caused death of cancer cells and, in primary human xenograft
      studies, demonstrated antitumor activity at tolerated doses. Due to its
      specificity and potency, TAK-243 allows for interrogation of ubiquitin biology
      and for assessment of UAE inhibition as a new approach for cancer treatment.

      for control of inflammation.
PG  - 224-231
LID - 10.1038/nm.4467 [doi]
AB  - Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are pathologically activated and
      relatively immature myeloid cells that have been implicated in the immunological 
      regulation of many pathologic conditions. Phenotypically and morphologically,
      MDSCs are similar to neutrophils (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytes (M-MDSCs). However,
      they have potent suppressive activity and distinct gene expression profiles and
      biochemical characteristics. No or very few MDSCs are observed in steady-state
      physiological conditions. Therefore, until recently, accumulation of MDSCs was
      considered a consequence of pathological processes or pregnancy. Here, we report 
      that MDSCs with a potent ability to suppress T cells are present during the first
      weeks of life in mice and humans. MDSC suppressive activity was triggered by
      lactoferrin and mediated by nitric oxide, PGE2, and S100A9 and S100A8 proteins.
      MDSCs from newborns had a transcriptome similar to that of tumor MDSCs, but with 
      strong upregulation of an antimicrobial gene network, and had potent
      antibacterial activity. MDSCs played a critical role in control of experimental
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in newborn mice. MDSCs in infants with very low
      weight, who are prone to NEC, had lower MDSC levels and suppressive activity than
      did infants with normal weight. Thus, the transitory presence of MDSCs may be
      critical for regulation of inflammation in newborns.

TI  - Prevention of tuberculosis in rhesus macaques by a cytomegalovirus-based vaccine.
PG  - 130-143

AB  - Despite widespread use of the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, tuberculosis
      (TB) remains a leading cause of global mortality from a single infectious agent
      (Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mtb). Here, over two independent Mtb challenge
      studies, we demonstrate that subcutaneous vaccination of rhesus macaques (RMs)
      with rhesus cytomegalovirus vectors encoding Mtb antigen inserts (hereafter
      referred to as RhCMV/TB)-which elicit and maintain highly
      effector-differentiated, circulating and tissue-resident Mtb-specific CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) memory T cell responses-can reduce the overall (pulmonary and
      extrapulmonary) extent of Mtb infection and disease by 68%, as compared to that
      in unvaccinated controls, after intrabronchial challenge with the Erdman strain
      of Mtb at approximately 1 year after the first vaccination. Fourteen of 34
      RhCMV/TB-vaccinated RMs (41%) across both studies showed no TB disease by
      computed tomography scans or at necropsy after challenge (as compared to 0 of 17 
      unvaccinated controls), and ten of these RMs were Mtb-culture-negative for all
      tissues, an exceptional long-term vaccine effect in the RM challenge model with
      the Erdman strain of Mtb. These results suggest that complete vaccine-mediated
      immune control of highly pathogenic Mtb is possible if immune effector responses 
      can intercept Mtb infection at its earliest stages.

      antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.
PG  - 194-202

AB  - The unique metabolic demands of cancer cells underscore potentially fruitful
      opportunities for drug discovery in the era of precision medicine. However,
      therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism has led to surprisingly few new drugs 
      to date. The neutral amino acid glutamine serves as a key intermediate in
      numerous metabolic processes leveraged by cancer cells, including biosynthesis,
      cell signaling, and oxidative protection. Herein we report the preclinical
      development of V-9302, a competitive small molecule antagonist of transmembrane
      glutamine flux that selectively and potently targets the amino acid transporter
      ASCT2. Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2 with V-9302 resulted in attenuated
      cancer cell growth and proliferation, increased cell death, and increased
      oxidative stress, which collectively contributed to antitumor responses in vitro 
      and in vivo. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the
      utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of glutamine transport in oncology,
      representing a new class of targeted therapy and laying a framework for
      paradigm-shifting therapies targeting cancer cell metabolism.

TI  - Cooperative targeting of melanoma heterogeneity with an AXL antibody-drug
      conjugate and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.
PG  - 203-212
LID - 10.1038/nm.4472 [doi]
AB  - Intratumor heterogeneity is a key factor contributing to therapeutic failure and,
      hence, cancer lethality. Heterogeneous tumors show partial therapy responses,
      allowing for the emergence of drug-resistant clones that often express high
      levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. In melanoma, AXL-high cells are
      resistant to MAPK pathway inhibitors, whereas AXL-low cells are sensitive to
      these inhibitors, rationalizing a differential therapeutic approach. We developed
      an antibody-drug conjugate, AXL-107-MMAE, comprising a human AXL antibody linked 
      to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E. We found that
      AXL-107-MMAE, as a single agent, displayed potent in vivo anti-tumor activity in 
      patient-derived xenografts, including melanoma, lung, pancreas and cervical
      cancer. By eliminating distinct populations in heterogeneous melanoma cell pools,
      AXL-107-MMAE and MAPK pathway inhibitors cooperatively inhibited tumor growth.
      Furthermore, by inducing AXL transcription, BRAF/MEK inhibitors potentiated the
      efficacy of AXL-107-MMAE. These findings provide proof of concept for the premise
      that rationalized combinatorial targeting of distinct populations in
      heterogeneous tumors may improve therapeutic effect, and merit clinical
      validation of AXL-107-MMAE in both treatment-naive and drug-resistant cancers in 
      mono- or combination therapy.

AB  - Immune-checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer therapy. In particular,
      inhibition of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has been found to be
      effective for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and other cancers. Despite a
      dramatic increase in progression-free survival, a large proportion of patients do
      not show durable responses. Therefore, predictive biomarkers of a clinical
      response are urgently needed. Here we used high-dimensional single-cell mass
      cytometry and a bioinformatics pipeline for the in-depth characterization of the 
      immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with stage IV melanoma
      before and after 12 weeks of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. During therapy, we observed
      a clear response to immunotherapy in the T cell compartment. However, before
      commencing therapy, a strong predictor of progression-free and overall survival
      in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was the frequency of
      CD14(+)CD16(-)HLA-DR(hi) monocytes. We confirmed this by conventional flow
      cytometry in an independent, blinded validation cohort, and we propose that the
      frequency of monocytes in PBMCs may serve in clinical decision support.

TI  - Diverse genetic-driven immune landscapes dictate tumor progression through

PG  - 165-175
LID - 10.1038/nm.4463 [doi]
AB  - Multiple immune-cell types can infiltrate tumors and promote progression and
      metastasis through different mechanisms, including immunosuppression. How
      distinct genetic alterations in tumors affect the composition of the immune
      landscape is currently unclear. Here, we characterized the immune-cell
      composition of prostate cancers driven by the loss of the critical tumor
      suppressor gene Pten, either alone or in combination with the loss of Trp53,
      Zbtb7a or Pml. We observed a striking quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity 
      that was directly dependent on the specific genetic events in the tumor and
      ranged from 'cold', noninflamed tumors to massively infiltrated
      landscapes-results with important therapeutic implications. Further, we showed
      these qualitative differences in transcriptomic analysis of human prostate cancer
      samples. These data suggest that patient stratification on the basis of
      integrated genotypic-immunophenotypic analyses may be necessary for successful
      clinical trials and tailored precision immunological therapies.

TI  - Macrophage extracellular trap formation promoted by platelet activation is a key 
      mediator of rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury.
PG  - 232-238
LID - 10.1038/nm.4462 [doi]
AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is a serious syndrome caused by skeletal muscle injury and the
      subsequent release of breakdown products from damaged muscle cells into systemic 
      circulation. The muscle damage most often results from strenuous exercise, muscle
      hypoxia, medications, or drug abuse and can lead to life-threatening
      complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Rhabdomyolysis and the AKI
      complication can also occur during crush syndrome, an emergency condition that
      commonly occurs in victims of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, and
      man-made disasters, such as wars and terrorism. Myoglobin released from damaged
      muscle is believed to trigger renal dysfunction in this form of AKI. Recently,
      macrophages were implicated in the disease pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-induced
      AKI, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study,
      we show that macrophages released extracellular traps (ETs) comprising DNA fibers
      and granule proteins in a mouse model of rhabdomyolysis. Heme-activated platelets
      released from necrotic muscle cells during rhabdomyolysis enhanced the production
      of macrophage extracellular traps (METs) through increasing intracellular
      reactive oxygen species generation and histone citrullination. Here we report,
      for the first time to our knowledge, this unanticipated role for METs and
      platelets as a sensor of myoglobin-derived heme in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI.
      This previously unknown mechanism might be targeted for treatment of the disease.
      Finally, we found a new therapeutic tool for prevention of AKI after
      rhabdomyolysis, which might rescue some sufferers of this pathology.

TI  - Suppression of luteinizing hormone enhances HSC recovery after hematopoietic
      injury.
PG  - 239-246
LID - 10.1038/nm.4470 [doi]
AB  - There is a substantial unmet clinical need for new strategies to protect the
      hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool and regenerate hematopoiesis after radiation
      injury from either cancer therapy or accidental exposure. Increasing evidence
      suggests that sex hormones, beyond their role in promoting sexual dimorphism,
      regulate HSC self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation. We and others have
      previously reported that sex-steroid ablation promotes bone marrow (BM)
      lymphopoiesis and HSC recovery in aged and immunodepleted mice. Here we found
      that a luteinizing hormone (LH)-releasing hormone antagonist (LHRH-Ant),
      currently in wide clinical use for sex-steroid inhibition, promoted hematopoietic
      recovery and mouse survival when administered 24 h after an otherwise-lethal dose
      of total-body irradiation (L-TBI). Unexpectedly, this protective effect was
      independent of sex steroids and instead relied on suppression of LH levels. Human
      and mouse long-term self-renewing HSCs (LT-HSCs) expressed high levels of the
      LH/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and expanded ex vivo when stimulated with 
      LH. In contrast, the suppression of LH after L-TBI inhibited entry of HSCs into
      the cell cycle, thus promoting HSC quiescence and protecting the cells from
      exhaustion. These findings reveal a role of LH in regulating HSC function and
      offer a new therapeutic approach for hematopoietic regeneration after
      hematopoietic injury.

      cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Through exome sequencing of ENKTL tumor-normal samples, we
      have identified a hotspot mutation (c.419T>C) in the evolutionarily conserved
      signaling intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT) gene, encoding a V140A variant of 
      ECSIT. ECSIT-V140A activated NF-kappaB more potently than the wild-type protein
      owing to its increased affinity for the S100A8 and S100A9 heterodimer, which
      promotes NADPH oxidase activity. ECSIT-T419C knock-in mice showed higher
      peritoneal NADPH oxidase activity than mice with wild-type ECSIT in response to
      LPS. ECSIT-T419C-transfected ENKTL cell lines produced tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma, which induced macrophage activation and
      massive cytokine secretion in cell culture and mouse xenografts. In individuals
      with ENKTL, ECSIT-V140A was associated with activation of NF-kappaB, higher HPS
      incidence, and poor prognosis. The immunosuppressive drug thalidomide prevented
      NF-kappaB from binding to the promoters of its target genes (including TNF and
      IFNG), and combination treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone extended
      survival of mice engrafted with ECSIT-T419C-transfected ENKTL cells. We added
      thalidomide to the conventional dexamethasone-containing therapy regimen for two 
      patients with HPS who expressed ECSIT-V140A, and we observed reversal of their
      HPS and disease-free survival for longer than 3 years. These findings provide
      mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for ENKTL-associated
      HPS.

AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common clinical condition that can lead 
      to advanced liver diseases. Lack of effective pharmacotherapies for NASH is
      largely attributable to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. The
      deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) plays key roles in inflammation and cancer.
      Here we identified CYLD as a suppressor of NASH in mice and in monkeys. CYLD is
      progressively degraded upon interaction with the E3 ligase TRIM47 in proportion
      to NASH severity. We observed that overexpression of Cyld in hepatocytes
      concomitantly inhibits lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, inflammation and
      fibrosis in mice with NASH induced in an experimental setting. Mechanistically,
      CYLD interacts directly with the kinase TAK1 and removes its K63-linked
      polyubiquitin chain, which blocks downstream activation of the JNK-p38 cascades. 
      Notably, reconstitution of hepatic CYLD expression effectively reverses disease
      progression in mice with dietary or genetically induced NASH and in high-fat
      diet-fed monkeys predisposed to metabolic syndrome. Collectively, our findings
      demonstrate that CYLD mitigates NASH severity and identify the CYLD-TAK1 axis as 
      a promising therapeutic target for management of the disease.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the associated morbidity and mortality due to 
      bacterial pathogens have been increasing globally to alarming levels. The World
      Health Organization (WHO) has called for global action on AMR, supported
      worldwide by governments, health ministries and health agencies. Many potential
      solutions to stem AMR are being discussed and implemented. These include
      increases in antimicrobial stewardship, investment in research and development to
      design new classes of antibiotics, and reduction of antibiotic use in rearing of 
      livestock. However, vaccines as tools to reduce AMR have historically been
      under-recognized in these discussions, even though their effectiveness in
      reducing disease and AMR is well documented. This review article seeks to
      highlight the value of vaccines as an additional modality to combat AMR globally,
      using select examples. It also will provide perspectives on how vaccines could be
      more effectively used in this effort.

TI  - The deubiquitinating enzyme TNFAIP3 mediates inactivation of hepatic ASK1 and
      ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 84-94

AB  - Activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in hepatocytes is a key
      process in the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and a promising
      target for treatment of the condition. However, the mechanism underlying ASK1
      activation is still unclear, and thus the endogenous regulators of this kinase
      remain open to be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. In screening for
      proteins that interact with ASK1 in the context of NASH, we identified the
      deubiquitinase tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) as a key
      endogenous suppressor of ASK1 activation, and we found that TNFAIP3 directly
      interacts with and deubiquitinates ASK1 in hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific
      ablation of Tnfaip3 exacerbated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease- and
      NASH-related phenotypes in mice, including glucose metabolism disorders, lipid
      accumulation and enhanced inflammation, in an ASK1-dependent manner. In contrast,
      transgenic or adeno-associated virus-mediated TNFAIP3 gene delivery in the liver 
      in both mouse and nonhuman primate models of NASH substantially blocked the onset
      and progression of the disease. These results implicate TNFAIP3 as a functionally
      important endogenous suppressor of ASK1 hyperactivation in the pathogenesis of
      NASH and identify it as a potential new molecular target for NASH therapy.

AB  - We present the molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
      characterize nearly 1,000 participants in Children's Oncology Group (COG) AML
      trials. The COG-National Cancer Institute (NCI) TARGET AML initiative assessed
      cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA and microRNA sequencing and CpG
      methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants corresponded to diverse, infrequent
      mutations, with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2% of cases. In contrast, somatic
      structural variants, including new gene fusions and focal deletions of MBNL1,
      ZEB2 and ELF1, were disproportionately prevalent in young individuals as compared
      to adults. Conversely, mutations in DNMT3A and TP53, which were common in adults,
      were conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. New mutations in
      GATA2, FLT3 and CBL and recurrent mutations in MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS and WT1 were
      frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations and promoter DNA hypermethylation
      convergently impacted Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell
      interactions and a cluster of zinc finger-encoding genes associated with KMT2A
      rearrangements. These results highlight the need for and facilitate the
      development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric
      AML.

TI  - An ALOX12-12-HETE-GPR31 signaling axis is a key mediator of hepatic
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.
PG  - 73-83
LID - 10.1038/nm.4451 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a common clinical issue lacking
      effective therapy and validated pharmacological targets. Here, using integrative 
      'omics' analysis, we identified an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase
      (ALOX12)-12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE)-G-protein-coupled receptor 31 
      (GPR31) signaling axis as a key determinant of the hepatic IR process. We found
      that ALOX12 was markedly upregulated in hepatocytes during ischemia to promote
      12-HETE accumulation and that 12-HETE then directly binds to GPR31, triggering an
      inflammatory response that exacerbates liver damage. Notably, blocking 12-HETE
      production inhibits IR-induced liver dysfunction, inflammation and cell death in 
      mice and pigs. Furthermore, we established a nonhuman primate hepatic IR model
      that closely recapitulates clinical liver dysfunction following liver resection. 
      Most strikingly, blocking 12-HETE accumulation effectively attenuated all
      pathologies of hepatic IR in this model. Collectively, this study has revealed
      previously uncharacterized metabolic reprogramming involving an
      ALOX12-12-HETE-GPR31 axis that functionally determines hepatic IR procession. We 
      have also provided proof of concept that blocking 12-HETE production is a
      promising strategy for preventing and treating IR-induced liver damage.

TI  - A proteolytic fragment of histone deacetylase 4 protects the heart from failure
      by regulating the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.
PG  - 62-72
LID - 10.1038/nm.4452 [doi]
AB  - The stress-responsive epigenetic repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)
      regulates cardiac gene expression. Here we show that the levels of an N-terminal 
      proteolytically derived fragment of HDAC4, termed HDAC4-NT, are lower in failing 
      mouse hearts than in healthy control hearts. Virus-mediated transfer of the
      portion of the Hdac4 gene encoding HDAC4-NT into the mouse myocardium protected
      the heart from remodeling and failure; this was associated with decreased
      expression of Nr4a1, which encodes a nuclear orphan receptor, and decreased
      NR4A1-dependent activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).
      Conversely, exercise enhanced HDAC4-NT levels, and mice with a
      cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Hdac4 show reduced exercise capacity, which
      was characterized by cardiac fatigue and increased expression of Nr4a1.
      Mechanistically, we found that NR4A1 negatively regulated contractile function in
      a manner that depended on the HBP and the calcium sensor STIM1. Our work
      describes a new regulatory axis in which epigenetic regulation of a metabolic
      pathway affects calcium handling. Activation of this axis during intermittent
      physiological stress promotes cardiac function, whereas its impairment in
      sustained pathological cardiac stress leads to heart failure.

TI  - Amyloid-beta plaques enhance Alzheimer's brain tau-seeded pathologies by
      facilitating neuritic plaque tau aggregation.
PG  - 29-38
LID - 10.1038/nm.4443 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta)
      plaques and intracellular tau inclusions. However, the exact mechanistic link
      between these two AD lesions remains enigmatic. Through injection of human
      AD-brain-derived pathological tau (AD-tau) into Abeta plaque-bearing mouse models
      that do not overexpress tau, we recapitulated the formation of three major types 
      of AD-relevant tau pathologies: tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites surrounding
      Abeta plaques (NP tau), AD-like neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil
      threads (NTs). These distinct tau pathologies have different temporal onsets and 
      functional consequences on neural activity and behavior. Notably, we found that
      Abeta plaques created a unique environment that facilitated the rapid
      amplification of proteopathic AD-tau seeds into large tau aggregates, initially
      appearing as NP tau, which was followed by the formation and spread of NFTs and
      NTs, likely through secondary seeding events. Our study provides insights into a 
      new multistep mechanism underlying Abeta plaque-associated tau pathogenesis.

TI  - Thyroid hormone inhibits lung fibrosis in mice by improving epithelial
      mitochondrial function.
PG  - 39-49
LID - 10.1038/nm.4447 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis
      during stress responses, but its role in lung fibrosis is unknown. Here we found 
      that the activity and expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme 
      that activates TH, were higher in lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis than in control individuals and were correlated with disease severity.
      We also found that Dio2-knockout mice exhibited enhanced bleomycin-induced lung
      fibrosis. Aerosolized TH delivery increased survival and resolved fibrosis in two
      models of pulmonary fibrosis in mice (intratracheal bleomycin and inducible
      TGF-beta1). Sobetirome, a TH mimetic, also blunted bleomycin-induced lung
      fibrosis. After bleomycin-induced injury, TH promoted mitochondrial biogenesis,
      improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuated mitochondria-regulated
      apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. TH did not
      blunt fibrosis in Ppargc1a- or Pink1-knockout mice, suggesting dependence on
      these pathways. We conclude that the antifibrotic properties of TH are associated
      with protection of alveolar epithelial cells and restoration of mitochondrial
      function and that TH may thus represent a potential therapy for pulmonary
      fibrosis.

TI  - cGAS drives noncanonical-inflammasome activation in age-related macular
      degeneration.
PG  - 50-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.4450 [doi]
AB  - Geographic atrophy is a blinding form of age-related macular degeneration
      characterized by retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) death; the RPE also exhibits 
      DICER1 deficiency, resultant accumulation of endogenous Alu-retroelement RNA, and
      NLRP3-inflammasome activation. How the inflammasome is activated in this
      untreatable disease is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that RPE degeneration
      in human-cell-culture and mouse models is driven by a noncanonical-inflammasome
      pathway that activates caspase-4 (caspase-11 in mice) and caspase-1, and requires
      cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent interferon-beta production and gasdermin
      D-dependent interleukin-18 secretion. Decreased DICER1 levels or Alu-RNA
      accumulation triggers cytosolic escape of mitochondrial DNA, which engages cGAS. 
      Moreover, caspase-4, gasdermin D, interferon-beta, and cGAS levels were elevated 
      in the RPE in human eyes with geographic atrophy. Collectively, these data
      highlight an unexpected role of cGAS in responding to mobile-element transcripts,
      reveal cGAS-driven interferon signaling as a conduit for
      mitochondrial-damage-induced inflammasome activation, expand the immune-sensing
      repertoire of cGAS and caspase-4 to noninfectious human disease, and identify new
      potential targets for treatment of a major cause of blindness.

TI  - CD22-targeted CAR T cells induce remission in B-ALL that is naive or resistant to
      CD19-targeted CAR immunotherapy.
PG  - 20-28

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 mediate potent effects in 
      relapsed and/or refractory pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but
      antigen loss is a frequent cause of resistance to CD19-targeted immunotherapy.
      CD22 is also expressed in most cases of B-ALL and is usually retained following
      CD19 loss. We report results from a phase 1 trial testing a new CD22-targeted CAR
      (CD22-CAR) in 21 children and adults, including 17 who were previously treated
      with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose-dependent antileukemic activity was
      observed, with complete remission obtained in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving
      >/=1 x 10(6) CD22-CAR T cells per kg body weight, including 5 of 5 patients with 
      CD19(dim) or CD19(-) B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were
      associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted CD22(+) cell
      escape from killing by CD22-CAR T cells. These results are the first to establish
      the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in B-ALL, including leukemia resistant to
      anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating potency against B-ALL comparable to that
      of CD19-CAR at biologically active doses. Our results also highlight the critical
      role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function.

TI  - Granulocyte-derived TNFalpha promotes vascular and hematopoietic regeneration in 
      the bone marrow.
PG  - 95-102
LID - 10.1038/nm.4448 [doi]
AB  - Endothelial cells are a critical component of the bone marrow (BM) stromal
      network, which maintains and regulates hematopoietic cells. Vascular regeneration
      precedes, and is necessary for, successful hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      transplantation, the only cure for most hematopoietic diseases. Recent data
      suggest that mature hematopoietic cells regulate BM stromal-cell function.
      Whether a similar cross-talk regulates the BM vasculature is not known. Here we
      found that donor hematopoietic cells act on sinusoidal endothelial cells and
      induce host blood vessel and hematopoietic regeneration after BM transplantation 
      in mice. Adoptive transfer of BM, but not peripheral, granulocytes prevented the 
      death of mice transplanted with limited numbers of HSCs and accelerated recovery 
      of host vessels and hematopoietic cells. Moreover, selective granulocyte ablation
      in vivo impaired vascular and hematopoietic regeneration after BM
      transplantation. Gene expression analyses indicated that granulocytes are the
      main source of the cytokine TNFalpha, whereas its receptor TNFR1 is selectively
      upregulated in regenerating blood vessels. In adoptive transfer experiments, wild
      type, but not Tnfa(-/-), granulocytes induced vascular recovery, and wild-type
      granulocyte transfer did not prevent death or promote vascular regeneration in
      Tnfr1(-/-); Tnfr2(-/-) mice. Thus, by delivering TNFalpha to endothelial cells,
      granulocytes promote blood vessel growth and hematopoietic regeneration.
      Manipulation of the cross-talk between granulocytes and endothelial cells may
      lead to new therapeutic approaches to improve blood vessel regeneration and
      increase survival and hematopoietic recovery after HSC transplantation.

      drug screening.
PG  - 1424-1435
LID - 10.1038/nm.4438 [doi]
AB  - Human liver cancer research currently lacks in vitro models that can faithfully
      recapitulate the pathophysiology of the original tumor. We recently described a
      novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy 
      liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function 
      and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of
      primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from three of the most common PLC subtypes: 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC)
      tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture,
      gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for
      discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term
      expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate
      that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties
      of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are
      amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the
      identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 as a potential therapeutic agent
      for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical
      utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver
      cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the
      disease.

TI  - Enhancing the precision of genetic lineage tracing using dual recombinases.
PG  - 1488-1498
LID - 10.1038/nm.4437 [doi]
AB  - The Cre-loxP recombination system is the most widely used technology for in vivo 
      tracing of stem or progenitor cell lineages. The precision of this genetic system
      largely depends on the specificity of Cre recombinase expression in targeted stem
      or progenitor cells. However, Cre expression in nontargeted cell types can
      complicate the interpretation of lineage-tracing studies and has caused
      controversy in many previous studies. Here we describe a new genetic lineage
      tracing system that incorporates the Dre-rox recombination system to enhance the 
      precision of conventional Cre-loxP-mediated lineage tracing. The Dre-rox system
      permits rigorous control of Cre-loxP recombination in lineage tracing,
      effectively circumventing potential uncertainty of the cell-type specificity of
      Cre expression. Using this new system we investigated two topics of recent
      debates-the contribution of c-Kit(+) cardiac stem cells to cardiomyocytes in the 
      heart and the contribution of Sox9(+) hepatic progenitor cells to hepatocytes in 
      the liver. By overcoming the technical hurdle of nonspecific Cre-loxP-mediated
      recombination, this new technology provides more precise analysis of cell lineage
      and fate decisions and facilitates the in vivo study of stem and progenitor cell 
      plasticity in disease and regeneration.

      (SERCA2b) and ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2). Inhibition of SERCA2b impairs
      UCP1-independent beige fat thermogenesis in humans and mice as well as in pigs, a
      species that lacks a functional UCP1 protein. Conversely, enhanced Ca(2+) cycling
      by activation of alpha1- and/or beta3-adrenergic receptors or the SERCA2b-RyR2
      pathway stimulates UCP1-independent thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. In the
      absence of UCP1, beige fat dynamically expends glucose through enhanced
      glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity for
      ATP-dependent thermogenesis through the SERCA2b pathway; beige fat thereby
      functions as a 'glucose sink' and improves glucose tolerance independently of
      body weight loss. Our study uncovers a noncanonical thermogenic mechanism through
      which beige fat controls whole-body energy homeostasis via Ca(2+) cycling.

PG  - 1416-1423
LID - 10.1038/nm.4444 [doi]
AB  - Mature T cell cancers are typically aggressive, treatment resistant and
      associated with poor prognosis. Clinical application of immunotherapeutic
      approaches has been limited by a lack of target antigens that discriminate
      malignant from healthy (normal) T cells. Unlike B cell depletion, pan-T cell
      aplasia is prohibitively toxic. We report a new targeting strategy based on the
      mutually exclusive expression of T cell receptor beta-chain constant domains 1
      and 2 (TRBC1 and TRBC2). We identify an antibody with unique TRBC1 specificity
      and use it to demonstrate that normal and virus-specific T cell populations
      contain both TRBC1(+) and TRBC2(+) compartments, whereas malignancies are
      restricted to only one. As proof of concept for anti-TRBC immunotherapy, we
      developed anti-TRBC1 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which recognized
      and killed normal and malignant TRBC1(+), but not TRBC2(+), T cells in vitro and 
      in a disseminated mouse model of leukemia. Unlike nonselective approaches
      targeting the entire T cell population, TRBC-targeted immunotherapy could
      eradicate a T cell malignancy while preserving sufficient normal T cells to
      maintain cellular immunity.

TI  - Selective neuronal lapses precede human cognitive lapses following sleep
      deprivation.
PG  - 1474-1480
LID - 10.1038/nm.4433 [doi]
AB  - Sleep deprivation is a major source of morbidity with widespread health effects, 
      including increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart attack, and
      stroke. Moreover, sleep deprivation brings about vehicle accidents and medical
      errors and is therefore an urgent topic of investigation. During sleep
      deprivation, homeostatic and circadian processes interact to build up sleep
      pressure, which results in slow behavioral performance (cognitive lapses)
      typically attributed to attentional thalamic and frontoparietal circuits, but the
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, through study of
      electroencephalograms (EEGs) in humans and local field potentials (LFPs) in
      nonhuman primates and rodents it was found that, during sleep deprivation,
      regional 'sleep-like' slow and theta (slow/theta) waves co-occur with impaired
      behavioral performance during wakefulness. Here we used intracranial electrodes
      to record single-neuron activities and LFPs in human neurosurgical patients
      performing a face/nonface categorization psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) over
      multiple experimental sessions, including a session after full-night sleep
      deprivation. We find that, just before cognitive lapses, the selective spiking
      responses of individual neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are attenuated,
      delayed, and lengthened. These 'neuronal lapses' are evident on a trial-by-trial 
      basis when comparing the slowest behavioral PVT reaction times to the fastest.
      Furthermore, during cognitive lapses, LFPs exhibit a relative local increase in
      slow/theta activity that is correlated with degraded single-neuron responses and 
      with baseline theta activity. Our results show that cognitive lapses involve
      local state-dependent changes in neuronal activity already present in the MTL.

TI  - IRF3 and type I interferons fuel a fatal response to myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1481-1487
LID - 10.1038/nm.4428 [doi]
AB  - Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and type I interferons (IFNs) protect
      against infections and cancer, but excessive IRF3 activation and type I IFN
      production cause autoinflammatory conditions such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
      and STING-associated vasculopathy of infancy (SAVI). Myocardial infarction (MI)
      elicits inflammation, but the dominant molecular drivers of MI-associated
      inflammation remain unclear. Here we show that ischemic cell death and uptake of 
      cell debris by macrophages in the heart fuel a fatal response to MI by activating
      IRF3 and type I IFN production. In mice, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 4,215
      leukocytes isolated from infarcted and non-infarcted hearts showed that MI
      provokes activation of an IRF3-interferon axis in a distinct population of
      interferon-inducible cells (IFNICs) that were classified as cardiac macrophages. 
      Mice genetically deficient in cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), its adaptor STING, 
      IRF3, or the type I IFN receptor IFNAR exhibited impaired interferon-stimulated
      gene (ISG) expression and, in the case of mice deficient in IRF3 or IFNAR,
      improved survival after MI as compared to controls. Interruption of
      IRF3-dependent signaling resulted in decreased cardiac expression of inflammatory
      cytokines and chemokines and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration of the
      heart, as well as in attenuated ventricular dilation and improved cardiac
      function. Similarly, treatment of mice with an IFNAR-neutralizing antibody after 
      MI ablated the interferon response and improved left ventricular dysfunction and 
      survival. These results identify IRF3 and the type I IFN response as a potential 
      therapeutic target for post-MI cardioprotection.

TI  - The activated conformation of integrin beta7 is a novel multiple myeloma-specific
      target for CAR T cell therapy.
PG  - 1436-1443

AB  - Cancer-specific cell-surface antigens are ideal targets for monoclonal antibody
      (mAb)-based immunotherapy but are likely to have previously been identified in
      transcriptome or proteome analyses. Here, we show that the active conformer of an
      integrin can serve as a specific therapeutic target for multiple myeloma (MM). We
      screened >10,000 anti-MM mAb clones and identified MMG49 as an MM-specific mAb
      specifically recognizing a subset of integrin beta7 molecules. The MMG49 epitope,
      in the N-terminal region of the beta7 chain, is predicted to be inaccessible in
      the resting integrin conformer but exposed in the active conformation. Elevated
      expression and constitutive activation of integrin beta7 conferred high MMG49
      reactivity on MM cells, whereas MMG49 binding was scarcely detectable in other
      cell types including normal integrin beta7(+) lymphocytes. T cells transduced
      with MMG49-derived chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) exerted anti-MM effects
      without damaging normal hematopoietic cells. Thus, MMG49 CAR T cell therapy is
      promising for MM, and a receptor protein with a rare but physiologically relevant
      conformation can serve as a cancer immunotherapy target.

TI  - A microRNA screen reveals that elevated hepatic ectodysplasin A expression
      contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
PG  - 1466-1473
LID - 10.1038/nm.4420 [doi]
AB  - Over 40% of microRNAs (miRNAs) are located in introns of protein-coding genes,
      and many of these intronic miRNAs are co-regulated with their host genes. In such
      cases of co-regulation, the products of host genes and their intronic miRNAs can 
      cooperate to coordinately regulate biologically important pathways. Therefore, we
      screened intronic miRNAs dysregulated in the livers of mouse models of obesity to
      identify previously uncharacterized protein-coding host genes that may contribute
      to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Our approach revealed that expression of both the gene encoding
      ectodysplasin A (Eda), the causal gene in X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal
      dysplasia (XLHED), and its intronic miRNA, miR-676, was increased in the livers
      of obese mice. Moreover, hepatic EDA expression is increased in obese human
      subjects and reduced upon weight loss, and its hepatic expression correlates with
      systemic insulin resistance. We also found that reducing miR-676 expression in
      db/db mice increases the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation 
      and reduces the expression of inflammatory signaling components in the liver.
      Further, we found that Eda expression in mouse liver is controlled via PPARgamma 
      and RXR-alpha, increases in circulation under conditions of obesity, and promotes
      JNK activation and inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS1 in skeletal muscle. 
      In accordance with these findings, gain- and loss-of-function approaches reveal
      that liver-derived EDA regulates systemic glucose metabolism, suggesting that EDA
      is a hepatokine that can contribute to impaired skeletal muscle insulin
      sensitivity in obesity.

TI  - Asprosin is a centrally acting orexigenic hormone.
PG  - 1444-1453
LID - 10.1038/nm.4432 [doi]
AB  - Asprosin is a recently discovered fasting-induced hormone that promotes hepatic
      glucose production. Here we demonstrate that asprosin in the circulation crosses 
      the blood-brain barrier and directly activates orexigenic AgRP(+) neurons via a
      cAMP-dependent pathway. This signaling results in inhibition of downstream
      anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-positive neurons in a GABA-dependent
      manner, which then leads to appetite stimulation and a drive to accumulate
      adiposity and body weight. In humans, a genetic deficiency in asprosin causes a
      syndrome characterized by low appetite and extreme leanness; this is phenocopied 
      by mice carrying similar mutations and can be fully rescued by asprosin.
      Furthermore, we found that obese humans and mice had pathologically elevated
      concentrations of circulating asprosin, and neutralization of asprosin in the
      blood with a monoclonal antibody reduced appetite and body weight in obese mice, 
      in addition to improving their glycemic profile. Thus, in addition to performing 
      a glucogenic function, asprosin is a centrally acting orexigenic hormone that is 
      a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of both obesity and diabetes.

TI  - ADAM10-mediated ephrin-B2 shedding promotes myofibroblast activation and organ
      fibrosis.
PG  - 1405-1415
LID - 10.1038/nm.4419 [doi]
AB  - Maladaptive wound healing responses to chronic tissue injury result in organ
      fibrosis. Fibrosis, which entails excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition
      and tissue remodeling by activated myofibroblasts, leads to loss of proper tissue
      architecture and organ function; however, the molecular mediators of
      myofibroblast activation have yet to be fully identified. Here we identify
      soluble ephrin-B2 (sEphrin-B2) as a new profibrotic mediator in lung and skin
      fibrosis. We provide molecular, functional and translational evidence that the
      ectodomain of membrane-bound ephrin-B2 is shed from fibroblasts into the alveolar
      airspace after lung injury. Shedding of sEphrin-B2 promotes fibroblast chemotaxis
      and activation via EphB3 and/or EphB4 receptor signaling. We found that mice
      lacking ephrin-B2 in fibroblasts are protected from skin and lung fibrosis and
      that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is the major ephrin-B2
      sheddase in fibroblasts. ADAM10 expression is increased by transforming growth
      factor (TGF)-beta1, and ADAM10-mediated sEphrin-B2 generation is required for
      TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblast activation. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 
      reduces sEphrin-B2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and prevents lung fibrosis in
      mice. Consistent with the mouse data, ADAM10-sEphrin-B2 signaling is upregulated 
      in fibroblasts from human subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These
      results uncover a new molecular mechanism of tissue fibrogenesis and identify
      sEphrin-B2, its receptors EphB3 and EphB4 and ADAM10 as potential therapeutic
      targets in the treatment of fibrotic diseases.

TI  - Barrier-tissue macrophages: functional adaptation to environmental challenges.
PG  - 1258-1270
LID - 10.1038/nm.4430 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages are found throughout the body, where they have crucial roles in
      tissue development, homeostasis and remodeling, as well as being sentinels of the
      innate immune system that can contribute to protective immunity and inflammation.
      Barrier tissues, such as the intestine, lung, skin and liver, are exposed
      constantly to the outside world, which places special demands on resident cell
      populations such as macrophages. Here we review the mounting evidence that
      although macrophages in different barrier tissues may be derived from distinct
      progenitors, their highly specific properties are shaped by the local
      environment, which allows them to adapt precisely to the needs of their
      anatomical niche. We discuss the properties of macrophages in steady-state
      barrier tissues, outline the factors that shape their differentiation and
      behavior and describe how macrophages change during protective immunity and
      inflammation.

TI  - lncRNA MIR100HG-derived miR-100 and miR-125b mediate cetuximab resistance via
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
PG  - 1331-1341
LID - 10.1038/nm.4424 [doi]
AB  - De novo and acquired resistance, which are largely attributed to genetic
      alterations, are barriers to effective anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor
      (EGFR) therapy. To generate cetuximab-resistant cells, we exposed
      cetuximab-sensitive colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab in three-dimensional
      culture. Using whole-exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we found
      that the long non-coding RNA MIR100HG and two embedded microRNAs, miR-100 and
      miR-125b, were overexpressed in the absence of known genetic events linked to
      cetuximab resistance. MIR100HG, miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression was also
      observed in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell
      cancer cell lines and in tumors from colorectal cancer patients that progressed
      on cetuximab. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately repressed five Wnt/beta-catenin
      negative regulators, resulting in increased Wnt signaling, and Wnt inhibition in 
      cetuximab-resistant cells restored cetuximab responsiveness. Our results describe
      a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the transcription factor
      GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this repression is relieved by
      miR-125b targeting of GATA6. These findings identify a clinically actionable,
      epigenetic cause of cetuximab resistance.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells play an essential role in antiviral immunity, but
      knowledge of their function in secondary lymphoid organs is incomplete. Lymph
      node follicles constitute a major viral reservoir during infections with HIV-1
      and simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac). In contrast, during
      nonpathogenic infection with SIV from African green monkeys (SIVagm), follicles
      remain generally virus free. We show that NK cells in secondary lymphoid organs
      from chronically SIVagm-infected African green monkeys (AGMs) were frequently
      CXCR5(+) and entered and persisted in lymph node follicles throughout the
      follow-up (240 d post-infection). These follicles were strongly positive for
      IL-15, which was primarily presented in its membrane-bound form by follicular
      dendritic cells. NK cell depletion through treatment with anti-IL-15 monoclonal
      antibody during chronic SIVagm infection resulted in high viral replication rates
      in follicles and the T cell zone and increased viral DNA in lymph nodes. Our data
      suggest that, in nonpathogenic SIV infection, NK cells migrate into follicles and
      play a major role in viral reservoir control in lymph nodes.

TI  - Epigenetic suppression of hippocampal calbindin-D28k by DeltaFosB drives
      seizure-related cognitive deficits.
PG  - 1377-1383
LID - 10.1038/nm.4413 [doi]
AB  - The calcium-binding protein calbindin-D28k is critical for hippocampal function
      and cognition, but its expression is markedly decreased in various neurological
      disorders associated with epileptiform activity and seizures. In Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) and epilepsy, both of which are accompanied by recurrent seizures,
      the severity of cognitive deficits reflects the degree of calbindin reduction in 
      the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, despite the importance of calbindin 
      in both neuronal physiology and pathology, the regulatory mechanisms that control
      its expression in the hippocampus are poorly understood. Here we report an
      epigenetic mechanism through which seizures chronically suppress hippocampal
      calbindin expression and impair cognition. We demonstrate that DeltaFosB, a
      highly stable transcription factor, is induced in the hippocampus in mouse models
      of AD and seizures, in which it binds and triggers histone deacetylation at the
      promoter of the calbindin gene (Calb1) and downregulates Calb1 transcription.
      Notably, increasing DG calbindin levels, either by direct virus-mediated
      expression or inhibition of DeltaFosB signaling, improves spatial memory in a
      mouse model of AD. Moreover, levels of DeltaFosB and calbindin expression are
      inversely related in the DG of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or
      AD and correlate with performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We
      propose that chronic suppression of calbindin by DeltaFosB is one mechanism
      through which intermittent seizures drive persistent cognitive deficits in
      conditions accompanied by recurrent seizures.

TI  - Activation of intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha during obesity
      contributes to hepatic steatosis.
PG  - 1298-1308
LID - 10.1038/nm.4412 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is becoming the most common chronic liver
      disease in Western countries, and limited therapeutic options are available. Here
      we uncovered a role for intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in hepatic
      steatosis. Human-intestine biopsies from individuals with or without obesity
      revealed that intestinal HIF-2alpha signaling was positively correlated with
      body-mass index and hepatic toxicity. The causality of this correlation was
      verified in mice with an intestine-specific disruption of Hif2a, in which
      high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis and obesity were substantially lower as
      compared to control mice. PT2385, a HIF-2alpha-specific inhibitor, had preventive
      and therapeutic effects on metabolic disorders that were dependent on intestine
      HIF-2alpha. Intestine HIF-2alpha inhibition markedly reduced intestine and serum 
      ceramide levels. Mechanistically, intestine HIF-2alpha regulates ceramide
      metabolism mainly from the salvage pathway, by positively regulating the
      expression of Neu3, the gene encoding neuraminidase 3. These results suggest that
      intestinal HIF-2alpha could be a viable target for hepatic steatosis therapy.

TI  - Targeting glioma stem cells through combined BMI1 and EZH2 inhibition.
PG  - 1352-1361
LID - 10.1038/nm.4415 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastomas are lethal cancers defined by angiogenesis and pseudopalisading
      necrosis. Here, we demonstrate that these histological features are associated
      with distinct transcriptional programs, with vascular regions showing a proneural
      profile, and hypoxic regions showing a mesenchymal pattern. As these regions
      harbor glioma stem cells (GSCs), we investigated the epigenetic regulation of
      these two niches. Proneural, perivascular GSCs activated EZH2, whereas
      mesenchymal GSCs in hypoxic regions expressed BMI1 protein, which promoted
      cellular survival under stress due to downregulation of the E3 ligase RNF144A.
      Using both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition, we found that proneural GSCs are
      preferentially sensitive to EZH2 disruption, whereas mesenchymal GSCs are more
      sensitive to BMI1 inhibition. Given that glioblastomas contain both proneural and
      mesenchymal GSCs, combined EZH2 and BMI1 targeting proved more effective than
      either agent alone both in culture and in vivo, suggesting that strategies that
      simultaneously target multiple epigenetic regulators within glioblastomas may be 
      effective in overcoming therapy resistance caused by intratumoral heterogeneity.

AB  - Cross-talk among oncogenic signaling and metabolic pathways may create
      opportunities for new therapeutic strategies in cancer. Here we show that
      although acute inhibition of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism induces only minimal 
      cell death, it lowers the apoptotic threshold in a subset of patient-derived
      glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that after attenuated
      glucose consumption, Bcl-xL blocks cytoplasmic p53 from triggering intrinsic
      apoptosis. Consequently, targeting of EGFR-driven glucose metabolism in
      combination with pharmacological stabilization of p53 with the brain-penetrant
      small molecule idasanutlin resulted in synthetic lethality in orthotopic
      glioblastoma xenograft models. Notably, neither the degree of EGFR-signaling
      inhibition nor genetic analysis of EGFR was sufficient to predict sensitivity to 
      this therapeutic combination. However, detection of rapid inhibitory effects on
      [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, assessed through noninvasive positron emission 
      tomography, was an effective predictive biomarker of response in vivo. Together, 
      these studies identify a crucial link among oncogene signaling, glucose
      metabolism, and cytoplasmic p53, which may potentially be exploited for

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acid epoxides are autocrine mediators that control the magnitude of
      IgE-mediated mast cell activation.
PG  - 1287-1297
LID - 10.1038/nm.4417 [doi]
AB  - Critical to the function of mast cells in immune responses including allergy is
      their production of lipid mediators, among which only omega-6 (omega-6)
      arachidonate-derived eicosanoids have been well characterized. Here, by employing
      comprehensive lipidomics, we identify omega-3 (omega-3) fatty acid epoxides as
      new mast cell-derived lipid mediators and show that they are produced by PAF-AH2,
      an oxidized-phospholipid-selective phospholipase A2. Genetic or pharmacological
      deletion of PAF-AH2 reduced the steady-state production of omega-3 epoxides,
      leading to attenuated mast cell activation and anaphylaxis following
      FcvarepsilonRI cross-linking. Mechanistically, the omega-3 epoxides promote
      IgE-mediated activation of mast cells by downregulating Srcin1, a Src-inhibitory 
      protein that counteracts FcvarepsilonRI signaling, through a pathway involving
      PPARg. Thus, the PAF-AH2-omega-3 epoxide-Srcin1 axis presents new potential drug 
      targets for allergic diseases.

TI  - Sympathetic neuron-associated macrophages contribute to obesity by importing and 
      metabolizing norepinephrine.
PG  - 1309-1318
LID - 10.1038/nm.4422 [doi]
AB  - The cellular mechanism(s) linking macrophages to norepinephrine (NE)-mediated
      regulation of thermogenesis have been a topic of debate. Here we identify
      sympathetic neuron-associated macrophages (SAMs) as a population of cells that
      mediate clearance of NE via expression of solute carrier family 6 member 2
      (SLC6A2), an NE transporter, and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a degradation
      enzyme. Optogenetic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
      upregulates NE uptake by SAMs and shifts the SAM profile to a more
      proinflammatory state. NE uptake by SAMs is prevented by genetic deletion of
      Slc6a2 or inhibition of the encoded transporter. We also observed an increased
      proportion of SAMs in the SNS of two mouse models of obesity. Genetic ablation of
      Slc6a2 in SAMs increases brown adipose tissue (BAT) content, causes browning of
      white fat, increases thermogenesis, and leads to substantial and sustained weight
      loss in obese mice. We further show that this pathway is conserved, as human
      sympathetic ganglia also contain SAMs expressing the analogous molecular
      machinery for NE clearance, which thus constitutes a potential target for obesity
      treatment.

TI  - Defining total-body AIDS-virus burden with implications for curative strategies.
PG  - 1271-1276
LID - 10.1038/nm.4411 [doi]
AB  - In the quest for a functional cure or the eradication of HIV infection, it is
      necessary to know the sizes of the reservoirs from which infection rebounds after
      treatment interruption. Thus, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in tissues
      of infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected
      humans. Before antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs contained >98% of the SIV RNA(+)
      and DNA(+) cells. With ART, the numbers of virus (v) RNA+ cells substantially
      decreased but remained detectable, and their persistence was associated with
      relatively lower drug concentrations in LT than in peripheral blood. Prolonged
      ART also decreased the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA(+) cells, but the estimated
      size of the residual tissue burden of 10(8) vDNA(+) cells potentially containing 
      replication-competent proviruses, along with evidence of continuing virus
      production in LT despite ART, indicated two important sources for rebound
      following treatment interruption. The large sizes of these tissue reservoirs
      underscore challenges in developing 'HIV cure' strategies targeting multiple
      sources of virus production.

TI  - Keap1 loss promotes Kras-driven lung cancer and results in dependence on
      glutaminolysis.
PG  - 1362-1368
LID - 10.1038/nm.4407 [doi]
AB  - Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in
      cancer treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the
      KRAS oncoprotein. One approach to addressing this challenge is to define
      mutations that frequently co-occur with those in KRAS, which themselves may lead 
      to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD
      tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene encoding Kelch-like
      ECH-associated protein 1 (refs. 2, 3, 4), a negative regulator of nuclear factor 
      erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional 
      regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. The high frequency of mutations
      in KEAP1 suggests an important role for the oxidative stress response in lung
      tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach in a mouse model of KRAS-driven
      LUAD, we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer progression. We show
      that loss of Keap1 hyperactivates NRF2 and promotes KRAS-driven LUAD in mice.
      Through a combination of CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic
      analyses, we show that Keap1- or Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased
      glutaminolysis, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through the
      pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we provide a rationale for
      stratification of human patients with lung cancer harboring KRAS/KEAP1- or
      KRAS/NRF2-mutant lung tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition.

TI  - Chromosome 1q21.3 amplification is a trackable biomarker and actionable target
      for breast cancer recurrence.
PG  - 1319-1330

AB  - Tumor recurrence remains the main reason for breast cancer-associated mortality, 
      and there are unmet clinical demands for the discovery of new biomarkers and
      development of treatment solutions to benefit patients with breast cancer at high
      risk of recurrence. Here we report the identification of chromosomal copy-number 
      amplification at 1q21.3 that is enriched in subpopulations of breast cancer cells
      bearing characteristics of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and that strongly
      associates with breast cancer recurrence. Amplification is present in
      approximately 10-30% of primary tumors but in more than 70% of recurrent tumors, 
      regardless of breast cancer subtype. Detection of amplification in cell-free DNA 
      (cfDNA) from blood is strongly associated with early relapse in patients with
      breast cancer and could also be used to track the emergence of tumor resistance
      to chemotherapy. We further show that 1q21.3-encoded S100 calcium-binding protein
      (S100A) family members, mainly S100A7, S100A8, and S100A9 (S100A7/8/9), and IL-1 
      receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) establish a reciprocal feedback loop driving
      tumorsphere growth. Notably, this functional circuitry can be disrupted by the
      small-molecule kinase inhibitor pacritinib, leading to preferential impairment of
      the growth of 1q21.3-amplified breast tumors. Our study uncovers the
      1q21.3-directed S100A7/8/9-IRAK1 feedback loop as a crucial component of breast
      cancer recurrence, serving as both a trackable biomarker and an actionable
      therapeutic target for breast cancer.

TI  - The N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)-forming enzyme METTL3 controls myeloid
      differentiation of normal hematopoietic and leukemia cells.
PG  - 1369-1376
LID - 10.1038/nm.4416 [doi]
AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an abundant nucleotide modification in mRNA that 
      is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. However, it
      remains unknown whether the m(6)A modification controls the differentiation of
      normal and/or malignant myeloid hematopoietic cells. Here we show that
      shRNA-mediated depletion of the m(6)A-forming enzyme METTL3 in human
      hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) promotes cell differentiation,
      coupled with reduced cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type 
      METTL3, but not of a catalytically inactive form of METTL3, inhibits cell
      differentiation and increases cell growth. METTL3 mRNA and protein are expressed 
      more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than in healthy HSPCs or
      other types of tumor cells. Furthermore, METTL3 depletion in human myeloid
      leukemia cell lines induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and delays
      leukemia progression in recipient mice in vivo. Single-nucleotide-resolution
      mapping of m(6)A coupled with ribosome profiling reveals that m(6)A promotes the 
      translation of c-MYC, BCL2 and PTEN mRNAs in the human acute myeloid leukemia
      MOLM-13 cell line. Moreover, loss of METTL3 leads to increased levels of
      phosphorylated AKT, which contributes to the differentiation-promoting effects of
      METTL3 depletion. Overall, these results provide a rationale for the therapeutic 
      targeting of METTL3 in myeloid leukemia.

AB  - The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept was proposed four decades ago, and states that
      tumor growth, analogous to the renewal of healthy tissues, is fueled by small
      numbers of dedicated stem cells. It has gradually become clear that many tumors
      harbor CSCs in dedicated niches, and yet their identification and eradication has
      not been as obvious as was initially hoped. Recently developed lineage-tracing
      and cell-ablation strategies have provided insights into CSC plasticity,
      quiescence, renewal, and therapeutic response. Here we discuss new developments
      in the CSC field in relationship to changing insights into how normal stem cells 
      maintain healthy tissues. Expectations in the field have become more realistic,
      and now, the first successes of therapies based on the CSC concept are emerging.

AB  - Human leukemias are liquid malignancies characterized by diffuse infiltration of 
      the bone marrow by transformed hematopoietic progenitors. The accessibility of
      tumor cells obtained from peripheral blood or through bone marrow aspirates,
      together with recent advances in cancer genomics and single-cell molecular
      analysis, have facilitated the study of clonal populations and their genetic and 
      epigenetic evolution over time with unprecedented detail. The results of these
      analyses challenge the classic view of leukemia as a clonal homogeneous diffuse
      tumor and introduce a more complex and dynamic scenario. In this review, we
      present current concepts on the role of clonal evolution in lymphoid and myeloid 
      leukemia as a driver of tumor initiation, disease progression and relapse. We
      also discuss the implications of these concepts in our understanding of the
      evolutionary mechanisms involved in leukemia transformation and therapy
      resistance.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA EGFR-AS1 mediates epidermal growth factor receptor addiction
      and modulates treatment response in squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1167-1175
LID - 10.1038/nm.4401 [doi]
AB  - Targeting EGFR is a validated approach in the treatment of squamous-cell cancers 
      (SCCs), although there are no established biomarkers for predicting response. We 
      have identified a synonymous mutation in EGFR, c.2361G>A (encoding p.Gln787Gln), 
      in two patients with head and neck SCC (HNSCC) who were exceptional responders to
      gefitinib, and we showed in patient-derived cultures that the A/A genotype was
      associated with greater sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as
      compared to the G/A and G/G genotypes. Remarkably, single-copy G>A nucleotide
      editing in isogenic models conferred a 70-fold increase in sensitivity due to
      decreased stability of the EGFR-AS1 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). In the
      appropriate context, sensitivity could be recapitulated through EGFR-AS1
      knockdown in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression was sufficient to induce
      resistance to TKIs. Reduced EGFR-AS1 levels shifted splicing toward EGFR isoform 
      D, leading to ligand-mediated pathway activation. In co-clinical trials involving
      patients and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, tumor shrinkage was most
      pronounced in the context of the A/A genotype for EGFR-Q787Q, low expression of
      EGFR-AS1 and high expression of EGFR isoform D. Our study reveals how a 'silent' 
      mutation influences the levels of a lncRNA, resulting in noncanonical EGFR
      addiction, and delineates a new predictive biomarker suite for response to EGFR
      TKIs.

TI  - Targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation eradicates therapy-resistant
      chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells.
PG  - 1234-1240
LID - 10.1038/nm.4399 [doi]
AB  - Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with imatinib mesylate and other
      second- and/or third-generation c-Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
      has substantially extended patient survival. However, TKIs primarily target
      differentiated cells and do not eliminate leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Therefore, 
      targeting minimal residual disease to prevent acquired resistance and/or disease 
      relapse requires identification of new LSC-selective target(s) that can be
      exploited therapeutically. Considering that malignant transformation involves
      cellular metabolic changes, which may in turn render the transformed cells
      susceptible to specific assaults in a selective manner, we searched for such
      vulnerabilities in CML LSCs. We performed metabolic analyses on both stem
      cell-enriched (CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)) and differentiated (CD34(-)) cells
      derived from individuals with CML, and we compared the signature of these cells
      with that of their normal counterparts. Through combination of stable
      isotope-assisted metabolomics with functional assays, we demonstrate that
      primitive CML cells rely on upregulated oxidative metabolism for their survival. 
      We also show that combination treatment with imatinib and tigecycline, an
      antibiotic that inhibits mitochondrial protein translation, selectively
      eradicates CML LSCs both in vitro and in a xenotransplantation model of human
      CML. Our findings provide a strong rationale for investigation of the use of TKIs
      in combination with tigecycline to treat patients with CML with minimal residual 
      disease.

TI  - KLF4-dependent perivascular cell plasticity mediates pre-metastatic niche
      formation and metastasis.
PG  - 1176-1190
LID - 10.1038/nm.4400 [doi]
AB  - A deeper understanding of the metastatic process is required for the development 
      of new therapies that improve patient survival. Metastatic tumor cell growth and 
      survival in distant organs is facilitated by the formation of a pre-metastatic
      niche that is composed of hematopoietic cells, stromal cells and extracellular
      matrix (ECM). Perivascular cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) 
      and pericytes, are involved in new vessel formation and in promoting stem cell
      maintenance and proliferation. Given the well-described plasticity of
      perivascular cells, we hypothesized that perivascular cells similarly regulate
      tumor cell fate at metastatic sites. We used perivascular-cell-specific and
      pericyte-specific lineage-tracing models to trace the fate of perivascular cells 
      in the pre-metastatic and metastatic microenvironments. We show that perivascular
      cells lose the expression of traditional vSMC and pericyte markers in response to
      tumor-secreted factors and exhibit increased proliferation, migration and ECM
      synthesis. Increased expression of the pluripotency gene Klf4 in these
      phenotypically switched perivascular cells promoted a less differentiated state, 
      characterized by enhanced ECM production, that established a pro-metastatic
      fibronectin-rich environment. Genetic inactivation of Klf4 in perivascular cells 
      decreased formation of a pre-metastatic niche and metastasis. Our data revealed a
      previously unidentified role for perivascular cells in pre-metastatic niche
      formation and uncovered novel strategies for limiting metastasis.

TI  - Biotin tagging of MeCP2 in mice reveals contextual insights into the Rett
      syndrome transcriptome.
PG  - 1203-1214
LID - 10.1038/nm.4406 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurological disorder
      characterized by regressive loss of neurodevelopmental milestones and acquired
      psychomotor deficits. However, the cellular heterogeneity of the brain impedes an
      understanding of how MECP2 mutations contribute to RTT. Here we developed a
      Cre-inducible method for cell-type-specific biotin tagging of MeCP2 in mice.
      Combining this approach with an allelic series of knock-in mice carrying frequent
      RTT-associated mutations (encoding T158M and R106W) enabled the selective
      profiling of RTT-associated nuclear transcriptomes in excitatory and inhibitory
      cortical neurons. We found that most gene-expression changes were largely
      specific to each RTT-associated mutation and cell type. Lowly expressed
      cell-type-enriched genes were preferentially disrupted by MeCP2 mutations, with
      upregulated and downregulated genes reflecting distinct functional categories.
      Subcellular RNA analysis in MeCP2-mutant neurons further revealed reductions in
      the nascent transcription of long genes and uncovered widespread
      post-transcriptional compensation at the cellular level. Finally, we overcame
      X-linked cellular mosaicism in female RTT models and identified distinct
      gene-expression changes between neighboring wild-type and mutant neurons,
      providing contextual insights into RTT etiology that support personalized
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Regulatory T cells impede acute and long-term immunity to blood-stage malaria
      through CTLA-4.
PG  - 1220-1225
LID - 10.1038/nm.4395 [doi]
AB  - Malaria, caused by the protozoan Plasmodium, is a devastating mosquito-borne
      disease with the potential to affect nearly half the world's population. Despite 
      mounting substantial T and B cell responses, humans fail to efficiently control
      blood-stage malaria or develop sterilizing immunity to reinfections. Although
      forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)(+)CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells form a part of these
      responses, their influence remains disputed and their mode of action is unknown. 
      Here we show that Treg cells expand in both humans and mice in blood-stage
      malaria and interfere with conventional T helper cell responses and follicular T 
      helper (TFH)-B cell interactions in germinal centers. Mechanistically, Treg cells
      function in a critical temporal window to impede protective immunity through
      cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4). Targeting Treg cells or
      CTLA-4 in this precise window accelerated parasite clearance and generated
      species-transcending immunity to blood-stage malaria in mice. Our study uncovers 
      a critical mechanism of immunosuppression associated with blood-stage malaria
      that delays parasite clearance and prevents development of potent adaptive
      immunity to reinfection. These data also reveal a temporally discrete and
      potentially therapeutically amenable functional role for Treg cells and CTLA-4 in
      limiting antimalarial immunity.

TI  - A mouse model for embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes uncovers the
      therapeutic potential of Sonic-hedgehog inhibitors.
PG  - 1191-1202
LID - 10.1038/nm.4402 [doi]
AB  - Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs) have recently been described 
      as a new entity of rare pediatric brain tumors with a fatal outcome. We show here
      that ETMRs are characterized by a parallel activation of Shh and Wnt signaling.
      Co-activation of these pathways in mouse neural precursors is sufficient to
      induce ETMR-like tumors in vivo that resemble their human counterparts on the
      basis of histology and global gene-expression analyses, and that point to apical 
      radial glia cells as the possible tumor cell of origin. Overexpression of LIN28A,
      which is a hallmark of human ETMRs, augments Sonic-hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt
      signaling in these precursor cells through the downregulation of let7-miRNA, and 
      LIN28A/let7a interaction with the Shh pathway was detected at the level of Gli
      mRNA. Finally, human ETMR cells that were transplanted into immunocompromised
      host mice were responsive to the SHH inhibitor arsenic trioxide (ATO). Our work
      provides a novel mouse model in which to study this tumor type, demonstrates the 
      driving role of Wnt and Shh activation in the growth of ETMRs and proposes
      downstream inhibition of Shh signaling as a therapeutic option for patients with 
      ETMRs.

TI  - Mutations in ACTRT1 and its enhancer RNA elements lead to aberrant activation of 
      Hedgehog signaling in inherited and sporadic basal cell carcinomas.
PG  - 1226-1233
LID - 10.1038/nm.4368 [doi]
AB  - Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, results from aberrant
      activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Although most cases of BCC are
      sporadic, some forms are inherited, such as Bazex-Dupre-Christol syndrome
      (BDCS)-a cancer-prone genodermatosis with an X-linked, dominant inheritance
      pattern. We have identified mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, which encodes
      actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), in two of the six families with BDCS that were
      examined in this study. High-throughput sequencing in the four remaining families
      identified germline mutations in noncoding sequences surrounding ACTRT1. These
      mutations were located in transcribed sequences encoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)
      and were shown to impair enhancer activity and ACTRT1 expression. ARP-T1 was
      found to directly bind to the GLI1 promoter, thus inhibiting GLI1 expression, and
      loss of ARP-T1 led to activation of the Hedgehog pathway in individuals with
      BDCS. Moreover, exogenous expression of ACTRT1 reduced the in vitro and in vivo
      proliferation rates of cell lines with aberrant activation of the Hedgehog
      signaling pathway. In summary, our study identifies a disease mechanism in BCC
      involving mutations in regulatory noncoding elements and uncovers the
      tumor-suppressor properties of ACTRT1.

TI  - GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and is required for the anti-obesity effects of
      the ligand.
PG  - 1158-1166
LID - 10.1038/nm.4394 [doi]
AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15; also known as MIC-1) is a divergent
      member of the TGF-beta superfamily and is associated with body-weight regulation 
      in humans and rodents. However, the cognate receptor of GDF15 is unknown. Here we
      show that GDF15 binds specifically to GDNF family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL)
      with high affinity, and that GFRAL requires association with the coreceptor RET
      to elicit intracellular signaling in response to GDF15 stimulation. We also found
      that GDF15-mediated reductions in food intake and body weight of mice with
      obesity were abolished in GFRAL-knockout mice. We further found that GFRAL
      expression was limited to hindbrain neurons and not present in peripheral
      tissues, which suggests that GDF15-GFRAL-mediated regulation of food intake is by
      a central mechanism. Lastly, given that GDF15 did not increase energy expenditure
      in treated mice with obesity, the anti-obesity actions of the cytokine are likely
      driven primarily by a reduction in food intake.

TI  - The metabolic effects of GDF15 are mediated by the orphan receptor GFRAL.
PG  - 1215-1219
LID - 10.1038/nm.4393 [doi]
AB  - Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), also known as MIC-1, is a distant
      member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and has been
      implicated in various biological functions, including cancer cachexia, renal and 
      heart failure, atherosclerosis and metabolism. A connection between GDF15 and
      body-weight regulation was initially suggested on the basis of an observation
      that increasing GDF15 levels in serum correlated with weight loss in individuals 
      with advanced prostate cancer. In animal models, overexpression of GDF15 leads to
      a lean phenotype, hypophagia and other improvements in metabolic parameters,
      suggesting that recombinant GDF15 protein could potentially be used in the
      treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the signaling and mechanism of
      action of GDF15 are poorly understood owing to the absence of a clearly
      identified cognate receptor. Here we report that GDNF-family receptor alpha-like 
      (GFRAL), an orphan member of the GFR-alpha family, is a high-affinity receptor
      for GDF15. GFRAL binds to GDF15 in vitro and is required for the metabolic
      actions of GDF15 with respect to body weight and food intake in vivo in mice.
      Gfral(-/-) mice were refractory to the effects of recombinant human GDF15 on
      body-weight, food-intake and glucose parameters. Blocking the interaction between
      GDF15 and GFRAL with a monoclonal antibody prevented the metabolic effects of
      GDF15 in rats. Gfral mRNA is highly expressed in the area postrema of mouse, rat 
      and monkey, in accordance with previous reports implicating this region of the
      brain in the metabolic actions of GDF15 (refs. 4,5,6). Together, our data
      demonstrate that GFRAL is a receptor for GDF15 that mediates the metabolic
      effects of GDF15.

TI  - GFRAL is the receptor for GDF15 and the ligand promotes weight loss in mice and
      nonhuman primates.
PG  - 1150-1157
LID - 10.1038/nm.4392 [doi]
AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the transforming
      growth factor (TGF)-beta family, is a secreted protein that circulates as a
      25-kDa dimer. In humans, elevated GDF15 correlates with weight loss, and the
      administration of GDF15 to mice with obesity reduces body weight, at least in
      part, by decreasing food intake. The mechanisms through which GDF15 reduces body 
      weight remain poorly understood, because the cognate receptor for GDF15 is
      unknown. Here we show that recombinant GDF15 induces weight loss in mice fed a
      high-fat diet and in nonhuman primates with spontaneous obesity. Furthermore, we 
      find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor alpha-like
      (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-beta
      superfamily ligands. Gfral is expressed in neurons of the area postrema and
      nucleus of the solitary tract in mice and humans, and genetic deletion of the
      receptor abrogates the ability of GDF15 to decrease food intake and body weight
      in mice. In addition, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance are exacerbated
      in GFRAL-deficient mice, suggesting a homeostatic role for this receptor in
      metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires
      the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET. Our data identify GFRAL as a
      new regulator of body weight and as the bona fide receptor mediating the
      metabolic effects of GDF15, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of GDF15 as 
      a potential pharmacotherapy for the treatment of obesity.

TI  - Microglia emerge as central players in brain disease.
PG  - 1018-1027
LID - 10.1038/nm.4397 [doi]
AB  - There has been an explosion of new findings recently giving us insights into the 
      involvement of microglia in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. A host of new
      molecular tools and mouse models of disease are increasingly implicating this
      enigmatic type of nervous system cell as a key player in conditions ranging from 
      neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism to neurodegenerative disorders such
      as Alzheimer's disease and chronic pain. Contemporaneously, diverse roles are
      emerging for microglia in the healthy brain, from sculpting developing neuronal
      circuits to guiding learning-associated plasticity. Understanding the
      physiological functions of these cells is crucial to determining their roles in
      disease. Here we focus on recent developments in our rapidly expanding
      understanding of the function, as well as the dysfunction, of microglia in
      disorders of the CNS.

TI  - Functional precision cancer medicine-moving beyond pure genomics.
PG  - 1028-1035
LID - 10.1038/nm.4389 [doi]
AB  - The essential job of precision medicine is to match the right drugs to the right 
      patients. In cancer, precision medicine has been nearly synonymous with genomics.
      However, sobering recent studies have generally shown that most patients with
      cancer who receive genomic testing do not benefit from a genomic precision
      medicine strategy. Although some call the entire project of precision cancer
      medicine into question, I suggest instead that the tools employed must be
      broadened. Instead of relying exclusively on big data measurements of initial
      conditions, we should also acquire highly actionable functional information by
      perturbing-for example, with cancer therapies-viable primary tumor cells from
      patients with cancer.

TI  - A human APOC3 missense variant and monoclonal antibody accelerate apoC-III
      clearance and lower triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels.
PG  - 1086-1094
LID - 10.1038/nm.4390 [doi]
AB  - Recent large-scale genetic sequencing efforts have identified rare coding
      variants in genes in the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) clearance pathway
      that are protective against coronary heart disease (CHD), independently of LDL
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Insight into the mechanisms of protection of these
      variants may facilitate the development of new therapies for lowering TRL levels.
      The gene APOC3 encodes apoC-III, a critical inhibitor of triglyceride (TG)
      lipolysis and remnant TRL clearance. Here we report a detailed interrogation of
      the mechanism of TRL lowering by the APOC3 Ala43Thr (A43T) variant, the only
      missense (rather than protein-truncating) variant in APOC3 reported to be TG
      lowering and protective against CHD. We found that both human APOC3 A43T
      heterozygotes and mice expressing human APOC3 A43T display markedly reduced
      circulating apoC-III levels. In mice, this reduction is due to impaired binding
      of A43T apoC-III to lipoproteins and accelerated renal catabolism of free
      apoC-III. Moreover, the reduced content of apoC-III in TRLs resulted in
      accelerated clearance of circulating TRLs. On the basis of this protective
      mechanism, we developed a monoclonal antibody targeting lipoprotein-bound human
      apoC-III that promotes circulating apoC-III clearance in mice expressing human
      APOC3 and enhances TRL catabolism in vivo. These data reveal the molecular
      mechanism by which a missense variant in APOC3 causes reduced circulating TG
      levels and, hence, protects from CHD. This protective mechanism has the potential
      to be exploited as a new therapeutic approach to reduce apoC-III levels and
      circulating TRL burden.

TI  - Targeting cellular senescence prevents age-related bone loss in mice.
PG  - 1072-1079
LID - 10.1038/nm.4385 [doi]
AB  - Aging is associated with increased cellular senescence, which is hypothesized to 
      drive the eventual development of multiple comorbidities. Here we investigate a
      role for senescent cells in age-related bone loss through multiple approaches. In
      particular, we used either genetic (i.e., the INK-ATTAC 'suicide' transgene
      encoding an inducible caspase 8 expressed specifically in senescent cells) or
      pharmacological (i.e., 'senolytic' compounds) means to eliminate senescent cells.
      We also inhibited the production of the proinflammatory secretome of senescent
      cells using a JAK inhibitor (JAKi). In aged (20- to 22-month-old) mice with
      established bone loss, activation of the INK-ATTAC caspase 8 in senescent cells
      or treatment with senolytics or the JAKi for 2-4 months resulted in higher bone
      mass and strength and better bone microarchitecture than in vehicle-treated mice.
      The beneficial effects of targeting senescent cells were due to lower bone
      resorption with either maintained (trabecular) or higher (cortical) bone
      formation as compared to vehicle-treated mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that
      senescent-cell conditioned medium impaired osteoblast mineralization and enhanced
      osteoclast-progenitor survival, leading to increased osteoclastogenesis.
      Collectively, these data establish a causal role for senescent cells in bone loss
      with aging, and demonstrate that targeting these cells has both anti-resorptive
      and anabolic effects on bone. Given that eliminating senescent cells and/or
      inhibiting their proinflammatory secretome also improves cardiovascular function,
      enhances insulin sensitivity, and reduces frailty, targeting this fundamental
      mechanism to prevent age-related bone loss suggests a novel treatment strategy
      not only for osteoporosis, but also for multiple age-related comorbidities.

TI  - Sex-specific transcriptional signatures in human depression.
PG  - 1102-1111
LID - 10.1038/nm.4386 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide.
      While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of MDD all point toward major sex
      differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain
      largely unknown. Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression
      network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female 
      transcriptional profiles associated with MDD across six brain regions. We overlap
      our human profiles with those from a mouse model, chronic variable stress, and
      capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological
      mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and
      females. Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in
      MDD, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in both
      depressed humans and stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific
      gene networks underlying MDD and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators
      of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub 
      gene Dusp6 in mouse prefrontal cortex mimicked stress susceptibility in females, 
      but not males, by increasing ERK signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability.
      Such Dusp6 downregulation also recapitulated the transcriptional remodeling that 
      occurs in prefrontal cortex of depressed females. Together our findings reveal
      marked sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in MDD and highlight the
      importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder.

TI  - Intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer is mediated by
      BET protein stabilization and AKT-mTORC1 activation.
PG  - 1055-1062
LID - 10.1038/nm.4379 [doi]
AB  - Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein inhibitors are emerging as
      promising anticancer therapies. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase
      substrate-binding adaptor speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) is the most frequently 
      mutated in primary prostate cancer. Here we demonstrate that wild-type SPOP binds
      to and induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BET proteins (BRD2, 
      BRD3 and BRD4) by recognizing a degron motif common among them. In contrast,
      prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants show impaired binding to BET proteins,
      resulting in decreased proteasomal degradation and accumulation of these proteins
      in prostate cancer cell lines and patient specimens and causing resistance to BET
      inhibitors. Transcriptome and BRD4 cistrome analyses reveal enhanced expression
      of the GTPase RAC1 and cholesterol-biosynthesis-associated genes together with
      activation of AKT-mTORC1 signaling as a consequence of BRD4 stabilization. Our
      data show that resistance to BET inhibitors in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer can be
      overcome by combination with AKT inhibitors and further support the evaluation of
      SPOP mutations as biomarkers to guide BET-inhibitor-oriented therapy in patients 
      with prostate cancer.

TI  - Opposing effects of cancer-type-specific SPOP mutants on BET protein degradation 
      and sensitivity to BET inhibitors.
PG  - 1046-1054
LID - 10.1038/nm.4372 [doi]
AB  - It is generally assumed that recurrent mutations within a given cancer driver
      gene elicit similar drug responses. Cancer genome studies have identified
      recurrent but divergent missense mutations affecting the substrate-recognition
      domain of the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in endometrial and prostate cancers. 
      The therapeutic implications of these mutations remain incompletely understood.
      Here we analyzed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by endometrial
      cancer-associated SPOP mutations and identified BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins
      (BETs) as SPOP-CUL3 substrates that are preferentially degraded by endometrial
      cancer-associated SPOP mutants. The resulting reduction of BET protein levels
      sensitized cancer cells to BET inhibitors. Conversely, prostate cancer-specific
      SPOP mutations resulted in impaired degradation of BETs, promoting their
      resistance to pharmacologic inhibition. These results uncover an oncogenomics
      paradox, whereby mutations mapping to the same domain evoke opposing drug
      susceptibilities. Specifically, we provide a molecular rationale for the use of
      BET inhibitors to treat patients with endometrial but not prostate cancer who
      harbor SPOP mutations.

TI  - Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors
      through stabilization of BRD4.
PG  - 1063-1071
LID - 10.1038/nm.4378 [doi]
AB  - The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins comprises four
      members-BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and the testis-specific isoform BRDT-that largely
      function as transcriptional coactivators and play critical roles in various
      cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion. 
      BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating
      the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the
      transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate
      cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are
      clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being
      pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients
      with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and
      I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical
      trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical 
      models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely
      unknown. Here we report that cullin-3(SPOP) earmarks BET proteins, including
      BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically,
      prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the
      degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant
      prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived
      from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to
      BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results
      elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts
      as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular
      mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer
      bearing SPOP mutations.

TI  - The eukaryotic gut virome in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: new clues
      in enteric graft-versus-host disease.
PG  - 1080-1085
LID - 10.1038/nm.4380 [doi]
AB  - Much attention has been focused on the role of the bacterial microbiome in human 
      health, but the virome is understudied. Although previously investigated in
      individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases or solid-organ transplants, virome
      dynamics in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enteric
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain unexplored. Here we characterize the
      longitudinal gut virome in 44 recipients of HSCT using metagenomics. A viral
      'bloom' was identified, and significant increases were demonstrated in the
      overall proportion of vertebrate viral sequences following transplantation (P =
      0.02). Increases in both the rates of detection (P < 0.0001) and number of
      sequences (P = 0.047) of persistent DNA viruses (anelloviruses, herpesviruses,
      papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses) over time were observed in individuals with 
      enteric GVHD relative to those without, a finding accompanied by a reduced phage 
      richness (P = 0.01). Picobirnaviruses were detected in 18 individuals (40.9%),
      more frequently before or within a week after transplant than at later time
      points (P = 0.008). In a time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards model,
      picobirnaviruses were predictive of the occurrence of severe enteric GVHD (hazard
      ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46-4.86; P = 0.001), and correlated
      with higher fecal levels of two GVHD severity markers, calprotectin and
      alpha1-antitrypsin. These results reveal a progressive expansion of vertebrate
      viral infections over time following HSCT, and they suggest an unexpected
      association of picobirnaviruses with early post-transplant GVHD.

TI  - D-mannose induces regulatory T cells and suppresses immunopathology.
PG  - 1036-1045
LID - 10.1038/nm.4375 [doi]
AB  - D-mannose, a C-2 epimer of glucose, exists naturally in many plants and fruits,
      and is found in human blood at concentrations less than one-fiftieth of that of
      glucose. However, although the roles of glucose in T cell metabolism, diabetes
      and obesity are well characterized, the function of D-mannose in T cell immune
      responses remains unknown. Here we show that supraphysiological levels of
      D-mannose safely achievable by drinking-water supplementation suppressed
      immunopathology in mouse models of autoimmune diabetes and airway inflammation,
      and increased the proportion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in mice.
      In vitro, D-mannose stimulated Treg cell differentiation in human and mouse cells
      by promoting TGF-beta activation, which in turn was mediated by upregulation of
      integrin alphavbeta8 and reactive oxygen species generated by increased fatty
      acid oxidation. This previously unrecognized immunoregulatory function of
      D-mannose may have clinical applications for immunopathology.

TI  - Implications of human genetic variation in CRISPR-based therapeutic genome
      editing.
PG  - 1095-1101
LID - 10.1038/nm.4377 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas genome-editing methods hold immense potential as therapeutic tools to 
      fix disease-causing mutations at the level of DNA. In contrast to typical drug
      development strategies aimed at targets that are highly conserved among
      individual patients, treatment at the genomic level must contend with substantial
      inter-individual natural genetic variation. Here we analyze the recently released
      ExAC and 1000 Genomes data sets to determine how human genetic variation impacts 
      target choice for Cas endonucleases in the context of therapeutic genome editing.
      We find that this genetic variation confounds the target sites of certain Cas
      endonucleases more than others, and we provide a compendium of guide RNAs
      predicted to have high efficacy in diverse patient populations. For further
      analysis, we focus on 12 therapeutically relevant genes and consider how genetic 
      variation affects off-target candidates for these loci. Our analysis suggests
      that, in large populations of individuals, most candidate off-target sites will
      be rare, underscoring the need for prescreening of patients through whole-genome 
      sequencing to ensure safety. This information can be integrated with empirical
      methods for guide RNA selection into a framework for designing CRISPR-based
      therapeutics that maximizes efficacy and safety across patient populations.

      the clinic.
PG  - 917-928
LID - 10.1038/nm.4381 [doi]
AB  - The global adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the
      early 2000s heralded a new era in effectively treating drug-resistant Plasmodium 
      falciparum malaria. However, several Southeast Asian countries have now reported 
      the emergence of parasites that have decreased susceptibility to artemisinin
      (ART) derivatives and ACT partner drugs, resulting in increasing rates of
      treatment failures. Here we review recent advances in understanding how
      antimalarials act and how resistance develops, and discuss new strategies for
      effectively combatting resistance, optimizing treatment and advancing the global 
      campaign to eliminate malaria.

TI  - Resolution of inflammation by interleukin-9-producing type 2 innate lymphoid
      cells.
PG  - 938-944
LID - 10.1038/nm.4373 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory diseases such as arthritis are chronic conditions that fail to
      resolve spontaneously. While the cytokine and cellular pathways triggering
      arthritis are well defined, those responsible for the resolution of inflammation 
      are incompletely characterized. Here we identified interleukin (IL)-9-producing
      type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as the mediators of a molecular and cellular
      pathway that orchestrates the resolution of chronic inflammation. In mice, the
      absence of IL-9 impaired ILC2 proliferation and activation of regulatory T (Treg)
      cells, and resulted in chronic arthritis with excessive cartilage destruction and
      bone loss. In contrast, treatment with IL-9 promoted ILC2-dependent Treg
      activation and effectively induced resolution of inflammation and protection of
      bone. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission exhibited high numbers of
      IL-9(+) ILC2s in joints and the circulation. Hence, fostering IL-9-mediated ILC2 
      activation may offer a novel therapeutic approach inducing resolution of
      inflammation rather than suppression of inflammatory responses.

PG  - 929-937
LID - 10.1038/nm.4369 [doi]
AB  - The principles that govern the evolution of tumors exposed to targeted therapy
      are poorly understood. Here we modeled the selection and propagation of an
      amplification in the BRAF oncogene (BRAF(amp)) in patient-derived tumor
      xenografts (PDXs) that were treated with a direct inhibitor of the kinase ERK,
      either alone or in combination with other ERK signaling inhibitors. Single-cell
      sequencing and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses mapped the
      emergence of extra-chromosomal amplification in parallel evolutionary
      trajectories that arose in the same tumor shortly after treatment. The
      evolutionary selection of BRAF(amp) was determined by the fitness threshold, the 
      barrier that subclonal populations need to overcome to regain fitness in the
      presence of therapy. This differed for inhibitors of ERK signaling, suggesting
      that sequential monotherapy is ineffective and selects for a progressively higher
      BRAF copy number. Concurrent targeting of the RAF, MEK and ERK kinases, however, 
      imposed a sufficiently high fitness threshold to prevent the propagation of
      subclones with high-level BRAF(amp). When administered on an intermittent
      schedule, this treatment inhibited tumor growth in 11/11 PDXs of lung cancer or
      melanoma without apparent toxicity in mice. Thus, gene amplification can be
      acquired and expanded through parallel evolution, enabling tumors to adapt while 
      maintaining their intratumoral heterogeneity. Treatments that impose the highest 
      fitness threshold will likely prevent the evolution of resistance-causing
      alterations and, thus, merit testing in patients.

      to the unusually large size and multi-exonic nature of genes encoding muscle
      structural proteins. Therapeutic genome editing to correct disease-causing
      splice-site mutations has been accomplished only through the homology-directed
      repair pathway, which is extremely inefficient in postmitotic tissues such as
      skeletal muscle. Here we describe a strategy using nonhomologous end-joining
      (NHEJ) to correct a pathogenic splice-site mutation. As a proof of principle, we 
      focus on congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), which is characterized by
      severe muscle wasting and paralysis. Specifically, we correct a splice-site
      mutation that causes the exclusion of exon 2 from Lama2 mRNA and the truncation
      of Lama2 protein in the dy(2J)/dy(2J) mouse model of MDC1A. Through systemic
      delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying clustered regularly interspaced
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 genome-editing components, we
      simultaneously excise an intronic region containing the mutation and create a
      functional donor splice site through NHEJ. This strategy leads to the inclusion
      of exon 2 in the Lama2 transcript and restoration of full-length Lama2 protein.
      Treated dy(2J)/dy(2J) mice display substantial improvement in muscle
      histopathology and function without signs of paralysis.

AB  - Previous studies have reported associations of IFITM3 SNP rs12252 with severe
      influenza, but evidence of association and the mechanism by which risk is
      conferred remain controversial. We prioritized SNPs in IFITM3 on the basis of
      putative biological function and identified rs34481144 in the 5' UTR. We found
      evidence of a new association of rs34481144 with severe influenza in three
      influenza-infected cohorts characterized by different levels of influenza illness
      severity. We determined a role for rs34481144 as an expression quantitative trait
      locus (eQTL) for IFITM3, with the risk allele associated with lower mRNA
      expression. The risk allele was found to have decreased IRF3 binding and
      increased CTCF binding in promoter-binding assays, and risk allele carriage
      diminished transcriptional correlations among IFITM3-neighboring genes,
      indicative of CTCF boundary activity. Furthermore, the risk allele disrupts a CpG
      site that undergoes differential methylation in CD8(+) T cell subsets. Carriers
      of the risk allele had reduced numbers of CD8(+) T cells in their airways during 
      natural influenza infection, consistent with IFITM3 promoting accumulation of
      CD8(+) T cells in airways and indicating that a critical function for IFITM3 may 
      be to promote immune cell persistence at mucosal sites.Our study identifies a new
      regulator of IFITM3 expression that associates with CD8(+) T cell levels in the
      airways and a spectrum of clinical outcomes.

TI  - Plk1 regulates contraction of postmitotic smooth muscle cells and is required for
      vascular homeostasis.
PG  - 964-974
LID - 10.1038/nm.4364 [doi]
AB  - Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), an essential regulator of cell division, is currently 
      undergoing clinical evaluation as a target for cancer therapy. We report an
      unexpected function of Plk1 in sustaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Plk1
      haploinsufficiency in mice did not induce obvious cell proliferation defects but 
      did result in arterial structural alterations, which frequently led to aortic
      rupture and death. Specific ablation of Plk1 in vascular smooth muscle cells
      (VSMCs) led to reduced arterial elasticity, hypotension, and an impaired arterial
      response to angiotensin II in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that Plk1 regulated
      angiotensin II-dependent activation of RhoA and actomyosin dynamics in VSMCs in a
      mitosis-independent manner. This regulation depended on Plk1 kinase activity, and
      the administration of small-molecule Plk1 inhibitors to angiotensin II-treated
      mice led to reduced arterial fitness and an elevated risk of aneurysm and aortic 
      rupture. We thus conclude that a partial reduction of Plk1 activity that does not
      block cell division can nevertheless impair aortic homeostasis. Our findings have
      potentially important implications for current approaches aimed at PLK1
      inhibition for cancer therapy.

TI  - Inflammation-dependent cerebrospinal fluid hypersecretion by the choroid plexus
      epithelium in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.
PG  - 997-1003
LID - 10.1038/nm.4361 [doi]
AB  - The choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) secretes higher volumes of fluid
      (cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) than any other epithelium and simultaneously functions
      as the blood-CSF barrier to gate immune cell entry into the central nervous
      system. Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH), an expansion of the cerebral
      ventricles due to CSF accumulation following intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH),
      is a common disease usually treated by suboptimal CSF shunting techniques. PHH is
      classically attributed to primary impairments in CSF reabsorption, but little
      experimental evidence supports this concept. In contrast, the potential
      contribution of CSF secretion to PHH has received little attention. In a rat
      model of PHH, we demonstrate that IVH causes a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and
      NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory response in the CPE that is associated with a
      approximately 3-fold increase in bumetanide-sensitive CSF secretion. IVH-induced 
      hypersecretion of CSF is mediated by TLR4-dependent activation of the Ste20-type 
      stress kinase SPAK, which binds, phosphorylates, and stimulates the NKCC1
      co-transporter at the CPE apical membrane. Genetic depletion of TLR4 or SPAK
      normalizes hyperactive CSF secretion rates and reduces PHH symptoms, as does
      treatment with drugs that antagonize TLR4-NF-kappaB signaling or the SPAK-NKCC1
      co-transporter complex. These data uncover a previously unrecognized contribution
      of CSF hypersecretion to the pathogenesis of PHH, demonstrate a new role for TLRs
      in regulation of the internal brain milieu, and identify a kinase-regulated
      mechanism of CSF secretion that could be targeted by repurposed US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat hydrocephalus.

TI  - Reconstruction of the mouse extrahepatic biliary tree using primary human
      extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids.
PG  - 954-963
LID - 10.1038/nm.4360 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of common bile duct (CBD) disorders, such as biliary atresia or
      ischemic strictures, is restricted by the lack of biliary tissue from healthy
      donors suitable for surgical reconstruction. Here we report a new method for the 
      isolation and propagation of human cholangiocytes from the extrahepatic biliary
      tree in the form of extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ECOs) for regenerative 
      medicine applications. The resulting ECOs closely resemble primary cholangiocytes
      in terms of their transcriptomic profile and functional properties. We explore
      the regenerative potential of these organoids in vivo and demonstrate that ECOs
      self-organize into bile duct-like tubes expressing biliary markers following
      transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In addition, 
      when seeded on biodegradable scaffolds, ECOs form tissue-like structures
      retaining biliary characteristics. The resulting bioengineered tissue can
      reconstruct the gallbladder wall and repair the biliary epithelium following
      transplantation into a mouse model of injury. Furthermore, bioengineered
      artificial ducts can replace the native CBD, with no evidence of cholestasis or
      occlusion of the lumen. In conclusion, ECOs can successfully reconstruct the
      biliary tree, providing proof of principle for organ regeneration using human
      primary cholangiocytes expanded in vitro.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 19 regulates skeletal muscle mass and ameliorates muscle
      wasting in mice.
PG  - 990-996
LID - 10.1038/nm.4363 [doi]
AB  - The endocrine-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 has recently
      emerged as a potential target for treating metabolic disease. Given that skeletal
      muscle is a key metabolic organ, we explored the role of FGF19 in that tissue.
      Here we report a novel function of FGF19 in regulating skeletal muscle mass
      through enlargement of muscle fiber size, and in protecting muscle from atrophy. 
      Treatment with FGF19 causes skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice, while
      physiological and pharmacological doses of FGF19 substantially increase the size 
      of human myotubes in vitro. These effects were not elicited by FGF21, a closely
      related endocrine FGF member. Both in vitro and in vivo, FGF19 stimulates the
      phosphorylation of the extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
      and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1), an mTOR-dependent master regulator of
      muscle cell growth. Moreover, mice with a skeletal-muscle-specific genetic
      deficiency of beta-Klotho (KLB), an obligate co-receptor for FGF15/19 (refs.
      2,3), were unresponsive to the hypertrophic effect of FGF19. Finally, in mice,
      FGF19 ameliorates skeletal muscle atrophy induced by glucocorticoid treatment or 
      obesity, as well as sarcopenia. Taken together, these findings provide evidence
      that the enterokine FGF19 is a novel factor in the regulation of skeletal muscle 
      mass, and that it has therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscle wasting.

TI  - A tripartite complex of suPAR, APOL1 risk variants and alphavbeta3 integrin on
      podocytes mediates chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 945-953

AB  - Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) independently predicts
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)
      gene variants G1 and G2, but not the reference allele (G0), are associated with
      an increased risk of CKD in individuals of recent African ancestry. Here we show 
      in two large, unrelated cohorts that decline in kidney function associated with
      APOL1 risk variants was dependent on plasma suPAR levels: APOL1-related risk was 
      attenuated in patients with lower suPAR, and strengthened in those with higher
      suPAR levels. Mechanistically, surface plasmon resonance studies identified
      high-affinity interactions between suPAR, APOL1 and alphavbeta3 integrin, whereby
      APOL1 protein variants G1 and G2 exhibited higher affinity for suPAR-activated
      avb3 integrin than APOL1 G0. APOL1 G1 or G2 augments alphavbeta3 integrin
      activation and causes proteinuria in mice in a suPAR-dependent manner. The
      synergy of circulating factor suPAR and APOL1 G1 or G2 on alphavbeta3 integrin
      activation is a mechanism for CKD.

TI  - Insulin action and resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 804-814
LID - 10.1038/nm.4350 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional excess is a major forerunner of type 2 diabetes. It enhances the
      secretion of insulin, but attenuates insulin's metabolic actions in the liver,
      skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, conflicting evidence indicates a
      lack of knowledge of the timing of these events during the development of obesity
      and diabetes, pointing to a key gap in our understanding of metabolic disease.
      This Perspective reviews alternate viewpoints and recent results on the temporal 
      and mechanistic connections between hyperinsulinemia, obesity and insulin
      resistance. Although much attention has addressed early steps in the insulin
      signaling cascade, insulin resistance in obesity seems to be largely elicited
      downstream of these steps. New findings also connect insulin resistance to
      extensive metabolic cross-talk between the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas and
      skeletal muscle. These and other advances over the past 5 years offer exciting
      opportunities and daunting challenges for the development of new therapeutic
      strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

      intervention.
PG  - 859-868
LID - 10.1038/nm.4358 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence has linked the gut microbiome to human obesity. We performed a 
      metagenome-wide association study and serum metabolomics profiling in a cohort of
      lean and obese, young, Chinese individuals. We identified obesity-associated gut 
      microbial species linked to changes in circulating metabolites. The abundance of 
      Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was markedly
      decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate 
      concentration. Consistently, gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced plasma
      glutamate concentration and alleviated diet-induced body-weight gain and
      adiposity in mice. Furthermore, weight-loss intervention by bariatric surgery
      partially reversed obesity-associated microbial and metabolic alterations in
      obese individuals, including the decreased abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and
      the elevated serum glutamate concentration. Our findings identify previously
      unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, circulating amino acids 
      and obesity, suggesting that it may be possible to intervene in obesity by
      targeting the gut microbiota.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) injury transforms naive astrocytes into reactive
      astrocytes, which eventually become scar-forming astrocytes that can impair
      axonal regeneration and functional recovery. This sequential phenotypic change,
      known as reactive astrogliosis, has long been considered unidirectional and
      irreversible. However, we report here that reactive astrocytes isolated from
      injured spinal cord reverted in retrograde to naive astrocytes when transplanted 
      into a naive spinal cord, whereas they formed astrocytic scars when transplanted 
      into injured spinal cord, indicating the environment-dependent plasticity of
      reactive astrogliosis. We also found that type I collagen was highly expressed in
      the spinal cord during the scar-forming phase and induced astrocytic scar
      formation via the integrin-N-cadherin pathway. In a mouse model of spinal cord
      injury, pharmacological blockade of reactive astrocyte-type I collagen
      interaction prevented astrocytic scar formation, thereby leading to improved
      axonal regrowth and better functional outcomes. Our findings reveal environmental
      cues regulating astrocytic fate decisions, thereby providing a potential
      therapeutic target for CNS injury.

TI  - Colonic organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells for modeling 
      colorectal cancer and drug testing.
PG  - 878-884
LID - 10.1038/nm.4355 [doi]
AB  - With the goal of modeling human disease of the large intestine, we sought to
      develop an effective protocol for deriving colonic organoids (COs) from
      differentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem
      cells (iPSCs). Extensive gene and immunohistochemical profiling confirmed that
      the derived COs represent colon rather than small intestine, containing stem
      cells, transit-amplifying cells, and the expected spectrum of differentiated
      cells, including goblet and endocrine cells. We applied this strategy to iPSCs
      derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP-iPSCs) harboring
      germline mutations in the WNT-signaling-pathway-regulator gene encoding APC, and 
      we generated COs that exhibit enhanced WNT activity and increased epithelial cell
      proliferation, which we used as a platform for drug testing. Two potential
      compounds, XAV939 and rapamycin, decreased proliferation in FAP-COs, but also
      affected cell proliferation in wild-type COs, which thus limits their therapeutic
      application. By contrast, we found that geneticin, a ribosome-binding antibiotic 
      with translational 'read-through' activity, efficiently targeted abnormal WNT
      activity and restored normal proliferation specifically in APC-mutant FAP-COs.
      These studies provide an efficient strategy for deriving human COs, which can be 
      used in disease modeling and drug discovery for colorectal disease.

      allows for sex-independent disease modeling.
PG  - 829-838
LID - 10.1038/nm.4346 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common prelude to cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma, is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide.
      Defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD has been
      hampered by a lack of animal models that closely recapitulate the severe end of
      the disease spectrum in humans, including bridging hepatic fibrosis. Here we
      demonstrate that a novel experimental model employing thermoneutral housing, as
      opposed to standard housing, resulted in lower stress-driven production of
      corticosterone, augmented mouse proinflammatory immune responses and markedly
      exacerbated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD pathogenesis. Disease exacerbation 
      at thermoneutrality was conserved across multiple mouse strains and was
      associated with augmented intestinal permeability, an altered microbiome and
      activation of inflammatory pathways that are associated with the disease in
      humans. Depletion of Gram-negative microbiota, hematopoietic cell deletion of
      Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inactivation of the IL-17 axis resulted in
      altered immune responsiveness and protection from thermoneutral-housing-driven
      NAFLD amplification. Finally, female mice, typically resistant to HFD-induced
      obesity and NAFLD, develop full disease characteristics at thermoneutrality.
      Thus, thermoneutral housing provides a sex-independent model of exacerbated NAFLD
      in mice and represents a novel approach for interrogation of the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Cold-induced conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in mice shapes the gut
      microbiome and promotes adaptive thermogenesis.
PG  - 839-849
LID - 10.1038/nm.4357 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive thermogenesis is an energy-demanding process that is mediated by
      cold-activated beige and brown adipocytes, and it entails increased uptake of
      carbohydrates, as well as lipoprotein-derived triglycerides and cholesterol, into
      these thermogenic cells. Here we report that cold exposure in mice triggers a
      metabolic program that orchestrates lipoprotein processing in brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) and hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids via the
      alternative synthesis pathway. This process is dependent on hepatic induction of 
      cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily b, polypeptide 1 (CYP7B1) and results in
      increased plasma levels, as well as fecal excretion, of bile acids that is
      accompanied by distinct changes in gut microbiota and increased heat production. 
      Genetic and pharmacological interventions that targeted the synthesis and biliary
      excretion of bile acids prevented the rise in fecal bile acid excretion, changed 
      the bacterial composition of the gut and modulated thermogenic responses. These
      results identify bile acids as important metabolic effectors under conditions of 
      sustained BAT activation and highlight the relevance of cholesterol metabolism by
      the host for diet-induced changes of the gut microbiota and energy metabolism.

TI  - ISDoT: in situ decellularization of tissues for high-resolution imaging and
      proteomic analysis of native extracellular matrix.
PG  - 890-898
LID - 10.1038/nm.4352 [doi]
AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a master regulator of cellular phenotype and
      behavior. It has a crucial role in both normal tissue homeostasis and disease
      pathology. Here we present a fast and efficient approach to enhance the study of 
      ECM composition and structure. Termed in situ decellularization of tissues
      (ISDoT), it allows whole organs to be decellularized, leaving native ECM
      architecture intact. These three-dimensional decellularized tissues can be
      studied using high-resolution fluorescence and second harmonic imaging, and can
      be used for quantitative proteomic interrogation of the ECM. Our method is
      superior to other methods tested in its ability to preserve the structural
      integrity of the ECM, facilitate high-resolution imaging and quantitatively
      detect ECM proteins. In particular, we performed high-resolution sub-micron
      imaging of matrix topography in normal tissue and over the course of primary
      tumor development and progression to metastasis in mice, providing the first
      detailed imaging of the metastatic niche. These data show that cancer-driven ECM 
      remodeling is organ specific, and that it is accompanied by comprehensive changes
      in ECM composition and topological structure. We also describe differing patterns
      of basement-membrane organization surrounding different types of blood vessels in
      healthy and diseased tissues. The ISDoT procedure allows for the study of native 
      ECM structure under normal and pathological conditions in unprecedented detail.

TI  - Elimination of large tumors in mice by mRNA-encoded bispecific antibodies.
PG  - 815-817
LID - 10.1038/nm.4356 [doi]
AB  - The potential of bispecific T cell-engaging antibodies is hindered by
      manufacturing challenges and short serum half-life. We circumvented these
      limitations by treating mice with in vitro-transcribed pharmacologically
      optimized, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the antibody. We achieved sustained 
      endogenous synthesis of the antibody, which eliminated advanced tumors as
      effectively as the corresponding purified bispecific antibody. Because
      manufacturing of pharmaceutical mRNA is fast, this approach could accelerate the 
      clinical development of novel bispecific antibodies.

AB  - Although antiretroviral therapy can suppress HIV-1 infection to undetectable
      levels of plasma viremia, integrated latent HIV-1 genomes that encode
      replication-competent virus persist in resting CD4(+) T cells. This latent HIV-1 
      reservoir represents a major barrier to a cure. Currently, there are substantial 
      efforts to identify therapeutic approaches that will eliminate or reduce the size
      of this latent HIV-1 reservoir. In this regard, a sensitive assay that can
      accurately and rapidly quantify inducible, replication-competent latent HIV-1
      from resting CD4(+) T cells is essential for HIV-1 eradication studies. Here we
      describe a reporter cell-based assay to quantify inducible, replication-competent
      latent HIV-1. This assay has several advantages over existing technology in that 
      it (i) is sensitive; (ii) requires only a small blood volume; (iii) is faster,
      less labor intensive, and less expensive; and (iv) can be readily adapted into a 
      high-throughput format. Using this assay, we show that the size of the inducible 
      latent HIV-1 reservoir in aviremic participants on therapy is approximately
      70-fold larger than previous estimates.

TI  - Combined mutation in Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 causes clear cell renal cell carcinoma in
      mice.
PG  - 869-877
LID - 10.1038/nm.4343 [doi]
AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) frequently exhibit inactivation of the 
      von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene, VHL, and often harbor multiple
      copy-number alterations in genes that regulate cell cycle progression. We show
      here that modeling these genetic alterations by combined deletion of Vhl, Trp53
      and Rb1 specifically in renal epithelial cells in mice caused ccRCC. These tumors
      arose from proximal tubule epithelial cells and shared molecular markers and mRNA
      expression profiles with human ccRCC. Exome sequencing revealed that mouse and
      human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent mutations in genes associated with the primary
      cilium, uncovering a mutational convergence on this organelle and implicating a
      subset of ccRCCs as genetic ciliopathies. Different mouse tumors responded
      differently to standard therapies for advanced human ccRCC, mimicking the range
      of clinical behaviors in the human disease. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible
      factor (HIF)-alpha transcription factors with acriflavine as third-line therapy
      had therapeutic effects in some tumors, providing preclinical evidence for
      further investigation of HIF-alpha inhibition as a ccRCC treatment. This
      autochthonous mouse ccRCC model represents a tool to investigate the biology of
      ccRCC and to identify new treatment strategies.

TI  - Metformin alters the gut microbiome of individuals with treatment-naive type 2
      diabetes, contributing to the therapeutic effects of the drug.
PG  - 850-858
LID - 10.1038/nm.4345 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its
      mechanism of action is poorly defined. Recent evidence implicates the gut
      microbiota as a site of metformin action. In a double-blind study, we randomized 
      individuals with treatment-naive T2D to placebo or metformin for 4 months and
      showed that metformin had strong effects on the gut microbiome. These results
      were verified in a subset of the placebo group that switched to metformin 6
      months after the start of the trial. Transfer of fecal samples (obtained before
      and 4 months after treatment) from metformin-treated donors to germ-free mice
      showed that glucose tolerance was improved in mice that received
      metformin-altered microbiota. By directly investigating metformin-microbiota
      interactions in a gut simulator, we showed that metformin affected pathways with 
      common biological functions in species from two different phyla, and many of the 
      metformin-regulated genes in these species encoded metalloproteins or metal
      transporters. Our findings provide support for the notion that altered gut
      microbiota mediates some of metformin's antidiabetic effects.

TI  - Biology and evolution of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1038/nm.4341 [doi]
AB  - Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers are a diverse group of neoplasms typically diagnosed 
      and treated on the basis of their site of origin. This Perspective focuses on
      advances in our understanding of the tumorigenesis and treatment of poorly
      differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Recent evidence from sequencing indicates
      that, although neuroendocrine tumors can arise de novo, they can also develop as 
      a result of lineage plasticity in response to pressure from targeted therapies.
      We discuss the shared genomic alterations of these tumors independently of their 
      site of origin, and we explore potential therapeutic strategies on the basis of
      recent biological findings.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression,
      leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA
      translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2
      diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice and selectively normalizes
      ERK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin
      is a potential FXS therapeutic.

      in chronic myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 692-702
LID - 10.1038/nm.4336 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics are ideally placed to unravel
      intratumoral heterogeneity and selective resistance of cancer stem cell (SC)
      subpopulations to molecularly targeted cancer therapies. However, current
      single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches lack the sensitivity required to reliably
      detect somatic mutations. We developed a method that combines high-sensitivity
      mutation detection with whole-transcriptome analysis of the same single cell. We 
      applied this technique to analyze more than 2,000 SCs from patients with chronic 
      myeloid leukemia (CML) throughout the disease course, revealing heterogeneity of 
      CML-SCs, including the identification of a subgroup of CML-SCs with a distinct
      molecular signature that selectively persisted during prolonged therapy. Analysis
      of nonleukemic SCs from patients with CML also provided new insights into
      cell-extrinsic disruption of hematopoiesis in CML associated with clinical
      outcome. Furthermore, we used this single-cell approach to identify a
      blast-crisis-specific SC population, which was also present in a subclone of
      CML-SCs during the chronic phase in a patient who subsequently developed blast
      crisis. This approach, which might be broadly applied to any malignancy,
      illustrates how single-cell analysis can identify subpopulations of
      therapy-resistant SCs that are not apparent through cell-population analysis.

AB  - Impaired learning and cognitive function often occurs during systemic infection
      or inflammation. Although activation of the innate immune system has been linked 
      to the behavioral and cognitive effects that are associated with infection, the
      underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we mimicked viral immune
      activation with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, and
      longitudinally imaged postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons 
      in the mouse primary motor cortex using two-photon microscopy. We found that
      peripheral immune activation caused dendritic spine loss, impairments in
      learning-dependent dendritic spine formation and deficits in multiple learning
      tasks in mice. These observed synaptic alterations in the cortex were mediated by
      peripheral-monocyte-derived cells and did not require microglial function in the 
      central nervous system. Furthermore, activation of CX3CR1(high)Ly6C(low)
      monocytes impaired motor learning and learning-related dendritic spine plasticity
      through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-dependent mechanisms. Taken together,
      our results highlight CX3CR1(high) monocytes and TNF-alpha as potential
      therapeutic targets for preventing infection-induced cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - A chronic low dose of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) restores cognitive
      function in old mice.
PG  - 782-787
LID - 10.1038/nm.4311 [doi]
AB  - The balance between detrimental, pro-aging, often stochastic processes and
      counteracting homeostatic mechanisms largely determines the progression of aging.
      There is substantial evidence suggesting that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is
      part of the latter system because it modulates the physiological processes
      underlying aging. The activity of the ECS declines during aging, as CB1 receptor 
      expression and coupling to G proteins are reduced in the brain tissues of older
      animals and the levels of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)
      are lower. However, a direct link between endocannabinoid tone and aging symptoms
      has not been demonstrated. Here we show that a low dose of
      Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) reversed the age-related decline in cognitive
      performance of mice aged 12 and 18 months. This behavioral effect was accompanied
      by enhanced expression of synaptic marker proteins and increased hippocampal
      spine density. THC treatment restored hippocampal gene transcription patterns
      such that the expression profiles of THC-treated mice aged 12 months closely
      resembled those of THC-free animals aged 2 months. The transcriptional effects of
      THC were critically dependent on glutamatergic CB1 receptors and histone
      acetylation, as their inhibition blocked the beneficial effects of THC. Thus,
      restoration of CB1 signaling in old individuals could be an effective strategy to
      treat age-related cognitive impairments.

AB  - Tumor molecular profiling is a fundamental component of precision oncology,
      enabling the identification of genomic alterations in genes and pathways that can
      be targeted therapeutically. The existence of recurrent targetable alterations
      across distinct histologically defined tumor types, coupled with an expanding
      portfolio of molecularly targeted therapies, demands flexible and comprehensive
      approaches to profile clinically relevant genes across the full spectrum of
      cancers. We established a large-scale, prospective clinical sequencing initiative
      using a comprehensive assay, MSK-IMPACT, through which we have compiled tumor and
      matched normal sequence data from a unique cohort of more than 10,000 patients
      with advanced cancer and available pathological and clinical annotations. Using
      these data, we identified clinically relevant somatic mutations, novel noncoding 
      alterations, and mutational signatures that were shared by common and rare tumor 
      types. Patients were enrolled on genomically matched clinical trials at a rate of
      11%. To enable discovery of novel biomarkers and deeper investigation into rare
      alterations and tumor types, all results are publicly accessible.

TI  - Decreased alertness due to sleep loss increases pain sensitivity in mice.
PG  - 768-774

AB  - Extended daytime and nighttime activities are major contributors to the growing
      sleep deficiency epidemic, as is the high prevalence of sleep disorders like
      insomnia. The consequences of chronic insufficient sleep for health remain
      uncertain. Sleep quality and duration predict presence of pain the next day in
      healthy subjects, suggesting that sleep disturbances alone may worsen pain, and
      experimental sleep deprivation in humans supports this claim. We demonstrate that
      sleep loss, but not sleep fragmentation, in healthy mice increases sensitivity to
      noxious stimuli (referred to as 'pain') without general sensory
      hyper-responsiveness. Moderate daily repeated sleep loss leads to a progressive
      accumulation of sleep debt and also to exaggerated pain responses, both of which 
      are rescued after restoration of normal sleep. Caffeine and modafinil, two
      wake-promoting agents that have no analgesic activity in rested mice, immediately
      normalize pain sensitivity in sleep-deprived animals, without affecting sleep
      debt. The reversibility of mild sleep-loss-induced pain by wake-promoting agents 
      reveals an unsuspected role for alertness in setting pain sensitivity.
      Clinically, insufficient or poor-quality sleep may worsen pain and this enhanced 
      pain may be reduced not by analgesics, whose effectiveness is reduced, but by
      increasing alertness or providing better sleep.

TI  - Tmbim1 is a multivesicular body regulator that protects against non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease in mice and monkeys by targeting the lysosomal degradation of
      Tlr4.
PG  - 742-752
LID - 10.1038/nm.4334 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly prevalent liver pathology
      that can progress from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and it is a
      leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is currently no
      pharmacological therapy for NASH. Defective lysosome-mediated protein degradation
      is a key process that underlies steatohepatitis and a well-recognized drug target
      in a variety of diseases; however, whether it can serve as a therapeutic target
      for NAFLD and NASH remains unknown. Here we report that transmembrane BAX
      inhibitor motif-containing 1 (TMBIM1) is an effective suppressor of
      steatohepatitis and a previously unknown regulator of the multivesicular body
      (MVB)-lysosomal pathway. Tmbim1 expression in hepatocytes substantially inhibited
      high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation in
      mice. Mechanistically, Tmbim1 promoted the lysosomal degradation of toll-like
      receptor 4 by cooperating with the ESCRT endosomal sorting complex to facilitate 
      MVB formation, and the ubiquitination of Tmbim1 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4l
      was required for this process. We also found that overexpression of Tmbim1 in the
      liver effectively inhibited a severe form of NAFLD in mice and NASH progression
      in monkeys. Taken together, these findings could lead to the development of
      promising strategies to treat NASH by targeting MVB regulators to properly
      orchestrate the lysosome-mediated protein degradation of key mediators of the
      disease.

TI  - Pericytes impair capillary blood flow and motor function after chronic spinal
      cord injury.
PG  - 733-741
LID - 10.1038/nm.4331 [doi]
AB  - Blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) are controlled by neuronal
      activity. For example, widespread vessel constriction (vessel tone) is induced by
      brainstem neurons that release the monoamines serotonin and noradrenaline, and
      local vessel dilation is induced by glutamatergic neuron activity. Here we
      examined how vessel tone adapts to the loss of neuron-derived monoamines after
      spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. We find that, months after the imposition of
      SCI, the spinal cord below the site of injury is in a chronic state of hypoxia
      owing to paradoxical excess activity of monoamine receptors (5-HT1) on pericytes,
      despite the absence of monoamines. This monoamine-receptor activity causes
      pericytes to locally constrict capillaries, which reduces blood flow to ischemic 
      levels. Receptor activation in the absence of monoamines results from the
      production of trace amines (such as tryptamine) by pericytes that ectopically
      express the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which synthesizes 
      trace amines directly from dietary amino acids (such as tryptophan). Inhibition
      of monoamine receptors or of AADC, or even an increase in inhaled oxygen,
      produces substantial relief from hypoxia and improves motoneuron and locomotor
      function after SCI.

TI  - Host DNA released by NETosis promotes rhinovirus-induced type-2 allergic asthma
      exacerbation.
PG  - 681-691
LID - 10.1038/nm.4332 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory viral infections represent the most common cause of allergic asthma
      exacerbations. Amplification of the type-2 immune response is strongly implicated
      in asthma exacerbation, but how virus infection boosts type-2 responses is poorly
      understood. We report a significant correlation between the release of host
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) following rhinovirus infection and the exacerbation
      of type-2 allergic inflammation in humans. In a mouse model of allergic airway
      hypersensitivity, we show that rhinovirus infection triggers dsDNA release
      associated with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), known as 
      NETosis. We further demonstrate that inhibiting NETosis by blocking neutrophil
      elastase or by degrading NETs with DNase protects mice from type-2
      immunopathology. Furthermore, the injection of mouse genomic DNA alone is
      sufficient to recapitulate many features of rhinovirus-induced type-2 immune
      responses and asthma pathology. Thus, NETosis and its associated extracellular
      dsDNA contribute to the pathogenesis and may represent potential therapeutic
      targets of rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations.

AB  - We directly assessed mesial temporal activity using intracranial foramen ovale
      electrodes in two patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) without a history or EEG
      evidence of seizures. We detected clinically silent hippocampal seizures and
      epileptiform spikes during sleep, a period when these abnormalities were most
      likely to interfere with memory consolidation. The findings in these index cases 
      support a model in which early development of occult hippocampal
      hyperexcitability may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

TI  - Local clearance of senescent cells attenuates the development of post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis and creates a pro-regenerative environment.
PG  - 775-781
LID - 10.1038/nm.4324 [doi]
AB  - Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate in many vertebrate tissues with age and
      contribute to age-related pathologies, presumably through their secretion of
      factors contributing to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
      Removal of SnCs delays several pathologies and increases healthy lifespan. Aging 
      and trauma are risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic
      disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage leading to pain and 
      physical disability. Senescent chondrocytes are found in cartilage tissue
      isolated from patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, yet their role in
      disease pathogenesis is unknown. To test the idea that SnCs might play a
      causative role in OA, we used the p16-3MR transgenic mouse, which harbors a
      p16(INK4a) (Cdkn2a) promoter driving the expression of a fusion protein
      containing synthetic Renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescent protein
      domains, as well as a truncated form of herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase
      (HSV-TK). This mouse strain allowed us to selectively follow and remove SnCs
      after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). We found that SnCs
      accumulated in the articular cartilage and synovium after ACLT, and selective
      elimination of these cells attenuated the development of post-traumatic OA,
      reduced pain and increased cartilage development. Intra-articular injection of a 
      senolytic molecule that selectively killed SnCs validated these results in
      transgenic, non-transgenic and aged mice. Selective removal of the SnCs from in
      vitro cultures of chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA undergoing total
      knee replacement decreased expression of senescent and inflammatory markers while
      also increasing expression of cartilage tissue extracellular matrix proteins.
      Collectively, these findings support the use of SnCs as a therapeutic target for 
      treating degenerative joint disease.

TI  - Pyruvate kinase M2 activation may protect against the progression of diabetic
      glomerular pathology and mitochondrial dysfunction.
PG  - 753-762
LID - 10.1038/nm.4328 [doi]
AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major cause of end-stage renal disease, and
      therapeutic options for preventing its progression are limited. To identify novel
      therapeutic strategies, we studied protective factors for DN using proteomics on 
      glomeruli from individuals with extreme duration of diabetes (l50 years) without 
      DN and those with histologic signs of DN. Enzymes in the glycolytic, sorbitol,
      methylglyoxal and mitochondrial pathways were elevated in individuals without DN.
      In particular, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression and activity were
      upregulated. Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased
      PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and
      cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes had higher levels 
      of toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.
      Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse
      albuminuria and glomerular pathology. Conversely, we found that pharmacological
      activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed
      hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial
      dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1alpha mRNA in
      cultured podocytes. In intervention studies using DBA2/J and Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse
      models of diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities,
      mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathology. Thus, PKM2 activation may protect
      against DN by increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting the production of
      toxic glucose metabolites and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis to restore
      mitochondrial function.

AB  - Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) trigger sterile inflammation after
      tissue injury, but the mechanisms underlying the resolution of inflammation
      remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that common DAMPs, such as
      high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1), peroxiredoxins (PRXs), and S100A8 and S100A9, 
      were internalized through the class A scavenger receptors MSR1 and MARCO in
      vitro. In ischemic murine brain, DAMP internalization was largely mediated by
      MSR1. An elevation of MSR1 levels in infiltrating myeloid cells observed 3 d
      after experimental stroke was dependent on the transcription factor Mafb.
      Combined deficiency for Msr1 and Marco, or for Mafb alone, in infiltrating
      myeloid cells caused impaired clearance of DAMPs, more severe inflammation, and
      exacerbated neuronal injury in a murine model of ischemic stroke. The retinoic
      acid receptor (RAR) agonist Am80 increased the expression of Mafb, thereby
      enhancing MSR1 expression. Am80 exhibited therapeutic efficacy when administered,
      even at 24 h after the onset of experimental stroke. Our findings uncover
      cellular mechanisms contributing to DAMP clearance in resolution of the sterile
      inflammation triggered by tissue injury.

TI  - A live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidate induces sterilizing immunity in
      mouse models.
PG  - 763-767
LID - 10.1038/nm.4322 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women can cause a wide range of
      congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the infant, a condition now 
      collectively known as congenital ZIKV syndrome. A vaccine to prevent or
      significantly attenuate viremia in pregnant women who are residents of or
      travelers to epidemic or endemic regions is needed to avert congenital ZIKV
      syndrome, and might also help to suppress epidemic transmission. Here we report
      on a live-attenuated vaccine candidate that contains a 10-nucleotide deletion in 
      the 3' untranslated region of the ZIKV genome (10-del ZIKV). The 10-del ZIKV is
      highly attenuated, immunogenic, and protective in type 1 interferon
      receptor-deficient A129 mice. Crucially, a single dose of 10-del ZIKV induced
      sterilizing immunity with a saturated neutralizing antibody titer, which no
      longer increased after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV, and completely prevented 
      viremia. The immunized mice also developed a robust T cell response. Intracranial
      inoculation of 1-d-old immunocompetent CD-1 mice with 1 x 10(4) infectious focus 
      units (IFU) of 10-del ZIKV caused no mortality, whereas infections with 10 IFU of
      wild-type ZIKV were lethal. Mechanistically, the attenuated virulence of 10-del
      ZIKV may be due to decreased viral RNA synthesis and increased sensitivity to
      type-1-interferon inhibition. The attenuated 10-del ZIKV was incapable of
      infecting mosquitoes after oral feeding of spiked-blood meals, representing an
      additional safety feature. Collectively, the safety and efficacy results suggest 
      that further development of this promising, live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine
      candidate is warranted.

TI  - Is autoimmunity the Achilles' heel of cancer immunotherapy?
PG  - 540-547
LID - 10.1038/nm.4321 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of immuno-oncology as the first broadly successful strategy for
      metastatic cancer will require clinicians to integrate this new pillar of
      medicine with chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted small-molecule compounds. Of 
      equal importance is gaining an understanding of the limitations and toxicities of
      immunotherapy. Immunotherapy was initially perceived to be a relatively less
      toxic approach to cancer treatment than other available therapies-and surely it
      is, when compared to those. However, as the use of immunotherapy becomes more
      common, especially as first- and second-line treatments, immunotoxicity and
      autoimmunity are emerging as the Achilles' heel of immunotherapy. In this
      Perspective, we discuss evidence that the occurrence of immunotoxicity bodes well
      for the patient, and describe mechanisms that might be related to the induction
      of autoimmunity. We then explore approaches to limit immunotoxicity, and discuss 
      the future directions of research and reporting that are needed to diminish it.

TI  - HIV persistence in tissue macrophages of humanized myeloid-only mice during
      antiretroviral therapy.
PG  - 638-643
LID - 10.1038/nm.4319 [doi]
AB  - Despite years of fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV persists in 
      its hosts and is never eradicated. One major barrier to eradication is that the
      virus infects multiple cell types that may individually contribute to HIV
      persistence. Tissue macrophages are critical contributors to HIV pathogenesis;
      however, their specific role in HIV persistence during long-term suppressive ART 
      has not been established. Using humanized myeloid-only mice (MoM), we demonstrate
      that HIV infection of tissue macrophages is rapidly suppressed by ART, as
      reflected by a rapid drop in plasma viral load and a dramatic decrease in the
      levels of cell-associated viral RNA and DNA. No viral rebound was observed in the
      plasma of 67% of the ART-treated animals at 7 weeks after ART interruption, and
      no replication-competent virus was rescued from the tissue macrophages obtained
      from these animals. In contrast, in a subset of animals ( approximately 33%), a
      delayed viral rebound was observed that is consistent with the establishment of
      persistent infection in tissue macrophages. These observations represent the
      first direct evidence, to our knowledge, of HIV persistence in tissue macrophages
      in vivo.

TI  - Alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or
      contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis.
PG  - 623-630
LID - 10.1038/nm.4316 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat generation in response to cold
      stimulation. It is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, whose
      chief effector is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE). NE enhances
      thermogenesis through beta3-adrenergic receptors to activate brown adipose tissue
      and by 'browning' white adipose tissue. Recent studies have reported that
      alternative activation of macrophages in response to interleukin (IL)-4
      stimulation induces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in 
      the catecholamine synthesis pathway, and that this activation provides an
      alternative source of locally produced catecholamines during the thermogenic
      process. Here we report that the deletion of Th in hematopoietic cells of adult
      mice neither alters energy expenditure upon cold exposure nor reduces browning in
      inguinal adipose tissue. Bone marrow-derived macrophages did not release NE in
      response to stimulation with IL-4, and conditioned media from IL-4-stimulated
      macrophages failed to induce expression of thermogenic genes, such as uncoupling 
      protein 1 (Ucp1), in adipocytes cultured with the conditioned media. Furthermore,
      chronic treatment with IL-4 failed to increase energy expenditure in wild-type,
      Ucp1(-/-) and interleukin-4 receptor-alpha double-negative (Il4ra(-/-)) mice. In 
      agreement with these findings, adipose-tissue-resident macrophages did not
      express TH. Thus, we conclude that alternatively activated macrophages do not
      synthesize relevant amounts of catecholamines, and hence, are not likely to have 
      a direct role in adipocyte metabolism or adaptive thermogenesis.

LID - 10.1038/nm.4315 [doi]
AB  - Splenic marginal zone B (MZB) cells, positioned at the interface between
      circulating blood and lymphoid tissue, detect and respond to blood-borne
      antigens. Here we show that MZB cells in mice activate a homeostatic program in
      response to a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and regulate both the differentiation
      and accumulation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Feeding mice an HCD resulted
      in upregulated MZB cell surface expression of the immunoregulatory ligand PDL1 in
      an ATF3-dependent manner and increased the interaction between MZB cells and
      pre-TFH cells, leading to PDL1-mediated suppression of TFH cell motility,
      alteration of TFH cell differentiation, reduced TFH abundance and suppression of 
      the proatherogenic TFH response. Our findings reveal a previously unsuspected
      role for MZB cells in controlling the TFH-germinal center response to a

AB  - Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by insufficient
      cardiac function. In addition to abnormalities intrinsic to the heart,
      dysfunction of other organs and dysregulation of systemic factors greatly affect 
      the development and consequences of heart failure. Here we show that the heart
      and kidneys function cooperatively in generating an adaptive response to cardiac 
      pressure overload. In mice subjected to pressure overload in the heart,
      sympathetic nerve activation led to activation of renal collecting-duct (CD)
      epithelial cells. Cell-cell interactions among activated CD cells, tissue
      macrophages and endothelial cells within the kidney led to secretion of the
      cytokine CSF2, which in turn stimulated cardiac-resident Ly6C(lo) macrophages,
      which are essential for the myocardial adaptive response to pressure overload.
      The renal response to cardiac pressure overload was disrupted by renal
      sympathetic denervation, adrenergic beta2-receptor blockade or CD-cell-specific
      deficiency of the transcription factor KLF5. Moreover, we identified amphiregulin
      as an essential cardioprotective mediator produced by cardiac Ly6C(lo)
      macrophages. Our results demonstrate a dynamic interplay between the heart, brain
      and kidneys that is necessary for adaptation to cardiac stress, and they
      highlight the homeostatic functions of tissue macrophages and the sympathetic
      nervous system.

TI  - Dectin 1 activation on macrophages by galectin 9 promotes pancreatic carcinoma
      and peritumoral immune tolerance.
PG  - 556-567
LID - 10.1038/nm.4314 [doi]
AB  - The progression of pancreatic oncogenesis requires immune-suppressive
      inflammation in cooperation with oncogenic mutations. However, the drivers of
      intratumoral immune tolerance are uncertain. Dectin 1 is an innate immune
      receptor crucial for anti-fungal immunity, but its role in sterile inflammation
      and oncogenesis has not been well defined. Furthermore, non-pathogen-derived
      ligands for dectin 1 have not been characterized. We found that dectin 1 is
      highly expressed on macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Dectin
      1 ligation accelerated the progression of PDA in mice, whereas deletion of
      Clec7a-the gene encoding dectin 1-or blockade of dectin 1 downstream signaling
      was protective. We found that dectin 1 can ligate the lectin galectin 9 in mouse 
      and human PDA, which results in tolerogenic macrophage programming and adaptive
      immune suppression. Upon disruption of the dectin 1-galectin 9 axis, CD4(+) and
      CD8(+) T cells, which are dispensable for PDA progression in hosts with an intact
      signaling axis, become reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumor
      immunity. These data suggest that targeting dectin 1 signaling is an attractive
      strategy for developing an immunotherapy for PDA.

TI  - Thymosin alpha1 represents a potential potent single-molecule-based therapy for
      cystic fibrosis.
PG  - 590-600
LID - 10.1038/nm.4305 [doi]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that compromise its chloride 
      channel activity. The most common mutation, p.Phe508del, results in the
      production of a misfolded CFTR protein, which has residual channel activity but
      is prematurely degraded. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic
      mechanisms involved in CF, which include impaired chloride permeability and
      persistent lung inflammation, a multidrug approach is required for efficacious CF
      therapy. To date, no individual drug with pleiotropic beneficial effects is
      available for CF. Here we report on the ability of thymosin alpha 1 (Talpha1)-a
      naturally occurring polypeptide with an excellent safety profile in the clinic
      when used as an adjuvant or an immunotherapeutic agent-to rectify the multiple
      tissue defects in mice with CF as well as in cells from subjects with the
      p.Phe508del mutation. Talpha1 displayed two combined properties that favorably
      opposed CF symptomatology: it reduced inflammation and increased CFTR maturation,
      stability and activity. By virtue of this two-pronged action, Talpha1 has strong 
      potential to be an efficacious single-molecule-based therapeutic agent for CF.

AB  - Chromosomal instability (CIN), a feature of most adult neoplasms from their early
      stages onward, is a driver of tumorigenesis. However, several malignancy
      subtypes, including some triple-negative breast cancers, display a paucity of
      genomic aberrations, thus suggesting that tumor development may occur in the
      absence of CIN. Here we show that the differentiation status of normal human
      mammary epithelial cells dictates cell behavior after an oncogenic event and
      predetermines the genetic routes toward malignancy. Whereas oncogene induction in
      differentiated cells induces massive DNA damage, mammary stem cells are
      resistant, owing to a preemptive program driven by the transcription factor ZEB1 
      and the methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB3. The prevention of oncogene-induced 
      DNA damage precludes induction of the oncosuppressive p53-dependent DNA-damage
      response, thereby increasing stem cells' intrinsic susceptibility to malignant
      transformation. In accord with this model, a subclass of breast neoplasms exhibit
      unique pathological features, including high ZEB1 expression, a low frequency of 
      TP53 mutations and low CIN.

TI  - Oncostatin M drives intestinal inflammation and predicts response to tumor
      necrosis factor-neutralizing therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 579-589
LID - 10.1038/nm.4307 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
      colitis (UC), are complex chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal
      tract that are driven by perturbed cytokine pathways. Anti-tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF) antibodies are mainstay therapies for IBD. However, up to 40% 
      of patients are nonresponsive to anti-TNF agents, which makes the identification 
      of alternative therapeutic targets a priority. Here we show that, relative to
      healthy controls, inflamed intestinal tissues from patients with IBD express high
      amounts of the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor (OSMR), which
      correlate closely with histopathological disease severity. The OSMR is expressed 
      in nonhematopoietic, nonepithelial intestinal stromal cells, which respond to OSM
      by producing various proinflammatory molecules, including interleukin (IL)-6, the
      leukocyte adhesion factor ICAM1, and chemokines that attract neutrophils,
      monocytes, and T cells. In an animal model of anti-TNF-resistant intestinal
      inflammation, genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of OSM significantly
      attenuates colitis. Furthermore, according to an analysis of more than 200
      patients with IBD, including two cohorts from phase 3 clinical trials of
      infliximab and golimumab, high pretreatment expression of OSM is strongly
      associated with failure of anti-TNF therapy. OSM is thus a potential biomarker
      and therapeutic target for IBD, and has particular relevance for
      anti-TNF-resistant patients.

TI  - VISTA is an inhibitory immune checkpoint that is increased after ipilimumab
      therapy in patients with prostate cancer.

AB  - To date, anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) or anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) monotherapy has not
      been demonstrated to be of substantial clinical benefit in patients with prostate
      cancer. To identify additional immune-inhibitory pathways in the prostate-tumor
      microenvironment, we evaluated untreated and ipilimumab-treated tumors from
      patients in a presurgical clinical trial. Levels of the PD-L1 and VISTA
      inhibitory molecules increased on independent subsets of macrophages in treated
      tumors. Our data suggest that VISTA represents another compensatory inhibitory
      pathway in prostate tumors after ipilimumab therapy.

TI  - The cold-induced lipokine 12,13-diHOME promotes fatty acid transport into brown
      adipose tissue.
PG  - 631-637
LID - 10.1038/nm.4297 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipose tissue combust fuels for heat
      production in adult humans, and so constitute an appealing target for the
      treatment of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.
      Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been
      shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time
      consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological
      interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from
      tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and
      glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'.
      Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and 
      is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be 
      thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that
      the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of 
      BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index 
      and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that
      12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold.
      Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely
      induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely
      activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in
      decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased 
      fatty acid (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of
      the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 
      12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for
      metabolic disorders.

AB  - We developed a multiplexed assay on a plasmonic-gold platform for measuring IgG
      and IgA antibodies and IgG avidity against both Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue
      virus (DENV) infections. In contrast to IgM cross-reactivity, IgG and IgA
      antibodies against ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen were specific to
      ZIKV infection, and IgG avidity revealed recent ZIKV infection and past DENV-2
      infection in patients in dengue-endemic regions. This assay could enable specific
      diagnosis of ZIKV infection over other flaviviral infections.

TI  - Refining strategies to translate genome editing to the clinic.
PG  - 415-423
LID - 10.1038/nm.4313 [doi]
AB  - Recent progress in developing programmable nucleases, such as zinc-finger
      nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas nucleases, have paved
      the way for gene editing to enter clinical practice. This translation is a result
      of combining high nuclease activity with high specificity and successfully
      applying this technology in various preclinical disease models, including
      infectious disease, primary immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, hemophilia
      and muscular dystrophy. Several clinical gene-editing trials, both ex vivo and in
      vivo, have been initiated in the past 2 years, including studies that aim to
      knockout genes as well as to add therapeutic transgenes. Here we discuss the
      advances made in the gene-editing field in recent years, and specify priorities
      that need to be addressed to expand therapeutic genome editing to further disease
      entities.

TI  - Targeting c-FOS and DUSP1 abrogates intrinsic resistance to tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitor therapy in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.
PG  - 472-482
LID - 10.1038/nm.4310 [doi]
AB  - Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for human cancers is not curative, and
      relapse occurs owing to the continued presence of tumor cells, referred to as
      minimal residual disease (MRD). The survival of MRD stem or progenitor cells in
      the absence of oncogenic kinase signaling, a phenomenon referred to as intrinsic 
      resistance, depends on diverse growth factors. Here we report that oncogenic
      kinase and growth-factor signaling converge to induce the expression of the
      signaling proteins FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-FOS, encoded by Fos) and
      dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Genetic deletion of Fos and Dusp1
      suppressed tumor growth in a BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase-induced mouse model of
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacological inhibition of c-FOS, DUSP1 and
      BCR-ABL eradicated MRD in multiple in vivo models, as well as in mice
      xenotransplanted with patient-derived primary CML cells. Growth-factor signaling 
      also conferred TKI resistance and induced FOS and DUSP1 expression in tumor cells
      modeling other types of kinase-driven leukemias. Our data demonstrate that c-FOS 
      and DUSP1 expression levels determine the threshold of TKI efficacy, such that
      growth-factor-induced expression of c-FOS and DUSP1 confers intrinsic resistance 
      to TKI therapy in a wide-ranging set of leukemias, and might represent a unifying
      Achilles' heel of kinase-driven cancers.

TI  - Gpr124 is essential for blood-brain barrier integrity in central nervous system
      disease.
PG  - 450-460
LID - 10.1038/nm.4309 [doi]
AB  - Although blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of
      diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins
      that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled
      receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain
      angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in 
      adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the
      endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted
      in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic
      stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical
      Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling
      fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice,
      with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and
      extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR
      specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under
      pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a
      potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB
      disruption.

TI  - HRDetect is a predictor of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency based on mutational
      signatures.
PG  - 517-525
LID - 10.1038/nm.4292 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 1-5% of breast cancers are attributed to inherited mutations in
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 and are selectively sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) inhibitors. In other cancer types, germline and/or somatic mutations in
      BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/BRCA2) also confer selective sensitivity to PARP
      inhibitors. Thus, assays to detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors have been sought.
      Recently, somatic substitution, insertion/deletion and rearrangement patterns, or
      'mutational signatures', were associated with BRCA1/BRCA2 dysfunction. Herein we 
      used a lasso logistic regression model to identify six distinguishing mutational 
      signatures predictive of BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. A weighted model called HRDetect
      was developed to accurately detect BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient samples. HRDetect
      identifies BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient tumors with 98.7% sensitivity (area under the
      curve (AUC) = 0.98). Application of this model in a cohort of 560 individuals
      with breast cancer, of whom 22 were known to carry a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2
      mutation, allowed us to identify an additional 22 tumors with somatic loss of
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 47 tumors with functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency where no
      mutation was detected. We validated HRDetect on independent cohorts of breast,
      ovarian and pancreatic cancers and demonstrated its efficacy in alternative
      sequencing strategies. Integrating all of the classes of mutational signatures
      thus reveals a larger proportion of individuals with breast cancer harboring
      BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency (up to 22%) than hitherto appreciated ( approximately
      1-5%) who could have selective therapeutic sensitivity to PARP inhibition.

AB  - Efficient hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homing is important for hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT), especially when HSC numbers are limited, as in the
      use of cord blood (CB). In a screen of small-molecule compounds, we identified
      glucocorticoid (GC) hormone signaling as an activator of CXCR4 expression in
      human CB HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Short-term GC
      pretreatment of human CB HSCs and HPCs promoted SDF-1-CXCR4-axis-mediated
      chemotaxis, homing, and long-term engraftment when these cells were transplanted 
      into primary- and secondary-recipient NSG mice. Mechanistically, activated
      glucocorticoid receptor binds directly to a glucocorticoid response element in
      the CXCR4 promoter and recruits the SRC-1-p300 complex to promote H4K5 and H4K16 
      histone acetylation, facilitating transcription of CXCR4. These results suggest a
      new and readily available means to enhance the clinical efficacy of CB HCT.

AB  - Cisplatin and its platinum analogs, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are some of the 
      most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics. Although cisplatin and carboplatin are
      used primarily in germ cell, breast and lung malignancies, oxaliplatin is instead
      used almost exclusively to treat colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers.
      Here we utilize a unique, multi-platform genetic approach to study the mechanism 
      of action of these clinically established platinum anti-cancer agents, as well as
      more recently developed cisplatin analogs. We show that oxaliplatin, unlike
      cisplatin and carboplatin, does not kill cells through the DNA-damage response.
      Rather, oxaliplatin kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress. This
      difference in drug mechanism explains the distinct clinical implementation of
      oxaliplatin relative to cisplatin, and it might enable mechanistically informed
      selection of distinct platinum drugs for distinct malignancies. These data
      highlight the functional diversity of core components of front-line cancer
      therapy and the potential benefits of applying a mechanism-based rationale to the
      use of our current arsenal of anti-cancer drugs.

TI  - Deficiency of the hepatokine selenoprotein P increases responsiveness to exercise
      in mice through upregulation of reactive oxygen species and AMP-activated protein
      kinase in muscle.
PG  - 508-516
LID - 10.1038/nm.4295 [doi]
AB  - Exercise has numerous health-promoting effects in humans; however, individual
      responsiveness to exercise with regard to endurance or metabolic health differs
      markedly. This 'exercise resistance' is considered to be congenital, with no
      evident acquired causative factors. Here we show that the anti-oxidative
      hepatokine selenoprotein P (SeP) causes exercise resistance through its muscle
      receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). SeP-deficient
      mice showed a 'super-endurance' phenotype after exercise training, as well as
      enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK) phosphorylation and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma
      coactivator (Ppargc)-1alpha (also known as PGC-1alpha; encoded by Ppargc1a)
      expression in skeletal muscle. Supplementation with the anti-oxidant
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced ROS production and the endurance capacity in
      SeP-deficient mice. SeP treatment impaired hydrogen-peroxide-induced adaptations 
      through LRP1 in cultured myotubes and suppressed exercise-induced AMPK
      phosphorylation and Ppargc1a gene expression in mouse skeletal muscle-effects
      which were blunted in mice with a muscle-specific LRP1 deficiency. Furthermore,
      we found that increased amounts of circulating SeP predicted the ineffectiveness 
      of training on endurance capacity in humans. Our study suggests that inhibitors
      of the SeP-LRP1 axis may function as exercise-enhancing drugs to treat diseases
      associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

TI  - EZH2 is a potential therapeutic target for H3K27M-mutant pediatric gliomas.
PG  - 483-492
LID - 10.1038/nm.4293 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive brain tumor that is
      located in the pons and primarily affects children. Nearly 80% of DIPGs harbor
      mutations in histone H3 genes, wherein lysine 27 is substituted with methionine
      (H3K27M). H3K27M has been shown to inhibit polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), 
      a multiprotein complex responsible for the methylation of H3 at lysine 27
      (H3K27me), by binding to its catalytic subunit EZH2. Although DIPGs with the
      H3K27M mutation show global loss of H3K27me3, several genes retain H3K27me3. Here
      we describe a mouse model of DIPG in which H3K27M potentiates tumorigenesis.
      Using this model and primary patient-derived DIPG cell lines, we show that
      H3K27M-expressing tumors require PRC2 for proliferation. Furthermore, we
      demonstrate that small-molecule EZH2 inhibitors abolish tumor cell growth through
      a mechanism that is dependent on the induction of the tumor-suppressor protein
      p16(INK4A). Genome-wide enrichment analyses show that the genes that retain
      H3K27me3 in H3K27M cells are strong polycomb targets. Furthermore, we find a
      highly significant overlap between genes that retain H3K27me3 in the DIPG mouse
      model and in human primary DIPGs expressing H3K27M. Taken together, these results
      show that residual PRC2 activity is required for the proliferation of
      H3K27M-expressing DIPGs, and that inhibition of EZH2 is a potential therapeutic
      strategy for the treatment of these tumors.

AB  - Identification of epitopes that are recognized by diabetogenic T cells and cause 
      selective beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has focused on peptides 
      originating from native beta cell proteins. Translational errors represent a
      major potential source of antigenic peptides to which central immune tolerance is
      lacking. Here, we describe an alternative open reading frame within human insulin
      mRNA encoding a highly immunogenic polypeptide that is targeted by T cells in T1D
      patients. We show that cytotoxic T cells directed against the N-terminal peptide 
      of this nonconventional product are present in the circulation of individuals
      diagnosed with T1D, and we provide direct evidence that such CD8(+) T cells are
      capable of killing human beta cells and thereby may be diabetogenic. This study
      reveals a new source of nonconventional polypeptides that act as self-epitopes in
      clinical autoimmune disease.

TI  - Therapeutic targeting of polycomb and BET bromodomain proteins in diffuse
      intrinsic pontine gliomas.
PG  - 493-500
LID - 10.1038/nm.4296 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a highly aggressive pediatric
      brainstem tumor characterized by rapid and uniform patient demise. A heterozygous
      point mutation of histone H3 occurs in more than 80% of these tumors and results 
      in a lysine-to-methionine substitution (H3K27M). Expression of this histone
      mutant is accompanied by a reduction in the levels of polycomb repressive complex
      2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and this is hypothesized to be
      a driving event of DIPG oncogenesis. Despite a major loss of H3K27me3, PRC2
      activity is still detected in DIPG cells positive for H3K27M. To investigate the 
      functional roles of H3K27M and PRC2 in DIPG pathogenesis, we profiled the
      epigenome of H3K27M-mutant DIPG cells and found that H3K27M associates with
      increased H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). In accordance with previous biochemical
      data, the majority of the heterotypic H3K27M-K27ac nucleosomes colocalize with
      bromodomain proteins at the loci of actively transcribed genes, whereas PRC2 is
      excluded from these regions; this suggests that H3K27M does not sequester PRC2 on
      chromatin. Residual PRC2 activity is required to maintain DIPG proliferative
      potential, by repressing neuronal differentiation and function. Finally, to
      examine the therapeutic potential of blocking the recruitment of bromodomain
      proteins by heterotypic H3K27M-K27ac nucleosomes in DIPG cells, we performed
      treatments in vivo with BET bromodomain inhibitors and demonstrate that they
      efficiently inhibit tumor progression, thus identifying this class of compounds
      as potential therapeutics in DIPG.

TI  - Targeting CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator ameliorates nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis in mice and nonhuman primates.
PG  - 439-449
LID - 10.1038/nm.4290 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive disease that is often
      accompanied by metabolic syndrome and poses a high risk of severe liver damage.
      However, no effective pharmacological treatment is currently available for NASH. 
      Here we report that CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) is a key
      suppressor of steatohepatitis and its metabolic disorders. We provide mechanistic
      evidence that CFLAR directly targets the kinase MAP3K5 (also known as ASK1) and
      interrupts its N-terminus-mediated dimerization, thereby blocking signaling
      involving ASK1 and the kinase MAPK8 (also known as JNK1). Furthermore, we
      identified a small peptide segment in CFLAR that effectively attenuates the
      progression of steatohepatitis and metabolic disorders in both mice and monkeys
      by disrupting the N-terminus-mediated dimerization of ASK1 when the peptide is
      expressed from an injected adenovirus-associated virus 8-based vector. Taken
      together, these findings establish CFLAR as a key suppressor of steatohepatitis
      and indicate that the development of CFLAR-peptide-mimicking drugs and the
      screening of small-molecular inhibitors that specifically block ASK1 dimerization
      are new and feasible approaches for NASH treatment.

TI  - Transgenic expression of human APOL1 risk variants in podocytes induces kidney
      disease in mice.
PG  - 429-438
LID - 10.1038/nm.4287 [doi]
AB  - African Americans have a heightened risk of developing chronic and end-stage
      kidney disease, an association that is largely attributed to two common genetic
      variants, termed G1 and G2, in the APOL1 gene. Direct evidence demonstrating that
      these APOL1 risk alleles are pathogenic is still lacking because the APOL1 gene
      is present in only some primates and humans; thus it has been challenging to
      demonstrate experimental proof of causality of these risk alleles for renal
      disease. Here we generated mice with podocyte-specific inducible expression of
      the APOL1 reference allele (termed G0) or each of the risk-conferring alleles (G1
      or G2). We show that mice with podocyte-specific expression of either APOL1 risk 
      allele, but not of the G0 allele, develop functional (albuminuria and azotemia), 
      structural (foot-process effacement and glomerulosclerosis) and molecular
      (gene-expression) changes that closely resemble human kidney disease. Disease
      development was cell-type specific and likely reversible, and the severity
      correlated with the level of expression of the risk allele. We further found that
      expression of the risk-variant APOL1 alleles interferes with endosomal
      trafficking and blocks autophagic flux, which ultimately leads to
      inflammatory-mediated podocyte death and glomerular scarring. In summary, this is
      the first demonstration that the expression of APOL1 risk alleles is causal for
      altered podocyte function and glomerular disease in vivo.

TI  - An emerging role for neutrophil extracellular traps in noninfectious disease.
PG  - 279-287
LID - 10.1038/nm.4294 [doi]
AB  - The production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is a process that enables
      neutrophils to help catch and kill bacteria. However, increasing evidence
      suggests that this process might also occur in noninfectious, sterile
      inflammation. In this Review, we describe the role of NETosis in autoimmunity,
      coagulation, acute injuries and cancer, and discuss NETs as potential therapeutic
      targets. Furthermore, we consider whether extracellular DNA is always detrimental
      in sterile inflammation and whether the source is always NETs.

PG  - 301-313
LID - 10.1038/nm.4283 [doi]
AB  - Expression of the MECOM (also known as EVI1) proto-oncogene is deregulated by
      chromosomal translocations in some cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is
      associated with poor clinical outcome. Here, through transcriptomic and
      metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic cells, we reveal that EVI1 overexpression 
      alters cellular metabolism. A screen using pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
      identified the ATP-buffering, mitochondrial creatine kinase CKMT1 as necessary
      for survival of EVI1-expressing cells in subjects with EVI1-positive AML. EVI1
      promotes CKMT1 expression by repressing the myeloid differentiation regulator
      RUNX1. Suppression of arginine-creatine metabolism by CKMT1-directed shRNAs or by
      the small molecule cyclocreatine selectively decreased the viability, promoted
      the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human EVI1-positive cell lines, and
      prolonged survival in both orthotopic xenograft models and mouse models of
      primary AML. CKMT1 inhibition altered mitochondrial respiration and ATP
      production, an effect that was abrogated by phosphocreatine-mediated reactivation
      of the arginine-creatine pathway. Targeting CKMT1 is thus a promising therapeutic
      strategy for this EVI1-driven AML subtype that is highly resistant to current
      treatment regimens.

TI  - Sirtuin 1 regulates cardiac electrical activity by deacetylating the cardiac
      sodium channel.
PG  - 361-367
LID - 10.1038/nm.4284 [doi]
AB  - The voltage-gated cardiac Na(+) channel (Nav1.5), encoded by the SCN5A gene,
      conducts the inward depolarizing cardiac Na(+) current (INa) and is vital for
      normal cardiac electrical activity. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A
      lead to defects in the generation and conduction of the cardiac electrical
      impulse and are associated with various arrhythmia phenotypes. Here we show that 
      sirtuin 1 deacetylase (Sirt1) deacetylates Nav1.5 at lysine 1479 (K1479) and
      stimulates INa via lysine-deacetylation-mediated trafficking of Nav1.5 to the
      plasma membrane. Cardiac Sirt1 deficiency in mice induces hyperacetylation of
      K1479 in Nav1.5, decreases expression of Nav1.5 on the cardiomyocyte membrane,
      reduces INa and leads to cardiac conduction abnormalities and premature death
      owing to arrhythmia. The arrhythmic phenotype of cardiac-Sirt1-deficient mice
      recapitulated human cardiac arrhythmias resulting from loss of function of
      Nav1.5. Increased Sirt1 activity or expression results in decreased lysine
      acetylation of Nav1.5, which promotes the trafficking of Nav1.5 to the plasma
      membrane and stimulation of INa. As compared to wild-type Nav1.5, Nav1.5 with
      K1479 mutated to a nonacetylatable residue increases peak INa and is not
      regulated by Sirt1, whereas Nav1.5 with K1479 mutated to mimic acetylation
      decreases INa. Nav1.5 is hyperacetylated on K1479 in the hearts of patients with 
      cardiomyopathy and clinical conduction disease. Thus, Sirt1, by deacetylating
      Nav1.5, plays an essential part in the regulation of INa and cardiac electrical
      activity.

PG  - 291-300
LID - 10.1038/nm.4285 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with the majority of
      mortality resulting from metastatic spread. However, the molecular mechanism by
      which cancer cells acquire the ability to disseminate from primary tumors, seed
      distant organs, and grow into tissue-destructive metastases remains incompletely 
      understood. We combined tumor barcoding in a mouse model of human lung
      adenocarcinoma with unbiased genomic approaches to identify a transcriptional
      program that confers metastatic ability and predicts patient survival.
      Small-scale in vivo screening identified several genes, including Cd109, that
      encode novel pro-metastatic factors. We uncovered signaling mediated by Janus
      kinases (Jaks) and the transcription factor Stat3 as a critical,
      pharmacologically targetable effector of CD109-driven lung cancer metastasis. In 
      summary, by coupling the systematic genomic analysis of purified cancer cells in 
      distinct malignant states from mouse models with extensive human validation, we
      uncovered several key regulators of metastatic ability, including an actionable
      pro-metastatic CD109-Jak-Stat3 axis.

TI  - Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction can restore antiviral activity of exhausted
      HBV-specific CD8 T cells in chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 327-336
LID - 10.1038/nm.4275 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8 T cells are functionally exhausted in
      chronic hepatitis B infection, and this condition can be corrected only partially
      through the modulation of inhibitory pathways, which suggests that a more complex
      molecular interplay underlies T cell exhaustion. To gain broader insight into
      this process and identify additional targets for the restoration of T cell
      function, we compared the transcriptome profiles of HBV-specific CD8 T cells from
      patients with acute and chronic disease with those of HBV-specific CD8 T cells
      from patients able to resolve HBV infection spontaneously and influenza
      (FLU)-specific CD8 T cells from healthy participants. The results indicate that
      exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells are markedly impaired at multiple levels and
      show substantial downregulation of various cellular processes centered on
      extensive mitochondrial alterations. A notable improvement of mitochondrial and
      antiviral CD8 functions was elicited by mitochondrion-targeted antioxidants,
      which suggests a central role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in T cell
      exhaustion. Thus, mitochondria represent promising targets for novel
      reconstitution therapies to treat chronic hepatitis B infection.

      cystinuria.
PG  - 288-290
LID - 10.1038/nm.4280 [doi]
AB  - Cystinuria is an incompletely dominant disorder characterized by defective
      urinary cystine reabsorption that results in the formation of cystine-based
      urinary stones. Current treatment options are limited in their effectiveness at
      preventing stone recurrence and are often poorly tolerated. We report that the
      nutritional supplement alpha-lipoic acid inhibits cystine stone formation in the 
      Slc3a1(-/-) mouse model of cystinuria by increasing the solubility of urinary
      cystine. These findings identify a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical
      treatment of cystinuria.

AB  - A substantial proportion of tumors consist of genotypically distinct
      subpopulations of cancer cells. This intratumor genetic heterogeneity poses a
      substantial challenge for the implementation of precision medicine. Single-cell
      genomics constitutes a powerful approach to resolve complex mixtures of cancer
      cells by tracing cell lineages and discovering cryptic genetic variations that
      would otherwise be obscured in tumor bulk analyses. Because of the chemical
      alterations that result from formalin fixation, single-cell genomic approaches
      have largely remained limited to fresh or rapidly frozen specimens. Here we
      describe the development and validation of a robust and accurate methodology to
      perform whole-genome copy-number profiling of single nuclei obtained from
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor samples. We applied the
      single-cell sequencing approach described here to study the progression from in
      situ to invasive breast cancer, which revealed that ductal carcinomas in situ
      show intratumor genetic heterogeneity at diagnosis and that these lesions may
      progress to invasive breast cancer through a variety of evolutionary processes.

TI  - A distinct innate lymphoid cell population regulates tumor-associated T cells.
PG  - 368-375
LID - 10.1038/nm.4278 [doi]
AB  - Antitumor T cells are subject to multiple mechanisms of negative regulation.
      Recent findings that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate adaptive T cell
      responses led us to examine the regulatory potential of ILCs in the context of
      cancer. We identified a unique ILC population that inhibits tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) from high-grade serous tumors, defined their suppressive
      capacity in vitro, and performed a comprehensive analysis of their phenotype.
      Notably, the presence of this CD56(+)CD3(-) population in TIL cultures was
      associated with reduced T cell numbers, and further functional studies
      demonstrated that this population suppressed TIL expansion and altered TIL
      cytokine production. Transcriptome analysis and phenotypic characterization
      determined that regulatory CD56(+)CD3(-) cells exhibit low cytotoxic activity,
      produce IL-22, and have an expression profile that overlaps with those of natural
      killer (NK) cells and other ILCs. NKp46 was highly expressed by these cells, and 
      addition of anti-NKp46 antibodies to TIL cultures abrogated the ability of these 
      regulatory ILCs to suppress T cell expansion. Notably, the presence of these
      regulatory ILCs in TIL cultures corresponded with a striking reduction in the
      time to disease recurrence. These studies demonstrate that a previously
      uncharacterized ILC population regulates the activity and expansion of
      tumor-associated T cells.

TI  - Blocking microglial pannexin-1 channels alleviates morphine withdrawal in
      rodents.
PG  - 355-360

AB  - Opiates are essential for treating pain, but termination of opiate therapy can
      cause a debilitating withdrawal syndrome in chronic users. To alleviate or avoid 
      the aversive symptoms of withdrawal, many of these individuals continue to use
      opiates. Withdrawal is therefore a key determinant of opiate use in dependent
      individuals, yet its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and effective
      therapies are lacking. Here, we identify the pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel as a
      therapeutic target in opiate withdrawal. We show that withdrawal from morphine
      induces long-term synaptic facilitation in lamina I and II neurons within the
      rodent spinal dorsal horn, a principal site of action for opiate analgesia.
      Genetic ablation of Panx1 in microglia abolished the spinal synaptic facilitation
      and ameliorated the sequelae of morphine withdrawal. Panx1 is unique in its
      permeability to molecules up to 1 kDa in size and its release of ATP. We show
      that Panx1 activation drives ATP release from microglia during morphine
      withdrawal and that degrading endogenous spinal ATP by administering apyrase
      produces a reduction in withdrawal behaviors. Conversely, we found that
      pharmacological inhibition of ATP breakdown exacerbates withdrawal. Treatment
      with a Panx1-blocking peptide ((10)panx) or the clinically used broad-spectrum
      Panx1 blockers, mefloquine or probenecid, suppressed ATP release and reduced
      withdrawal severity. Our results demonstrate that Panx1-mediated ATP release from
      microglia is required for morphine withdrawal in rodents and that blocking Panx1 
      alleviates the severity of withdrawal without affecting opiate analgesia.

TI  - DNA methylation heterogeneity defines a disease spectrum in Ewing sarcoma.
PG  - 386-395
LID - 10.1038/nm.4273 [doi]
AB  - Developmental tumors in children and young adults carry few genetic alterations, 
      yet they have diverse clinical presentation. Focusing on Ewing sarcoma, we sought
      to establish the prevalence and characteristics of epigenetic heterogeneity in
      genetically homogeneous cancers. We performed genome-scale DNA methylation
      sequencing for a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma tumors and analyzed epigenetic
      heterogeneity on three levels: between cancers, between tumors, and within
      tumors. We observed consistent DNA hypomethylation at enhancers regulated by the 
      disease-defining EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, thus establishing epigenomic enhancer
      reprogramming as a ubiquitous and characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma. DNA
      methylation differences between tumors identified a continuous disease spectrum
      underlying Ewing sarcoma, which reflected the strength of an EWS-FLI1 regulatory 
      signature and a continuum between mesenchymal and stem cell signatures. There was
      substantial epigenetic heterogeneity within tumors, particularly in patients with
      metastatic disease. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of 
      epigenetic heterogeneity in Ewing sarcoma and thereby highlights the importance
      of considering nongenetic aspects of tumor heterogeneity in the context of cancer
      biology and personalized medicine.

TI  - Maturation of the infant microbiome community structure and function across
      multiple body sites and in relation to mode of delivery.
PG  - 314-326

AB  - Human microbial communities are characterized by their taxonomic, metagenomic and
      metabolic diversity, which varies by distinct body sites and influences human
      physiology. However, when and how microbial communities within each body niche
      acquire unique taxonomical and functional signatures in early life remains
      underexplored. We thus sought to determine the taxonomic composition and
      potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota across
      multiple body sites and assess the effect of the mode of delivery and its
      potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women in their early
      third trimester (n = 81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling
      through 6 weeks after delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n = 
      81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at the time of delivery. Samples
      across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina
      were collected for each maternal-infant dyad. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and
      sequencing analysis of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA were performed to
      interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota.
      We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were
      relatively homogeneous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable
      exception of the neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks after delivery, the
      infant microbiota structure and function had substantially expanded and
      diversified, with the body site serving as the primary determinant of the
      composition of the bacterial community and its functional capacity. Although
      minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community
      structure were associated with the cesarean mode of delivery in some body sites
      (oral gingiva, nares and skin; R(2) = 0.038), this was not true for neonatal
      stool (meconium; Mann-Whitney P > 0.05), and there was no observable difference
      in community function regardless of delivery mode. For infants at 6 weeks of age,
      the microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with
      demonstrable body site specificity (P < 0.001, R(2) = 0.189) but without
      discernable differences in community structure or function between infants
      delivered vaginally or by cesarean surgery (P = 0.057, R(2) = 0.007). We conclude
      that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes
      substantial reorganization, which is primarily driven by body site and not by
      mode of delivery.

TI  - Nicotine reverses hypofrontality in animal models of addiction and schizophrenia.
PG  - 347-354

AB  - The prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlies higher cognitive processes that are
      modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation by cholinergic
      inputs. PFC spontaneous default activity is altered in neuropsychiatric
      disorders, including schizophrenia-a disorder that can be accompanied by heavy
      smoking. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the
      alpha5 nAChR subunit, that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia.
      Mice with altered nAChR gene function exhibit PFC-dependent behavioral deficits, 
      but it is unknown how the corresponding human polymorphisms alter the cellular
      and circuit mechanisms underlying behavior. Here we show that mice expressing a
      human alpha5 SNP exhibit neurocognitive behavioral deficits in social interaction
      and sensorimotor gating tasks. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake mouse models
      showed that nicotine can differentially influence PFC pyramidal cell activity by 
      nAChR modulation of layer II/III hierarchical inhibitory circuits. In
      alpha5-SNP-expressing and alpha5-knockout mice, lower activity of vasoactive
      intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons resulted in an increased somatostatin
      (SOM) interneuron inhibitory drive over layer II/III pyramidal neurons. The
      decreased activity observed in alpha5-SNP-expressing mice resembles the
      hypofrontality observed in patients with psychiatric disorders, including
      schizophrenia and addiction. Chronic nicotine administration reversed this
      hypofrontality, suggesting that administration of nicotine may represent a
      therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a physiological
      basis for the tendency of patients with schizophrenia to self-medicate by
      smoking.

TI  - JNK1 negatively controls antifungal innate immunity by suppressing CD23
      expression.
PG  - 337-346
LID - 10.1038/nm.4260 [doi]
AB  - Opportunistic fungal infections are a leading cause of death among
      immune-compromised patients, and there is a pressing need to develop new
      antifungal therapeutic agents because of toxicity and resistance to the
      antifungal drugs currently in use. Although C-type lectin receptor- and Toll-like
      receptor-induced signaling pathways are key activators of host antifungal
      immunity, little is known about the mechanisms that negatively regulate host
      immune responses to a fungal infection. Here we found that JNK1 activation
      suppresses antifungal immunity in mice. We showed that JNK1-deficient mice had a 
      significantly higher survival rate than wild-type control mice in response to
      Candida albicans infection, and the expression of JNK1 in hematopoietic innate
      immune cells was critical for this effect. JNK1 deficiency leads to significantly
      higher induction of CD23, a novel C-type lectin receptor, through NFATc1-mediated
      regulation of the CD23 gene promoter. Blocking either CD23 upregulation or
      CD23-dependent nitric oxide production eliminated the enhanced antifungal
      response found in JNK1-deficient mice. Notably, JNK inhibitors exerted potent
      antifungal therapeutic effects in both mouse and human cells infected with C.
      albicans, indicating that JNK1 may be a therapeutic target for treating fungal
      infection.

TI  - alpha-synuclein toxicity in neurodegeneration: mechanism and therapeutic
      strategies.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1038/nm.4269 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in alpha-synuclein dosage lead to familial Parkinson's disease (PD), 
      and its accumulation results in synucleinopathies that include PD, dementia with 
      Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Furthermore, alpha-synuclein
      contributes to the fibrilization of amyloid-b and tau, two key proteins in
      Alzheimer's disease, which suggests a central role for alpha-synuclein toxicity
      in neurodegeneration. Recent studies of factors contributing to alpha-synuclein
      toxicity and its disruption of downstream cellular pathways have expanded our
      understanding of disease pathogenesis in synucleinopathies. In this Review, we
      discuss these emerging themes, including the contributions of aging, selective
      vulnerability and non-cell-autonomous factors such as alpha-synuclein
      cell-to-cell propagation and neuroinflammation. Finally, we summarize recent
      efforts toward the development of targeted therapies for PD and related
      synucleinopathies.

TI  - Loss of mu opioid receptor signaling in nociceptors, but not microglia, abrogates
      morphine tolerance without disrupting analgesia.
PG  - 164-173
LID - 10.1038/nm.4262 [doi]
AB  - Opioid pain medications have detrimental side effects including analgesic
      tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Tolerance and OIH counteract
      opioid analgesia and drive dose escalation. The cell types and receptors on which
      opioids act to initiate these maladaptive processes remain disputed, which has
      prevented the development of therapies to maximize and sustain opioid analgesic
      efficacy. We found that mu opioid receptors (MORs) expressed by primary afferent 
      nociceptors initiate tolerance and OIH development. RNA sequencing and
      histological analysis revealed that MORs are expressed by nociceptors, but not by
      spinal microglia. Deletion of MORs specifically in nociceptors eliminated
      morphine tolerance, OIH and pronociceptive synaptic long-term potentiation
      without altering antinociception. Furthermore, we found that co-administration of
      methylnaltrexone bromide, a peripherally restricted MOR antagonist, was
      sufficient to abrogate morphine tolerance and OIH without diminishing
      antinociception in perioperative and chronic pain models. Collectively, our data 
      support the idea that opioid agonists can be combined with peripheral MOR
      antagonists to limit analgesic tolerance and OIH.

PG  - 185-191
LID - 10.1038/nm.4268 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal antibody 10-1074 targets the V3 glycan supersite on the HIV-1 envelope
      (Env) protein. It is among the most potent anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies
      isolated so far. Here we report on its safety and activity in 33 individuals who 
      received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody. 10-1074 was well
      tolerated and had a half-life of 24.0 d in participants without HIV-1 infection
      and 12.8 d in individuals with HIV-1 infection. Thirteen individuals with viremia
      received the highest dose of 30 mg/kg 10-1074. Eleven of these participants were 
      10-1074-sensitive and showed a rapid decline in viremia by a mean of 1.52 log10
      copies/ml. Virologic analysis revealed the emergence of multiple independent
      10-1074-resistant viruses in the first weeks after infusion. Emerging escape
      variants were generally resistant to the related V3-specific antibody PGT121, but
      remained sensitive to antibodies targeting nonoverlapping epitopes, such as the
      anti-CD4-binding-site antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01. The results demonstrate the
      safety and activity of 10-1074 in humans and support the idea that antibodies
      targeting the V3 glycan supersite might be useful for the treatment and
      prevention of HIV-1 infection.

      into two extreme clinical and immunological states.

LID - 10.1038/nm.4267 [doi]
AB  - Low-grade, chronic inflammation has been associated with many diseases of aging, 
      but the mechanisms responsible for producing this inflammation remain unclear.
      Inflammasomes can drive chronic inflammation in the context of an infectious
      disease or cellular stress, and they trigger the maturation of interleukin-1beta 
      (IL-1beta). Here we find that the expression of specific inflammasome gene
      modules stratifies older individuals into two extremes: those with constitutive
      expression of IL-1beta, nucleotide metabolism dysfunction, elevated oxidative
      stress, high rates of hypertension and arterial stiffness; and those without
      constitutive expression of IL-1beta, who lack these characteristics. Adenine and 
      N(4)-acetylcytidine, nucleotide-derived metabolites that are detectable in the
      blood of the former group, prime and activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, induce the 
      production of IL-1beta, activate platelets and neutrophils and elevate blood
      pressure in mice. In individuals over 85 years of age, the elevated expression of
      inflammasome gene modules was associated with all-cause mortality. Thus,
      targeting inflammasome components may ameliorate chronic inflammation and various
      other age-associated conditions.

TI  - Targeting SAMHD1 with the Vpx protein to improve cytarabine therapy for
      hematological malignancies.
PG  - 256-263
LID - 10.1038/nm.4265 [doi]
AB  - The cytostatic deoxycytidine analog cytarabine (ara-C) is the most active agent
      available against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Together with anthracyclines,
      ara-C forms the backbone of AML treatment for children and adults. In AML, both
      the cytotoxicity of ara-C in vitro and the clinical response to ara-C therapy are
      correlated with the ability of AML blasts to accumulate the active metabolite
      ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), which causes DNA damage through perturbation of DNA
      synthesis. Differences in expression levels of known transporters or metabolic
      enzymes relevant to ara-C only partially account for patient-specific
      differential ara-CTP accumulation in AML blasts and response to ara-C treatment. 
      Here we demonstrate that the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)
      triphosphohydrolase SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) promotes the
      detoxification of intracellular ara-CTP pools. Recombinant SAMHD1 exhibited
      ara-CTPase activity in vitro, and cells in which SAMHD1 expression was
      transiently reduced by treatment with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
      protein Vpx were dramatically more sensitive to ara-C-induced cytotoxicity.
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the gene encoding SAMHD1 sensitized cells to
      ara-C, and this sensitivity could be abrogated by ectopic expression of wild-type
      (WT), but not dNTPase-deficient, SAMHD1. Mouse models of AML lacking SAMHD1 were 
      hypersensitive to ara-C, and treatment ex vivo with Vpx sensitized primary
      patient-derived AML blasts to ara-C. Finally, we identified SAMHD1 as a risk
      factor in cohorts of both pediatric and adult patients with de novo AML who
      received ara-C treatment. Thus, SAMHD1 expression levels dictate patient
      sensitivity to ara-C, providing proof-of-concept that the targeting of SAMHD1 by 
      Vpx could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for potentiating ara-C efficacy
      in hematological malignancies.

TI  - Donor CD19 CAR T cells exert potent graft-versus-lymphoma activity with
      diminished graft-versus-host activity.
PG  - 242-249
LID - 10.1038/nm.4258 [doi]
AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially
      curative therapy for hematological malignancies. However, graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and relapse after allo-HSCT remain major impediments to the
      success of allo-HSCT. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) direct tumor cell
      recognition of adoptively transferred T cells. CD19 is an attractive CAR target, 
      which is expressed in most B cell malignancies, as well as in healthy B cells.
      Clinical trials using autologous CD19-targeted T cells have shown remarkable
      promise in various B cell malignancies. However, the use of allogeneic CAR T
      cells poses a concern in that it may increase risk of the occurrence of GVHD,
      although this has not been reported in selected patients infused with
      donor-derived CD19 CAR T cells after allo-HSCT. To understand the mechanism
      whereby allogeneic CD19 CAR T cells may mediate anti-lymphoma activity without
      causing a significant increase in the incidence of GVHD, we studied donor-derived
      CD19 CAR T cells in allo-HSCT and lymphoma models in mice. We demonstrate that
      alloreactive T cells expressing CD28-costimulated CD19 CARs experience enhanced
      stimulation, resulting in the progressive loss of both their effector function
      and proliferative potential, clonal deletion, and significantly decreased
      occurrence of GVHD. Concurrently, the other CAR T cells that were present in bulk
      donor T cell populations retained their anti-lymphoma activity in accordance with
      the requirement that both the T cell receptor (TCR) and CAR be engaged to
      accelerate T cell exhaustion. In contrast, first-generation and
      4-1BB-costimulated CAR T cells increased the occurrence of GVHD. These findings
      could explain the reduced risk of GVHD occurring with cumulative TCR and CAR
      signaling.

AB  - Heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), including Marfan
      syndrome (MFS), currently lack a cure, and causative mutations have been
      identified for only a fraction of affected families. Here we identify the
      metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) as
      therapeutic targets in individuals with TAAD. We show that Adamts1 is a major
      mediator of vascular homeostasis, given that genetic haploinsufficiency of
      Adamts1 in mice causes TAAD similar to MFS. Aortic nitric oxide and Nos2 levels
      were higher in Adamts1-deficient mice and in a mouse model of MFS (hereafter
      referred to as MFS mice), and Nos2 inactivation protected both types of mice from
      aortic pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of Nos2 rapidly reversed aortic
      dilation and medial degeneration in young Adamts1-deficient mice and in young or 
      old MFS mice. Patients with MFS showed elevated NOS2 and decreased ADAMTS1
      protein levels in the aorta. These findings uncover a possible causative role for
      the ADAMTS1-NOS2 axis in human TAAD and warrant evaluation of NOS2 inhibitors for
      therapy.

TI  - Targeting the histone methyltransferase G9a activates imprinted genes and
      improves survival of a mouse model of Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG  - 213-222
LID - 10.1038/nm.4257 [doi]
AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinting disorder caused by a deficiency of
      paternally expressed gene(s) in the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region. The regulation 
      of imprinted gene expression in this region is coordinated by an imprinting
      center (PWS-IC). In individuals with PWS, genes responsible for PWS on the
      maternal chromosome are present, but repressed epigenetically, which provides an 
      opportunity for the use of epigenetic therapy to restore expression from the
      maternal copies of PWS-associated genes. Through a high-content screen (HCS) of
      >9,000 small molecules, we discovered that UNC0638 and UNC0642-two selective
      inhibitors of euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (EHMT2, also known
      as G9a)-activated the maternal (m) copy of candidate genes underlying PWS,
      including the SnoRNA cluster SNORD116, in cells from humans with PWS and also
      from a mouse model of PWS carrying a paternal (p) deletion from small nuclear
      ribonucleoprotein N (Snrpn (S)) to ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (Ube3a (U))
      (mouse model referred to hereafter as m(+)/p(DeltaS-U)). Both UNC0642 and UNC0638
      caused a selective reduction of the dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9
      (H3K9me2) at PWS-IC, without changing DNA methylation, when analyzed by bisulfite
      genomic sequencing. This indicates that histone modification is essential for the
      imprinting of candidate genes underlying PWS. UNC0642 displayed therapeutic
      effects in the PWS mouse model by improving the survival and the growth of
      m(+)/p(DeltaS-U) newborn pups. This study provides the first proof of principle
      for an epigenetics-based therapy for PWS.

      pancreatic tumors.

AB  - Mammalian tissues rely on a variety of nutrients to support their physiological
      functions. It is known that altered metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of
      cancer, but which nutrients support the inappropriate growth of intact malignant 
      tumors is incompletely understood. Amino acids are essential nutrients for many
      cancer cells that can be obtained through the scavenging and catabolism of
      extracellular protein via macropinocytosis. In particular, macropinocytosis can
      be a nutrient source for pancreatic cancer cells, but it is not fully understood 
      how the tumor environment influences metabolic phenotypes and whether
      macropinocytosis supports the maintenance of amino acid levels within pancreatic 
      tumors. Here we utilize miniaturized plasma exchange to deliver labeled albumin
      to tissues in live mice, and we demonstrate that breakdown of albumin contributes
      to the supply of free amino acids in pancreatic tumors. We also deliver albumin
      directly into tumors using an implantable microdevice, which was adapted and
      modified from ref. 9. Following implantation, we directly observe protein
      catabolism and macropinocytosis in situ by pancreatic cancer cells, but not by
      adjacent, non-cancerous pancreatic tissue. In addition, we find that intratumoral
      inhibition of macropinocytosis decreases amino acid levels. Taken together, these
      data suggest that pancreatic cancer cells consume extracellular protein,
      including albumin, and that this consumption serves as an important source of
      amino acids for pancreatic cancer cells in vivo.

TI  - SAMHD1 is a biomarker for cytarabine response and a therapeutic target in acute
      myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 250-255
LID - 10.1038/nm.4255 [doi]
AB  - The nucleoside analog cytarabine (Ara-C) is an essential component of primary and
      salvage chemotherapy regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After cellular
      uptake, Ara-C is converted into its therapeutically active triphosphate
      metabolite, Ara-CTP, which exerts antileukemic effects, primarily by inhibiting
      DNA synthesis in proliferating cells. Currently, a substantial fraction of
      patients with AML fail to respond effectively to Ara-C therapy, and reliable
      biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic response to Ara-C are lacking. SAMHD1
      is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that cleaves
      physiological dNTPs into deoxyribonucleosides and inorganic triphosphate.
      Although it has been postulated that SAMHD1 sensitizes cancer cells to
      nucleoside-analog derivatives through the depletion of competing dNTPs, we show
      here that SAMHD1 reduces Ara-C cytotoxicity in AML cells. Mechanistically,
      dGTP-activated SAMHD1 hydrolyzes Ara-CTP, which results in a drastic reduction of
      Ara-CTP in leukemic cells. Loss of SAMHD1 activity-through genetic depletion,
      mutational inactivation of its triphosphohydrolase activity or proteasomal
      degradation using specialized, virus-like particles-potentiates the cytotoxicity 
      of Ara-C in AML cells. In mouse models of retroviral AML transplantation, as well
      as in retrospective analyses of adult patients with AML, the response to
      Ara-C-containing therapy was inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression. These
      results identify SAMHD1 as a potential biomarker for the stratification of
      patients with AML who might best respond to Ara-C-based therapy and as a target
      for treating Ara-C-refractory AML.

TI  - Dissociation of muscle insulin sensitivity from exercise endurance in mice by
      HDAC3 depletion.
PG  - 223-234
LID - 10.1038/nm.4245 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are associated with reduced glucose
      utilization in the muscle and poor exercise performance. Here we find that
      depletion of the epigenome modifier histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) specifically in
      skeletal muscle causes severe systemic insulin resistance in mice but markedly
      enhances endurance and resistance to muscle fatigue, despite reducing muscle
      force. This seemingly paradoxical phenotype is due to lower glucose utilization
      and greater lipid oxidation in HDAC3-depleted muscles, a fuel switch caused by
      the activation of anaplerotic reactions driven by AMP deaminase 3 (Ampd3) and
      catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. These findings highlight the pivotal
      role of amino acid catabolism in muscle fatigue and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.
      Further, as genome occupancy of HDAC3 in skeletal muscle is controlled by the
      circadian clock, these results delineate an epigenomic regulatory mechanism
      through which the circadian clock governs skeletal muscle bioenergetics. These
      findings suggest that physical exercise at certain times of the day or
      pharmacological targeting of HDAC3 could potentially be harnessed to alter
      systemic fuel metabolism and exercise performance.

TI  - A chikungunya fever vaccine utilizing an insect-specific virus platform.
PG  - 192-199
LID - 10.1038/nm.4253 [doi]
AB  - Traditionally, vaccine development involves tradeoffs between immunogenicity and 
      safety. Live-attenuated vaccines typically offer rapid and durable immunity but
      have reduced safety when compared to inactivated vaccines. In contrast, the
      inability of inactivated vaccines to replicate enhances safety at the expense of 
      immunogenicity, often necessitating multiple doses and boosters. To overcome
      these tradeoffs, we developed the insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus (EILV),
      as a vaccine platform. To address the chikungunya fever (CHIKF) pandemic, we used
      an EILV cDNA clone to design a chimeric virus containing the chikungunya virus
      (CHIKV) structural proteins. The recombinant EILV/CHIKV was structurally
      identical at 10 A to wild-type CHIKV, as determined by single-particle
      cryo-electron microscopy, and it mimicked the early stages of CHIKV replication
      in vertebrate cells from attachment and entry to viral RNA delivery. Yet the
      recombinant virus remained completely defective for productive replication,
      providing a high degree of safety. A single dose of EILV/CHIKV produced in
      mosquito cells elicited rapid (within 4 d) and long-lasting (>290 d) neutralizing
      antibodies that provided complete protection in two different mouse models. In
      nonhuman primates, EILV/CHIKV elicited rapid and robust immunity that protected
      against viremia and telemetrically monitored fever. Our EILV platform represents 
      the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in
      preclinical vaccine development and highlights the potential application of such 
      viruses in vaccinology.

TI  - T memory stem cells in health and disease.
PG  - 18-27
LID - 10.1038/nm.4241 [doi]
AB  - T memory stem (TSCM) cells are a rare subset of memory lymphocytes endowed with
      the stem cell-like ability to self-renew and the multipotent capacity to
      reconstitute the entire spectrum of memory and effector T cell subsets.
      Cumulative evidence in mice, nonhuman primates and humans indicates that TSCM
      cells are minimally differentiated cells at the apex of the hierarchical system
      of memory T lymphocytes. Here we describe emerging findings demonstrating that
      TSCM cells, owing to their extreme longevity and robust potential for immune
      reconstitution, are central players in many physiological and pathological human 
      processes. We also discuss how TSCM cell stemness could be leveraged
      therapeutically to enhance the efficacy of vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies
      for cancer and infectious diseases or, conversely, how it could be disrupted to
      treat TSCM cell driven and sustained diseases, such as autoimmunity, adult T cell
      leukemia and HIV-1.

TI  - Fasting selectively blocks development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia via
      leptin-receptor upregulation.
PG  - 79-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.4252 [doi]
AB  - New therapeutic approaches are needed to treat leukemia effectively. Dietary
      restriction regimens, including fasting, have been considered for the prevention 
      and treatment of certain solid tumor types. However, whether and how dietary
      restriction affects hematopoietic malignancies is unknown. Here we report that
      fasting alone robustly inhibits the initiation and reverses the leukemic
      progression of both B cell and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL and
      T-ALL, respectively), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in mouse models of
      these tumors. Mechanistically, we found that attenuated leptin-receptor (LEPR)
      expression is essential for the development and maintenance of ALL, and that
      fasting inhibits ALL development by upregulation of LEPR and its downstream
      signaling through the protein PR/SET domain 1 (PRDM1). The expression of LEPR
      signaling-related genes correlated with the prognosis of pediatric patients with 
      pre-B-ALL, and fasting effectively inhibited B-ALL growth in a human xenograft
      model. Our results indicate that the effects of fasting on tumor growth are
      cancer-type dependent, and they suggest new avenues for the development of
      treatment strategies for leukemia.

TI  - Loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 induces resistance to multiple drugs
      in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 69-78
LID - 10.1038/nm.4247 [doi]
AB  - In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), therapy resistance frequently occurs, leading to
      high mortality among patients. However, the mechanisms that render leukemic cells
      drug resistant remain largely undefined. Here, we identified loss of the histone 
      methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation
      as a novel pathway of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
      and cytotoxic drugs in AML. Low EZH2 protein levels correlated with poor
      prognosis in AML patients. Suppression of EZH2 protein expression induced
      chemoresistance of AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Low
      EZH2 levels resulted in derepression of HOX genes, and knockdown of HOXB7 and
      HOXA9 in the resistant cells was sufficient to improve sensitivity to TKIs and
      cytotoxic drugs. The endogenous loss of EZH2 expression in resistant cells and
      primary blasts from a subset of relapsed AML patients resulted from enhanced
      CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr487. This interaction was stabilized
      by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and followed by proteasomal degradation of EZH2 
      in drug-resistant cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of HSP90, CDK1 and the
      proteasome prevented EZH2 degradation, decreased HOX gene expression and restored
      drug sensitivity. Finally, patients with reduced EZH2 levels at progression to
      standard therapy responded to the combination of bortezomib and cytarabine,
      concomitant with the re-establishment of EZH2 expression and blast clearance.
      These data suggest restoration of EZH2 protein as a viable approach to overcome
      treatment resistance in this AML patient population.

TI  - Bone marrow-derived immature myeloid cells are a main source of circulating suPAR
      contributing to proteinuric kidney disease.
PG  - 100-106
LID - 10.1038/nm.4242 [doi]
AB  - Excess levels of protein in urine (proteinuria) is a hallmark of kidney disease
      that typically occurs in conjunction with diabetes, hypertension, gene mutations,
      toxins or infections but may also be of unknown cause (idiopathic). Systemic
      soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a circulating factor 
      implicated in the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as 
      focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The cellular source(s) of elevated
      suPAR associated with future and progressing kidney disease is unclear, but is
      likely extra-renal, as the pathological uPAR is circulating and FSGS can recur
      even after a damaged kidney is replaced with a healthy donor organ. Here we
      report that bone marrow (BM) Gr-1(lo) immature myeloid cells are responsible for 
      the elevated, pathological levels of suPAR, as evidenced by BM chimera and BM
      ablation and cell transfer studies. A marked increase of Gr-1(lo) myeloid cells
      was commonly found in the BM of proteinuric animals having high suPAR, and these 
      cells efficiently transmit proteinuria when transferred to healthy mice. In
      accordance with the results seen in suPAR-associated proteinuric animal models,
      in which kidney damage is caused not by local podocyte-selective injury but more 
      likely by systemic insults, a humanized xenograft model of FSGS resulted in an
      expansion of Gr-1(lo) cells in the BM, leading to high plasma suPAR and
      proteinuric kidney disease. Together, these results identify suPAR as a
      functional connection between the BM and the kidney, and they implicate BM
      immature myeloid cells as a key contributor to glomerular dysfunction.

TI  - Interleukin-33-induced expression of PIBF1 by decidual B cells protects against
      preterm labor.
PG  - 128-135
LID - 10.1038/nm.4244 [doi]
AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. Intrauterine 
      and systemic infection and inflammation cause 30-40% of spontaneous preterm labor
      (PTL), which precedes PTB. Although antibody production is a major immune defense
      mechanism against infection, and B cell dysfunction has been implicated in
      pregnancy complications associated with PTL, the functions of B cells in
      pregnancy are not well known. We found that choriodecidua of women undergoing
      spontaneous PTL harbored functionally altered B cell populations. B
      cell-deficient mice were markedly more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to
      PTL after inflammation, but B cells conferred interleukin (IL)-10-independent
      protection against PTL. B cell deficiency in mice resulted in a lower uterine
      level of active progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1), and therapeutic
      administration of PIBF1 mitigated PTL and uterine inflammation in B
      cell-deficient mice. B cells are a significant producer of PIBF1 in human
      choriodecidua and mouse uterus in late gestation. PIBF1 expression by B cells is 
      induced by the mucosal alarmin IL-33 (ref. 9). Human PTL was associated with
      diminished expression of the alpha-chain of IL-33 receptor on choriodecidual B
      cells and a lower level of active PIBF1 in late gestation choriodecidua. These
      results define a vital regulatory cascade involving IL-33, decidual B cells and
      PIBF1 in safeguarding term pregnancy and suggest new therapeutic approaches based
      on IL-33 and PIBF1 to prevent human PTL.

TI  - Dickkopf-1 promotes hematopoietic regeneration via direct and niche-mediated
      mechanisms.
PG  - 91-99
LID - 10.1038/nm.4251 [doi]
AB  - The role of osteolineage cells in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      regeneration following myelosuppression is not well understood. Here we show that
      deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bax in osterix (Osx, also known as
      Sp7 transcription factor 7)-expressing cells in mice promotes HSC regeneration
      and hematopoietic radioprotection following total body irradiation. These mice
      showed increased bone marrow (BM) levels of the protein dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which 
      was produced in Osx-expressing BM cells. Treatment of irradiated HSCs with Dkk1
      in vitro increased the recovery of both long-term repopulating HSCs and
      progenitor cells, and systemic administration of Dkk1 to irradiated mice
      increased hematopoietic recovery and improved survival. Conversely, inducible
      deletion of one allele of Dkk1 in Osx-expressing cells in adult mice inhibited
      the recovery of BM stem and progenitor cells and of complete blood counts
      following irradiation. Dkk1 promoted hematopoietic regeneration via both direct
      effects on HSCs, in which treatment with Dkk1 decreased the levels of
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and suppressed senescence, and indirect
      effects on BM endothelial cells, in which treatment with Dkk1 induced epidermal
      growth factor (EGF) secretion. Accordingly, blockade of the EGF receptor
      partially abrogated Dkk1-mediated hematopoietic recovery. These data identify
      Dkk1 as a regulator of hematopoietic regeneration and demonstrate paracrine
      cross-talk between BM osteolineage cells and endothelial cells in regulating
      hematopoietic reconstitution following injury.

TI  - Resting-state connectivity biomarkers define neurophysiological subtypes of
      depression.
PG  - 28-38
LID - 10.1038/nm.4246 [doi]
AB  - Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in
      psychiatry, partly because there is a weak correspondence between diagnostic
      labels and their neurobiological substrates. Like other neuropsychiatric
      disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous
      syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses
      to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large
      multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be
      subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes ('biotypes') defined by distinct
      patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks.
      Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic
      classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82-93%) sensitivity and specificity for
      depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample
      replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely
      on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing
      clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial
      magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of
      depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for
      identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted
      neurostimulation therapies.

TI  - A purified membrane protein from Akkermansia muciniphila or the pasteurized
      bacterium improves metabolism in obese and diabetic mice.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.1038/nm.4236 [doi]
AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with low-grade inflammation and
      specific changes in gut microbiota composition. We previously demonstrated that
      administration of Akkermansia muciniphila to mice prevents the development of
      obesity and associated complications. However, the underlying mechanisms of this 
      protective effect remain unclear. Moreover, the sensitivity of A. muciniphila to 
      oxygen and the presence of animal-derived compounds in its growth medium
      currently limit the development of translational approaches for human medicine.
      We have addressed these issues here by showing that A. muciniphila retains its
      efficacy when grown on a synthetic medium compatible with human administration.
      Unexpectedly, we discovered that pasteurization of A. muciniphila enhanced its
      capacity to reduce fat mass development, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in
      mice. These improvements were notably associated with a modulation of the host
      urinary metabolomics profile and intestinal energy absorption. We demonstrated
      that Amuc_1100, a specific protein isolated from the outer membrane of A.
      muciniphila, interacts with Toll-like receptor 2, is stable at temperatures used 
      for pasteurization, improves the gut barrier and partly recapitulates the
      beneficial effects of the bacterium. Finally, we showed that administration of
      live or pasteurized A. muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium is safe in
      humans. These findings provide support for the use of different preparations of
      A. muciniphila as therapeutic options to target human obesity and associated
      disorders.

TI  - Thalamic miR-338-3p mediates auditory thalamocortical disruption and its late
      onset in models of 22q11.2 microdeletion.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.1038/nm.4240 [doi]
AB  - Although 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with early-life
      behavioral abnormalities, affected individuals are also at high risk for the
      development of schizophrenia symptoms, including psychosis, later in life.
      Auditory thalamocortical (TC) projections recently emerged as a neural circuit
      that is specifically disrupted in mouse models of 22q11DS (hereafter referred to 
      as 22q11DS mice), in which haploinsufficiency of the microRNA
      (miRNA)-processing-factor-encoding gene Dgcr8 results in the elevation of the
      dopamine receptor Drd2 in the auditory thalamus, an abnormal sensitivity of
      thalamocortical projections to antipsychotics, and an abnormal acoustic-startle
      response. Here we show that these auditory TC phenotypes have a delayed onset in 
      22q11DS mice and are associated with an age-dependent reduction of miR-338-3p, a 
      miRNA that targets Drd2 and is enriched in the thalamus of both humans and mice. 
      Replenishing depleted miR-338-3p in mature 22q11DS mice rescued the TC
      abnormalities, and deletion of Mir338 (which encodes miR-338-3p) or reduction of 
      miR-338-3p expression mimicked the TC and behavioral deficits and eliminated the 
      age dependence of these deficits. Therefore, miR-338-3p depletion is necessary
      and sufficient to disrupt auditory TC signaling in 22q11DS mice, and it may
      mediate the pathogenic mechanism of 22q11DS-related psychosis and control its
      late onset.

TI  - Engineered human pluripotent-stem-cell-derived intestinal tissues with a
      functional enteric nervous system.
PG  - 49-59
LID - 10.1038/nm.4233 [doi]
AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gastrointestinal tract controls many
      diverse functions, including motility and epithelial permeability. Perturbations 
      in ENS development or function are common, yet there is no human model for
      studying ENS-intestinal biology and disease. We used a tissue-engineering
      approach with embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to generate
      human intestinal tissue containing a functional ENS. We recapitulated normal
      intestinal ENS development by combining human-PSC-derived neural crest cells
      (NCCs) and developing human intestinal organoids (HIOs). NCCs recombined with
      HIOs in vitro migrated into the mesenchyme, differentiated into neurons and glial
      cells and showed neuronal activity, as measured by rhythmic waves of calcium
      transients. ENS-containing HIOs grown in vivo formed neuroglial structures
      similar to a myenteric and submucosal plexus, had functional interstitial cells
      of Cajal and had an electromechanical coupling that regulated waves of
      propagating contraction. Finally, we used this system to investigate the cellular
      and molecular basis for Hirschsprung's disease caused by a mutation in the gene
      PHOX2B. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of
      human-PSC-derived intestinal tissue with a functional ENS and how this system can
      be used to study motility disorders of the human gastrointestinal tract.

      species and suppresses tumor growth.

AB  - Cancer cells experience higher oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) than do non-malignant cells because of genetic alterations and abnormal
      growth; as a result, maintenance of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is
      essential for their survival and proliferation. Under conditions of elevated ROS,
      endogenous L-cysteine (L-Cys) production is insufficient for GSH synthesis. This 
      necessitates uptake of L-Cys that is predominantly in its disulfide form,
      L-cystine (CSSC), via the xCT(-) transporter. We show that administration of an
      engineered and pharmacologically optimized human cyst(e)inase enzyme mediates
      sustained depletion of the extracellular L-Cys and CSSC pool in mice and
      non-human primates. Treatment with this enzyme selectively causes cell cycle
      arrest and death in cancer cells due to depletion of intracellular GSH and
      ensuing elevated ROS; yet this treatment results in no apparent toxicities in
      mice even after months of continuous treatment. Cyst(e)inase suppressed the
      growth of prostate carcinoma allografts, reduced tumor growth in both prostate
      and breast cancer xenografts and doubled the median survival time of
      TCL1-Tg:p53(-/-) mice, which develop disease resembling human chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia. It was observed that enzyme-mediated depletion of the serum L-Cys and
      CSSC pool suppresses the growth of multiple tumors, yet is very well tolerated
      for prolonged periods, suggesting that cyst(e)inase represents a safe and
      effective therapeutic modality for inactivating antioxidant cellular responses in
      a wide range of malignancies.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screens reveal a Wnt-FZD5 signaling circuit as a druggable
      vulnerability of RNF43-mutant pancreatic tumors.
PG  - 60-68
LID - 10.1038/nm.4219 [doi]
AB  - Forward genetic screens with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing enable high-resolution
      detection of genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells. We conducted genome-wide
      CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
      cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we
      discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one
      of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an
      underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor
      level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the
      expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity
      cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that
      specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant
      PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support
      for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a
      patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively
      inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential 
      targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that
      carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting 
      the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC. Our results show
      that CRIPSR-based genetic screens can be leveraged to identify and validate cell 
      surface targets for antibody development and therapy.

TI  - Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells identifies distinct copy-number
      profiles in patients with chemosensitive and chemorefractory small-cell lung
      cancer.
PG  - 114-119
LID - 10.1038/nm.4239 [doi]
AB  - In most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)-a metastatic, aggressive
      disease-the condition is initially chemosensitive but then relapses with acquired
      chemoresistance. In a minority of patients, however, relapse occurs within 3
      months of initial treatment; in these cases, disease is defined as
      chemorefractory. The molecular mechanisms that differentiate chemosensitive from 
      chemorefractory disease are currently unknown. To identify genetic features that 
      distinguish chemosensitive from chemorefractory disease, we examined copy-number 
      aberrations (CNAs) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from pretreatment SCLC blood
      samples. After analysis of 88 CTCs isolated from 13 patients (training set), we
      generated a CNA-based classifier that we validated in 18 additional patients
      (testing set, 112 CTC samples) and in six SCLC patient-derived CTC explant
      tumors. The classifier correctly assigned 83.3% of the cases as chemorefractory
      or chemosensitive. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in
      progression-free survival (PFS) (Kaplan-Meier P value = 0.0166) between patients 
      designated as chemorefractory or chemosensitive by using the baseline CNA
      classifier. Notably, CTC CNA profiles obtained at relapse from five patients with
      initially chemosensitive disease did not switch to a chemorefractory CNA profile,
      which suggests that the genetic basis for initial chemoresistance differs from
      that underlying acquired chemoresistance.

AB  - Together with recent advances in the processing and culture of human tissue,
      bioengineering, xenotransplantation and genome editing, Induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSCs) present a range of new opportunities for the study of human cancer.
      Here we discuss the main advantages and limitations of iPSC modeling, and how the
      method intersects with other patient-derived models of cancer, such as organoids,
      organs-on-chips and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). We highlight the
      opportunities that iPSC models can provide beyond those offered by existing
      systems and animal models and present current challenges and crucial areas for
      future improvements toward wider adoption of this technology.

TI  - Cardioprotection and lifespan extension by the natural polyamine spermidine.
PG  - 1428-1438
LID - 10.1038/nm.4222 [doi]
AB  - Aging is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death.
      Here we show that oral supplementation of the natural polyamine spermidine
      extends the lifespan of mice and exerts cardioprotective effects, reducing
      cardiac hypertrophy and preserving diastolic function in old mice. Spermidine
      feeding enhanced cardiac autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration, and 
      it also improved the mechano-elastical properties of cardiomyocytes in vivo,
      coinciding with increased titin phosphorylation and suppressed subclinical
      inflammation. Spermidine feeding failed to provide cardioprotection in mice that 
      lack the autophagy-related protein Atg5 in cardiomyocytes. In Dahl salt-sensitive
      rats that were fed a high-salt diet, a model for hypertension-induced congestive 
      heart failure, spermidine feeding reduced systemic blood pressure, increased
      titin phosphorylation and prevented cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in
      diastolic function, thus delaying the progression to heart failure. In humans,
      high levels of dietary spermidine, as assessed from food questionnaires,
      correlated with reduced blood pressure and a lower incidence of cardiovascular
      disease. Our results suggest a new and feasible strategy for protection against
      cardiovascular disease.

LID - 10.1038/nm.4220 [doi]
AB  - Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a debilitating disorder that affects derivatives of
      the neural crest (NC). For unknown reasons, people with FD show marked
      differences in disease severity despite carrying an identical, homozygous point
      mutation in IKBKAP, encoding IkappaB kinase complex-associated protein. Here we
      present disease-related phenotypes in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that
      capture FD severity. Cells from individuals with severe but not mild disease show
      impaired specification of NC derivatives, including autonomic and sensory
      neurons. In contrast, cells from individuals with severe and mild FD show defects
      in peripheral neuron survival, indicating that neurodegeneration is the main
      culprit for cases of mild FD. Although genetic repair of the FD-associated
      mutation reversed early developmental NC defects, sensory neuron specification
      was not restored, indicating that other factors may contribute to disease
      severity. Whole-exome sequencing identified candidate modifier genes for
      individuals with severe FD. Our study demonstrates that PSC-based modeling is
      sensitive in recapitulating disease severity, which presents an important step
      toward personalized medicine.

TI  - Hepatitis-C-virus-induced microRNAs dampen interferon-mediated antiviral
      signaling.
PG  - 1475-1481
LID - 10.1038/nm.4211 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 200 million people globally, and 60-80% of cases 
      persist as a chronic infection that will progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer
      in 2-10% of patients. We recently demonstrated that HCV induces aberrant
      expression of two host microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-208b and miR-499a-5p, encoded by
      myosin genes in infected hepatocytes. These miRNAs, along with
      AU-rich-element-mediated decay, suppress IFNL2 and IFNL3, members of the type III
      interferon (IFN) gene family, to support viral persistence. In this study, we
      show that miR-208b and miR-499a-5p also dampen type I IFN signaling in
      HCV-infected hepatocytes by directly down-regulating expression of the type I IFN
      receptor chain, IFNAR1. Inhibition of these miRNAs by using miRNA inhibitors
      during HCV infection increased expression of IFNAR1. Additionally, inhibition
      rescued the antiviral response to exogenous type I IFN, as measured by a marked
      increase in IFN-stimulated genes and a decrease in HCV load. Treatment of
      HCV-infected hepatocytes with type I IFN increased expression of myosins over HCV
      infection alone. Since these miRNAs can suppress type III IFN family members,
      these data collectively define a novel cross-regulation between type I and III
      IFNs during HCV infection.

TI  - DNMT3A mutations promote anthracycline resistance in acute myeloid leukemia via
      impaired nucleosome remodeling.
PG  - 1488-1495
LID - 10.1038/nm.4210 [doi]
AB  - Although the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initially
      respond to chemotherapy, many of them subsequently relapse, and the mechanistic
      basis for AML persistence following chemotherapy has not been determined.
      Recurrent somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), most frequently
      at arginine 882 (DNMT3A(R882)), have been observed in AML and in individuals with
      clonal hematopoiesis in the absence of leukemic transformation. Patients with
      DNMT3A(R882) AML have an inferior outcome when treated with standard-dose
      daunorubicin-based induction chemotherapy, suggesting that DNMT3A(R882) cells
      persist and drive relapse. We found that Dnmt3a mutations induced hematopoietic
      stem cell expansion, cooperated with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 
      gene (Flt3(ITD)) and the nucleophosmin gene (Npm1(c)) to induce AML in vivo, and 
      promoted resistance to anthracycline chemotherapy. In patients with AML, the
      presence of DNMT3A(R882) mutations predicts minimal residual disease,
      underscoring their role in AML chemoresistance. DNMT3A(R882) cells showed
      impaired nucleosome eviction and chromatin remodeling in response to
      anthracycline treatment, which resulted from attenuated recruitment of histone
      chaperone SPT-16 following anthracycline exposure. This defect led to an
      inability to sense and repair DNA torsional stress, which resulted in increased
      mutagenesis. Our findings identify a crucial role for DNMT3A(R882) mutations in
      driving AML chemoresistance and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling 
      in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

TI  - IAP antagonists induce anti-tumor immunity in multiple myeloma.
PG  - 1411-1420
LID - 10.1038/nm.4229 [doi]
AB  - The cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAP) 1 and 2 are amplified in about 3% of 
      cancers and have been identified in multiple malignancies as being potential
      therapeutic targets as a result of their role in the evasion of apoptosis.
      Consequently, small-molecule IAP antagonists, such as LCL161, have entered
      clinical trials for their ability to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated 
      apoptosis of cancer cells. However, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are recurrently homozygously 
      deleted in multiple myeloma (MM), resulting in constitutive activation of the
      noncanonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway. To our surprise, we observed
      robust in vivo anti-myeloma activity of LCL161 in a transgenic myeloma mouse
      model and in patients with relapsed-refractory MM, where the addition of
      cyclophosphamide resulted in a median progression-free-survival of 10 months.
      This effect was not a result of direct induction of tumor cell death, but rather 
      of upregulation of tumor-cell-autonomous type I interferon (IFN) signaling and a 
      strong inflammatory response that resulted in the activation of macrophages and
      dendritic cells, leading to phagocytosis of tumor cells. Treatment of a MM mouse 
      model with LCL161 established long-term anti-tumor protection and induced
      regression in a fraction of the mice. Notably, combination of LCL161 with the
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD1 was curative in all of the treated mice.

TI  - Molecular-level analysis of the serum antibody repertoire in young adults before 
      and after seasonal influenza vaccination.
PG  - 1456-1464
LID - 10.1038/nm.4224 [doi]
AB  - Molecular understanding of serological immunity to influenza has been confounded 
      by the complexity of the polyclonal antibody response in humans. Here we used
      high-resolution proteomics analysis of immunoglobulin (referred to as Ig-seq)
      coupled with high-throughput sequencing of transcripts encoding B cell receptors 
      (BCR-seq) to quantitatively determine the antibody repertoire at the individual
      clonotype level in the sera of young adults before and after vaccination with
      trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The serum repertoire comprised between 40
      and 147 clonotypes that were specific to each of the three monovalent components 
      of the trivalent influenza vaccine, with boosted pre-existing clonotypes
      accounting for approximately 60% of the response. An unexpectedly high fraction
      of serum antibodies recognized both the H1 and H3 monovalent vaccines.
      Recombinant versions of these H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad
      binding to hemagglutinins (HAs) from previously circulating virus strains;
      several of these antibodies, which were prevalent in the serum of multiple
      donors, recognized the same conserved epitope in the HA head domain. Although the
      HA-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show neutralization activity in
      vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains
      when administered before or after challenge. Collectively, our data reveal
      unanticipated insights regarding the serological response to influenza
      vaccination and raise questions about the added benefits of using a quadrivalent 
      vaccine instead of a trivalent vaccine.

AB  - For broad protection against infection by viruses such as influenza or HIV,
      vaccines should elicit antibodies that bind conserved viral epitopes, such as the
      receptor-binding site (RBS). RBS-directed antibodies have been described for both
      HIV and influenza virus, and the design of immunogens to elicit them is a goal of
      vaccine research in both fields. Residues in the RBS of influenza virus
      hemagglutinin (HA) determine a preference for the avian or human receptor,
      alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid, respectively.
      Transmission of an avian-origin virus between humans generally requires one or
      more mutations in the sequences encoding the influenza virus RBS to change the
      preferred receptor from avian to human, but passage of a human-derived vaccine
      candidate in chicken eggs can select for reversion to avian receptor preference. 
      For example, the X-181 strain of the 2009 new pandemic H1N1 influenza virus,
      derived from the A/California/07/2009 isolate and used in essentially all
      vaccines since 2009, has arginine at position 226, a residue known to confer
      preference for an alpha-2,3 linkage in H1 subtype viruses; the wild-type
      A/California/07/2009 isolate, like most circulating human H1N1 viruses, has
      glutamine at position 226. We describe, from three different individuals,
      RBS-directed antibodies that recognize the avian-adapted H1 strain in current
      influenza vaccines but not the circulating new pandemic 2009 virus; Arg226 in the
      vaccine-strain RBS accounts for the restriction. The polyclonal sera of the three
      donors also reflect this preference. Therefore, when vaccines produced from
      strains that are never passaged in avian cells become widely available, they may 
      prove more capable of eliciting RBS-directed, broadly neutralizing antibodies
      than those produced from egg-adapted viruses, extending the established benefits 
      of current seasonal influenza immunizations.

TI  - Forebrain-selective AMPA-receptor antagonism guided by TARP gamma-8 as an
      antiepileptic mechanism.
PG  - 1496-1501
LID - 10.1038/nm.4221 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological manipulation of specific neural circuits to optimize therapeutic 
      index is an unrealized goal in neurology and psychiatry. AMPA receptors are
      important for excitatory synaptic transmission, and their antagonists are
      antiepileptic. Although efficacious, AMPA-receptor antagonists, including
      perampanel (Fycompa), the only approved antagonist for epilepsy, induce dizziness
      and motor impairment. We hypothesized that blockade of forebrain AMPA receptors
      without blocking cerebellar AMPA receptors would be antiepileptic and devoid of
      motor impairment. Taking advantage of an AMPA receptor auxiliary protein, TARP
      gamma-8, which is selectively expressed in the forebrain and modulates the
      pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors, we discovered that LY3130481
      selectively antagonized recombinant and native AMPA receptors containing gamma-8,
      but not gamma-2 (cerebellum) or other TARP members. Two amino acid residues
      unique to gamma-8 determined this selectivity. We also observed antagonism of
      AMPA receptors expressed in hippocampal, but not cerebellar, tissue from an
      patient with epilepsy. Corresponding to this selective activity, LY3130481
      prevented multiple seizure types in rats and mice and without motor side effects.
      These findings demonstrate the first rationally discovered molecule targeting
      specific neural circuitries for therapeutic advantage.

AB  - Development of an effective vaccine against Ebola virus is of high priority.
      However, knowledge about potential correlates of protection and the durability of
      immune response after vaccination is limited. Here, we elucidate the human
      antibody repertoire after administration of vesicular stomatitis virus
      (VSV)-Ebola vaccine at 3 million, 20 million and 100 million plaque-forming units
      (PFU) and homologous VSV-Ebola vaccine boost in healthy adult volunteers. Whole
      genome-fragment phage display libraries, expressing linear and conformational
      epitopes of Ebola glycoprotein (GP), showed higher diversity of antibody epitopes
      in individuals vaccinated with 20 million PFU than in those vaccinated with 3
      million or 100 million PFU. Surface plasmon resonance kinetics showed higher
      levels of GP-binding antibodies after a single vaccination with 20 million or 100
      million PFU than with 3 million PFU, and these correlated strongly with
      neutralization titers. A second vaccination did not boost antibody or virus
      neutralization titers, which declined rapidly, and induced only minimal antibody 
      affinity maturation. Isotype analysis revealed a predominant IgM response even
      after the second vaccination, which contributed substantially to virus
      neutralization in vitro. These findings may help identify new vaccine targets and
      aid development and evaluation of effective countermeasures against Ebola.

TI  - Analysis of self-antigen specificity of islet-infiltrating T cells from human
      donors with type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 1482-1487
LID - 10.1038/nm.4203 [doi]
AB  - A major therapeutic goal for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is to induce
      autoantigen-specific tolerance of T cells. This could suppress autoimmunity in
      those at risk for the development of T1D, as well as in those with established
      disease who receive islet replacement or regeneration therapy. Because functional
      studies of human autoreactive T cell responses have been limited largely to
      peripheral blood-derived T cells, it is unclear how representative the peripheral
      T cell repertoire is of T cells infiltrating the islets. Our knowledge of the
      insulitic T cell repertoire is derived from histological and immunohistochemical 
      analyses of insulitis, the identification of autoreactive CD8(+) T cells in situ,
      in islets of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2(+) donors and isolation and
      identification of DQ8 and DQ2-DQ8 heterodimer-restricted, proinsulin-reactive
      CD4(+) T cells grown from islets of a single donor with T1D. Here we present an
      analysis of 50 of a total of 236 CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell lines grown from
      individual handpicked islets or clones directly sorted from handpicked, dispersed
      islets from nine donors with T1D. Seventeen of these T cell lines and clones
      reacted to a broad range of studied native islet antigens and to
      post-translationally modified peptides. These studies demonstrate the existence
      of a variety of islet-infiltrating, islet-autoantigen reactive T cells in
      individuals with T1D, and these data have implications for the design of
      successful immunotherapies.

TI  - Genomic diversity in autopsy samples reveals within-host dissemination of
      HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 1470-1474

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, especially
      among individuals infected with HIV. Whereas phylogenetic analysis has revealed
      M. tuberculosis spread throughout history and in local outbreaks, much less is
      understood about its dissemination within the body. Here we report genomic
      analysis of 2,693 samples collected post mortem from lung and extrapulmonary
      biopsies of 44 subjects in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, who received minimal
      antitubercular treatment and most of whom were HIV seropositive. We found that
      purifying selection occurred within individual patients, without the need for
      patient-to-patient transmission. Despite negative selection, mycobacteria
      diversified within individuals to form sublineages that co-existed for years.
      These sublineages, as well as distinct strains from mixed infections, were
      differentially distributed throughout the lung, suggesting temporary barriers to 
      pathogen migration. As a consequence, samples taken from the upper airway often
      captured only a fraction of the population diversity, challenging current methods
      of outbreak tracing and resistance diagnostics. Phylogenetic analysis indicated
      that dissemination from the lungs to extrapulmonary sites was as frequent as
      between lung sites, supporting the idea of similar migration routes within and
      between organs, at least in subjects with HIV. Genomic diversity therefore
      provides a record of pathogen diversification and repeated dissemination across
      the body.

TI  - Eradication of large established tumors in mice by combination immunotherapy that
      engages innate and adaptive immune responses.
PG  - 1402-1410
LID - 10.1038/nm.4200 [doi]
AB  - Checkpoint blockade with antibodies specific for cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA)-4 or programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also
      known as PD-1) elicits durable tumor regression in metastatic cancer, but these
      dramatic responses are confined to a minority of patients. This suboptimal
      outcome is probably due in part to the complex network of immunosuppressive
      pathways present in advanced tumors, which are unlikely to be overcome by
      intervention at a single signaling checkpoint. Here we describe a combination
      immunotherapy that recruits a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells to
      eliminate large tumor burdens in syngeneic tumor models and a genetically
      engineered mouse model of melanoma; to our knowledge tumors of this size have not
      previously been curable by treatments relying on endogenous immunity. Maximal
      antitumor efficacy required four components: a tumor-antigen-targeting antibody, 
      a recombinant interleukin-2 with an extended half-life, anti-PD-1 and a powerful 
      T cell vaccine. Depletion experiments revealed that CD8(+) T cells,
      cross-presenting dendritic cells and several other innate immune cell subsets
      were required for tumor regression. Effective treatment induced infiltration of
      immune cells and production of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor, enhanced
      antibody-mediated tumor antigen uptake and promoted antigen spreading. These
      results demonstrate the capacity of an elicited endogenous immune response to
      destroy large, established tumors and elucidate essential characteristics of
      combination immunotherapies that are capable of curing a majority of tumors in
      experimental settings typically viewed as intractable.

TI  - Zika viral dynamics and shedding in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques.
PG  - 1448-1455
LID - 10.1038/nm.4206 [doi]
AB  - Infection with Zika virus has been associated with serious neurological
      complications and fetal abnormalities. However, the dynamics of viral infection, 
      replication and shedding are poorly understood. Here we show that both rhesus and
      cynomolgus macaques are highly susceptible to infection by lineages of Zika virus
      that are closely related to, or are currently circulating in, the Americas. After
      subcutaneous viral inoculation, viral RNA was detected in blood plasma as early
      as 1 d after infection. Viral RNA was also detected in saliva, urine,
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and semen, but transiently in vaginal secretions.
      Although viral RNA during primary infection was cleared from blood plasma and
      urine within 10 d, viral RNA was detectable in saliva and seminal fluids until
      the end of the study, 3 weeks after the resolution of viremia in the blood. The
      control of primary Zika virus infection in the blood was correlated with rapid
      innate and adaptive immune responses. We also identified Zika RNA in tissues,
      including the brain and male and female reproductive tissues, during early and
      late stages of infection. Re-infection of six animals 45 d after primary
      infection with a heterologous strain resulted in complete protection, which
      suggests that primary Zika virus infection elicits protective immunity. Early
      invasion of Zika virus into the nervous system of healthy animals and the extent 
      and duration of shedding in saliva and semen underscore possible concern for

LID - 10.1038/nm.4218 [doi]
AB  - People diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety,
      addiction or schizophrenia often have dysregulated memory, mood, pattern
      separation and/or reward processing. These symptoms are indicative of a disrupted
      function of the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the brain, and they improve with 
      treatment and remission. The dysfunction of the DG is accompanied by structural
      maladaptations, including dysregulation of adult-generated neurons. An increasing
      number of studies using modern inducible approaches to manipulate new neurons
      show that the behavioral symptoms in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders 
      can be produced or exacerbated by the inhibition of DG neurogenesis. Thus, here
      we posit that the connection between neuropsychiatric disorders and dysregulated 
      DG neurogenesis is beyond correlation or epiphenomenon, and that the regulation
      of adult-generated DG neurogenesis merits continued and focused attention in the 
      ongoing effort to develop novel treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - There is a growing understanding that pathological genetic variation and
      environmental insults during sensitive periods in brain development have
      long-term consequences on brain function, which range from learning disabilities 
      to complex psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Furthermore, recent
      experiments in animal models suggest that therapeutic interventions during
      sensitive periods, typically before the onset of clear neurological and
      behavioral symptoms, might prevent or ameliorate the development of specific
      pathologies. These studies suggest that understanding the dynamic nature of the
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders is crucial for the
      development of effective therapies. In this Perspective, I explore the emerging
      concept of developmental windows in psychiatric disorders, their relevance for
      understanding disease progression and their potential for the design of new
      therapies. The limitations and caveats of early interventions in psychiatric
      disorders are also discussed in this context.

AB  - The field of medicine is moving toward the use of biomarkers for the optimization
      of individualized care. This is a particular challenge for the field of
      psychiatry, in which diagnosis is based on a descriptive collection of behaviors 
      without the availability of any objective test to stratify patients. Neuroimaging
      techniques such as molecular imaging with positron-emission tomography (PET) or
      structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide an opportunity
      to bring psychiatry from an era of subjective descriptive classification into
      objective and tangible brain-based measures. Here we provide steps toward the
      development of robust, reliable and valid biomarkers. The success of such
      development is crucial because it will enable the field of psychiatry to move
      forward into the era of modern medicine.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia 
      (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are of great societal and medical importance,
      but the complexity of these diseases and the challenges of modeling the
      development and function of the human brain have made these disorders difficult
      to study experimentally. The recent development of 3D brain organoids derived
      from human pluripotent stem cells offers a promising approach for investigating
      the phenotypic underpinnings of these highly polygenic disorders and for
      understanding the contribution of individual risk variants and complex genetic
      background to human pathology. Here we discuss the advantages, limitations and
      future applications of human brain organoids as in vitro models of
      neuropsychiatric disease.

AB  - Recent genomic studies have revealed the highly polygenic nature of psychiatric
      disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive
      disorder. Many of the individual genetic associations are shared across multiple 
      disorders in a way that points to extensive biological pleiotropy and further
      challenges the biological validity of existing diagnostic approaches. Here we
      argue that the existence of risk alleles specific to a single diagnostic category
      is unlikely. We also highlight some of the important clinical repercussions of
      pleiotropy.

TI  - PIM1 kinase inhibition as a targeted therapy against triple-negative breast
      tumors with elevated MYC expression.
PG  - 1321-1329
LID - 10.1038/nm.4213 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which cells lack expression of the
      estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR) and the ERBB2 (also known 
      as HER2) receptor, is the breast cancer subtype with the poorest outcome. No
      targeted therapy is available against this subtype of cancer owing to a lack of
      validated molecular targets. We previously reported that signaling involving
      MYC-an essential, pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates the expression 
      of hundreds of genes-is disproportionally higher in triple-negative (TN) tumors
      than in receptor-positive (RP) tumors. Direct inhibition of the oncogenic
      transcriptional activity of MYC has been challenging to achieve. Here, by
      conducting a shRNA screen targeting the kinome, we identified PIM1, a
      non-essential serine-threonine kinase, in a synthetic lethal interaction with
      MYC. PIM1 expression was higher in TN tumors than in RP tumors and was associated
      with poor prognosis in patients with hormone- and HER2-negative tumors.
      Small-molecule PIM kinase inhibitors halted the growth of human TN tumors with
      elevated MYC expression in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) and MYC-driven
      transgenic mouse models of breast cancer by inhibiting the oncogenic
      transcriptional activity of MYC and restoring the function of the endogenous cell
      cycle inhibitor, p27. Our findings warrant clinical evaluation of PIM kinase
      inhibitors in patients with TN tumors that have elevated MYC expression.

TI  - PIM1 kinase regulates cell death, tumor growth and chemotherapy response in
      triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 1303-1313
LID - 10.1038/nm.4198 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have poor prognosis and lack targeted
      therapies. Here we identified increased copy number and expression of the PIM1
      proto-oncogene in genomic data sets of patients with TNBC. TNBC cells, but not
      nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, were dependent on PIM1 for proliferation
      and protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown reduced expression of the
      anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and dynamic BH3 profiling of apoptotic priming
      revealed that PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. 
      In TNBC tumors and their cellular models, PIM1 expression was associated with
      several transcriptional signatures involving the transcription factor MYC, and
      PIM1 depletion in TNBC cell lines decreased, in a MYC-dependent manner, cell
      population growth and expression of the MYC target gene MCL1. Treatment with the 
      pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 impaired the growth of both cell line and
      patient-derived xenografts and sensitized them to standard-of-care chemotherapy. 
      This work identifies PIM1 as a malignant-cell-selective target in TNBC and the
      potential use of PIM1 inhibitors for sensitizing TNBC to chemotherapy-induced
      apoptotic cell death.

TI  - Recurrent MET fusion genes represent a drug target in pediatric glioblastoma.
PG  - 1314-1320
LID - 10.1038/nm.4204 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric glioblastoma is one of the most common and most deadly brain tumors in 
      childhood. Using an integrative genetic analysis of 53 pediatric glioblastomas
      and five in vitro model systems, we identified previously unidentified gene
      fusions involving the MET oncogene in approximately 10% of cases. These MET
      fusions activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and, in
      cooperation with lesions compromising cell cycle regulation, induced aggressive
      glial tumors in vivo. MET inhibitors suppressed MET tumor growth in xenograft
      models. Finally, we treated a pediatric patient bearing a MET-fusion-expressing
      glioblastoma with the targeted inhibitor crizotinib. This therapy led to
      substantial tumor shrinkage and associated relief of symptoms, but new
      treatment-resistant lesions appeared, indicating that combination therapies are
      likely necessary to achieve a durable clinical response.

TI  - Vessel co-option mediates resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in liver
      metastases.
PG  - 1294-1302

AB  - The efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer is limited by resistance
      mechanisms that are poorly understood. Notably, instead of through the induction 
      of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic
      mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated
      with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with
      colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is
      also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which
      results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical
      mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the
      actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in
      liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of
      angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of
      angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism
      of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis 
      and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Most human cancers, including myeloma, are preceded by a precursor state. There
      is an unmet need for in vivo models to study the interaction of human
      preneoplastic cells in the bone marrow microenvironment with non-malignant cells.
      Here, we genetically humanized mice to permit the growth of primary human
      preneoplastic and malignant plasma cells together with non-malignant cells in
      vivo. Growth was largely restricted to the bone marrow, mirroring the pattern in 
      patients with myeloma. Xenografts captured the genomic complexity of parental
      tumors and revealed additional somatic changes. Moreover, xenografts from
      patients with preneoplastic gammopathy showed progressive growth, suggesting that
      the clinical stability of these lesions may in part be due to growth controls
      extrinsic to tumor cells. These data demonstrate a new approach to investigate
      the entire spectrum of human plasma cell neoplasia and illustrate the utility of 
      humanized models for understanding the functional diversity of human tumors.

TI  - Caspase-2 cleavage of tau reversibly impairs memory.
PG  - 1268-1276
LID - 10.1038/nm.4199 [doi]
AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, the tau protein forms fibrils,
      which are believed to be neurotoxic. However, fibrillar tau has been dissociated 
      from neuron death and network dysfunction, suggesting the involvement of
      nonfibrillar species. Here we describe a novel pathological process in which
      caspase-2 cleavage of tau at Asp314 impairs cognitive and synaptic function in
      animal and cellular models of tauopathies by promoting the missorting of tau to
      dendritic spines. The truncation product, Deltatau314, resists fibrillation and
      is present at higher levels in brains from cognitively impaired mice and humans
      with AD. The expression of tau mutants that resisted caspase-2 cleavage prevented
      tau from infiltrating spines, dislocating glutamate receptors and impairing
      synaptic function in cultured neurons, and it prevented memory deficits and
      neurodegeneration in mice. Decreasing the levels of caspase-2 restored long-term 
      memory in mice that had existing deficits. Our results suggest an overall
      treatment strategy for re-establishing synaptic function and restoring memory in 
      patients with AD by preventing tau from accumulating in dendritic spines.

TI  - Translocation and dissemination of commensal bacteria in post-stroke infection.
PG  - 1277-1284
LID - 10.1038/nm.4194 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection is highly prevalent in patients who have had a stroke.
      Despite the potential contribution of micro-aspiration in post-stroke pneumonia, 
      we found that the majority of the microorganisms detected in the patients who
      developed infections after having a stroke were common commensal bacteria that
      normally reside in the intestinal tracts. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke,
      post-stroke infection was only observed in mice that were born and raised in
      specific-pathogen-free facilities; this was not seen in mice that were born and
      raised in germ-free facilities. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, we provide evidence demonstrating that
      the source of the bacteria forming the microbial community in the lungs of
      post-stroke mice was indeed the host small intestine. Additionally,
      stroke-induced gut barrier permeability and dysfunction preceded the
      dissemination of orally inoculated bacteria to peripheral tissues. This study
      identifies a novel pathway in which stroke promotes the translocation and
      dissemination of selective strains of bacteria that originated from the host gut 
      microbiota.

AB  - Microsatellite instability (MSI), the spontaneous loss or gain of nucleotides
      from repetitive DNA tracts, is a diagnostic phenotype for gastrointestinal,
      endometrial, and colorectal tumors, yet the landscape of instability events
      across a wider variety of cancer types remains poorly understood. To explore MSI 
      across malignancies, we examined 5,930 cancer exomes from 18 cancer types at more
      than 200,000 microsatellite loci and constructed a genomic classifier for MSI. We
      identified MSI-positive tumors in 14 of the 18 cancer types. We also identified
      loci that were more likely to be unstable in particular cancer types, resulting
      in specific instability signatures that involved cancer-associated genes,
      suggesting that instability patterns reflect selective pressures and can
      potentially identify novel cancer drivers. We also observed a correlation between
      survival outcomes and the overall burden of unstable microsatellites, suggesting 
      that MSI may be a continuous, rather than discrete, phenotype that is informative
      across cancer types. These analyses offer insight into conserved and
      cancer-specific properties of MSI and reveal opportunities for improved methods
      of clinical MSI diagnosis and cancer gene discovery.

TI  - Hyaluronan and TLR4 promote surfactant-protein-C-positive alveolar progenitor
      cell renewal and prevent severe pulmonary fibrosis in mice.
PG  - 1285-1293
LID - 10.1038/nm.4192 [doi]
AB  - Successful recovery from lung injury requires the repair and regeneration of
      alveolar epithelial cells to restore the integrity of gas-exchanging regions
      within the lung and preserve organ function. Improper regeneration of the
      alveolar epithelium is often associated with severe pulmonary fibrosis, the
      latter of which involves the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts, as well
      as matrix accumulation. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) are stem cells
      in the adult lung that contribute to the lung repair process. The mechanisms that
      regulate AEC2 renewal are incompletely understood. We provide evidence that
      expression of the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the
      extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) on AEC2s are important for
      AEC2 renewal, repair of lung injury and limiting the extent of fibrosis. Either
      deletion of TLR4 or HA synthase 2 in surfactant-protein-C-positive AEC2s leads to
      impaired renewal capacity, severe fibrosis and mortality. Furthermore, AEC2s from
      patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis have reduced cell surface HA and impaired
      renewal capacity, suggesting that HA and TLR4 are key contributors to lung stem
      cell renewal and that severe pulmonary fibrosis is the result of distal
      epithelial stem cell failure.

TI  - Dietary zinc alters the microbiota and decreases resistance to Clostridium
      difficile infection.
PG  - 1330-1334
LID - 10.1038/nm.4174 [doi]
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the most commonly reported nosocomial pathogen in the
      United States and is an urgent public health concern worldwide. Over the past
      decade, incidence, severity and costs associated with C. difficile infection
      (CDI) have increased dramatically. CDI is most commonly initiated by
      antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota; however,
      non-antibiotic-associated CDI cases are well documented and on the rise. This
      suggests that unexplored environmental, nutrient and host factors probably
      influence CDI. Here we show that excess dietary zinc (Zn) substantially alters
      the gut microbiota and, in turn, reduces the minimum amount of antibiotics needed
      to confer susceptibility to CDI. In mice colonized with C. difficile, excess
      dietary Zn severely exacerbated C. difficile-associated disease by increasing
      toxin activity and altering the host immune response. In addition, we show that
      the Zn-binding S100 protein calprotectin has antimicrobial effects against C.
      difficile and is an essential component of the innate immune response to CDI.
      Taken together, these data suggest that nutrient Zn levels have a key role in
      determining susceptibility to CDI and severity of disease, and that
      calprotectin-mediated metal limitation is an important factor in the host immune 
      response to C. difficile.

PG  - 1358-1367

AB  - Microglia, the only lifelong resident immune cells of the central nervous system 
      (CNS), are highly specialized macrophages that have been recognized to have a
      crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and
      adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). However, in contrast to other cell types of the human
      CNS, bona fide microglia have not yet been derived from cultured human
      pluripotent stem cells. Here we establish a robust and efficient protocol for the
      rapid production of microglia-like cells from human (h) embryonic stem (ES) and
      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that uses defined serum-free culture
      conditions. These in vitro pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells
      (termed pMGLs) faithfully recapitulate the expected ontogeny and characteristics 
      of their in vivo counterparts, and they resemble primary fetal human and mouse
      microglia. We generated these cells from multiple disease-specific cell lines and
      find that pMGLs derived from an hES model of Rett syndrome are smaller than their
      isogenic controls. We further describe a platform to study the integration and
      live behavior of pMGLs in organotypic 3D cultures. This modular differentiation
      system allows for the study of microglia in highly defined conditions as they
      mature in response to developmentally relevant cues, and it provides a framework 
      in which to study the long-term interactions of microglia residing in a
      tissue-like environment.

TI  - Determinants of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody induction.
PG  - 1260-1267
LID - 10.1038/nm.4187 [doi]
AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a focal component of HIV-1 vaccine
      design, yet basic aspects of their induction remain poorly understood. Here we
      report on viral, host and disease factors that steer bnAb evolution using the
      results of a systematic survey in 4,484 HIV-1-infected individuals that
      identified 239 bnAb inducers. We show that three parameters that reflect the
      exposure to antigen-viral load, length of untreated infection and viral
      diversity-independently drive bnAb evolution. Notably, black participants showed 
      significantly (P = 0.0086-0.038) higher rates of bnAb induction than white
      participants. Neutralization fingerprint analysis, which was used to delineate
      plasma specificity, identified strong virus subtype dependencies, with higher
      frequencies of CD4-binding-site bnAbs in infection with subtype B viruses (P =
      0.02) and higher frequencies of V2-glycan-specific bnAbs in infection with
      non-subtype B viruses (P = 1 x 10(-5)). Thus, key host, disease and viral
      determinants, including subtype-specific envelope features that determine bnAb
      specificity, remain to be unraveled and harnessed for bnAb-based vaccine design.

TI  - Dual effects of carbon monoxide on pericytes and neurogenesis in traumatic brain 
      injury.
PG  - 1335-1341
LID - 10.1038/nm.4188 [doi]
AB  - At low levels, carbon monoxide (CO) has physiological roles as a second messenger
      and neuromodulator. Here we assess the effects of CO in a mouse model of
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Treatment with CO-releasing molecule (CORM)-3
      reduced pericyte death and ameliorated the progression of neurological deficits. 
      In contrast, although treatment with the radical scavenger
      N-tert-butyl-a-phenylnitrone (PBN) also reduced pericyte death, neurological
      outcomes were not rescued. As compared to vehicle-treated control and PBN-treated
      mice, CORM-3-treated mice showed higher levels of phosphorylated neural nitric
      oxide synthase within neural stem cells (NSCs). Inhibition of nitric oxide
      synthase diminished the CORM-3-mediated increase in the number of cells that
      stained positive for both the neuronal marker NeuN and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine
      (BrdU; a marker for proliferating cells) in vivo, consequently interfering with
      neurological recovery after TBI. Because NSCs seemed to be in close proximity to 
      pericytes, we asked whether cross-talk between pericytes and NSCs was induced by 
      CORM-3, thereby promoting neurogenesis. In pericyte cultures that were undergoing
      oxygen and glucose deprivation, conditioned cell culture medium collected after
      CORM-3 treatment enhanced the in vitro differentiation of NSCs into mature
      neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that CO treatment may provide a
      therapeutic approach for TBI by preventing pericyte death, rescuing cross-talk
      with NSCs and promoting neurogenesis.

AB  - We describe the development of fetal brain lesions after Zika virus (ZIKV)
      inoculation in a pregnant pigtail macaque. Periventricular lesions developed
      within 10 d and evolved asymmetrically in the occipital-parietal lobes. Fetal
      autopsy revealed ZIKV in the brain and significant cerebral white matter
      hypoplasia, periventricular white matter gliosis, and axonal and ependymal
      injury. Our observation of ZIKV-associated fetal brain lesions in a nonhuman
      primate provides a model for therapeutic evaluation.

TI  - Signals from the gut microbiota to distant organs in physiology and disease.
PG  - 1079-1089
LID - 10.1038/nm.4185 [doi]
AB  - The ecosystem of the human gut consists of trillions of bacteria forming a
      bioreactor that is fueled by dietary macronutrients to produce bioactive
      compounds. These microbiota-derived metabolites signal to distant organs in the
      body, which enables the gut bacteria to connect to the immune and hormone system,
      to the brain (the gut-brain axis) and to host metabolism, as well as other
      functions of the host. This microbe-host communication is essential to maintain
      vital functions of the healthy host. Recently, however, the gut microbiota has
      been associated with a number of diseases, ranging from obesity and inflammatory 
      diseases to behavioral and physiological abnormalities associated with
      neurodevelopmental disorders. In this Review, we will discuss microbiota-host
      cross-talk and intestinal microbiome signaling to extraintestinal organs. We will
      review mechanisms of how this communication might contribute to host physiology
      and discuss how misconfigured signaling might contribute to different diseases.

TI  - Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase suppresses fatty acid synthesis and tumor
      growth of non-small-cell lung cancer in preclinical models.
PG  - 1108-1119
LID - 10.1038/nm.4181 [doi]
AB  - Continuous de novo fatty acid synthesis is a common feature of cancer that is
      required to meet the biosynthetic demands of a growing tumor. This process is
      controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an
      attractive but traditionally intractable drug target. Here we provide genetic and
      pharmacological evidence that in preclinical models ACC is required to maintain
      the de novo fatty acid synthesis needed for growth and viability of
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We describe the ability of ND-646-an
      allosteric inhibitor of the ACC enzymes ACC1 and ACC2 that prevents ACC subunit
      dimerization-to suppress fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Chronic
      ND-646 treatment of xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC
      inhibited tumor growth. When administered as a single agent or in combination
      with the standard-of-care drug carboplatin, ND-646 markedly suppressed lung tumor
      growth in the Kras;Trp53(-/-) (also known as KRAS p53) and Kras;Stk11(-/-) (also 
      known as KRAS Lkb1) mouse models of NSCLC. These findings demonstrate that ACC
      mediates a metabolic liability of NSCLC and that ACC inhibition by ND-646 is
      detrimental to NSCLC growth, supporting further examination of the use of ACC
      inhibitors in oncology.

TI  - Neonatal gut microbiota associates with childhood multisensitized atopy and T
      cell differentiation.

AB  - Gut microbiota bacterial depletions and altered metabolic activity at 3 months
      are implicated in childhood atopy and asthma. We hypothesized that
      compositionally distinct human neonatal gut microbiota (NGM) exist, and are
      differentially related to relative risk (RR) of childhood atopy and asthma. Using
      stool samples (n = 298; aged 1-11 months) from a US birth cohort and 16S rRNA
      sequencing, neonates (median age, 35 d) were divisible into three microbiota
      composition states (NGM1-3). Each incurred a substantially different RR for
      multisensitized atopy at age 2 years and doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 4 years. 
      The highest risk group, labeled NGM3, showed lower relative abundance of certain 
      bacteria (for example, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium), higher
      relative abundance of particular fungi (Candida and Rhodotorula) and a distinct
      fecal metabolome enriched for pro-inflammatory metabolites. Ex vivo culture of
      human adult peripheral T cells with sterile fecal water from NGM3 subjects
      increased the proportion of CD4(+) cells producing interleukin (IL)-4 and reduced
      the relative abundance of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells. 12,13-DiHOME, enriched in 
      NGM3 versus lower-risk NGM states, recapitulated the effect of NGM3 fecal water
      on relative CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cell abundance. These findings suggest that
      neonatal gut microbiome dysbiosis might promote CD4(+) T cell dysfunction
      associated with childhood atopy.

TI  - The long noncoding RNA Chaer defines an epigenetic checkpoint in cardiac
      hypertrophy.
PG  - 1131-1139
LID - 10.1038/nm.4179 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic reprogramming is a critical process of pathological gene induction
      during cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, but the underlying regulatory
      mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here we identified a heart-enriched long
      noncoding (lnc)RNA, named cardiac-hypertrophy-associated epigenetic regulator
      (Chaer), which is necessary for the development of cardiac hypertrophy.
      Mechanistically, Chaer directly interacts with the catalytic subunit of polycomb 
      repressor complex 2 (PRC2). This interaction, which is mediated by a 66-mer motif
      in Chaer, interferes with PRC2 targeting to genomic loci, thereby inhibiting
      histone H3 lysine 27 methylation at the promoter regions of genes involved in
      cardiac hypertrophy. The interaction between Chaer and PRC2 is transiently
      induced after hormone or stress stimulation in a process involving mammalian
      target of rapamycin complex 1, and this interaction is a prerequisite for
      epigenetic reprogramming and induction of genes involved in hypertrophy.
      Inhibition of Chaer expression in the heart before, but not after, the onset of
      pressure overload substantially attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.
      Our study reveals that stress-induced pathological gene activation in the heart
      requires a previously uncharacterized lncRNA-dependent epigenetic checkpoint.

TI  - HAUSP deubiquitinates and stabilizes N-Myc in neuroblastoma.
PG  - 1180-1186
LID - 10.1038/nm.4180 [doi]
AB  - The MYCN proto-oncogene is amplified in a number of advanced-stage human tumors, 
      such as neuroblastomas. Similar to other members of the MYC family of
      oncoproteins, MYCN (also known as N-Myc) is a transcription factor, and its
      stability and activity are tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent
      proteasome degradation. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that N-Myc is
      a driver of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, therapies that directly suppress N-Myc
      activity in human tumors are limited. Here we have identified ubiquitin-specific 
      protease 7 (USP7; also known as HAUSP) as a regulator of N-Myc function in
      neuroblastoma. HAUSP interacts with N-Myc, and HAUSP expression induces
      deubiquitination and subsequent stabilization of N-Myc. Conversely, RNA
      interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of USP7 in neuroblastoma cancer cell
      lines, or genetic ablation of Usp7 in the mouse brain, destabilizes N-Myc, which 
      leads to inhibition of N-Myc function. Notably, HAUSP is more abundant in
      patients with neuroblastoma who have poorer prognosis, and HAUSP expression
      substantially correlates with N-Myc transcriptional activity. Furthermore,
      small-molecule inhibitors of HAUSP's deubiquitinase activity markedly suppress
      the growth of MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma cell lines in xenograft mouse
      models. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a crucial role of HAUSP in
      regulating N-Myc function in vivo and suggest that HAUSP inhibition is a
      potential therapy for MYCN-amplified tumors.

TI  - Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing controls cathepsin S expression in
      atherosclerosis by enabling HuR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.
PG  - 1140-1150
LID - 10.1038/nm.4172 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, which is catalyzed by a family of
      adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, is important in the
      epitranscriptomic regulation of RNA metabolism. However, the role of A-to-I RNA
      editing in vascular disease is unknown. Here we show that cathepsin S mRNA
      (CTSS), which encodes a cysteine protease associated with angiogenesis and
      atherosclerosis, is highly edited in human endothelial cells. The 3' untranslated
      region (3' UTR) of the CTSS transcript contains two inverted repeats, the AluJo
      and AluSx(+) regions, which form a long stem-loop structure that is recognized by
      ADAR1 as a substrate for editing. RNA editing enables the recruitment of the
      stabilizing RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR; encoded by ELAVL1) to the
      3' UTR of the CTSS transcript, thereby controlling CTSS mRNA stability and
      expression. In endothelial cells, ADAR1 overexpression or treatment of cells with
      hypoxia or with the inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and
      tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha induces CTSS RNA editing and consequently increases
      cathepsin S expression. ADAR1 levels and the extent of CTSS RNA editing are
      associated with changes in cathepsin S levels in patients with atherosclerotic
      vascular diseases, including subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery
      disease, aortic aneurysms and advanced carotid atherosclerotic disease. These
      results reveal a previously unrecognized role of RNA editing in gene expression
      in human atherosclerotic vascular diseases.

      tuberculosis mRNA after tuberculosis cure.
PG  - 1094-1100
LID - 10.1038/nm.4177 [doi]
AB  - The absence of a gold standard to determine when antibiotics induce a sterilizing
      cure has confounded the development of new approaches to treat pulmonary
      tuberculosis (PTB). We detected positron emission tomography and computerized
      tomography (PET-CT) imaging response patterns consistent with active disease,
      along with the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) mRNA in sputum and
      bronchoalveolar lavage samples, in a substantial proportion of adult,
      HIV-negative patients with PTB after a standard 6-month treatment plus 1 year
      follow-up, including patients with a durable cure and others who later developed 
      recurrent disease. The presence of MTB mRNA in the context of nonresolving and
      intensifying lesions on PET-CT images might indicate ongoing transcription,
      suggesting that even apparently curative treatment for PTB may not eradicate all 
      of the MTB bacteria in most patients. This suggests an important complementary
      role for the immune response in maintaining a disease-free state. Sterilizing
      drugs or host-directed therapies, and better treatment response markers, are
      probably needed for the successful development of improved and shortened
      PTB-treatment strategies.

AB  - In view of the high proportion of individuals with resistance to antihypertensive
      medication and/or poor compliance or tolerance of this medication, new drugs to
      treat hypertension are urgently needed. Here we show that peripheral
      chemoreceptors generate aberrant signaling that contributes to high blood
      pressure in hypertension. We discovered that purinergic receptor P2X3 (P2rx3,
      also known as P2x3) mRNA expression is upregulated substantially in
      chemoreceptive petrosal sensory neurons in rats with hypertension. These neurons 
      generate both tonic drive and hyperreflexia in hypertensive (but not
      normotensive) rats, and both phenomena are normalized by the blockade of P2X3
      receptors. Antagonism of P2X3 receptors also reduces arterial pressure and basal 
      sympathetic activity and normalizes carotid body hyperreflexia in conscious rats 
      with hypertension; no effect was observed in rats without hypertension. We
      verified P2X3 receptor expression in human carotid bodies and observed
      hyperactivity of carotid bodies in individuals with hypertension. These data
      support the identification of the P2X3 receptor as a potential new target for the
      control of human hypertension.

TI  - Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors act centrally to cause bone loss in mice by
      counteracting a local anti-resorptive effect.
PG  - 1170-1179
LID - 10.1038/nm.4166 [doi]
AB  - The use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been associated
      with an increased risk of bone fracture, raising concerns about their
      increasingly broader usage. This deleterious effect is poorly understood, and
      thus strategies to avoid this side effect remain elusive. We show here that
      fluoxetine (Flx), one of the most-prescribed SSRIs, acts on bone remodeling
      through two distinct mechanisms. Peripherally, Flx has anti-resorptive
      properties, directly impairing osteoclast differentiation and function through a 
      serotonin-reuptake-independent mechanism that is dependent on intracellular
      Ca(2+) levels and the transcription factor Nfatc1. With time, however, Flx also
      triggers a brain-serotonin-dependent rise in sympathetic output that increases
      bone resorption sufficiently to counteract its local anti-resorptive effect, thus
      leading to a net effect of impaired bone formation and bone loss. Accordingly,
      neutralizing this second mode of action through co-treatment with the
      beta-blocker propranolol, while leaving the peripheral effect intact, prevents
      Flx-induced bone loss in mice. Hence, this study identifies a dual mode of action
      of SSRIs on bone remodeling and suggests a therapeutic strategy to block the
      deleterious effect on bone homeostasis from their chronic use.

AB  - Tuberculosis is classically divided into states of latent infection and active
      disease. Using combined positron emission and computed tomography in 35
      asymptomatic, antiretroviral-therapy-naive, HIV-1-infected adults with latent
      tuberculosis, we identified ten individuals with pulmonary abnormalities
      suggestive of subclinical, active disease who were substantially more likely to
      progress to clinical disease. Our findings challenge the conventional two-state
      paradigm and may aid future identification of biomarkers that are predictive of
      progression.

AB  - In response to the current global health emergency posed by the Zika virus (ZIKV)
      outbreak and its link to microcephaly and other neurological conditions, we
      performed a drug repurposing screen of approximately 6,000 compounds that
      included approved drugs, clinical trial drug candidates and pharmacologically
      active compounds; we identified compounds that either inhibit ZIKV infection or
      suppress infection-induced caspase-3 activity in different neural cells. A
      pan-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, inhibited ZIKV-induced increases in caspase-3
      activity and protected human cortical neural progenitors in both monolayer and
      three-dimensional organoid cultures. Ten structurally unrelated inhibitors of
      cyclin-dependent kinases inhibited ZIKV replication. Niclosamide, a category B
      anthelmintic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, also inhibited
      ZIKV replication. Finally, combination treatments using one compound from each
      category (neuroprotective and antiviral) further increased protection of human
      neural progenitors and astrocytes from ZIKV-induced cell death. Our results
      demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy and identify lead compounds
      for anti-ZIKV drug development.

TI  - An AMP-activated protein kinase-stabilizing peptide ameliorates adipose tissue
      wasting in cancer cachexia in mice.
PG  - 1120-1130
LID - 10.1038/nm.4171 [doi]
AB  - Cachexia represents a fatal energy-wasting syndrome in a large number of patients
      with cancer that mostly results in a pathological loss of skeletal muscle and
      adipose tissue. Here we show that tumor cell exposure and tumor growth in mice
      triggered a futile energy-wasting cycle in cultured white adipocytes and white
      adipose tissue (WAT), respectively. Although uncoupling protein 1
      (Ucp1)-dependent thermogenesis was dispensable for tumor-induced body wasting,
      WAT from cachectic mice and tumor-cell-supernatant-treated adipocytes were
      consistently characterized by the simultaneous induction of both lipolytic and
      lipogenic pathways. Paradoxically, this was accompanied by an inactivated
      AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk), which is normally activated in peripheral
      tissues during states of low cellular energy. Ampk inactivation correlated with
      its degradation and with upregulation of the Ampk-interacting protein Cidea.
      Therefore, we developed an Ampk-stabilizing peptide, ACIP, which was able to
      ameliorate WAT wasting in vitro and in vivo by shielding the Cidea-targeted
      interaction surface on Ampk. Thus, our data establish the Ucp1-independent
      remodeling of adipocyte lipid homeostasis as a key event in tumor-induced WAT
      wasting, and we propose the ACIP-dependent preservation of Ampk integrity in the 
      WAT as a concept in future therapies for cachexia.

TI  - Implant-derived magnesium induces local neuronal production of CGRP to improve
      bone-fracture healing in rats.
PG  - 1160-1169
LID - 10.1038/nm.4162 [doi]
AB  - Orthopedic implants containing biodegradable magnesium have been used for
      fracture repair with considerable efficacy; however, the underlying mechanisms by
      which these implants improve fracture healing remain elusive. Here we show the
      formation of abundant new bone at peripheral cortical sites after intramedullary 
      implantation of a pin containing ultrapure magnesium into the intact distal femur
      in rats. This response was accompanied by substantial increases of neuronal
      calcitonin gene-related polypeptide-alpha (CGRP) in both the peripheral cortex of
      the femur and the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Surgical removal of the 
      periosteum, capsaicin denervation of sensory nerves or knockdown in vivo of the
      CGRP-receptor-encoding genes Calcrl or Ramp1 substantially reversed the
      magnesium-induced osteogenesis that we observed in this model. Overexpression of 
      these genes, however, enhanced magnesium-induced osteogenesis. We further found
      that an elevation of extracellular magnesium induces magnesium transporter 1
      (MAGT1)-dependent and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M,
      member 7 (TRPM7)-dependent magnesium entry, as well as an increase in
      intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the accumulation of terminal
      synaptic vesicles in isolated rat DRG neurons. In isolated rat periosteum-derived
      stem cells, CGRP induces CALCRL- and RAMP1-dependent activation of
      cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and SP7 (also known as
      osterix), and thus enhances osteogenic differentiation of these stem cells.
      Furthermore, we have developed an innovative, magnesium-containing intramedullary
      nail that facilitates femur fracture repair in rats with ovariectomy-induced
      osteoporosis. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously undefined role
      of magnesium in promoting CGRP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, which
      suggests the therapeutic potential of this ion in orthopedics.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted that splicing patterns are frequently altered in 
      cancer and that mutations in genes encoding spliceosomal proteins, as well as
      mutations affecting the splicing of key cancer-associated genes, are enriched in 
      cancer. In parallel, there is also accumulating evidence that several molecular
      subtypes of cancer are highly dependent on splicing function for cell survival.
      These findings have resulted in a growing interest in targeting splicing
      catalysis, splicing regulatory proteins, and/or specific key altered splicing
      events in the treatment of cancer. Here we present strategies that exist and that
      are in development to target altered dependency on the spliceosome, as well as
      aberrant splicing, in cancer. These include drugs to target global splicing in
      cancer subtypes that are preferentially dependent on wild-type splicing for
      survival, methods to alter post-translational modifications of
      splicing-regulating proteins, and strategies to modulate pathologic splicing
      events and protein-RNA interactions in cancer.

TI  - 3K3A-activated protein C stimulates postischemic neuronal repair by human neural 
      stem cells in mice.
PG  - 1050-5
LID - 10.1038/nm.4154 [doi]
AB  - Activated protein C (APC) is a blood protease with anticoagulant activity and
      cell-signaling activities mediated by the activation of protease-activated
      receptor 1 (F2R, also known as PAR1) and F2RL1 (also known as PAR3) via
      noncanonical cleavage. Recombinant variants of APC, such as the 3K3A-APC
      (Lys191-193Ala) mutant in which three Lys residues (KKK191-193) were replaced
      with alanine, and/or its other mutants with reduced (>90%) anticoagulant
      activity, engineered to reduce APC-associated bleeding risk while retaining
      normal cell-signaling activity, have shown benefits in preclinical models of
      ischemic stroke, brain trauma, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
      sepsis, ischemic and reperfusion injury of heart, kidney and liver, pulmonary,
      kidney and gastrointestinal inflammation, diabetes and lethal body radiation. On 
      the basis of proof-of-concept studies and an excellent safety profile in humans, 
      3K3A-APC has advanced to clinical trials as a neuroprotectant in ischemic stroke.
      Recently, 3K3A-APC has been shown to stimulate neuronal production by human
      neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs) in vitro via a
      PAR1-PAR3-sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor 1-Akt pathway, which suggests the
      potential for APC-based treatment as a strategy for structural repair in the
      human central nervous (CNS) system. Here we report that late postischemic
      treatment of mice with 3K3A-APC stimulates neuronal production by transplanted
      human NSCs, promotes circuit restoration and improves functional recovery. Thus, 
      3K3A-APC-potentiated neuronal recruitment from engrafted NSCs might offer a new
      approach to the treatment of stroke and related neurological disorders.

TI  - Endothelial exocytosis of angiopoietin-2 resulting from CCM3 deficiency
      contributes to cerebral cavernous malformation.
PG  - 1033-1042

AB  - Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular malformations that affect
      the central nervous system and result in cerebral hemorrhage, seizure and stroke.
      CCMs arise from loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes: KRIT1 (also
      known as CCM1), CCM2 or PDCD10 (also known as CCM3). PDCD10 mutations in humans
      often result in a more severe form of the disease relative to mutations in the
      other two CCM genes, and PDCD10-knockout mice show severe defects, the
      mechanistic basis for which is unclear. We have recently reported that CCM3
      regulates exocytosis mediated by the UNC13 family of exocytic regulatory
      proteins. Here, in investigating the role of endothelial cell exocytosis in CCM
      disease progression, we found that CCM3 suppresses UNC13B- and vesicle-associated
      membrane protein 3 (VAMP3)-dependent exocytosis of angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) in
      brain endothelial cells. CCM3 deficiency in endothelial cells augments the
      exocytosis and secretion of ANGPT2, which is associated with destabilized
      endothelial cell junctions, enlarged lumen formation and endothelial
      cell-pericyte dissociation. UNC13B deficiency, which blunts ANGPT2 secretion from
      endothelial cells, or treatment with an ANGPT2-neutralizing antibody normalizes
      the defects in the brain and retina caused by endothelial-cell-specific CCM3
      deficiency, including the disruption of endothelial cell junctions, vessel
      dilation and pericyte dissociation. Thus, enhanced secretion of ANGPT2 in
      endothelial cells contributes to the progression of CCM disease, providing a new 
      therapeutic approach for treating this devastating pathology.

TI  - A genome-editing strategy to treat beta-hemoglobinopathies that recapitulates a
      mutation associated with a benign genetic condition.
PG  - 987-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.4170 [doi]
AB  - Disorders resulting from mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta gene (HBB;
      which encodes beta-globin), mainly sickle cell disease (SCD) and
      beta-thalassemia, become symptomatic postnatally as fetal gamma-globin expression
      from two paralogous genes, hemoglobin subunit gamma 1 (HBG1) and HBG2, decreases 
      and adult beta-globin expression increases, thereby shifting red blood cell (RBC)
      hemoglobin from the fetal (referred to as HbF or alpha2gamma2) to adult (referred
      to as HbA or alpha2beta2) form. These disorders are alleviated when postnatal
      expression of fetal gamma-globin is maintained. For example, in hereditary
      persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), a benign genetic condition, mutations
      attenuate gamma-globin-to-beta-globin switching, causing high-level HbF
      expression throughout life. Co-inheritance of HPFH with beta-thalassemia- or
      SCD-associated gene mutations alleviates their clinical manifestations. Here we
      performed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing of human blood progenitors to
      mutate a 13-nt sequence that is present in the promoters of the HBG1 and HBG2
      genes, thereby recapitulating a naturally occurring HPFH-associated mutation.
      Edited progenitors produced RBCs with increased HbF levels that were sufficient
      to inhibit the pathological hypoxia-induced RBC morphology found in SCD. Our
      findings identify a potential DNA target for genome-editing-mediated therapy of
      beta-hemoglobinopathies.

TI  - Identification of a major epitope by anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies in
      patients with mycobacterial disease.
PG  - 994-1001
LID - 10.1038/nm.4158 [doi]
AB  - The binding of autoantibodies (autoAbs) to interferon (IFN)-gamma in people with 
      mycobacterial diseases has become an emerging medical concern. Many patients
      display specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II haplotypes, which
      suggests that a common T cell-dependent and B cell-dependent mechanism might
      underlie the production of specific anti-IFN-gamma autoAbs. We show here that
      these autoAbs target a major epitope (amino acids 121-131, designated position
      (P)121-131) in a region crucial for IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) activation to
      impair IFN-gamma-mediated activities. The amino acid sequence of this epitope is 
      highly homologous to a stretch in the Noc2 protein of Aspergillus spp., which was
      cross-reactive with autoAbs from patients. Rats immunized with Aspergillus Noc2
      developed antibodies that reacted with human IFN-gamma. We generated an
      epitope-erased variant of IFN-gamma (EE-IFN-gamma), in which the major
      neutralizing epitope region was altered. The binding affinity of anti-IFN-gamma
      autoAbs for EE-IFN-gamma was reduced by about 40%, as compared to that for
      IFN-gamma1-131. Moreover, EE-IFN-gamma activated the IFN-gammaR downstream
      signaling pathway ex vivo, irrespectively of anti-IFN-gamma autoAbs. In
      conclusion, we identified a common, crucial B cell epitope that bound to
      anti-IFN-gamma autoAbs in patients, and we propose a molecular-mimicry model for 
      autoAb development. In addition, treatment with EE-IFN-gamma might be worth
      investigating in patients producing anti-IFN-gamma autoAbs.

PG  - 1056-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.4155 [doi]
AB  - The protein kinase B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) is an
      oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in melanoma. Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi)
      have shown high response rates and extended survival in patients with melanoma
      who bear tumors that express mutations encoding BRAF proteins mutant at Val600,
      but a vast majority of these patients develop drug resistance. Here we show that 
      loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin 
      complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified
      loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or 
      STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to
      BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3
      expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and
      xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated 
      expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2;
      hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic
      mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor 
      function of STAG2 and STAG3.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune
      disease characterized by altered balance of activity between effector and
      regulatory CD4(+) T cells. The homeostasis of CD4(+) T cell subsets is regulated 
      by interleukin (IL)-2, and reduced production of IL-2 by T cells is observed in
      individuals with SLE. Here we report that treatment with low-dose recombinant
      human IL-2 selectively modulated the abundance of regulatory T (Treg) cells,
      follicular helper T (TFH) cells and IL-17-producing helper T (TH17) cells, but
      not TH1 or TH2 cells, accompanied by marked reductions of disease activity in
      patients with SLE.

TI  - Defective proviruses rapidly accumulate during acute HIV-1 infection.
PG  - 1043-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.4156 [doi]
AB  - Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication to clinically 
      undetectable levels, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) persists in
      CD4(+) T cells in a latent form that is not targeted by the immune system or by
      ART. This latent reservoir is a major barrier to curing individuals of HIV-1
      infection. Many individuals initiate ART during chronic infection, and in this
      setting, most proviruses are defective. However, the dynamics of the accumulation
      and the persistence of defective proviruses during acute HIV-1 infection are
      largely unknown. Here we show that defective proviruses accumulate rapidly within
      the first few weeks of infection to make up over 93% of all proviruses,
      regardless of how early ART is initiated. By using an unbiased method to amplify 
      near-full-length proviral genomes from HIV-1-infected adults treated at different
      stages of infection, we demonstrate that early initiation of ART limits the size 
      of the reservoir but does not profoundly affect the proviral landscape. This
      analysis allows us to revise our understanding of the composition of proviral
      populations and estimate the true reservoir size in individuals who were treated 
      early versus late in infection. Additionally, we demonstrate that common assays
      for measuring the reservoir do not correlate with reservoir size, as determined
      by the number of genetically intact proviruses. These findings reveal hurdles
      that must be overcome to successfully analyze future HIV-1 cure strategies.

TI  - Withaferin A is a leptin sensitizer with strong antidiabetic properties in mice.
PG  - 1023-32

AB  - The increasing global prevalence of obesity and its associated disorders points
      to an urgent need for the development of novel and effective therapeutic
      strategies that induce healthy weight loss. Obesity is characterized by
      hyperleptinemia and central leptin resistance. In an attempt to identify
      compounds that could reverse leptin resistance and thus promote weight loss, we
      analyzed a library of small molecules that have mRNA expression profiles similar 
      to that of celastrol, a naturally occurring compound that we previously
      identified as a leptin sensitizer. Through this process, we identified another
      naturally occurring compound, withaferin A, that also acts as a leptin
      sensitizer. We found that withaferin-A treatment of mice with diet-induced
      obesity (DIO) resulted in a 20-25% reduction of body weight, while also
      decreasing obesity-associated abnormalities, including hepatic steatosis.
      Withaferin-A treatment marginally affected the body weight of ob/ob and db/db
      mice, both of which are deficient in leptin signaling. In addition, withaferin A,
      unlike celastrol, has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism that occur
      independently of its leptin-sensitizing effect. Our results show that the
      metabolic abnormalities of DIO can be mitigated by sensitizing animals to
      endogenous leptin, and they indicate that withaferin A is a potential leptin
      sensitizer with additional antidiabetic actions.

TI  - An asthma-associated IL4R variant exacerbates airway inflammation by promoting
      conversion of regulatory T cells to TH17-like cells.
PG  - 1013-22
LID - 10.1038/nm.4147 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms by which regulatory T (Treg) cells fail to control inflammation in
      asthma remain poorly understood. We show that a severe asthma-associated
      polymorphism in the gene encoding the interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha chain
      (Il4ra(R576)) promotes conversion of induced Treg (iTreg) cells toward a T helper
      17 (TH17) cell fate. This skewing is mediated by the recruitment by
      IL-4Ralpha(R576) of the growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) adaptor
      protein, which drives IL-17 expression by activating a pathway that involves
      extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, IL-6 and the transcription factor STAT3.
      Treg cell-specific deletion of genes that regulate TH17 cell differentiation,
      including Il6ra and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (Rorc), but not of Il4 or
      Il13, prevented exacerbated airway inflammation in mice expressing Il4ra(R576)
      (hereafter referred to as Il4ra(R576) mice). Furthermore, treatment of
      Il4ra(R576) mice with a neutralizing IL-6-specific antibody prevented iTreg cell 
      reprogramming into TH17-like cells and protected against severe airway
      inflammation. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism for the
      development of mixed TH2-TH17 cell inflammation in genetically prone individuals 
      and point to interventions that stabilize iTreg cells as potentially effective
      therapeutic strategies.

TI  - NOX4-dependent fatty acid oxidation promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation in
      macrophages.
PG  - 1002-12
LID - 10.1038/nm.4153 [doi]
AB  - Altered metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
      diseases. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a source of cellular superoxide anions, has
      multiple biological functions that may be of importance in inflammation and in
      the pathogenesis of human metabolic diseases, including diabetes. However, the
      mechanisms by which NOX4-dependent metabolic regulation affect the innate immune 
      response remain unclear. Here we show that deficiency of NOX4 resulted in reduced
      expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which is a key
      mitochondrial enzyme in the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway. The reduced FAO
      resulted in less activation of the nucleotide-binding domain,
      leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptor (NLR), pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) 
      inflammasome in human and mouse macrophages. In contrast, NOX4 deficiency did not
      inhibit the activation of the NLR family, CARD-domain-containing 4 (NLRC4), the
      NLRP1 or the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes. We also found that
      inhibition of FAO by etomoxir treatment suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
      Furthermore, Nox4-deficient mice showed substantial reduction in caspase-1
      activation and in interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 production, and there was
      improved survival in a mouse model of NLRP3-mediated Streptococcus pneumoniae
      infection. The pharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 by either GKT137831, which is
      currently in phase 2 clinical trials, or VAS-2870 attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome
      activation. Our results suggest that NOX4-mediated FAO promotes NLRP3
      inflammasome activation.

TI  - A rapid pro-hemostatic approach to overcome direct oral anticoagulants.
PG  - 924-32
LID - 10.1038/nm.4149 [doi]
AB  - Direct inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin are promising oral
      anticoagulants that are becoming widely adopted. The ability to reverse their
      anticoagulant effects is important when serious bleeding occurs or urgent medical
      procedures are needed. Here, using experimental mouse models of hemostasis, we
      show that a variant coagulation factor, FXa(I16L), rapidly restores hemostasis in
      the presence of the anticoagulant effects of these inhibitors. The ability of
      FXa(I16L) to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitor depends, at least
      in part, on the ability of the active site inhibitor to hinder
      antithrombin-dependent FXa inactivation, paradoxically allowing uninhibited FXa
      to persist in plasma. Because of its inherent catalytic activity, FXa(I16L) is
      more potent (by >50-fold) in the hemostasis models tested than a noncatalytic
      antidote that is currently in clinical development. FXa(I16L) also reduces the
      anticoagulant-associated bleeding in vivo that is induced by the thrombin
      inhibitor dabigatran. FXa(I16L) may be able to fill an important unmet clinical
      need for a rapid, pro-hemostatic agent to reverse the effects of several new
      anticoagulants.

TI  - Inhibition of CBLB protects from lethal Candida albicans sepsis.
PG  - 915-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4134 [doi]
AB  - Fungal infections claim an estimated 1.5 million lives each year. Mechanisms that
      protect from fungal infections are still elusive. Recognition of fungal pathogens
      relies on C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and their downstream signaling kinase
      SYK. Here we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB controls proximal CLR
      signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells. We show that CBLB associates with
      SYK and ubiquitinates SYK, dectin-1, and dectin-2 after fungal recognition.
      Functionally, CBLB deficiency results in increased inflammasome activation,
      enhanced reactive oxygen species production, and increased fungal killing.
      Genetic deletion of Cblb protects mice from morbidity caused by cutaneous
      infection and markedly improves survival after a lethal systemic infection with
      Candida albicans. On the basis of these findings, we engineered a cell-permeable 
      CBLB inhibitory peptide that protects mice from lethal C. albicans infections. We
      thus describe a key role for Cblb in the regulation of innate antifungal immunity

TI  - On-demand erythrocyte disposal and iron recycling requires transient macrophages 
      in the liver.
PG  - 945-51
LID - 10.1038/nm.4146 [doi]
AB  - Iron is an essential component of the erythrocyte protein hemoglobin and is
      crucial to oxygen transport in vertebrates. In the steady state, erythrocyte
      production is in equilibrium with erythrocyte removal. In various
      pathophysiological conditions, however, erythrocyte life span is compromised
      severely, which threatens the organism with anemia and iron toxicity. Here we
      identify an on-demand mechanism that clears erythrocytes and recycles iron. We
      show that monocytes that express high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex,
      locus C1 (LY6C1, also known as Ly-6C) ingest stressed and senescent erythrocytes,
      accumulate in the liver via coordinated chemotactic cues, and differentiate into 
      ferroportin 1 (FPN1, encoded by SLC40A1)-expressing macrophages that can deliver 
      iron to hepatocytes. Monocyte-derived FPN1(+)Tim-4(neg) macrophages are
      transient, reside alongside embryonically derived T cell immunoglobulin and mucin
      domain containing 4 (Timd4, also known as Tim-4)(high) Kupffer cells (KCs), and
      depend on the growth factor Csf1 and the transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by
      Nfe2l2). The spleen, likewise, recruits iron-loaded Ly-6C(high) monocytes, but
      these do not differentiate into iron-recycling macrophages, owing to the
      suppressive action of Csf2. The accumulation of a transient macrophage population
      in the liver also occurs in mouse models of hemolytic anemia, anemia of
      inflammation, and sickle cell disease. Inhibition of monocyte recruitment to the 
      liver during stressed erythrocyte delivery leads to kidney and liver damage.
      These observations identify the liver as the primary organ that supports rapid
      erythrocyte removal and iron recycling, and uncover a mechanism by which the body
      adapts to fluctuations in erythrocyte integrity.

TI  - Targeting CBLB as a potential therapeutic approach for disseminated candidiasis.
PG  - 906-14
LID - 10.1038/nm.4141 [doi]
AB  - Disseminated candidiasis has become one of the leading causes of
      hospital-acquired blood stream infections with high mobility and mortality.
      However, the molecular basis of host defense against disseminated candidiasis
      remains elusive, and treatment options are limited. Here we report that the E3
      ubiquitin ligase CBLB directs polyubiquitination of dectin-1 and dectin-2, two
      key pattern-recognition receptors for sensing Candida albicans, and their
      downstream kinase SYK, thus inhibiting dectin-1- and dectin-2-mediated innate
      immune responses. CBLB deficiency or inactivation protects mice from systemic
      infection with a lethal dose of C. albicans, and deficiency of dectin-1,
      dectin-2, or both in Cblb(-/-) mice abrogates this protection. Notably, silencing
      the Cblb gene in vivo protects mice from lethal systemic C. albicans infection.
      Our data reveal that CBLB is crucial for homeostatic control of innate immune
      responses mediated by dectin-1 and dectin-2. Our data also indicate that CBLB
      represents a potential therapeutic target for protection from disseminated
      candidiasis.

TI  - Urolithin A induces mitophagy and prolongs lifespan in C. elegans and increases
      muscle function in rodents.
PG  - 879-88
LID - 10.1038/nm.4132 [doi]
AB  - The biological effects of urolithins remain poorly characterized, despite
      wide-spread human exposure via the dietary consumption of their metabolic
      precursors, the ellagitannins, which are found in the pomegranate fruit, as well 
      as in nuts and berries. We identified urolithin A (UA) as a first-in-class
      natural compound that induces mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo following oral 
      consumption. In C. elegans, UA prevented the accumulation of dysfunctional
      mitochondria with age and extended lifespan. Likewise, UA prolonged normal
      activity during aging in C. elegans, including mobility and pharyngeal pumping,
      while maintaining mitochondrial respiratory capacity. These effects translated to
      rodents, where UA improved exercise capacity in two different mouse models of
      age-related decline of muscle function, as well as in young rats. Our findings
      highlight the health benefits of urolithin A and its potential application in
      strategies to improve mitochondrial and muscle function.

TI  - Loss of fibronectin from the aged stem cell niche affects the regenerative
      capacity of skeletal muscle in mice.
PG  - 897-905
LID - 10.1038/nm.4126 [doi]
AB  - Age-related changes in the niche have long been postulated to impair the function
      of somatic stem cells. Here we demonstrate that the aged stem cell niche in
      skeletal muscle contains substantially reduced levels of fibronectin (FN),
      leading to detrimental consequences for the function and maintenance of muscle
      stem cells (MuSCs). Deletion of the gene encoding FN from young regenerating
      muscles replicates the aging phenotype and leads to a loss of MuSC numbers. By
      using an extracellular matrix (ECM) library screen and pathway profiling, we
      characterize FN as a preferred adhesion substrate for MuSCs and demonstrate that 
      integrin-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase and the p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly de-regulated in MuSCs from
      aged mice because of insufficient attachment to the niche. Reconstitution of FN
      levels in the aged niche remobilizes stem cells and restores youth-like muscle
      regeneration. Taken together, we identify the loss of stem cell adhesion to FN in
      the niche ECM as a previously unknown aging mechanism.

TI  - p53 induces formation of NEAT1 lncRNA-containing paraspeckles that modulate
      replication stress response and chemosensitivity.
PG  - 861-8

AB  - In a search for mediators of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which induces
      pleiotropic and often antagonistic cellular responses, we identified the long
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1. NEAT1 is an essential architectural component of
      paraspeckle nuclear bodies, whose pathophysiological relevance remains unclear.
      Activation of p53, pharmacologically or by oncogene-induced replication stress,
      stimulated the formation of paraspeckles in mouse and human cells. Silencing
      Neat1 expression in mice, which prevents paraspeckle formation, sensitized
      preneoplastic cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death and impaired skin
      tumorigenesis. We provide mechanistic evidence that NEAT1 promotes ATR signaling 
      in response to replication stress and is thereby engaged in a negative feedback
      loop that attenuates oncogene-dependent activation of p53. NEAT1 targeting in
      established human cancer cell lines induced synthetic lethality with genotoxic
      chemotherapeutics, including PARP inhibitors, and nongenotoxic activation of p53.
      This study establishes a key genetic link between NEAT1 paraspeckles, p53 biology
      and tumorigenesis and identifies NEAT1 as a promising target to enhance
      sensitivity of cancer cells to both chemotherapy and p53 reactivation therapy.

TI  - Activation of the reward system boosts innate and adaptive immunity.
PG  - 940-4
LID - 10.1038/nm.4133 [doi]
AB  - Positive expectations contribute to the clinical benefits of the placebo effect. 
      Such positive expectations are mediated by the brain's reward system; however, it
      remains unknown whether and how reward system activation affects the body's
      physiology and, specifically, immunity. Here we show that activation of the
      ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key component of the reward system, strengthens
      immunological host defense. We used 'designer receptors exclusively activated by 
      designer drugs' (DREADDs) to directly activate dopaminergic neurons in the mouse 
      VTA and characterized the subsequent immune response after exposure to bacteria
      (Escherichia coli), using time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and functional
      assays. We found an increase in innate and adaptive immune responses that were
      manifested by enhanced antibacterial activity of monocytes and macrophages,
      reduced in vivo bacterial load and a heightened T cell response in the mouse
      model of delayed-type hypersensitivity. By chemically ablating the sympathetic
      nervous system (SNS), we showed that the reward system's effects on immunity are,
      at least partly, mediated by the SNS. Thus, our findings establish a causal
      relationship between the activity of the VTA and the immune response to bacterial
      infection.

TI  - Targeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to
      checkpoint immunotherapy.
PG  - 851-60
LID - 10.1038/nm.4123 [doi]
AB  - Single-agent immunotherapy has achieved limited clinical benefit to date in
      patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This may be a result of
      the presence of a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).
      Critical obstacles to immunotherapy in PDAC tumors include a high number of
      tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells and a uniquely desmoplastic stroma that 
      functions as a barrier to T cell infiltration. We identified hyperactivated focal
      adhesion kinase (FAK) activity in neoplastic PDAC cells as an important regulator
      of the fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME. We found that FAK activity was
      elevated in human PDAC tissues and correlated with high levels of fibrosis and
      poor CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Single-agent FAK inhibition using the 
      selective FAK inhibitor VS-4718 substantially limited tumor progression,
      resulting in a doubling of survival in the p48-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D);Trp53(flox/+)
      (KPC) mouse model of human PDAC. This delay in tumor progression was associated
      with markedly reduced tumor fibrosis and decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating 
      immunosuppressive cells. We also found that FAK inhibition rendered the
      previously unresponsive KPC mouse model responsive to T cell immunotherapy and
      PD-1 antagonists. These data suggest that FAK inhibition increases immune
      surveillance by overcoming the fibrotic and immunosuppressive PDAC TME and
      renders tumors responsive to immunotherapy.

      muscle in mice.
PG  - 889-96
LID - 10.1038/nm.4116 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between stem cells and their microenvironment, or niche, are
      essential for stem cell maintenance and function. Our knowledge of the niche for 
      the skeletal muscle stem cell, i.e., the satellite cell (SC), is incomplete. Here
      we show that beta1-integrin is an essential niche molecule that maintains SC
      homeostasis, and sustains the expansion and self-renewal of this stem cell pool
      during regeneration. We further show that beta1-integrin cooperates with
      fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), a potent growth factor for SCs, to
      synergistically activate their common downstream effectors, the mitogen-activated
      protein (MAP) kinase Erk and protein kinase B (Akt). Notably, SCs in aged mice
      show altered beta1-integrin activity and insensitivity to Fgf2. Augmenting
      beta1-integrin activity with a monoclonal antibody restores Fgf2 sensitivity and 
      improves regeneration after experimentally induced muscle injury. The same
      treatment also enhances regeneration and function of dystrophic muscles in mdx
      mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, beta1-integrin senses
      the SC niche to maintain responsiveness to Fgf2, and this integrin represents a
      potential therapeutic target for pathological conditions of the muscle in which
      the stem cell niche is compromised.

AB  - Little is known about the inter-individual variation of cytokine responses to
      different pathogens in healthy individuals. To systematically describe cytokine
      responses elicited by distinct pathogens and to determine the effect of genetic
      variation on cytokine production, we profiled cytokines produced by peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells from 197 individuals of European origin from the 200
      Functional Genomics (200FG) cohort in the Human Functional Genomics Project
      (http://www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org), obtained over three different years. We
      compared bacteria- and fungi-induced cytokine profiles and found that most
      cytokine responses were organized around a physiological response to specific
      pathogens, rather than around a particular immune pathway or cytokine. We then
      correlated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes with
      cytokine abundance and identified six cytokine quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
      Among them, a cytokine QTL at the NAA35-GOLM1 locus markedly modulated
      interleukin (IL)-6 production in response to multiple pathogens and was
      associated with susceptibility to candidemia. Furthermore, the cytokine QTLs that
      we identified were enriched among SNPs previously associated with infectious
      diseases and heart diseases. These data reveal and begin to explain the
      variability in cytokine production by human immune cells in response to
      pathogens.

PG  - 869-78

AB  - Genetic mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP, also known as TDP-43)
      cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and an increase in the presence of
      TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP) in the cytoplasm is a prominent histopathological
      feature of degenerating neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases. However,
      the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to ALS pathophysiology
      remain elusive. Here we have found that TDP-43 accumulates in the mitochondria of
      neurons in subjects with ALS or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Disease-associated
      mutations increase TDP-43 mitochondrial localization. In mitochondria, wild-type 
      (WT) and mutant TDP-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger
      RNAs (mRNAs) encoding respiratory complex I subunits ND3 and ND6, impair their
      expression and specifically cause complex I disassembly. The suppression of
      TDP-43 mitochondrial localization abolishes WT and mutant TDP-43-induced
      mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss, and improves phenotypes of
      transgenic mutant TDP-43 mice. Thus, our studies link TDP-43 toxicity directly to
      mitochondrial bioenergetics and propose the targeting of TDP-43 mitochondrial
      localization as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration.

TI  - RANK ligand as a potential target for breast cancer prevention in BRCA1-mutation 
      carriers.
PG  - 933-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.4118 [doi]
AB  - Individuals who have mutations in the breast-cancer-susceptibility gene BRCA1
      (hereafter referred to as BRCA1-mutation carriers) frequently undergo
      prophylactic mastectomy to minimize their risk of breast cancer. The
      identification of an effective prevention therapy therefore remains a 'holy
      grail' for the field. Precancerous BRCA1(mut/+) tissue harbors an aberrant
      population of luminal progenitor cells, and deregulated progesterone signaling
      has been implicated in BRCA1-associated oncogenesis. Coupled with the findings
      that tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11; also known as RANKL)
      is a key paracrine effector of progesterone signaling and that RANKL and its
      receptor TNFRSF11A (also known as RANK) contribute to mammary tumorigenesis, we
      investigated a role for this pathway in the pre-neoplastic phase of
      BRCA1-mutation carriers. We identified two subsets of luminal progenitors
      (RANK(+) and RANK(-)) in histologically normal tissue of BRCA1-mutation carriers 
      and showed that RANK(+) cells are highly proliferative, have grossly aberrant DNA
      repair and bear a molecular signature similar to that of basal-like breast
      cancer. These data suggest that RANK(+) and not RANK(-) progenitors are a key
      target population in these women. Inhibition of RANKL signaling by treatment with
      denosumab in three-dimensional breast organoids derived from pre-neoplastic
      BRCA1(mut/+) tissue attenuated progesterone-induced proliferation. Notably,
      proliferation was markedly reduced in breast biopsies from BRCA1-mutation
      carriers who were treated with denosumab. Furthermore, inhibition of RANKL in a
      Brca1-deficient mouse model substantially curtailed mammary tumorigenesis. Taken 
      together, these findings identify a targetable pathway in a putative
      cell-of-origin population in BRCA1-mutation carriers and implicate RANKL blockade
      as a promising strategy in the prevention of breast cancer.

TI  - The microbiome in early life: implications for health outcomes.
PG  - 713-22

AB  - Recent studies have characterized how host genetics, prenatal environment and
      delivery mode can shape the newborn microbiome at birth. Following this,
      postnatal factors, such as antibiotic treatment, diet or environmental exposure, 
      further modulate the development of the infant's microbiome and immune system,
      and exposure to a variety of microbial organisms during early life has long been 
      hypothesized to exert a protective effect in the newborn. Furthermore,
      epidemiological studies have shown that factors that alter bacterial communities 
      in infants during childhood increase the risk for several diseases, highlighting 
      the importance of understanding early-life microbiome composition. In this
      review, we describe how prenatal and postnatal factors shape the development of
      both the microbiome and the immune system. We also discuss the prospects of
      microbiome-mediated therapeutics and the need for more effective approaches that 
      can reconfigure bacterial communities from pathogenic to homeostatic
      configurations.

AB  - Genetic heterogeneity contributes to clinical outcome and progression of most
      tumors, but little is known about allelic diversity for epigenetic compartments, 
      and almost no data exist for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We examined epigenetic
      heterogeneity as assessed by cytosine methylation within defined genomic loci
      with four CpGs (epialleles), somatic mutations, and transcriptomes of AML patient
      samples at serial time points. We observed that epigenetic allele burden is
      linked to inferior outcome and varies considerably during disease progression.
      Epigenetic and genetic allelic burden and patterning followed different patterns 
      and kinetics during disease progression. We observed a subset of AMLs with high
      epiallele and low somatic mutation burden at diagnosis, a subset with high
      somatic mutation and lower epiallele burdens at diagnosis, and a subset with a
      mixed profile, suggesting distinct modes of tumor heterogeneity. Genes linked to 
      promoter-associated epiallele shifts during tumor progression showed increased
      single-cell transcriptional variance and differential expression, suggesting
      functional impact on gene regulation. Thus, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity 
      can occur with distinct kinetics likely to affect the biological and clinical
      features of tumors.

TI  - Immunomodulatory drugs disrupt the cereblon-CD147-MCT1 axis to exert antitumor
      activity and teratogenicity.
PG  - 735-43
LID - 10.1038/nm.4128 [doi]
AB  - Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), such as thalidomide and its derivatives
      lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are key treatment modalities for hematologic
      malignancies, particularly multiple myeloma (MM) and del(5q) myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS). Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor of the CRL4 ubiquitin
      ligase complex, is the primary target by which IMiDs mediate anticancer and
      teratogenic effects. Here we identify a ubiquitin-independent physiological
      chaperone-like function of CRBN that promotes maturation of the basigin (BSG;
      also known as CD147) and solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1; also known
      as MCT1) proteins. This process allows for the formation and activation of the
      CD147-MCT1 transmembrane complex, which promotes various biological functions,
      including angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion and lactate export. We found that
      IMiDs outcompete CRBN for binding to CD147 and MCT1, leading to destabilization
      of the CD147-MCT1 complex. Accordingly, IMiD-sensitive MM cells lose CD147 and
      MCT1 expression after being exposed to IMiDs, whereas IMiD-resistant cells retain
      their expression. Furthermore, del(5q) MDS cells have elevated CD147 expression, 
      which is attenuated after IMiD treatment. Finally, we show that BSG (CD147)
      knockdown phenocopies the teratogenic effects of thalidomide exposure in
      zebrafish. These findings provide a common mechanistic framework to explain both 
      the teratogenic and pleiotropic antitumor effects of IMiDs.

TI  - Stimulating the RIG-I pathway to kill cells in the latent HIV reservoir following
      viral reactivation.
PG  - 807-11
LID - 10.1038/nm.4124 [doi]
AB  - The persistence of latent HIV proviruses in long-lived CD4(+) T cells despite
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major obstacle to viral eradication. Because
      current candidate latency-reversing agents (LRAs) induce HIV transcription, but
      fail to clear these cellular reservoirs, new approaches for killing these
      reactivated latent HIV reservoir cells are urgently needed. HIV latency depends
      upon the transcriptional quiescence of the integrated provirus and the
      circumvention of immune defense mechanisms. These defenses include cell-intrinsic
      innate responses that use pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect viral
      pathogens, and that subsequently induce apoptosis of the infected cell. Retinoic 
      acid (RA)-inducible gene I (RIG-I, encoded by DDX58) forms one class of PRRs that
      mediates apoptosis and the elimination of infected cells after recognition of
      viral RNA. Here we show that acitretin, an RA derivative approved by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration (FDA), enhances RIG-I signaling ex vivo, increases HIV
      transcription, and induces preferential apoptosis of HIV-infected cells. These
      effects are abrogated by DDX58 knockdown. Acitretin also decreases proviral DNA
      levels in CD4(+) T cells from HIV-positive subjects on suppressive ART, an effect
      that is amplified when combined with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a
      histone deacetylase inhibitor. Pharmacological enhancement of an innate
      cellular-defense network could provide a means by which to eliminate reactivated 
      cells in the latent HIV reservoir.

TI  - A calcium- and calpain-dependent pathway determines the response to lenalidomide 
      in myelodysplastic syndromes.

AB  - Despite the high response rates of individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) to treatment with lenalidomide
      (LEN) and the recent identification of cereblon (CRBN) as the molecular target of
      LEN, the cellular mechanism by which LEN eliminates MDS clones remains elusive.
      Here we performed an RNA interference screen to delineate gene regulatory
      networks that mediate LEN responsiveness in an MDS cell line, MDSL. We identified
      GPR68, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that has been implicated in
      calcium metabolism, as the top candidate gene for modulating sensitivity to LEN. 
      LEN induced GPR68 expression via IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), resulting
      in increased cytosolic calcium levels and activation of a calcium-dependent
      calpain, CAPN1, which were requisite steps for induction of apoptosis in MDS
      cells and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In contrast, deletion of GPR68
      or inhibition of calcium and calpain activation suppressed LEN-induced
      cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of calpastatin (CAST), an endogenous CAPN1
      inhibitor that is encoded by a gene (CAST) deleted in del(5q) MDS, correlated
      with LEN responsiveness in patients with del(5q) MDS. Depletion of CAST restored 
      responsiveness of LEN-resistant non-del(5q) MDS cells and AML cells, providing an
      explanation for the superior responses of patients with del(5q) MDS to LEN
      treatment. Our study describes a cellular mechanism by which LEN, acting through 
      CRBN and IKZF1, has cytotoxic effects in MDS and AML that depend on a calcium-
      and calpain-dependent pathway.

TI  - Loss of the co-repressor GPS2 sensitizes macrophage activation upon metabolic
      stress induced by obesity and type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 780-91
LID - 10.1038/nm.4114 [doi]
AB  - Humans with obesity differ in their susceptibility to developing insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). This variation may relate to the extent of 
      adipose tissue (AT) inflammation that develops as their obesity progresses. The
      state of macrophage activation has a central role in determining the degree of AT
      inflammation and thus its dysfunction, and these states are driven by epigenomic 
      alterations linked to gene expression. The underlying mechanisms that regulate
      these alterations, however, are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that a
      co-repressor complex containing G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) crucially
      controls the macrophage epigenome during activation by metabolic stress. The
      study of AT from humans with and without obesity revealed correlations between
      reduced GPS2 expression in macrophages, elevated systemic and AT inflammation,
      and diabetic status. The causality of this relationship was confirmed by using
      macrophage-specific Gps2-knockout (KO) mice, in which inappropriate co-repressor 
      complex function caused enhancer activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and
      hypersensitivity toward metabolic-stress signals. By contrast, transplantation of
      GPS2-overexpressing bone marrow into two mouse models of obesity (ob/ob and
      diet-induced obesity) reduced inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity.
      Thus, our data reveal a potentially reversible disease mechanism that links
      co-repressor-dependent epigenomic alterations in macrophages to AT inflammation
      and the development of T2D.

AB  - Brain metastases represent the greatest clinical challenge in treating
      HER2-positive breast cancer. We report the development of orthotopic
      patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of HER2-expressing breast cancer brain
      metastases (BCBM), and their use for the identification of targeted combination
      therapies. Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR resulted in durable tumor
      regressions in three of five PDXs, and therapeutic response was correlated with a
      reduction in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, an mTORC1 effector. The two
      nonresponding PDXs showed hypermutated genomes with enrichment of mutations in
      DNA-repair genes, which suggests an association of genomic instability with
      therapeutic resistance. These findings suggest that a biomarker-driven clinical
      trial of PI3K inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor should be conducted
      for patients with HER2-positive BCBM.

      antidiabetic target in mice selected for leanness.

AB  - The discovery of genetic mechanisms for resistance to obesity and diabetes may
      illuminate new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this global health
      challenge. We used the polygenic 'lean' mouse model, which has been selected for 
      low adiposity over 60 generations, to identify mitochondrial thiosulfate
      sulfurtransferase (Tst; also known as rhodanese) as a candidate
      obesity-resistance gene with selectively increased expression in adipocytes.
      Elevated adipose Tst expression correlated with indices of metabolic health
      across diverse mouse strains. Transgenic overexpression of Tst in adipocytes
      protected mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin-resistant diabetes.
      Tst-deficient mice showed markedly exacerbated diabetes, whereas pharmacological 
      activation of TST ameliorated diabetes in mice. Mechanistically, TST selectively 
      augmented mitochondrial function combined with degradation of reactive oxygen
      species and sulfide. In humans, TST mRNA expression in adipose tissue correlated 
      positively with insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and negatively with fat
      mass. Thus, the genetic identification of Tst as a beneficial regulator of
      adipocyte mitochondrial function may have therapeutic significance for
      individuals with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - A recombinant vaccine containing Aventis Pasteur's canarypox vector (ALVAC)-HIV
      and gp120 alum decreased the risk of HIV acquisition in the RV144 vaccine trial. 
      The substitution of alum with the more immunogenic MF59 adjuvant is under
      consideration for the next efficacy human trial. We found here that an
      ALVAC-simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and gp120 alum (ALVAC-SIV + gp120)
      equivalent vaccine, but not an ALVAC-SIV + gp120 MF59 vaccine, was efficacious in
      delaying the onset of SIVmac251 in rhesus macaques, despite the higher
      immunogenicity of the latter adjuvant. Vaccine efficacy was associated with
      alum-induced, but not with MF59-induced, envelope (Env)-dependent mucosal innate 
      lymphoid cells (ILCs) that produce interleukin (IL)-17, as well as with mucosal
      IgG to the gp120 variable region 2 (V2) and the expression of 12 genes, ten of
      which are part of the RAS pathway. The association between RAS activation and
      vaccine efficacy was also observed in an independent efficacious SIV-vaccine
      approach. Whether RAS activation, mucosal ILCs and antibodies to V2 are also
      important hallmarks of HIV-vaccine efficacy in humans will require further
      studies.

TI  - PD-1(+) and follicular helper T cells are responsible for persistent HIV-1
      transcription in treated aviremic individuals.
PG  - 754-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.4113 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms responsible for the persistence of HIV-1 after many years of
      suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been only partially elucidated.
      Most of the studies investigating HIV-1 persistence have been performed with
      blood, although it is well known that germinal centers (GCs) within lymph nodes
      (LNs) serve as primary sites for HIV-1 replication. We sought to identify the
      memory CD4 T cell populations in blood and LNs that are responsible for the
      production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, as well as for active
      and persistent virus transcription in ART-treated (for 1.5-14.0 years), aviremic 
      (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that LN CD4 T
      cells that express programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also known as PD-1), which are
      composed of about 65% T follicular helper cells as defined by the expression of
      the cell surface receptors CXCR5 and PD-1, are the major source of
      replication-competent HIV-1 and of infectious virus, as compared to any other
      (CXCR5(-)PD-1(-) and CXCR5(+)PD-1(-)) blood or LN memory CD4 T cell populations. 
      LN PD-1(+) cells accounted for 46% and 96% of the total pools of memory CD4 T
      cells containing inducible replication-competent or infectious virus,
      respectively. Notably, higher levels of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA were present in
      LN PD-1(+) cells after long-term (up to 12 years) ART than in other memory CD4 T 
      cell subpopulations. These results indicate that LN PD-1(+) cells are the major
      CD4 T cell compartment in the blood and LNs for the production of
      replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, and for active and persistent virus
      transcription in long-term-ART-treated aviremic individuals. Thus, these cells
      may represent a major obstacle to finding a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.

TI  - A humanized bone marrow ossicle xenotransplantation model enables improved
      engraftment of healthy and leukemic human hematopoietic cells.
PG  - 812-21
LID - 10.1038/nm.4103 [doi]
AB  - Xenotransplantation models represent powerful tools for the investigation of
      healthy and malignant human hematopoiesis. However, current models do not fully
      mimic the components of the human bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and they
      enable only limited engraftment of samples from some human malignancies. Here we 
      show that a xenotransplantation model bearing subcutaneous humanized ossicles
      with an accessible BM microenvironment, formed by in situ differentiation of
      human BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, enables the robust engraftment of
      healthy human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as primary acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, at levels much greater than those in
      unmanipulated mice. Direct intraossicle transplantation accelerated engraftment
      and resulted in the detection of substantially higher leukemia-initiating cell
      (LIC) frequencies. We also observed robust engraftment of acute promyelocytic
      leukemia (APL) and myelofibrosis (MF) samples, and identified LICs in these
      malignancies. This humanized ossicle xenotransplantation approach provides a
      system for modeling a wide variety of human hematological diseases.

TI  - Central injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 induces sustained remission of
      diabetic hyperglycemia in rodents.
PG  - 800-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.4101 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is among the most common and costly disorders worldwide.
      The goal of current medical management for T2D is to transiently ameliorate
      hyperglycemia through daily dosing of one or more antidiabetic drugs.
      Hypoglycemia and weight gain are common side effects of therapy, and sustained
      disease remission is not obtainable with nonsurgical approaches. On the basis of 
      the potent glucose-lowering response elicited by activation of brain fibroblast
      growth factor (FGF) receptors, we explored the antidiabetic efficacy of centrally
      administered FGF1, which, unlike other FGF peptides, activates all FGF receptor
      subtypes. We report that a single intracerebroventricular injection of FGF1 at a 
      dose one-tenth of that needed for antidiabetic efficacy following peripheral
      injection induces sustained diabetes remission in both mouse and rat models of
      T2D. This antidiabetic effect is not secondary to weight loss, does not increase 
      the risk of hypoglycemia, and involves a novel and incompletely understood
      mechanism for increasing glucose clearance from the bloodstream. We conclude that
      the brain has an inherent potential to induce diabetes remission and that brain
      FGF receptors are potential pharmacological targets for achieving this goal.

      p53-altered liver cancer.
PG  - 744-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.4107 [doi]
AB  - MYC oncoproteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of the majority of
      human tumors but are considered undruggable. By using a direct in vivo shRNA
      screen, we show that liver cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding 
      the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) and that are 
      driven by the oncoprotein NRAS become addicted to MYC stabilization via a
      mechanism mediated by aurora kinase A (AURKA). This MYC stabilization enables the
      tumor cells to overcome a latent G2/M cell cycle arrest that is mediated by AURKA
      and the tumor suppressor protein p19(ARF). MYC directly binds to AURKA, and
      inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by conformation-changing AURKA
      inhibitors results in subsequent MYC degradation and cell death. These
      conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, with one of them currently being tested
      in early clinical trials, suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice 
      bearing Trp53-deficient, NRAS-driven MYC-expressing hepatocellular carcinomas
      (HCCs). TP53-mutated human HCCs revealed increased AURKA expression and a
      positive correlation between AURKA and MYC expression. In xenograft models, mice 
      bearing TP53-mutated or TP53-deleted human HCCs were hypersensitive to treatment 
      with conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, thus suggesting a therapeutic
      strategy for this subgroup of human HCCs.

TI  - Impact of pre-adapted HIV transmission.
PG  - 606-13
LID - 10.1038/nm.4100 [doi]
AB  - Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA)-restricted CD8(+) T lymphocyte (CTL)
      responses are crucial to HIV-1 control. Although HIV can evade these responses,
      the longer-term impact of viral escape mutants remains unclear, as these variants
      can also reduce intrinsic viral fitness. To address this, we here developed a
      metric to determine the degree of HIV adaptation to an HLA profile. We
      demonstrate that transmission of viruses that are pre-adapted to the HLA
      molecules expressed in the recipient is associated with impaired immunogenicity, 
      elevated viral load and accelerated CD4(+) T cell decline. Furthermore, the
      extent of pre-adaptation among circulating viruses explains much of the variation
      in outcomes attributed to the expression of certain HLA alleles. Thus, viral
      pre-adaptation exploits 'holes' in the immune response. Accounting for these
      holes may be key for vaccine strategies seeking to elicit functional responses
      from viral variants, and to HIV cure strategies that require broad CTL responses 
      to achieve successful eradication of HIV reservoirs.

TI  - Activation of the pluripotency factor OCT4 in smooth muscle cells is
      atheroprotective.
PG  - 657-65
LID - 10.1038/nm.4109 [doi]
AB  - Although somatic cell activation of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency
      factor OCT4 has been reported, this previous work has been controversial and has 
      not demonstrated a functional role for OCT4 in somatic cells. Here we demonstrate
      that smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific conditional knockout of Oct4 in Apoe(-/-) 
      mice resulted in increased lesion size and changes in lesion composition that are
      consistent with decreased plaque stability, including a thinner fibrous cap,
      increased necrotic core area, and increased intraplaque hemorrhage. Results of
      SMC-lineage-tracing studies showed that these effects were probably the result of
      marked reductions in SMC numbers within lesions and SMC investment within the
      fibrous cap, which may result from impaired SMC migration. The reactivation of
      Oct4 within SMCs was associated with hydroxymethylation of the Oct4 promoter and 
      was hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha, encoded by HIF1A) and
      Kruppel-like factor-4 (KLF4)-dependent. These results provide the first direct
      evidence that OCT4 has a functional role in somatic cells, and they highlight the
      potential role of OCT4 in normal and diseased somatic cells.

TI  - Protection against malaria at 1 year and immune correlates following PfSPZ
      vaccination.
PG  - 614-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4110 [doi]
AB  - An attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine,
      is highly protective against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 3 weeks
      after immunization, but the durability of protection is unknown. We assessed how 
      vaccine dosage, regimen, and route of administration affected durable protection 
      in malaria-naive adults. After four intravenous immunizations with 2.7 x 10(5)
      PfSPZ, 6/11 (55%) vaccinated subjects remained without parasitemia following CHMI
      21 weeks after immunization. Five non-parasitemic subjects from this dosage group
      underwent repeat CHMI at 59 weeks, and none developed parasitemia. Although
      Pf-specific serum antibody levels correlated with protection up to 21-25 weeks
      after immunization, antibody levels waned substantially by 59 weeks. Pf-specific 
      T cell responses also declined in blood by 59 weeks. To determine whether T cell 
      responses in blood reflected responses in liver, we vaccinated nonhuman primates 
      with PfSPZ Vaccine. Pf-specific interferon-gamma-producing CD8 T cells were
      present at approximately 100-fold higher frequencies in liver than in blood. Our 
      findings suggest that PfSPZ Vaccine conferred durable protection to malaria
      through long-lived tissue-resident T cells and that administration of higher
      doses may further enhance protection.

TI  - Type I interferons and microbial metabolites of tryptophan modulate astrocyte
      activity and central nervous system inflammation via the aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor.
PG  - 586-97
LID - 10.1038/nm.4106 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during health
      and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response 
      to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity
      and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I
      signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription
      factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2
      (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon
      (IFN)-beta are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the
      gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS
      inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the
      recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by
      supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate,
      indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme
      tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists
      were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function
      in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora 
      to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.

TI  - A human-specific AS3MT isoform and BORCS7 are molecular risk factors in the
      10q24.32 schizophrenia-associated locus.
PG  - 649-56
LID - 10.1038/nm.4096 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported many single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with psychiatric disorders, but knowledge is
      lacking regarding molecular mechanisms. Here we show that risk alleles spanning
      multiple genes across the 10q24.32 schizophrenia-related locus are associated in 
      the human brain selectively with an increase in the expression of both BLOC-1
      related complex subunit 7 (BORCS7) and a previously uncharacterized,
      human-specific arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT) isoform (AS3MT(d2d3)), which
      lacks arsenite methyltransferase activity and is more abundant in individuals
      with schizophrenia than in controls. Conditional-expression analysis suggests
      that BORCS7 and AS3MT(d2d3) signals are largely independent. GWAS risk SNPs
      across this region are linked with a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
      polymorphism in the first exon of AS3MT that is associated with the expression of
      AS3MT(d2d3) in samples from both Caucasians and African Americans. The VNTR
      genotype predicts promoter activity in luciferase assays, as well as DNA
      methylation within the AS3MT gene. Both AS3MT(d2d3) and BORCS7 are expressed in
      adult human neurons and astrocytes, and they are upregulated during human stem
      cell differentiation toward neuronal fates. Our results provide a molecular
      explanation for the prominent 10q24.32 locus association, including a novel and
      evolutionarily recent protein that is involved in early brain development and
      confers risk for psychiatric illness.

TI  - CARD9 impacts colitis by altering gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan into
      aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands.
PG  - 598-605
LID - 10.1038/nm.4102 [doi]
AB  - Complex interactions between the host and the gut microbiota govern intestinal
      homeostasis but remain poorly understood. Here we reveal a relationship between
      gut microbiota and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9), a
      susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that functions in the
      immune response against microorganisms. CARD9 promotes recovery from colitis by
      promoting interleukin (IL)-22 production, and Card9(-/-) mice are more
      susceptible to colitis. The microbiota is altered in Card9(-/-) mice, and
      transfer of the microbiota from Card9(-/-) to wild-type, germ-free recipients
      increases their susceptibility to colitis. The microbiota from Card9(-/-) mice
      fails to metabolize tryptophan into metabolites that act as aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor (AHR) ligands. Intestinal inflammation is attenuated after inoculation
      of mice with three Lactobacillus strains capable of metabolizing tryptophan or by
      treatment with an AHR agonist. Reduced production of AHR ligands is also observed
      in the microbiota from individuals with IBD, particularly in those with CARD9
      risk alleles associated with IBD. Our findings reveal that host genes affect the 
      composition and function of the gut microbiota, altering the production of
      microbial metabolites and intestinal inflammation.

      immunogenic cell death.

LID - 10.1038/nm.4078 [doi]
AB  - Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that is effective in the treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Cetuximab blocks epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR)-ligand interaction and inhibits downstream RAS-ERK activation.
      However, only some activating mutations in RAS affect cetuximab efficacy, and it 
      is not clear what else mediates treatment success. Here we hypothesized that
      cetuximab induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) that activates a potent antitumor 
      response. We found that cetuximab, in combination with chemotherapy, fostered ICD
      in CRC cells, which we measured via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
      response and an increase in phagocytosis by dendritic cells. ICD induction
      depended on the mutational status of the EGFR signaling pathway and on the
      inhibition of the splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), an unfolded protein
      response (UPR) mediator. We confirmed the enhanced immunogenicity elicited by
      cetuximab in a mouse model of human EGFR-expressing CRC. Overall, we demonstrate 
      a new, immune-related mechanism of action of cetuximab that may help to tailor
      personalized medicine.

TI  - Modulation of splicing catalysis for therapeutic targeting of leukemia with
      mutations in genes encoding spliceosomal proteins.
PG  - 672-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4097 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in genes encoding splicing factors (which we refer to as spliceosomal
      genes) are commonly found in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations recurrently affect specific amino
      acid residues, leading to perturbed normal splice site and exon recognition.
      Spliceosomal gene mutations are always heterozygous and rarely occur together
      with one another, suggesting that cells may tolerate only a partial deviation
      from normal splicing activity. To test this hypothesis, we engineered mice to
      express a mutated allele of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2
      (Srsf2(P95H))-which commonly occurs in individuals with MDS and AML-in an
      inducible, hemizygous manner in hematopoietic cells. These mice rapidly succumbed
      to fatal bone marrow failure, demonstrating that Srsf2-mutated cells depend on
      the wild-type Srsf2 allele for survival. In the context of leukemia, treatment
      with the spliceosome inhibitor E7107 (refs. 7,8) resulted in substantial
      reductions in leukemic burden, specifically in isogenic mouse leukemias and
      patient-derived xenograft AMLs carrying spliceosomal mutations. Whereas E7107
      treatment of mice resulted in widespread intron retention and cassette exon
      skipping in leukemic cells regardless of Srsf2 genotype, the magnitude of
      splicing inhibition following E7107 treatment was greater in Srsf2-mutated than
      in Srsf2-wild-type leukemia, consistent with the differential effect of E7107 on 
      survival. Collectively, these data provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence
      that leukemias with spliceosomal gene mutations are preferentially susceptible to
      additional splicing perturbations in vivo as compared to leukemias without such
      mutations. Modulation of spliceosome function may thus provide a new therapeutic 
      avenue in genetically defined subsets of individuals with MDS or AML.

TI  - Excessive fatty acid oxidation induces muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia.
PG  - 666-71
LID - 10.1038/nm.4093 [doi]
AB  - Cachexia is a devastating muscle-wasting syndrome that occurs in patients who
      have chronic diseases. It is most commonly observed in individuals with advanced 
      cancer, presenting in 80% of these patients, and it is one of the primary causes 
      of morbidity and mortality associated with cancer. Additionally, although many
      people with cachexia show hypermetabolism, the causative role of metabolism in
      muscle atrophy has been unclear. To understand the molecular basis of
      cachexia-associated muscle atrophy, it is necessary to develop accurate models of
      the condition. By using transcriptomics and cytokine profiling of human muscle
      stem cell-based models and human cancer-induced cachexia models in mice, we found
      that cachectic cancer cells secreted many inflammatory factors that rapidly led
      to high levels of fatty acid metabolism and to the activation of a p38
      stress-response signature in skeletal muscles, before manifestation of cachectic 
      muscle atrophy occurred. Metabolomics profiling revealed that factors secreted by
      cachectic cancer cells rapidly induce excessive fatty acid oxidation in human
      myotubes, which leads to oxidative stress, p38 activation and impaired muscle
      growth. Pharmacological blockade of fatty acid oxidation not only rescued human
      myotubes, but also improved muscle mass and body weight in cancer cachexia models
      in vivo. Therefore, fatty acid-induced oxidative stress could be targeted to
      prevent cancer-induced cachexia.

AB  - B cell lymphoma and melanoma harbor recurrent mutations in the gene encoding the 
      EZH2 histone methyltransferase (EZH2), but the carcinogenic role of these
      mutations is unclear. Here we describe a mouse model in which the most common
      somatic Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation (EZH2(Y646F) in human; Ezh2(Y641F) in
      mouse) is conditionally expressed. Expression of Ezh2(Y641F) in mouse B cells or 
      melanocytes caused high-penetrance lymphoma or melanoma, respectively.
      Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, but not the oncoprotein Myc,
      or loss of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) further
      accelerated lymphoma progression. Expression of the mutant Braf but not the
      mutant Nras oncoprotein further accelerated melanoma progression. Although
      expression of Ezh2(Y641F) globally increased the abundance of trimethylated Lys27
      of histone H3 (H3K27me3), it also caused a widespread redistribution of this
      repressive mark, including a loss of H3K27me3 that was associated with increased 
      transcription at many loci. These results suggest that Ezh2(Y641F) induces
      lymphoma and melanoma through a vast reorganization of chromatin structure,
      inducing both repression and activation of polycomb-regulated loci.

TI  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation from fixed clinical tissues reveals tumor-specific 
      enhancer profiles.
PG  - 685-91
LID - 10.1038/nm.4085 [doi]
AB  - Extensive cross-linking introduced during routine tissue fixation of clinical
      pathology specimens severely hampers chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
      next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis from archived tissue samples. This
      limits the ability to study the epigenomes of valuable, clinically annotated
      tissue resources. Here we describe fixed-tissue chromatin immunoprecipitation
      sequencing (FiT-seq), a method that enables reliable extraction of soluble
      chromatin from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples for
      accurate detection of histone marks. We demonstrate that FiT-seq data from FFPE
      specimens are concordant with ChIP-seq data from fresh-frozen samples of the same
      tumors. By using multiple histone marks, we generate chromatin-state maps and
      identify cis-regulatory elements in clinical samples from various tumor types
      that can readily allow us to distinguish between cancers by the tissue of origin.
      Tumor-specific enhancers and superenhancers that are elucidated by FiT-seq
      analysis correlate with known oncogenic drivers in different tissues and can
      assist in the understanding of how chromatin states affect gene regulation.

PG  - 641-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4084 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between the hippocampus and the cortex are critical for memory.
      Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) identify epileptic brain regions and
      can impair memory, but the mechanisms by which they interact with physiological
      patterns of network activity are mostly undefined. We show in a rat model of
      temporal lobe epilepsy that spontaneous hippocampal IEDs correlate with impaired 
      memory consolidation, and that they are precisely coordinated with spindle
      oscillations in the prefrontal cortex during nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. 
      This coordination surpasses the normal physiological ripple-spindle coupling and 
      is accompanied by decreased ripple occurrence. IEDs also induce spindles during
      rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness-behavioral states that do not
      naturally express these oscillations-by generating a cortical 'down' state. In a 
      pilot clinical examination of four subjects with focal epilepsy, we confirm a
      similar correlation of temporofrontal IEDs with spindles over anatomically
      restricted cortical regions. These findings imply that IEDs may impair memory via
      the misappropriation of physiological mechanisms for hippocampal-cortical
      coupling, which suggests a target for the treatment of memory impairment in
      epilepsy.

TI  - Two FOXP3(+)CD4(+) T cell subpopulations distinctly control the prognosis of
      colorectal cancers.
PG  - 679-84
LID - 10.1038/nm.4086 [doi]
AB  - CD4(+) T cells that express the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) transcription factor
      function as regulatory T (Treg) cells and hinder effective immune responses
      against cancer cells. Abundant Treg cell infiltration into tumors is associated
      with poor clinical outcomes in various types of cancers. However, the role of
      Treg cells is controversial in colorectal cancers (CRCs), in which FOXP3(+) T
      cell infiltration indicated better prognosis in some studies. Here we show that
      CRCs, which are commonly infiltrated by suppression-competent FOXP3(hi) Treg
      cells, can be classified into two types by the degree of additional infiltration 
      of FOXP3(lo) nonsuppressive T cells. The latter, which are distinguished from
      FOXP3(+) Treg cells by non-expression of the naive T cell marker CD45RA and
      instability of FOXP3, secreted inflammatory cytokines. Indeed, CRCs with abundant
      infiltration of FOXP3(lo) T cells showed significantly better prognosis than
      those with predominantly FOXP3(hi) Treg cell infiltration. Development of such
      inflammatory FOXP3(lo) non-Treg cells may depend on secretion of interleukin
      (IL)-12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta by tissues and their presence
      was correlated with tumor invasion by intestinal bacteria, especially
      Fusobacterium nucleatum. Thus, functionally distinct subpopulations of
      tumor-infiltrating FOXP3(+) T cells contribute in opposing ways to determining
      CRC prognosis. Depletion of FOXP3(hi) Treg cells from tumor tissues, which would 
      augment antitumor immunity, could thus be used as an effective treatment strategy
      for CRCs and other cancers, whereas strategies that locally increase the
      population of FOXP3(lo) non-Treg cells could be used to suppress or prevent tumor
      formation.

TI  - A framework for understanding and targeting residual disease in oncogene-driven
      solid cancers.
PG  - 472-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4091 [doi]
AB  - Molecular targeted therapy has the potential to dramatically improve survival in 
      patients with cancer. However, complete and durable responses to targeted therapy
      are rare in individuals with advanced-stage solid cancers. Even the most
      effective targeted therapies generally do not induce a complete tumor response,
      resulting in residual disease and tumor progression that limits patient survival.
      We discuss the emerging need to more fully understand the molecular basis of
      residual disease as a prelude to designing therapeutic strategies to minimize or 
      eliminate residual disease so that we can move from temporary to chronic control 
      of disease, or a cure, for patients with advanced-stage solid cancers.
      Ultimately, we propose a shift from the current reactive paradigm of analyzing
      and treating acquired drug resistance to a pre-emptive paradigm of defining the
      mechanisms that result in residual disease, to target and limit this disease
      reservoir.

PG  - 464-71

AB  - Rapid and affordable tumor molecular profiling has led to an explosion of
      clinical and genomic data poised to enhance the diagnosis, prognostication and
      treatment of cancer. A critical point has now been reached at which the analysis 
      and storage of annotated clinical and genomic information in unconnected silos
      will stall the advancement of precision cancer care. Information systems must be 
      harmonized to overcome the multiple technical and logistical barriers to data
      sharing. Against this backdrop, the Global Alliance for Genomic Health (GA4GH)
      was established in 2013 to create a common framework that enables responsible,
      voluntary and secure sharing of clinical and genomic data. This Perspective from 
      the GA4GH Clinical Working Group Cancer Task Team highlights the data-aggregation
      challenges faced by the field, suggests potential collaborative solutions and
      describes how GA4GH can catalyze a harmonized data-sharing culture.

TI  - Activation of Bacteroides fragilis toxin by a novel bacterial protease
      contributes to anaerobic sepsis in mice.
PG  - 563-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.4077 [doi]
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis is the leading cause of anaerobic bacteremia and sepsis.
      Enterotoxigenic strains that produce B. fragilis toxin (BFT, fragilysin)
      contribute to colitis and intestinal malignancy, yet are also isolated in
      bloodstream infection. It is not known whether these strains harbor unique
      genetic determinants that confer virulence in extra-intestinal disease. We
      demonstrate that BFT contributes to sepsis in mice, and we identify a B. fragilis
      protease called fragipain (Fpn) that is required for the endogenous activation of
      BFT through the removal of its auto-inhibitory prodomain. Structural analysis of 
      Fpn reveals a His-Cys catalytic dyad that is characteristic of C11-family
      cysteine proteases that are conserved in multiple pathogenic Bacteroides spp. and
      Clostridium spp. Fpn-deficient, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis has an attenuated
      ability to induce sepsis in mice; however, Fpn is dispensable in B. fragilis
      colitis, wherein host proteases mediate BFT activation. Our findings define a
      role for B. fragilis enterotoxin and its activating protease in the pathogenesis 
      of bloodstream infection, which indicates a greater complexity of cellular
      targeting and activity of BFT than previously recognized. The expression of fpn
      by both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains suggests that this protease may
      contribute to anaerobic sepsis in ways that extend beyond its role in toxin
      activation. It could thus potentially serve as a target for disease modification.

TI  - Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes recapitulate the
      predilection of breast cancer patients to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
PG  - 547-56
LID - 10.1038/nm.4087 [doi]
AB  - Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy agent effective in treating a wide
      range of malignancies, but it causes a dose-related cardiotoxicity that can lead 
      to heart failure in a subset of patients. At present, it is not possible to
      predict which patients will be affected by doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity
      (DIC). Here we demonstrate that patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem
      cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can recapitulate the predilection to DIC 
      of individual patients at the cellular level. hiPSC-CMs derived from individuals 
      with breast cancer who experienced DIC were consistently more sensitive to
      doxorubicin toxicity than hiPSC-CMs from patients who did not experience DIC,
      with decreased cell viability, impaired mitochondrial and metabolic function,
      impaired calcium handling, decreased antioxidant pathway activity, and increased 
      reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, our data indicate that
      hiPSC-CMs are a suitable platform to identify and characterize the genetic basis 
      and molecular mechanisms of DIC.

TI  - Genotype tunes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissue tension to induce

PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.1038/nm.4082 [doi]
AB  - Fibrosis compromises pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) treatment and contributes
      to patient mortality, yet antistromal therapies are controversial. We found that 
      human PDACs with impaired epithelial transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
      signaling have high epithelial STAT3 activity and develop stiff,
      matricellular-enriched fibrosis associated with high epithelial tension and
      shorter patient survival. In several KRAS-driven mouse models, both the loss of
      TGF-beta signaling and elevated beta1-integrin mechanosignaling engaged a
      positive feedback loop whereby STAT3 signaling promotes tumor progression by
      increasing matricellular fibrosis and tissue tension. In contrast, epithelial
      STAT3 ablation attenuated tumor progression by reducing the stromal stiffening
      and epithelial contractility induced by loss of TGF-beta signaling. In PDAC
      patient biopsies, higher matricellular protein and activated STAT3 were
      associated with SMAD4 mutation and shorter survival. The findings implicate
      epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis in the aggressiveness of SMAD4
      mutant pancreatic tumors and highlight STAT3 and mechanics as key drivers of this
      phenotype.

TI  - LGR4 is a receptor for RANKL and negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation 
      and bone resorption.
PG  - 539-46
LID - 10.1038/nm.4076 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11, also known as RANKL) 
      regulates multiple physiological or pathological functions, including osteoclast 
      differentiation and osteoporosis. TNFRSF11A (also called RANK) is considered to
      be the sole receptor for RANKL. Herein we report that leucine-rich
      repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4, also called GPR48) is
      another receptor for RANKL. LGR4 competes with RANK to bind RANKL and suppresses 
      canonical RANK signaling during osteoclast differentiation. RANKL binding to LGR4
      activates the Galphaq and GSK3-beta signaling pathway, an action that suppresses 
      the expression and activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic, 
      calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATC1) during osteoclastogenesis. Both whole-body
      (Lgr4(-/-)) and monocyte conditional knockout mice of Lgr4 (Lgr4 CKO) exhibit
      osteoclast hyperactivation (including elevation of osteoclast number, surface
      area, and size) and increased bone erosion. The soluble LGR4 extracellular domain
      (ECD) binds RANKL and inhibits osteoclast differentiation in vivo. Moreover,
      LGR4-ECD therapeutically abrogated RANKL-induced bone loss in three mouse models 
      of osteoporosis. Therefore, LGR4 acts as a second RANKL receptor that negatively 
      regulates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.

TI  - Nod2-mediated recognition of the microbiota is critical for mucosal adjuvant
      activity of cholera toxin.
PG  - 524-30
LID - 10.1038/nm.4075 [doi]
AB  - Cholera toxin (CT) is a potent adjuvant for inducing mucosal immune responses.
      However, the mechanism by which CT induces adjuvant activity remains unclear.
      Here we show that the microbiota is critical for inducing antigen-specific IgG
      production after intranasal immunization. After mucosal vaccination with CT, both
      antibiotic-treated and germ-free (GF) mice had reduced amounts of
      antigen-specific IgG, smaller recall-stimulated cytokine responses, impaired
      follicular helper T (TFH) cell responses and reduced numbers of plasma cells.
      Recognition of symbiotic bacteria via the nucleotide-binding oligomerization
      domain containing 2 (Nod2) sensor in cells that express the integrin CD11c
      (encoded by Itgax) was required for the adjuvanticity of CT. Reconstitution of GF
      mice with a Nod2 agonist or monocolonization with Staphylococcus sciuri, which
      has high Nod2-stimulatory activity, was sufficient to promote robust CT adjuvant 
      activity, whereas bacteria with low Nod2-stimulatory activity did not.
      Mechanistically, CT enhanced Nod2-mediated cytokine production in dendritic cells
      via intracellular cyclic AMP. These results show a role for the microbiota and
      the intracellular receptor Nod2 in promoting the mucosal adjuvant activity of CT.

TI  - RNA interference-induced hepatotoxicity results from loss of the first
      synthesized isoform of microRNA-122 in mice.
PG  - 557-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.4079 [doi]
AB  - Small RNAs can be engineered to target and eliminate expression of
      disease-causing genes or infectious viruses, resulting in the preclinical and
      clinical development of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics using these small
      RNAs. To ensure the success of RNAi therapeutics, small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
      must co-opt sufficient quantities of the endogenous microRNA machinery to elicit 
      efficient gene knockdown without impeding normal cellular function. We previously
      observed liver toxicity-including hepatocyte turnover, loss of gene repression
      and lethality-in mice receiving high doses of a recombinant adeno-associated
      virus (rAAV) vector expressing shRNAs (rAAV-shRNAs); however the mechanism by
      which toxicity ensues has not been elucidated. Using rAAV-shRNAs we have now
      determined that hepatotoxicity arises when exogenous shRNAs exceed 12% of the
      total amount of liver microRNAs. After this threshold was surpassed, shRNAs
      specifically reduced the initially synthesized 22-nucleotide isoform of microRNA 
      (miR)-122-5p without substantially affecting other microRNAs, resulting in
      functional de-repression of miR-122 target mRNAs. Delivery of a rAAV-shRNA vector
      expressing mature miR-122-5p could circumvent toxicity, despite the exogenous
      shRNA accounting for 70% of microRNAs. Toxicity was also not observed in
      Mir122-knockout mice regardless of the level or sequence of the shRNA. Our study 
      establishes limits to the microRNA machinery that is available for therapeutic
      siRNAs and suggests new paradigms for the role of miR-122 in liver homeostasis in
      mice.

TI  - Inflammatory signaling in human tuberculosis granulomas is spatially organized.
PG  - 531-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4073 [doi]
AB  - Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their
      function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the 
      role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects
      with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection,
      mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps
      of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a
      pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of
      antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.
      Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively
      anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six
      human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and
      anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that
      these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein
      and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize
      that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical
      localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the
      granuloma.

TI  - Epithelial calcineurin controls microbiota-dependent intestinal tumor
      development.
PG  - 506-15
LID - 10.1038/nm.4072 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation-associated pathways are active in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
      and contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Calcineurin, a
      phosphatase required for the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T
      cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, shows increased expression in CRC. 
      We therefore investigated the role of calcineurin in intestinal tumor
      development. We demonstrate that calcineurin and NFAT factors are constitutively 
      expressed by primary IECs and selectively activated in intestinal tumors as a
      result of impaired stratification of the tumor-associated microbiota and
      toll-like receptor signaling. Epithelial calcineurin supports the survival and
      proliferation of cancer stem cells in an NFAT-dependent manner and promotes the
      development of intestinal tumors in mice. Moreover, somatic mutations that have
      been identified in human CRC are associated with constitutive activation of
      calcineurin, whereas nuclear translocation of NFAT is associated with increased
      death from CRC. These findings highlight an epithelial cell-intrinsic pathway
      that integrates signals derived from the commensal microbiota to promote
      intestinal tumor development.

TI  - ROR-gamma drives androgen receptor expression and represents a therapeutic target
      in castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 488-96
LID - 10.1038/nm.4070 [doi]
AB  - The androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in human
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the determinants of AR
      overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid
      receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR-gamma) is overexpressed and amplified
      in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-gamma drives AR expression in the tumors.
      ROR-gamma recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also
      known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR
      gene transcription. ROR-gamma antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and 
      its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-gamma
      antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and 
      expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-gamma antagonists
      suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft
      PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without 
      overt toxicity, in mice. Taken together, these results establish ROR-gamma as a
      key player in CRPC by acting upstream of AR and as a potential therapeutic target
      for advanced PCa.

TI  - Spinal cord reconstitution with homologous neural grafts enables robust
      corticospinal regeneration.
PG  - 479-87
LID - 10.1038/nm.4066 [doi]
AB  - The corticospinal tract (CST) is the most important motor system in humans, yet
      robust regeneration of this projection after spinal cord injury (SCI) has not
      been accomplished. In murine models of SCI, we report robust corticospinal axon
      regeneration, functional synapse formation and improved skilled forelimb function
      after grafting multipotent neural progenitor cells into sites of SCI.
      Corticospinal regeneration requires grafts to be driven toward caudalized (spinal
      cord), rather than rostralized, fates. Fully mature caudalized neural grafts also
      support corticospinal regeneration. Moreover, corticospinal axons can emerge from
      neural grafts and regenerate beyond the lesion, a process that is potentially
      related to the attenuation of the glial scar. Rat corticospinal axons also
      regenerate into human donor grafts of caudal spinal cord identity. Collectively, 
      these findings indicate that spinal cord 'replacement' with homologous neural
      stem cells enables robust regeneration of the corticospinal projection within and
      beyond spinal cord lesion sites, achieving a major unmet goal of SCI research and
      offering new possibilities for clinical translation.

TI  - Commensal microbiota affects ischemic stroke outcome by regulating intestinal
      gammadelta T cells.
PG  - 516-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4068 [doi]
AB  - Commensal gut bacteria impact the host immune system and can influence disease
      processes in several organs, including the brain. However, it remains unclear
      whether the microbiota has an impact on the outcome of acute brain injury. Here
      we show that antibiotic-induced alterations in the intestinal flora reduce
      ischemic brain injury in mice, an effect transmissible by fecal transplants.
      Intestinal dysbiosis alters immune homeostasis in the small intestine, leading to
      an increase in regulatory T cells and a reduction in interleukin (IL)-17-positive
      gammadelta T cells through altered dendritic cell activity. Dysbiosis suppresses 
      trafficking of effector T cells from the gut to the leptomeninges after stroke.
      Additionally, IL-10 and IL-17 are required for the neuroprotection afforded by
      intestinal dysbiosis. The findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-brain
      axis and an impact of the intestinal flora and meningeal IL-17(+) gammadelta T
      cells on ischemic injury.

TI  - Advancing the understanding of autism disease mechanisms through genetics.
PG  - 345-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.4071 [doi]
AB  - Progress in understanding the genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
      has fueled remarkable advances in our understanding of its potential
      neurobiological mechanisms. Yet, at the same time, these findings highlight
      extraordinary causal diversity and complexity at many levels ranging from
      molecules to circuits and emphasize the gaps in our current knowledge. Here we
      review current understanding of the genetic architecture of ASD and integrate
      genetic evidence, neuropathology and studies in model systems with how they
      inform mechanistic models of ASD pathophysiology. Despite the challenges, these
      advances provide a solid foundation for the development of rational, targeted
      molecular therapies.

TI  - Modeling Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome with induced pluripotent stem cells reveals a
      causal role for Wnt/beta-catenin defects in neuronal cholesterol synthesis
      phenotypes.
PG  - 388-96
LID - 10.1038/nm.4067 [doi]
AB  - Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a malformation disorder caused by mutations 
      in DHCR7, which impair the reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to
      cholesterol. SLOS results in cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities and
      nervous system defects, though neither affected cell types nor impaired signaling
      pathways are fully understood. Whether 7DHC accumulation or cholesterol loss is
      primarily responsible for disease pathogenesis is also unclear. Using induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from subjects with SLOS, we identified cellular
      defects that lead to precocious neuronal specification within SLOS derived neural
      progenitors. We also demonstrated that 7DHC accumulation, not cholesterol
      deficiency, is critical for SLOS-associated defects. We further identified
      downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling as a key initiator of aberrant SLOS 
      iPSC differentiation through the direct inhibitory effects of 7DHC on the
      formation of an active Wnt receptor complex. Activation of canonical Wnt
      signaling prevented the neural phenotypes observed in SLOS iPSCs, suggesting that
      Wnt signaling may be a promising therapeutic target for SLOS.

AB  - Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a major
      objective where antenatal care is not readily accessible. We tested
      HIV-1-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs) as a
      post-exposure therapy in an infant macaque model for intrapartum MTCT.
      One-month-old rhesus macaques were inoculated orally with the simian-human
      immunodeficiency virus SHIVSF162P3. On days 1, 4, 7 and 10 after virus exposure, 
      we injected animals subcutaneously with NmAbs and quantified systemic
      distribution of NmAbs in multiple tissues within 24 h after antibody
      administration. Replicating virus was found in multiple tissues by day 1 in
      animals that were not treated. All NmAb-treated macaques were free of virus in
      blood and tissues at 6 months after exposure. We detected no anti-SHIV T cell
      responses in blood or tissues at necropsy, and no virus emerged after CD8(+) T
      cell depletion. These results suggest that early passive immunotherapy can
      eliminate early viral foci and thereby prevent the establishment of viral
      reservoirs.

TI  - PTEN opposes negative selection and enables oncogenic transformation of pre-B
      cells.
PG  - 379-87
LID - 10.1038/nm.4062 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway
      and a potent tumor suppressor in many types of cancer. To test a tumor
      suppressive role for PTEN in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we induced
      Cre-mediated deletion of Pten in mouse models of pre-B ALL. In contrast to its
      role as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, loss of one or both alleles of Pten 
      caused rapid cell death of pre-B ALL cells and was sufficient to clear transplant
      recipient mice of leukemia. Small-molecule inhibition of PTEN in human pre-B ALL 
      cells resulted in hyperactivation of AKT, activation of the p53 tumor suppressor 
      cell cycle checkpoint and cell death. Loss of PTEN function in pre-B ALL cells
      was functionally equivalent to acute activation of autoreactive pre-B cell

      autoreactive B cells. We propose that targeted inhibition of PTEN and
      hyperactivation of AKT triggers a checkpoint for the elimination of autoreactive

AB  - Upregulation of the persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) in motoneurons contributes
      to the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI). We investigated 
      the mechanisms that regulate I(NaP) and observed elevated expression of
      voltage-gated sodium (Nav) 1.6 channels in spinal lumbar motoneurons of adult
      rats with SCI. Furthermore, immunoblots revealed a proteolysis of Nav channels,
      and biochemical assays identified calpain as the main proteolytic factor.
      Calpain-dependent cleavage of Nav channels after neonatal SCI was associated with
      an upregulation of I(NaP) in motoneurons. Similarly, the calpain-dependent
      cleavage of Nav1.6 channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells
      caused the upregulation of I(NaP). The pharmacological inhibition of calpain
      activity by MDL28170 reduced the cleavage of Nav channels, I(NaP) in motoneurons 
      and spasticity in rats with SCI. Similarly, the blockade of I(NaP) by riluzole
      alleviated spasticity. This study demonstrates that Nav channel expression in
      lumbar motoneurons is altered after SCI, and it shows a tight relationship
      between the calpain-dependent proteolysis of Nav1.6 channels, the upregulation of
      I(NaP) and spasticity.

TI  - Retinal lipid and glucose metabolism dictates angiogenesis through the lipid
      sensor Ffar1.
PG  - 439-45
LID - 10.1038/nm.4059 [doi]
AB  - Tissues with high metabolic rates often use lipids, as well as glucose, for
      energy, conferring a survival advantage during feast and famine. Current dogma
      suggests that high-energy-consuming photoreceptors depend on glucose. Here we
      show that the retina also uses fatty acid beta-oxidation for energy. Moreover, we
      identify a lipid sensor, free fatty acid receptor 1 (Ffar1), that curbs glucose
      uptake when fatty acids are available. Very-low-density lipoprotein receptor
      (Vldlr), which is present in photoreceptors and is expressed in other tissues
      with a high metabolic rate, facilitates the uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty 
      acid. In the retinas of Vldlr(-/-) mice with low fatty acid uptake but high
      circulating lipid levels, we found that Ffar1 suppresses expression of the
      glucose transporter Glut1. Impaired glucose entry into photoreceptors results in 
      a dual (lipid and glucose) fuel shortage and a reduction in the levels of the
      Krebs cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). Low alpha-KG levels
      promotes stabilization of hypoxia-induced factor 1a (Hif1a) and secretion of
      vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) by starved Vldlr(-/-)
      photoreceptors, leading to neovascularization. The aberrant vessels in the
      Vldlr(-/-) retinas, which invade normally avascular photoreceptors, are
      reminiscent of the vascular defects in retinal angiomatous proliferation, a
      subset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is associated
      with high vitreous VEGFA levels in humans. Dysregulated lipid and glucose
      photoreceptor energy metabolism may therefore be a driving force in macular
      telangiectasia, neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases.

TI  - p16(Ink4a)-induced senescence of pancreatic beta cells enhances insulin
      secretion.
PG  - 412-20
LID - 10.1038/nm.4054 [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence is thought to contribute to age-associated deterioration of
      tissue physiology. The senescence effector p16(Ink4a) is expressed in pancreatic 
      beta cells during aging and limits their proliferative potential; however, its
      effects on beta cell function are poorly characterized. We found that beta
      cell-specific activation of p16(Ink4a) in transgenic mice enhances
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In mice with diabetes, this leads to
      improved glucose homeostasis, providing an unexpected functional benefit.
      Expression of p16(Ink4a) in beta cells induces hallmarks of senescence--including
      cell enlargement, and greater glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity--which
      promote increased insulin secretion. GSIS increases during the normal aging of
      mice and is driven by elevated p16(Ink4a) activity. We found that islets from
      human adults contain p16(Ink4a)-expressing senescent beta cells and that
      senescence induced by p16(Ink4a) in a human beta cell line increases insulin
      secretion in a manner dependent, in part, on the activity of the mechanistic
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      (PPAR)-gamma proteins. Our findings reveal a novel role for p16(Ink4a) and
      cellular senescence in promoting insulin secretion by beta cells and in
      regulating normal functional tissue maturation with age.

PG  - 421-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.4057 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological and experimental data implicate branched-chain amino acids
      (BCAAs) in the development of insulin resistance, but the mechanisms that
      underlie this link remain unclear. Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle stems
      from the excess accumulation of lipid species, a process that requires
      blood-borne lipids to initially traverse the blood vessel wall. How this
      trans-endothelial transport occurs and how it is regulated are not well
      understood. Here we leveraged PPARGC1a (also known as PGC-1alpha; encoded by
      Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator that regulates broad programs of fatty
      acid consumption, to identify 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB), a catabolic
      intermediate of the BCAA valine, as a new paracrine regulator of
      trans-endothelial fatty acid transport. We found that 3-HIB is secreted from
      muscle cells, activates endothelial fatty acid transport, stimulates muscle fatty
      acid uptake in vivo and promotes lipid accumulation in muscle, leading to insulin
      resistance in mice. Conversely, inhibiting the synthesis of 3-HIB in muscle cells
      blocks the ability of PGC-1alpha to promote endothelial fatty acid uptake. 3-HIB 
      levels are elevated in muscle from db/db mice with diabetes and from human
      subjects with diabetes, as compared to those without diabetes. These data unveil 
      a mechanism in which the metabolite 3-HIB, by regulating the trans-endothelial
      flux of fatty acids, links the regulation of fatty acid flux to BCAA catabolism, 
      providing a mechanistic explanation for how increased BCAA catabolic flux can
      cause diabetes.

TI  - Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation as a therapy for MYC-overexpressing
      triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 427-32
LID - 10.1038/nm.4055 [doi]
AB  - Expression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC is disproportionately
      elevated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), as compared to estrogen
      receptor-, progesterone receptor- or human epidermal growth factor 2
      receptor-positive (RP) breast cancer. We and others have shown that MYC alters
      metabolism during tumorigenesis. However, the role of MYC in TNBC metabolism
      remains mostly unexplored. We hypothesized that MYC-dependent metabolic
      dysregulation is essential for the growth of MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells and
      may identify new therapeutic targets for this clinically challenging subset of
      breast cancer. Using a targeted metabolomics approach, we identified fatty acid
      oxidation (FAO) intermediates as being dramatically upregulated in a MYC-driven
      model of TNBC. We also identified a lipid metabolism gene signature in patients
      with TNBC that were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and from
      multiple other clinical data sets, implicating FAO as a dysregulated pathway that
      is critical for TNBC cell metabolism. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of
      FAO catastrophically decreased energy metabolism in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells
      and blocked tumor growth in a MYC-driven transgenic TNBC model and in a
      MYC-overexpressing TNBC patient-derived xenograft. These findings demonstrate
      that MYC-overexpressing TNBC shows an increased bioenergetic reliance on FAO and 
      identify the inhibition of FAO as a potential therapeutic strategy for this
      subset of breast cancer.

AB  - Astrocytes isolated from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are
      toxic to motor neurons (MNs) and play a non-cell autonomous role in disease
      pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of MNs to cell death
      remain unclear. Here we report that astrocytes derived from either mice bearing
      mutations in genes associated with ALS or human subjects with ALS reduce the
      expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules on MNs;
      reduced MHCI expression makes these MNs susceptible to astrocyte-induced cell
      death. Increasing MHCI expression on MNs increases survival and motor performance
      in a mouse model of ALS and protects MNs against astrocyte toxicity.
      Overexpression of a single MHCI molecule, HLA-F, protects human MNs from ALS
      astrocyte-mediated toxicity, whereas knockdown of its receptor, the killer cell
      immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR3DL2, on human astrocytes results in enhanced MN 
      death. Thus, our data indicate that, in ALS, loss of MHCI expression on MNs
      renders them more vulnerable to astrocyte-mediated toxicity.

AB  - Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic
      therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic
      alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major
      oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed
      multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome
      sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript
      profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals. 
      In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited
      diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations,
      the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic 
      drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR)
      activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell 
      proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was
      correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F
      transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with
      somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM)
      exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than
      did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins. Collectively,
      these data indicate that although exceptions exist, evaluating a single
      metastasis provides a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic driver
      alterations that are present in disseminated tumors within an individual, and
      thus may be useful for selecting treatments on the basis of predicted molecular
      vulnerabilities.

TI  - Prospective identification of neoantigen-specific lymphocytes in the peripheral
      blood of melanoma patients.
PG  - 433-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4051 [doi]
AB  - Detection of lymphocytes that target tumor-specific mutant neoantigens--derived
      from products encoded by mutated genes in the tumor--is mostly limited to
      tumor-resident lymphocytes, but whether these lymphocytes often occur in the
      circulation is unclear. We recently reported that intratumoral expression of the 
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor can guide the identification of the
      patient-specific repertoire of tumor-reactive CD8(+) lymphocytes that reside in
      the tumor. In view of these findings, we investigated whether PD-1 expression on 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes could be used as a biomarker to detect T cells that 
      target neoantigens. By using a high-throughput personalized screening approach,
      we identified neoantigen-specific lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of three of
      four melanoma patients. Despite their low frequency in the circulation, we found 
      that CD8(+)PD-1(+), but not CD8(+)PD-1(-), cell populations had lymphocytes that 
      targeted 3, 3 and 1 unique, patient-specific neoantigens, respectively. We show
      that neoantigen-specific T cells and gene-engineered lymphocytes expressing
      neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from peripheral blood
      recognized autologous tumors. Notably, the tumor-antigen specificities and TCR
      repertoires of the circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8(+)PD-1(+) cells
      appeared similar, implying that the circulating CD8(+)PD-1(+) lymphocytes could
      provide a window into the tumor-resident antitumor lymphocytes. Thus, expression 
      of PD-1 identifies a diverse and patient-specific antitumor T cell response in
      peripheral blood, providing a novel noninvasive strategy to develop personalized 
      therapies using neoantigen-reactive lymphocytes or TCRs to treat cancer.

TI  - Synaptic plasticity and depression: new insights from stress and rapid-acting
      antidepressants.
PG  - 238-49
LID - 10.1038/nm.4050 [doi]
AB  - Depression is a common, devastating illness. Current pharmacotherapies help many 
      patients, but high rates of a partial response or no response, and the delayed
      onset of the effects of antidepressant therapies, leave many patients
      inadequately treated. However, new insights into the neurobiology of stress and
      human mood disorders have shed light on mechanisms underlying the vulnerability
      of individuals to depression and have pointed to novel antidepressants.
      Environmental events and other risk factors contribute to depression through
      converging molecular and cellular mechanisms that disrupt neuronal function and
      morphology, resulting in dysfunction of the circuitry that is essential for mood 
      regulation and cognitive function. Although current antidepressants, such as
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, produce subtle changes that take effect in weeks
      or months, it has recently been shown that treatment with new agents results in
      an improvement in mood ratings within hours of dosing patients who are resistant 
      to typical antidepressants. Within a similar time scale, these new agents have
      also been shown to reverse the synaptic deficits caused by stress.

TI  - Transient inhibition of ROR-gammat therapeutically limits intestinal inflammation
      by reducing TH17 cells and preserving group 3 innate lymphoid cells.
PG  - 319-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.4046 [doi]
AB  - RAR-related orphan receptor-gammat (ROR-gammat) directs differentiation of
      proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and is a potential therapeutic target in
      chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, ROR-gammat-dependent group
      3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s provide essential immunity and tissue protection in
      the intestine, suggesting that targeting ROR-gammat could also result in impaired
      host defense after infection or enhanced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that
      transient chemical inhibition of ROR-gammat in mice selectively reduces cytokine 
      production from TH17 but not ILCs in the context of intestinal infection with
      Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in preserved innate immunity. Temporal deletion 
      of Rorc (encoding ROR-gammat) in mature ILCs also did not impair cytokine
      response in the steady state or during infection. Finally, pharmacologic
      inhibition of ROR-gammat provided therapeutic benefit in mouse models of
      intestinal inflammation and reduced the frequency of TH17 cells but not ILCs
      isolated from primary intestinal samples of individuals with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Collectively, these results reveal differential requirements for
      ROR-gammat in the maintenance of TH17 cell and ILC3 responses and suggest that
      transient inhibition of ROR-gammat is a safe and effective therapeutic approach
      during intestinal inflammation.

TI  - Rps14 haploinsufficiency causes a block in erythroid differentiation mediated by 
      S100A8 and S100A9.
PG  - 288-97
LID - 10.1038/nm.4047 [doi]
AB  - Impaired erythropoiesis in the deletion 5q (del(5q)) subtype of myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) has been linked to heterozygous deletion of RPS14, which encodes
      the ribosomal protein small subunit 14. We generated mice with conditional
      inactivation of Rps14 and demonstrated an erythroid differentiation defect that
      is dependent on the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) and
      is characterized by apoptosis at the transition from polychromatic to
      orthochromatic erythroblasts. This defect resulted in age-dependent progressive
      anemia, megakaryocyte dysplasia and loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
      quiescence. As assessed by quantitative proteomics, mutant erythroblasts
      expressed higher levels of proteins involved in innate immune signaling, notably 
      the heterodimeric S100 calcium-binding proteins S100a8 and S100a9. S100a8--whose 
      expression was increased in mutant erythroblasts, monocytes and macrophages--is
      functionally involved in the erythroid defect caused by the Rps14 deletion, as
      addition of recombinant S100a8 was sufficient to induce a differentiation defect 
      in wild-type erythroid cells, and genetic inactivation of S100a8 expression
      rescued the erythroid differentiation defect of Rps14-haploinsufficient HSCs. Our
      data link Rps14 haploinsufficiency in del(5q) MDS to activation of the innate
      immune system and induction of S100A8-S100A9 expression, leading to a
      p53-dependent erythroid differentiation defect.

TI  - CYP3A5 mediates basal and acquired therapy resistance in different subtypes of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 278-87
LID - 10.1038/nm.4038 [doi]
AB  - Although subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have been described,
      this malignancy is clinically still treated as a single disease. Here we present 
      patient-derived models representing the full spectrum of previously identified
      quasi-mesenchymal (QM-PDA), classical and exocrine-like PDAC subtypes, and
      identify two markers--HNF1A and KRT81--that enable stratification of tumors into 
      different subtypes by using immunohistochemistry. Individuals with tumors of
      these subtypes showed substantial differences in overall survival, and their
      tumors differed in drug sensitivity, with the exocrine-like subtype being
      resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and paclitaxel. Cytochrome P450 3A5
      (CYP3A5) metabolizes these compounds in tumors of the exocrine-like subtype, and 
      pharmacological or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CYP3A5 inhibition
      sensitizes tumor cells to these drugs. Whereas hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha
      (HNF4A) controls basal expression of CYP3A5, drug-induced CYP3A5 upregulation is 
      mediated by the nuclear receptor NR1I2. CYP3A5 also contributes to acquired drug 
      resistance in QM-PDA and classical PDAC, and it is highly expressed in several
      additional malignancies. These findings designate CYP3A5 as a predictor of
      therapy response and as a tumor cell-autonomous detoxification mechanism that
      must be overcome to prevent drug resistance.

      KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 270-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.4041 [doi]
AB  - Patients with advanced Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant
      lung adenocarcinoma are currently treated with standard chemotherapy because of a
      lack of efficacious targeted therapies. We reasoned that the identification of
      mediators of Kras signaling in early mouse lung hyperplasias might bypass the
      difficulties that are imposed by intratumor heterogeneity in advanced tumors, and
      that it might unveil relevant therapeutic targets. Transcriptional profiling of
      Kras(G12V)-driven mouse hyperplasias revealed intertumor diversity with a subset 
      that exhibited an aggressive transcriptional profile analogous to that of
      advanced human adenocarcinomas. The top-scoring gene in this profile encodes the 
      tyrosine kinase receptor DDR1. The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DDR1
      blocked tumor initiation and tumor progression, respectively. The concomitant
      inhibition of both DDR1 and Notch signaling induced the regression of
      KRAS;TP53-mutant patient-derived lung xenografts (PDX) with a therapeutic
      efficacy that was at least comparable to that of standard chemotherapy. Our data 
      indicate that the combined inhibition of DDR1 and Notch signaling could be an
      effective targeted therapy for patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

PG  - 298-305
LID - 10.1038/nm.4045 [doi]
AB  - An increasingly recognized resistance mechanism to androgen receptor
      (AR)-directed therapy in prostate cancer involves epithelial plasticity, in which
      tumor cells demonstrate low to absent AR expression and often have neuroendocrine
      features. The etiology and molecular basis for this 'alternative'
      treatment-resistant cell state remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing
      whole-exome sequencing data of metastatic biopsies from patients, we observed
      substantial genomic overlap between castration-resistant tumors that were
      histologically characterized as prostate adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) and
      neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE); analysis of biopsy samples from the
      same individuals over time points to a model most consistent with divergent
      clonal evolution. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed marked epigenetic
      differences between CRPC-NE tumors and CRPC-Adeno, and also designated samples of
      CRPC-Adeno with clinical features of AR independence as CRPC-NE, suggesting that 
      epigenetic modifiers may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of this 
      treatment-resistant state. This study supports the emergence of an alternative,
      'AR-indifferent' cell state through divergent clonal evolution as a mechanism of

TI  - Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal
      microbial transfer.
PG  - 250-3
LID - 10.1038/nm.4039 [doi]
AB  - Exposure of newborns to the maternal vaginal microbiota is interrupted with
      cesarean birthing. Babies delivered by cesarean section (C-section) acquire a
      microbiota that differs from that of vaginally delivered infants, and C-section
      delivery has been associated with increased risk for immune and metabolic
      disorders. Here we conducted a pilot study in which infants delivered by
      C-section were exposed to maternal vaginal fluids at birth. Similarly to
      vaginally delivered babies, the gut, oral and skin bacterial communities of these
      newborns during the first 30 d of life was enriched in vaginal bacteria--which
      were underrepresented in unexposed C-section-delivered infants--and the
      microbiome similarity to those of vaginally delivered infants was greater in oral
      and skin samples than in anal samples. Although the long-term health consequences
      of restoring the microbiota of C-section-delivered infants remain unclear, our
      results demonstrate that vaginal microbes can be partially restored at birth in
      C-section-delivered babies.

TI  - Tumor cells can follow distinct evolutionary paths to become resistant to
      epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition.
PG  - 262-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.4040 [doi]
AB  - Although mechanisms of acquired resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancers to EGFR inhibitors have been
      identified, little is known about how resistant clones evolve during drug
      therapy. Here we observe that acquired resistance caused by the EGFR(T790M)
      gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing
      EGFR(T790M)-positive clones or via genetic evolution of initially
      EGFR(T790M)-negative drug-tolerant cells. The path to resistance impacts the
      biology of the resistant clone, as those that evolved from drug-tolerant cells
      had a diminished apoptotic response to third-generation EGFR inhibitors that
      target EGFR(T790M); treatment with navitoclax, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic
      factors BCL-xL and BCL-2 restored sensitivity. We corroborated these findings
      using cultures derived directly from EGFR inhibitor-resistant patient tumors.
      These findings provide evidence that clinically relevant drug-resistant cancer
      cells can both pre-exist and evolve from drug-tolerant cells, and they point to
      therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome resistance in the clinic.

TI  - Human 'brite/beige' adipocytes develop from capillary networks, and their
      implantation improves metabolic homeostasis in mice.
PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.4031 [doi]
AB  - Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue, where it
      generates heat by uncoupling electron transport from ATP production. UCP1 is also
      found outside classical brown adipose tissue depots, in adipocytes that are
      termed 'brite' (brown-in-white) or 'beige'. In humans, the presence of brite or
      beige (brite/beige) adipocytes is correlated with a lean, metabolically healthy
      phenotype, but whether a causal relationship exists is not clear. Here we report 
      that human brite/beige adipocyte progenitors proliferate in response to
      pro-angiogenic factors, in association with expanding capillary networks.
      Adipocytes formed from these progenitors transform in response to adenylate
      cyclase activation from being UCP1 negative to being UCP1 positive, which is a
      defining feature of the beige/brite phenotype, while displaying uncoupled
      respiration. When implanted into normal chow-fed, or into high-fat diet
      (HFD)-fed, glucose-intolerant NOD-scid IL2rg(null) (NSG) mice, brite/beige
      adipocytes activated in vitro enhance systemic glucose tolerance. These
      adipocytes express neuroendocrine and secreted factors, including the pro-protein
      convertase PCSK1, which is strongly associated with human obesity. Pro-angiogenic
      conditions therefore drive the proliferation of human beige/brite adipocyte
      progenitors, and activated beige/brite adipocytes can affect systemic glucose
      homeostasis, potentially through a neuroendocrine mechanism.

TI  - Rescue of GABAB and GIRK function in the lateral habenula by protein phosphatase 
      2A inhibition ameliorates depression-like phenotypes in mice.
PG  - 254-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.4037 [doi]
AB  - The lateral habenula (LHb) encodes aversive signals, and its aberrant activity
      contributes to depression-like symptoms. However, a limited understanding of the 
      cellular mechanisms underlying LHb hyperactivity has precluded the development of
      pharmacological strategies to ameliorate depression-like phenotypes. Here we
      report that an aversive experience in mice, such as foot-shock exposure (FsE),
      induces LHb neuronal hyperactivity and depression-like symptoms. This occurs
      along with increased protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, a known regulator of
      GABAB receptor (GABABR) and G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) 
      channel surface expression. Accordingly, FsE triggers GABAB1 and GIRK2
      internalization, leading to rapid and persistent weakening of GABAB-activated
      GIRK-mediated (GABAB-GIRK) currents. Pharmacological inhibition of PP2A restores 
      both GABAB-GIRK function and neuronal excitability. As a consequence, PP2A
      inhibition ameliorates depression-like symptoms after FsE and in a
      learned-helplessness model of depression. Thus, GABAB-GIRK plasticity in the LHb 
      represents a cellular substrate for aversive experience. Furthermore, its
      reversal by PP2A inhibition may provide a novel therapeutic approach to alleviate
      symptoms of depression in disorders that are characterized by LHb hyperactivity.

TI  - Long-term glycemic control using polymer-encapsulated human stem cell-derived
      beta cells in immune-competent mice.
PG  - 306-11
LID - 10.1038/nm.4030 [doi]
AB  - The transplantation of glucose-responsive, insulin-producing cells offers the
      potential for restoring glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Pancreas
      transplantation and the infusion of cadaveric islets are currently implemented
      clinically, but these approaches are limited by the adverse effects of
      immunosuppressive therapy over the lifetime of the recipient and the limited
      supply of donor tissue. The latter concern may be addressed by recently described
      glucose-responsive mature beta cells that are derived from human embryonic stem
      cells (referred to as SC-beta cells), which may represent an unlimited source of 
      human cells for pancreas replacement therapy. Strategies to address the
      immunosuppression concerns include immunoisolation of insulin-producing cells
      with porous biomaterials that function as an immune barrier. However, clinical
      implementation has been challenging because of host immune responses to the
      implant materials. Here we report the first long-term glycemic correction of a
      diabetic, immunocompetent animal model using human SC-beta cells. SC-beta cells
      were encapsulated with alginate derivatives capable of mitigating foreign-body
      responses in vivo and implanted into the intraperitoneal space of C57BL/6J mice
      treated with streptozotocin, which is an animal model for chemically induced type
      1 diabetes. These implants induced glycemic correction without any
      immunosuppression until their removal at 174 d after implantation. Human
      C-peptide concentrations and in vivo glucose responsiveness demonstrated
      therapeutically relevant glycemic control. Implants retrieved after 174 d
      contained viable insulin-producing cells.

TI  - Targeting EZH2 in cancer.
PG  - 128-34
LID - 10.1038/nm.4036 [doi]
AB  - Recent genomic studies have resulted in an emerging understanding of the role of 
      chromatin regulators in the development of cancer. EZH2, a histone methyl
      transferase subunit of a Polycomb repressor complex, is recurrently mutated in
      several forms of cancer and is highly expressed in numerous others. Notably, both
      gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations occur in cancers but are
      associated with distinct cancer types. Here we review the spectrum of
      EZH2-associated mutations, discuss the mechanisms underlying EZH2 function, and
      synthesize a unifying perspective that the promotion of cancer arises from
      disruption of the role of EZH2 as a master regulator of transcription. We further
      discuss EZH2 inhibitors that are now showing early signs of promise in clinical
      trials and also additional strategies to combat roles of EZH2 in cancer.

TI  - Spatiotemporal neuromodulation therapies engaging muscle synergies improve motor 
      control after spinal cord injury.
PG  - 138-45
LID - 10.1038/nm.4025 [doi]
AB  - Electrical neuromodulation of lumbar segments improves motor control after spinal
      cord injury in animal models and humans. However, the physiological principles
      underlying the effect of this intervention remain poorly understood, which has
      limited the therapeutic approach to continuous stimulation applied to restricted 
      spinal cord locations. Here we developed stimulation protocols that reproduce the
      natural dynamics of motoneuron activation during locomotion. For this, we
      computed the spatiotemporal activation pattern of muscle synergies during
      locomotion in healthy rats. Computer simulations identified optimal electrode
      locations to target each synergy through the recruitment of proprioceptive
      feedback circuits. This framework steered the design of spatially selective
      spinal implants and real-time control software that modulate extensor and flexor 
      synergies with precise temporal resolution. Spatiotemporal neuromodulation
      therapies improved gait quality, weight-bearing capacity, endurance and skilled
      locomotion in several rodent models of spinal cord injury. These new concepts are
      directly translatable to strategies to improve motor control in humans.

TI  - Targeting of the pulmonary capillary vascular niche promotes lung alveolar repair
      and ameliorates fibrosis.
PG  - 154-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.4035 [doi]
AB  - Although the lung can undergo self-repair after injury, fibrosis in chronically
      injured or diseased lungs can occur at the expense of regeneration. Here we study
      how a hematopoietic-vascular niche regulates alveolar repair and lung fibrosis.
      Using intratracheal injection of bleomycin or hydrochloric acid in mice, we show 
      that repetitive lung injury activates pulmonary capillary endothelial cells
      (PCECs) and perivascular macrophages, impeding alveolar repair and promoting
      fibrosis. Whereas the chemokine receptor CXCR7, expressed on PCECs, acts to
      prevent epithelial damage and ameliorate fibrosis after a single round of
      treatment with bleomycin or hydrochloric acid, repeated injury leads to
      suppression of CXCR7 expression and recruitment of vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1)-expressing perivascular macrophages. This recruitment 
      stimulates Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent persistent upregulation of the Notch ligand
      Jagged1 (encoded by Jag1) in PCECs, which in turn stimulates exuberant Notch
      signaling in perivascular fibroblasts and enhances fibrosis. Administration of a 
      CXCR7 agonist or PCEC-targeted Jag1 shRNA after lung injury promotes alveolar
      repair and reduces fibrosis. Thus, targeting of a maladapted
      hematopoietic-vascular niche, in which macrophages, PCECs and perivascular
      fibroblasts interact, may help to develop therapy to spur lung regeneration and
      alleviate fibrosis.

AB  - Systemic immune suppression may curtail the ability to mount the protective,
      cell-mediated immune responses that are needed for brain repair. By using mouse
      models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we show that immune checkpoint blockade
      directed against the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway evokes an interferon
      (IFN)-gamma-dependent systemic immune response, which is followed by the
      recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages to the brain. When induced in mice
      with established pathology, this immunological response leads to clearance of
      cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognitive performance.
      Repeated treatment sessions were required to maintain a long-lasting beneficial
      effect on disease pathology. These findings suggest that immune checkpoints may
      be targeted therapeutically in AD.

TI  - Blocking c-Met-mediated PARP1 phosphorylation enhances anti-tumor effects of PARP
      inhibitors.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1038/nm.4032 [doi]
AB  - Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising
      therapeutics for many diseases, including cancer, in clinical trials. One PARP
      inhibitor, olaparib (Lynparza, AstraZeneca), was recently approved by the FDA to 
      treat ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA genes. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have essential
      roles in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, and a deficiency of BRCA proteins
      sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibition. Here we show that the receptor
      tyrosine kinase c-Met associates with and phosphorylates PARP1 at Tyr907 (PARP1
      pTyr907 or pY907). PARP1 pY907 increases PARP1 enzymatic activity and reduces
      binding to a PARP inhibitor, thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to PARP
      inhibition. The combination of c-Met and PARP1 inhibitors synergized to suppress 
      the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and xenograft tumor models, and we
      observed similar synergistic effects in a lung cancer xenograft tumor model.
      These results suggest that the abundance of PARP1 pY907 may predict tumor
      resistance to PARP inhibitors, and that treatment with a combination of c-Met and
      PARP inhibitors may benefit patients whose tumors show high c-Met expression and 
      who do not respond to PARP inhibition alone.

PG  - 146-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.4027 [doi]
AB  - Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in autoimmunity, but how
      they are generated and their roles in sterile inflammation remain unclear.
      Ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (RNP ICs), inducers of NETosis, require
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) for maximal NET stimulation. After
      RNP IC stimulation of neutrophils, mitochondria become hypopolarized and
      translocate to the cell surface. Extracellular release of oxidized mitochondrial 
      DNA is proinflammatory in vitro, and when this DNA is injected into mice, it
      stimulates type I interferon (IFN) signaling through a pathway dependent on the
      DNA sensor STING. Mitochondrial ROS are also necessary for spontaneous NETosis of
      low-density granulocytes from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus. This
      was also observed in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease, who lack
      NADPH oxidase activity but still develop autoimmunity and type I IFN signatures. 
      Mitochondrial ROS inhibition in vivo reduces disease severity and type I IFN
      responses in a mouse model of lupus. Together, these findings highlight a role
      for mitochondria in the generation not only of NETs but also of pro-inflammatory 
      oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Mitochondrial iron chelation ameliorates cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis and
      emphysema in mice.
PG  - 163-74
LID - 10.1038/nm.4021 [doi]
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to both cigarette smoking 
      and genetic determinants. We have previously identified iron-responsive
      element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and
      have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. 
      Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette
      smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation
      followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression
      and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator 
      of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron
      loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial
      dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had 
      higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance
      (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in
      the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected
      from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a
      mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from
      CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced
      impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung
      injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and
      potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD.

TI  - Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase inhibition prevents multiple organ failure in rodent
      models of acute pancreatitis.
PG  - 202-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.4020 [doi]
AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common and devastating inflammatory condition of the
      pancreas that is considered to be a paradigm of sterile inflammation leading to
      systemic multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. Acute mortality
      from AP-MODS exceeds 20% (ref. 3), and the lifespans of those who survive the
      initial episode are typically shorter than those of the general population. There
      are no specific therapies available to protect individuals from AP-MODS. Here we 
      show that kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO), a key enzyme of tryptophan
      metabolism, is central to the pathogenesis of AP-MODS. We created a mouse strain 
      that is deficient for Kmo (encoding KMO) and that has a robust biochemical
      phenotype that protects against extrapancreatic tissue injury to the lung, kidney
      and liver in experimental AP-MODS. A medicinal chemistry strategy based on
      modifications of the kynurenine substrate led to the discovery of the
      oxazolidinone GSK180 as a potent and specific inhibitor of KMO. The binding mode 
      of the inhibitor in the active site was confirmed by X-ray co-crystallography at 
      3.2 A resolution. Treatment with GSK180 resulted in rapid changes in the levels
      of kynurenine pathway metabolites in vivo, and it afforded therapeutic protection
      against MODS in a rat model of AP. Our findings establish KMO inhibition as a
      novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AP-MODS, and they open up a new
      area for drug discovery in critical illness.

TI  - Killer lymphocytes use granulysin, perforin and granzymes to kill intracellular
      parasites.
PG  - 210-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.4023 [doi]
AB  - Protozoan infections are a serious global health problem. Natural killer (NK)
      cells and cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) eliminate pathogen-infected cells by
      releasing cytolytic granule contents--granzyme (Gzm) proteases and the
      pore-forming perforin (PFN)--into the infected cell. However, these cytotoxic
      molecules do not kill intracellular parasites. CD8(+) CTLs protect against
      parasite infections in mice primarily by secreting interferon (IFN)-gamma.
      However, human, but not rodent, cytotoxic granules contain the antimicrobial
      peptide granulysin (GNLY), which selectively destroys cholesterol-poor microbial 
      membranes, and GNLY, PFN and Gzms rapidly kill intracellular bacteria. Here we
      show that GNLY delivers Gzms into three protozoan parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi,
      Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania major), in which the Gzms generate superoxide
      and inactivate oxidative defense enzymes to kill the parasite. PFN delivers GNLY 
      and Gzms into infected cells, and GNLY then delivers Gzms to the intracellular
      parasites. Killer cell-mediated parasite death, which we term 'microbe-programmed
      cell death' or 'microptosis', is caspase independent but resembles mammalian
      apoptosis, causing mitochondrial swelling, transmembrane potential dissipation,
      membrane blebbing, phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA damage and chromatin
      condensation. GNLY-transgenic mice are protected against infection by T. cruzi
      and T. gondii, and survive infections that are lethal to wild-type mice. Thus,
      GNLY-, PFN- and Gzm-mediated elimination of intracellular protozoan parasites is 
      an unappreciated immune defense mechanism.

TI  - Apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage protein enhances intraluminal debris clearance 
      and ameliorates acute kidney injury in mice.
PG  - 183-93
LID - 10.1038/nm.4012 [doi]
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with prolonged hospitalization and high
      mortality, and it predisposes individuals to chronic kidney disease. To date, no 
      effective AKI treatments have been established. Here we show that the apoptosis
      inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein on intraluminal debris interacts with
      kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 and promotes recovery from AKI. During AKI, the
      concentration of AIM increases in the urine, and AIM accumulates on necrotic cell
      debris within the kidney proximal tubules. The AIM present in this cellular
      debris binds to KIM-1, which is expressed on injured tubular epithelial cells,
      and enhances the phagocytic removal of the debris by the epithelial cells, thus
      contributing to kidney tissue repair. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion
      (IR)-induced AKI, AIM-deficient mice exhibited abrogated debris clearance and
      persistent renal inflammation, resulting in higher mortality than wild-type (WT) 
      mice due to progressive renal dysfunction. Treatment of mice with IR-induced AKI 
      using recombinant AIM resulted in the removal of the debris, thereby ameliorating
      renal pathology. We observed this effect in both AIM-deficient and WT mice, but
      not in KIM-1-deficient mice. Our findings provide a basis for the development of 
      potentially novel therapies for AKI.

TI  - CaMKII is a RIP3 substrate mediating ischemia- and oxidative stress-induced

PG  - 175-82
LID - 10.1038/nm.4017 [doi]
AB  - Regulated necrosis (necroptosis) and apoptosis are crucially involved in severe
      cardiac pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction,
      ischemia-reperfusion injury and heart failure. Whereas apoptotic signaling is
      well defined, the mechanisms that underlie cardiomyocyte necroptosis remain
      elusive. Here we show that receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) triggers
      myocardial necroptosis, in addition to apoptosis and inflammation, through
      activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) rather than
      through the well-established RIP3 partners RIP1 and MLKL. In mice, RIP3
      deficiency or CaMKII inhibition ameliorates myocardial necroptosis and heart
      failure induced by ischemia-reperfusion or by doxorubicin treatment. RIP3-induced
      activation of CaMKII, via phosphorylation or oxidation or both, triggers opening 
      of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and myocardial necroptosis.
      These findings identify CaMKII as a new RIP3 substrate and delineate a
      RIP3-CaMKII-mPTP myocardial necroptosis pathway, a promising target for the
      treatment of ischemia- and oxidative stress-induced myocardial damage and heart
      failure.

PG  - 26-36

AB  - Adoptive transfer of receptor-engineered T cells has produced impressive results 
      in treating patients with B cell leukemias and lymphomas. This success has
      captured public imagination and driven academic and industrial researchers to
      develop similar 'off-the-shelf' receptors targeting shared antigens on epithelial
      cancers, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. However, the successful
      treatment of large numbers of people with solid cancers using this strategy is
      unlikely to be straightforward. Receptor-engineered T cells have the potential to
      cause lethal toxicity from on-target recognition of normal tissues, and there is 
      a paucity of truly tumor-specific antigens shared across tumor types. Here we
      offer our perspective on how expanding the use of genetically redirected T cells 
      to treat the majority of patients with solid cancers will require major
      technical, manufacturing and regulatory innovations centered around the
      development of autologous gene therapies targeting private somatic mutations.

PG  - 46-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.4011 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) degrades misfolded proteins including those
      implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the effects of tau
      accumulation on proteasome function in a mouse model of tauopathy and in a cross 
      to a UPS reporter mouse (line Ub-G76V-GFP). Accumulation of insoluble tau was
      associated with a decrease in the peptidase activity of brain 26S proteasomes,
      higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins and undegraded Ub-G76V-GFP. 26S
      proteasomes from mice with tauopathy were physically associated with tau and were
      less active in hydrolyzing ubiquitinated proteins, small peptides and ATP. 26S
      proteasomes from normal mice incubated with recombinant oligomers or fibrils also
      showed lower hydrolyzing capacity in the same assays, implicating tau as a
      proteotoxin. Administration of an agent that activates cAMP-protein kinase A
      (PKA) signaling led to attenuation of proteasome dysfunction, probably through
      proteasome subunit phosphorylation. In vivo, this led to lower levels of
      aggregated tau and improvements in cognitive performance.

TI  - Loss of the proteostasis factor AIRAPL causes myeloid transformation by
      deregulating IGF-1 signaling.
PG  - 91-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.4013 [doi]
AB  - AIRAPL (arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein-like) is an evolutionarily
      conserved regulator of cellular proteostasis linked to longevity in nematodes,
      but its biological function in mammals is unknown. We show herein that
      AIRAPL-deficient mice develop a fully-penetrant myeloproliferative neoplastic
      process. Proteomic analysis of AIRAPL-deficient mice revealed that this protein
      exerts its antineoplastic function through the regulation of the
      insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway. We demonstrate
      that AIRAPL interacts with newly synthesized insulin-related growth factor-1
      receptor (IGF1R) polypeptides, promoting their ubiquitination and
      proteasome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, genetic and pharmacological IGF1R
      inhibitory strategies prevent the hematological disease found in AIRAPL-deficient
      mice as well as that in mice carrying the Jak2(V617F) mutation, thereby
      demonstrating the causal involvement of this pathway in the pathogenesis of
      myeloproliferative neoplasms. Consistent with its proposed role as a tumor
      suppressor of myeloid transformation, AIRAPL expression is widely abrogated in
      human myeloproliferative disorders. Collectively, these findings support the
      oncogenic relevance of proteostasis deregulation in hematopoietic cells, and they
      unveil novel therapeutic targets for these frequent hematological neoplasias.

TI  - In vivo imaging of inflammasome activation reveals a subcapsular macrophage burst
      response that mobilizes innate and adaptive immunity.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1038/nm.4016 [doi]
AB  - The inflammasome is activated in response to a variety of pathogens and has an
      important role in shaping adaptive immunity, yet the spatiotemporal orchestration
      of inflammasome activation in vivo and the mechanisms by which it promotes an
      effective immune response are not fully understood. Using an in vivo reporter to 
      visualize inflammasome assembly, we establish the distribution, kinetics and
      propagation of the inflammasome response to a local viral infection. We show that
      modified vaccinia Ankara virus induces inflammasome activation in subcapsular
      sinus (SCS) macrophages, which is immediately followed by cell death and release 
      of extracellular ASC specks. This transient inflammasome signaling in the lymph
      node generates a robust influx of inflammatory cells and mobilizes T cells from
      the circulation to increase the magnitude of T cell responses. We propose that
      after infection, SCS macrophages deliver a burst response of inflammasome
      activity and cell death that translates into the broadening of T cell responses, 
      identifying an important aspect of inflammasome-driven vaccination strategies.

TI  - Clearance of senescent cells by ABT263 rejuvenates aged hematopoietic stem cells 
      in mice.
PG  - 78-83
LID - 10.1038/nm.4010 [doi]
AB  - Senescent cells (SCs) accumulate with age and after genotoxic stress, such as
      total-body irradiation (TBI). Clearance of SCs in a progeroid mouse model using a
      transgenic approach delays several age-associated disorders, suggesting that SCs 
      play a causative role in certain age-related pathologies. Thus, a 'senolytic'
      pharmacological agent that can selectively kill SCs holds promise for
      rejuvenating tissue stem cells and extending health span. To test this idea, we
      screened a collection of compounds and identified ABT263 (a specific inhibitor of
      the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-xL) as a potent senolytic drug. We show
      that ABT263 selectively kills SCs in culture in a cell type- and
      species-independent manner by inducing apoptosis. Oral administration of ABT263
      to either sublethally irradiated or normally aged mice effectively depleted SCs, 
      including senescent bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and senescent
      muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Notably, this depletion mitigated TBI-induced
      premature aging of the hematopoietic system and rejuvenated the aged HSCs and
      MuSCs in normally aged mice. Our results demonstrate that selective clearance of 
      SCs by a pharmacological agent is beneficial in part through its rejuvenation of 
      aged tissue stem cells. Thus, senolytic drugs may represent a new class of
      radiation mitigators and anti-aging agents.

TI  - Systematic discovery of complex insertions and deletions in human cancers.
PG  - 97-104
LID - 10.1038/nm.4002 [doi]
AB  - Complex insertions and deletions (indels) are formed by simultaneously deleting
      and inserting DNA fragments of different sizes at a common genomic location. Here
      we present a systematic analysis of somatic complex indels in the coding
      sequences of samples from over 8,000 cancer cases using Pindel-C. We discovered
      285 complex indels in cancer-associated genes (such as PIK3R1, TP53, ARID1A,
      GATA3 and KMT2D) in approximately 3.5% of cases analyzed; nearly all instances of
      complex indels were overlooked (81.1%) or misannotated (17.6%) in previous
      reports of 2,199 samples. In-frame complex indels are enriched in PIK3R1 and
      EGFR, whereas frameshifts are prevalent in VHL, GATA3, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN and
      ATRX. Furthermore, complex indels display strong tissue specificity (such as VHL 
      in kidney cancer samples and GATA3 in breast cancer samples). Finally, structural
      analyses support findings of previously missed, but potentially druggable,
      mutations in the EGFR, MET and KIT oncogenes. This study indicates the critical
      importance of improving complex indel discovery and interpretation in medical
      research.

TI  - Early-life compartmentalization of human T cell differentiation and regulatory
      function in mucosal and lymphoid tissues.
PG  - 72-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.4008 [doi]
AB  - It is unclear how the immune response in early life becomes appropriately
      stimulated to provide protection while also avoiding excessive activation as a
      result of diverse new antigens. T cells are integral to adaptive immunity; mouse 
      studies indicate that tissue localization of T cell subsets is important for both
      protective immunity and immunoregulation. In humans, however, the early
      development and function of T cells in tissues remain unexplored. We present here
      an analysis of lymphoid and mucosal tissue T cells derived from pediatric organ
      donors in the first two years of life, as compared to adult organ donors,
      revealing early compartmentalization of T cell differentiation and regulation.
      Whereas adult tissues contain a predominance of memory T cells, in pediatric
      blood and tissues the main subset consists of naive recent thymic emigrants, with
      effector memory T cells (T(EM)) found only in the lungs and small intestine.
      Additionally, regulatory T (T(reg)) cells comprise a high proportion (30-40%) of 
      CD4(+) T cells in pediatric tissues but are present at much lower frequencies
      (1-10%) in adult tissues. Pediatric tissue T(reg) cells suppress endogenous T
      cell activation, and early T cell functionality is confined to the mucosal sites 
      that have the lowest T(reg):T(EM) cell ratios, which suggests control in situ of 
      immune responses in early life.

TI  - PPAR-delta is repressed in Huntington's disease, is required for normal neuronal 
      function and can be targeted therapeutically.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1038/nm.4003 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
      CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which encodes a 
      polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. We found that peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-delta) interacts with HTT and that
      mutant HTT represses PPAR-delta-mediated transactivation. Increased PPAR-delta
      transactivation ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and improved cell survival 
      of neurons from mouse models of HD. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-delta in
      the central nervous system of mice was sufficient to induce motor dysfunction,
      neurodegeneration, mitochondrial abnormalities and transcriptional alterations
      that recapitulated HD-like phenotypes. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-delta
      specifically in the striatum of medium spiny neurons in mice yielded HD-like
      motor phenotypes, accompanied by striatal neuron loss. In mouse models of HD,
      pharmacologic activation of PPAR-delta using the agonist KD3010 improved motor
      function, reduced neurodegeneration and increased survival. PPAR-delta activation
      also reduced HTT-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in medium spiny-like neurons 
      generated from stem cells derived from individuals with HD, indicating that
      PPAR-delta activation may be beneficial in HD and related disorders.

TI  - TCF1 links GIPR signaling to the control of beta cell function and survival.
PG  - 84-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.3997 [doi]
AB  - The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and the glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor transduce nutrient-stimulated signals
      to control beta cell function. Although the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a
      validated drug target for diabetes, the importance of the GIP receptor (GIPR) for
      the function of beta cells remains uncertain. We demonstrate that mice with
      selective ablation of GIPR in beta cells (MIP-Cre:Gipr(Flox/Flox);
      Gipr(-/-betaCell)) exhibit lower levels of meal-stimulated insulin secretion,
      decreased expansion of adipose tissue mass and preservation of insulin
      sensitivity when compared to MIP-Cre controls. Beta cells from Gipr(-/-betaCell) 
      mice display greater sensitivity to apoptosis and markedly lower islet expression
      of T cell-specific transcription factor-1 (TCF1, encoded by Tcf7), a protein not 
      previously characterized in beta cells. GIP, but not GLP-1, promotes beta cell
      Tcf7 expression via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-independent and
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway. Tcf7 (in mice) or 
      TCF7 (in humans) levels are lower in islets taken from diabetic mice and in
      humans with type 2 diabetes; knockdown of TCF7 in human and mouse islets impairs 
      the cytoprotective responsiveness to GIP and enhances the magnitude of apoptotic 
      injury, whereas restoring TCF1 levels in beta cells from Gipr(-/-betaCell) mice
      lowers the number of apoptotic cells compared to that seen in MIP-Cre controls.
      Tcf7(-/-) mice show impaired insulin secretion, deterioration of glucose
      tolerance with either aging and/or high-fat feeding and increased sensitivity to 
      beta cell injury relative to wild-type (WT) controls. Hence the GIPR-TCF1 axis
      represents a potential therapeutic target for preserving both the function and
      survival of vulnerable, diabetic beta cells.

AB  - Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) drives neoplastic progression and therapeutic
      resistance. We used the bioinformatics tools 'expanding ploidy and allele
      frequency on nested subpopulations' (EXPANDS) and PyClone to detect clones that
      are present at a >/=10% frequency in 1,165 exome sequences from tumors in The
      Cancer Genome Atlas. 86% of tumors across 12 cancer types had at least two
      clones. ITH in the morphology of nuclei was associated with genetic ITH
      (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rho = 0.24-0.41; P < 0.001). Mutation of a
      driver gene that typically appears in smaller clones was a survival risk factor
      (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-2.69). The risk of 
      mortality also increased when >2 clones coexisted in the same tumor sample (HR = 
      1.49, 95% CI: 1.20-1.87). In two independent data sets, copy-number alterations
      affecting either <25% or >75% of a tumor's genome predicted reduced risk (HR =
      0.15, 95% CI: 0.08-0.29). Mortality risk also declined when >4 clones coexisted
      in the sample, suggesting a trade-off between the costs and benefits of genomic
      instability. ITH and genomic instability thus have the potential to be useful
      measures that can universally be applied to all cancers.

TI  - Parkinson's disease-associated mutant VPS35 causes mitochondrial dysfunction by
      recycling DLP1 complexes.
PG  - 54-63
LID - 10.1038/nm.3983 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical step during the pathogenesis of
      Parkinson's disease (PD), and increasing evidence suggests abnormal mitochondrial
      dynamics and quality control as important underlying mechanisms. The VPS35 gene, 
      which encodes a key component of the membrane protein-recycling retromer complex,
      is the third autosomal-dominant gene associated with PD. However, how VPS35
      mutations lead to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that
      PD-associated VPS35 mutations caused mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death
      in cultured neurons in vitro, in mouse substantia nigra neurons in vivo and in
      human fibroblasts from an individual with PD who has the VPS35(D620N) mutation.
      VPS35-induced mitochondrial deficits and neuronal dysfunction could be prevented 
      by inhibition of mitochondrial fission. VPS35 mutants showed increased
      interaction with dynamin-like protein (DLP) 1, which enhanced turnover of the
      mitochondrial DLP1 complexes via the mitochondria-derived vesicle-dependent
      trafficking of the complexes to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, oxidative
      stress increased the VPS35-DLP1 interaction, which we also found to be increased 
      in the brains of sporadic PD cases. These results revealed a novel cellular
      mechanism for the involvement of VPS35 in mitochondrial fission, dysregulation of
      which is probably involved in the pathogenesis of familial, and possibly
      sporadic, PD.

TI  - Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy.
PG  - 1424-35
LID - 10.1038/nm.4000 [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence, a process that imposes permanent proliferative arrest on
      cells in response to various stressors, has emerged as a potentially important
      contributor to aging and age-related disease, and it is an attractive target for 
      therapeutic exploitation. A wealth of information about senescence in cultured
      cells has been acquired over the past half century; however, senescence in living
      organisms is poorly understood, largely because of technical limitations relating
      to the identification and characterization of senescent cells in tissues and
      organs. Furthermore, newly recognized beneficial signaling functions of
      senescence suggest that indiscriminately targeting senescent cells or modulating 
      their secretome for anti-aging therapy may have negative consequences. Here we
      discuss current progress and challenges in understanding the stressors that
      induce senescence in vivo, the cell types that are prone to senesce, and the
      autocrine and paracrine properties of senescent cells in the contexts of aging
      and age-related diseases as well as disease therapy.

AB  - Here we review the environmental and genetic manipulations that link cellular and
      organismal metabolism to aging. In particular, we explore how nutrients are
      sensed and how various intracellular energy nodes seem to coordinate distinct
      metabolic alterations linked to extended longevity. In addition, the role of
      mitochondria as both a metabolic and signaling organelle is discussed. Finally,
      we review a host of new targeted pharmacological approaches that attempt to
      exploit the connection between aging and metabolism to treat a wide range of
      age-related diseases. Together, these insights are beginning to reveal answers to
      century-old mysteries and are providing a future road map for the rational
      extension of lifespan.

AB  - Accumulation of intracellular damage is an almost universal hallmark of aging. An
      improved understanding of the systems that contribute to cellular protein quality
      control has shed light on the reasons for the increased vulnerability of the
      proteome to stress in aging cells. Maintenance of protein homeostasis, or
      proteostasis, is attained through precisely coordinated systems that rapidly
      correct unwanted proteomic changes. Here we focus on recent developments that
      highlight the multidimensional nature of the proteostasis networks, which allow
      for coordinated protein homeostasis intracellularly, in between cells and even
      across organs, as well as on how they affect common age-associated diseases when 
      they malfunction in aging.

TI  - Can aging be 'drugged'?
PG  - 1400-5
LID - 10.1038/nm.4005 [doi]
AB  - The engines that drive the complex process of aging are being identified by
      model-organism research, thereby providing potential targets and rationale for
      drug studies. Several studies of small molecules have already been completed in
      animal models with the hope of finding an elixir for aging, with a few compounds 
      showing early promise. What lessons can we learn from drugs currently being
      tested, and which pitfalls can we avoid in our search for a therapeutic for
      aging? Finally, we must also ask whether an elixir for aging would be applicable 
      to everyone, or whether we age differently, thus potentially shortening lifespan 
      in some individuals.

TI  - Translational strategies in aging and age-related disease.
PG  - 1395-9

AB  - Aging is a risk factor for several of the world's most prevalent diseases,
      including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and
      metabolic disease. Although our understanding of the molecular pathways that
      contribute to the aging process and age-related disease is progressing through
      the use of model organisms, how to apply this knowledge in the clinic is less
      clear. In September, Nature Medicine, in collaboration with the Volkswagen
      Foundation, hosted a conference at the beautiful Herrenhausen Palace in Hannover,
      Germany with the goal of broadening our understanding of the aging process and
      its meaning as a 'risk factor' in disease. Here, several of the speakers at that 
      conference answer questions posed by Nature Medicine.

TI  - Treatment during a vulnerable developmental period rescues a genetic epilepsy.
PG  - 1436-44
LID - 10.1038/nm.3987 [doi]
AB  - The nervous system is vulnerable to perturbations during specific developmental
      periods. Insults during such susceptible time windows can have long-term
      consequences, including the development of neurological diseases such as
      epilepsy. Here we report that a pharmacological intervention timed during a
      vulnerable neonatal period of cortical development prevents pathology in a
      genetic epilepsy model. By using mice with dysfunctional Kv7 voltage-gated K(+)
      channels, which are mutated in human neonatal epilepsy syndromes, we demonstrate 
      the safety and efficacy of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1
      antagonist bumetanide, which was administered during the first two postnatal
      weeks. In Kv7 current-deficient mice, which normally display epilepsy,
      hyperactivity and stereotypies as adults, transient bumetanide treatment
      normalized neonatal in vivo cortical network and hippocampal neuronal activity,
      prevented structural damage in the hippocampus and restored wild-type adult
      behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, bumetanide treatment did not adversely affect
      control mice. These results suggest that in individuals with disease
      susceptibility, timing prophylactically safe interventions to specific windows
      during development may prevent or arrest disease progression.

TI  - Synthetic lethal targeting of oncogenic transcription factors in acute leukemia
      by PARP inhibitors.
PG  - 1481-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.3993 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly driven by oncogenic transcription factors,
      which have been classically viewed as intractable targets using small-molecule
      inhibitor approaches. Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive
      transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene
      RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARalpha fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are
      extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part
      owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination
      (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In
      contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A)
      fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and
      insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological
      inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of
      various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP
      inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to
      AML1-ETO and PML-RARalpha transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a
      potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and
      reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML.

TI  - Targeting megakaryocytic-induced fibrosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms by
      AURKA inhibition.
PG  - 1473-80
LID - 10.1038/nm.3995 [doi]
AB  - Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis,
      myeloproliferation, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly and leukemic
      progression. Moreover, the bone marrow and spleens of individuals with PMF
      contain large numbers of atypical megakaryocytes that are postulated to
      contribute to fibrosis through the release of cytokines, including transforming
      growth factor (TGF)-beta. Although the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib
      provides symptomatic relief, it does not reduce the mutant allele burden or
      substantially reverse fibrosis. Here we show through pharmacologic and genetic
      studies that aurora kinase A (AURKA) represents a new therapeutic target in PMF. 
      Treatment with MLN8237, a selective AURKA inhibitor, promoted polyploidization
      and differentiation of megakaryocytes with PMF-associated mutations and had
      potent antifibrotic and antitumor activity in vivo in mouse models of PMF.
      Moreover, heterozygous deletion of Aurka was sufficient to ameliorate fibrosis
      and other PMF features in vivo. Our data suggest that megakaryocytes drive
      fibrosis in PMF and that targeting them with AURKA inhibitors has the potential
      to provide therapeutic benefit.

TI  - Dystrophin expression in muscle stem cells regulates their polarity and
      asymmetric division.
PG  - 1455-63
LID - 10.1038/nm.3990 [doi]
AB  - Dystrophin is expressed in differentiated myofibers, in which it is required for 
      sarcolemmal integrity, and loss-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes it
      result in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a disease characterized by
      progressive and severe skeletal muscle degeneration. Here we found that
      dystrophin is also highly expressed in activated muscle stem cells (also known as
      satellite cells), in which it associates with the serine-threonine kinase Mark2
      (also known as Par1b), an important regulator of cell polarity. In the absence of
      dystrophin, expression of Mark2 protein is downregulated, resulting in the
      inability to localize the cell polarity regulator Pard3 to the opposite side of
      the cell. Consequently, the number of asymmetric divisions is strikingly reduced 
      in dystrophin-deficient satellite cells, which also display a loss of polarity,
      abnormal division patterns (including centrosome amplification), impaired mitotic
      spindle orientation and prolonged cell divisions. Altogether, these intrinsic
      defects strongly reduce the generation of myogenic progenitors that are needed
      for proper muscle regeneration. Therefore, we conclude that dystrophin has an
      essential role in the regulation of satellite cell polarity and asymmetric
      division. Our findings indicate that muscle wasting in DMD not only is caused by 
      myofiber fragility, but also is exacerbated by impaired regeneration owing to
      intrinsic satellite cell dysfunction.

TI  - Microbiota depletion promotes browning of white adipose tissue and reduces
      obesity.
PG  - 1497-1501
LID - 10.1038/nm.3994 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes a lean and healthy phenotype and improves
      insulin sensitivity. In response to cold or exercise, brown fat cells also emerge
      in the white adipose tissue (WAT; also known as beige cells), a process known as 
      browning. Here we show that the development of functional beige fat in the
      inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ingSAT) and perigonadal visceral adipose
      tissue (pgVAT) is promoted by the depletion of microbiota either by means of
      antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice. This leads to improved glucose
      tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and adipocyte size in
      lean mice, obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. 
      Such metabolic improvements are mediated by eosinophil infiltration, enhanced
      type 2 cytokine signaling and M2 macrophage polarization in the subcutaneous
      white fat depots of microbiota-depleted animals. The metabolic phenotype and the 
      browning of the subcutaneous fat are impaired by the suppression of type 2
      cytokine signaling, and they are reversed by recolonization of the
      antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice with microbes. These results provide insight
      into the microbiota-fat signaling axis and beige-fat development in health and
      metabolic disease.

TI  - SWI/SNF-mutant cancers depend on catalytic and non-catalytic activity of EZH2.
PG  - 1491-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3968 [doi]
AB  - Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode
      subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across 
      a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to
      have bona fide tumor suppressor activity. However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF
      subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a
      catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in
      all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF
      subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently
      mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway
      mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we
      demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a
      non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that
      they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity.
      These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic
      alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors 
      now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of
      EZH2.

      circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse
      genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the
      spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results
      indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone 
      can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin
      converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells 
      and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV.
      Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus
      in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based
      immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both
      monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from 
      infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these
      findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014
      recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in
      vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses
      currently circulating in bat populations.

TI  - MARCH8 inhibits HIV-1 infection by reducing virion incorporation of envelope
      glycoproteins.
PG  - 1502-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3956 [doi]
AB  - Membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) is one of 11 members of the recently
      discovered MARCH family of RING (really interesting new gene)-finger E3 ubiquitin
      ligases. MARCH8 downregulates several host transmembrane proteins, including
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, CD86, interleukin (IL)-1 receptor
      accessory protein, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 and
      the transferrin receptor. However, its physiological roles remain largely
      unknown. Here we identify MARCH8 as a novel antiviral factor. The ectopic
      expression of MARCH8 in virus-producing cells does not affect levels of
      lentivirus production, but it does markedly reduce viral infectivity. MARCH8
      blocks the incorporation of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein into virus particles by
      downregulating it from the cell surface, probably through their interaction,
      resulting in a substantial reduction in the efficiency of viral entry. The
      inhibitory effect of MARCH8 on vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein is even 
      more remarkable, suggesting a broad-spectrum inhibition of enveloped viruses by
      MARCH8. Notably, the endogenous expression of MARCH8 is high in monocyte-derived 
      macrophages and dendritic cells, and MARCH8 knockdown or knockout in macrophages 
      significantly increases the infectivity of virions produced by these cells. Our
      findings thus indicate that MARCH8 is highly expressed in terminally
      differentiated myeloid cells, and that it is a potent antiviral protein that
      targets viral envelope glycoproteins and reduces their incorporation into
      virions.

TI  - An AKT3-FOXG1-reelin network underlies defective migration in human focal
      malformations of cortical development.
PG  - 1445-54
LID - 10.1038/nm.3982 [doi]
AB  - Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs) account for the majority of
      drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy. Postzygotic somatic mutations activating the
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B
      (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway are found in a wide range of
      brain diseases, including FMCDs. It remains unclear how a mutation in a small
      fraction of cells disrupts the architecture of the entire hemisphere. Within
      human FMCD-affected brain, we found that cells showing activation of the
      PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were enriched for the AKT3(E17K) mutation. Introducing the 
      FMCD-causing mutation into mouse brain resulted in electrographic seizures and
      impaired hemispheric architecture. Mutation-expressing neural progenitors showed 
      misexpression of reelin, which led to a non-cell autonomous migration defect in
      neighboring cells, due at least in part to derepression of reelin transcription
      in a manner dependent on the forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXG1.
      Treatments aimed at either blocking downstream AKT signaling or inactivating
      reelin restored migration. These findings suggest a central AKT-FOXG1-reelin
      signaling pathway in FMCD and support pathway inhibitors as potential treatments 
      or therapies for some forms of focal epilepsy.

TI  - The TAM receptor Mertk protects against neuroinvasive viral infection by
      maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity.
PG  - 1464-72
LID - 10.1038/nm.3974 [doi]
AB  - The TAM receptors Tyro3, Axl and Mertk are receptor tyrosine kinases that dampen 
      host innate immune responses following engagement with their ligands Gas6 and
      Protein S, which recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells. In a form of
      apoptotic mimicry, many enveloped viruses display phosphatidylserine on the outer
      leaflet of their membranes, enabling TAM receptor activation and downregulation
      of antiviral responses. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a deficiency of TAM
      receptors would enhance antiviral responses and protect against viral infection. 
      Unexpectedly, mice lacking Mertk and/or Axl, but not Tyro3, exhibited greater
      vulnerability to infection with neuroinvasive West Nile and La Crosse
      encephalitis viruses. This phenotype was associated with increased blood-brain
      barrier permeability, which enhanced virus entry into and infection of the brain.
      Activation of Mertk synergized with interferon-beta to tighten cell junctions and
      prevent virus transit across brain microvascular endothelial cells. Because TAM
      receptors restrict pathogenesis of neuroinvasive viruses, these findings have
      implications for TAM antagonists that are currently in clinical development.

AB  - Human tumors show a high level of genetic heterogeneity, but the processes that
      influence the timing and route of metastatic dissemination of the subclones are
      unknown. Here we have used whole-exome sequencing of 103 matched benign,
      malignant and metastatic skin tumors from genetically heterogeneous mice to
      demonstrate that most metastases disseminate synchronously from the primary
      tumor, supporting parallel rather than linear evolution as the predominant model 
      of metastasis. Shared mutations between primary carcinomas and their matched
      metastases have the distinct A-to-T signature of the initiating carcinogen
      dimethylbenzanthracene, but non-shared mutations are primarily G-to-T, a
      signature associated with oxidative stress. The existence of carcinomas that
      either did or did not metastasize in the same host animal suggests that there are
      tumor-intrinsic factors that influence metastatic seeding. We also demonstrate
      the importance of germline polymorphisms in determining allele-specific
      mutations, and we identify somatic genetic alterations that are specifically
      related to initiation of carcinogenesis by Hras or Kras mutations. Mouse tumors
      that mimic the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers can aid our understanding
      of the clonal evolution of metastasis and provide a realistic model for the
      testing of novel therapies.

TI  - The emerging role of lncRNAs in cancer.
PG  - 1253-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.3981 [doi]
AB  - It is increasingly evident that many of the genomic mutations in cancer reside
      inside regions that do not encode proteins. However, these regions are often
      transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). The recent application of
      next-generation sequencing to a growing number of cancer transcriptomes has
      indeed revealed thousands of lncRNAs whose aberrant expression is associated with
      different cancer types. Among the few that have been functionally characterized, 
      several have been linked to malignant transformation. Notably, these lncRNAs have
      key roles in gene regulation and thus affect various aspects of cellular
      homeostasis, including proliferation, survival, migration or genomic stability.
      This review aims to summarize current knowledge of lncRNAs from the cancer
      perspective. It discusses the strategies that led to the identification of
      cancer-related lncRNAs and the methodologies and challenges involving the study
      of these molecules, as well as the imminent applications of these findings to the
      clinic.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of microRNAs regulating cholesterol and triglyceride
      homeostasis.
PG  - 1290-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3980 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked genes to various pathological
      traits. However, the potential contribution of regulatory noncoding RNAs, such as
      microRNAs (miRNAs), to a genetic predisposition to pathological conditions has
      remained unclear. We leveraged GWAS meta-analysis data from >188,000 individuals 
      to identify 69 miRNAs in physical proximity to single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) associated with abnormal levels of circulating lipids. Several of these
      miRNAs (miR-128-1, miR-148a, miR-130b, and miR-301b) control the expression of
      key proteins involved in cholesterol-lipoprotein trafficking, such as the
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and the ATP-binding cassette A1
      (ABCA1) cholesterol transporter. Consistent with human liver expression data and 
      genetic links to abnormal blood lipid levels, overexpression and antisense
      targeting of miR-128-1 or miR-148a in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J and Apoe-null
      mice resulted in altered hepatic expression of proteins involved in lipid
      trafficking and metabolism, and in modulated levels of circulating
      lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides. Taken together, these findings support
      the notion that altered expression of miRNAs may contribute to abnormal blood
      lipid levels, predisposing individuals to human cardiometabolic disorders.

AB  - There are few in vitro models of exocrine pancreas development and primary human 
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We establish three-dimensional culture
      conditions to induce the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into
      exocrine progenitor organoids that form ductal and acinar structures in culture
      and in vivo. Expression of mutant KRAS or TP53 in progenitor organoids induces
      mutation-specific phenotypes in culture and in vivo. Expression of TP53(R175H)
      induces cytosolic SOX9 localization. In patient tumors bearing TP53 mutations,
      SOX9 was cytoplasmic and associated with mortality. We also define culture
      conditions for clonal generation of tumor organoids from freshly resected PDAC.
      Tumor organoids maintain the differentiation status, histoarchitecture and
      phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and retain patient-specific
      physiological changes, including hypoxia, oxygen consumption, epigenetic marks
      and differences in sensitivity to inhibition of the histone methyltransferase
      EZH2. Thus, pancreatic progenitor organoids and tumor organoids can be used to
      model PDAC and for drug screening to identify precision therapy strategies.

TI  - Inhibition of mechanical allodynia in neuropathic pain by TLR5-mediated A-fiber
      blockade.
PG  - 1326-31
LID - 10.1038/nm.3978 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical allodynia, induced by normally innocuous low-threshold mechanical
      stimulation, represents a cardinal feature of neuropathic pain. Blockade or
      ablation of high-threshold, small-diameter unmyelinated group C nerve fibers
      (C-fibers) has limited effects on mechanical allodynia. Although large,
      myelinated group A fibers, in particular Abeta-fibers, have previously been
      implicated in mechanical allodynia, an A-fiber-selective pharmacological blocker 
      is still lacking. Here we report a new method for targeted silencing of A-fibers 
      in neuropathic pain. We found that Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is co-expressed
      with neurofilament-200 in large-diameter A-fiber neurons in the dorsal root
      ganglion (DRG). Activation of TLR5 with its ligand flagellin results in neuronal 
      entry of the membrane-impermeable lidocaine derivative QX-314, leading to
      TLR5-dependent blockade of sodium currents, predominantly in A-fiber neurons of
      mouse DRGs. Intraplantar co-application of flagellin and QX-314
      (flagellin/QX-314) dose-dependently suppresses mechanical allodynia after
      chemotherapy, nerve injury, and diabetic neuropathy, but this blockade is
      abrogated in Tlr5-deficient mice. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrated that
      co-application of flagellin/QX-314 selectively suppressed Abeta-fiber conduction 
      in naive and chemotherapy-treated mice. TLR5-mediated Abeta-fiber blockade, but
      not capsaicin-mediated C-fiber blockade, also reduced chemotherapy-induced
      ongoing pain without impairing motor function. Finally, flagellin/QX-314
      co-application suppressed sodium currents in large-diameter human DRG neurons.
      Thus, our findings provide a new tool for targeted silencing of Abeta-fibers and 
      neuropathic pain treatment.

AB  - In heart failure therapy, it is generally assumed that attempts to produce a
      long-term increase in cardiac contractile force are almost always accompanied by 
      structural and functional damage. Here we show that modest overexpression of the 
      Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), encoded by Pebp1 in mice, produces a
      well-tolerated, persistent increase in cardiac contractility that is mediated by 
      the beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1AR). This result is unexpected, as beta1AR
      activation, a major driver of cardiac contractility, usually has long-term
      adverse effects. RKIP overexpression achieves this tolerance via simultaneous
      activation of the beta2AR subtype. Analogously, RKIP deficiency exaggerates
      pressure overload-induced cardiac failure. We find that RKIP expression is
      upregulated in mouse and human heart failure, indicative of an adaptive role for 
      RKIP. Pebp1 gene transfer in a mouse model of heart failure has beneficial
      effects, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for heart failure therapy.

AB  - Profiling candidate therapeutics with limited cancer models during preclinical
      development hinders predictions of clinical efficacy and identifying factors that
      underlie heterogeneous patient responses for patient-selection strategies. We
      established approximately 1,000 patient-derived tumor xenograft models (PDXs)
      with a diverse set of driver mutations. With these PDXs, we performed in vivo
      compound screens using a 1 x 1 x 1 experimental design (PDX clinical trial or
      PCT) to assess the population responses to 62 treatments across six indications. 
      We demonstrate both the reproducibility and the clinical translatability of this 
      approach by identifying associations between a genotype and drug response, and
      established mechanisms of resistance. In addition, our results suggest that PCTs 
      may represent a more accurate approach than cell line models for assessing the
      clinical potential of some therapeutic modalities. We therefore propose that this
      experimental paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of
      treatment modalities and enhance our ability to predict clinical trial responses.

      homeostasis and lymphoma.
PG  - 1272-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3962 [doi]
AB  - The skin harbors a variety of resident leukocyte subsets that must be tightly
      regulated to maintain immune homeostasis. Hair follicles are unique structures in
      the skin that contribute to skin dendritic cell homeostasis through chemokine
      production. We demonstrate that CD4(+) and CD8(+) skin-resident memory T cells
      (TRM cells), which are responsible for long-term skin immunity, reside
      predominantly within the hair follicle epithelium of the unperturbed epidermis.
      TRM cell tropism for the epidermis and follicles is herein termed
      epidermotropism. Hair follicle expression of IL-15 was required for CD8(+) TRM
      cells, and IL-7 for CD8(+) and CD4(+) TRM cells, to exert epidermotropism. A lack
      of either cytokine in the skin led to impaired hapten-induced contact
      hypersensitivity responses. In a model of cutaneous T cell lymphoma,
      epidermotropic CD4(+) TRM lymphoma cell localization depended on the presence of 
      hair follicle-derived IL-7. These findings implicate hair follicle-derived
      cytokines as regulators of malignant and non-malignant TRM cell tissue residence,
      and they suggest that the cytokines may be targeted therapeutically in
      inflammatory skin diseases and lymphoma.

TI  - Selective inhibition of the p38 alternative activation pathway in infiltrating T 
      cells inhibits pancreatic cancer progression.
PG  - 1337-43
LID - 10.1038/nm.3957 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm
      characterized by a marked fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, the presence of
      which can promote both cancer induction and growth. Therefore, selective
      manipulation of local cytokines is an attractive, although unrealized,
      therapeutic approach. T cells possess a unique mechanism of p38 mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) activation downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement
      through the phosphorylation of Tyr323 (pY323). This alternative p38 activation
      pathway is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Here we show in
      human PDAC that a high percentage of infiltrating pY323(+) T cells was associated
      with large numbers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha- and interleukin
      (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and aggressive
      disease. The growth of mouse pancreatic tumors was inhibited by genetic ablation 
      of the alternative p38 pathway, and transfer of wild-type CD4(+) T cells, but not
      those lacking the alternative pathway, enhanced tumor growth in T cell-deficient 
      mice. Notably, a plasma membrane-permeable peptide derived from GADD45-alpha, the
      naturally occurring inhibitor of p38 pY323(+) (ref. 7), reduced CD4(+) TIL
      production of TNF-alpha, IL-17A, IL-10 and secondary cytokines, halted growth of 
      implanted tumors and inhibited progression of spontaneous KRAS-driven
      adenocarcinoma in mice. Thus, TCR-mediated activation of CD4(+) TILs results in
      alternative p38 activation and production of protumorigenic factors and can be
      targeted for therapeutic benefit.

PG  - 1350-6

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous
      outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene
      expression-based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we
      formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and
      analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six
      independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular
      subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability
      immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation;
      CMS2 (canonical, 37%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 
      (metabolic, 13%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4
      (mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor-beta activation, stromal
      invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a
      transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups
      the most robust classification system currently available for CRC-with clear
      biological interpretability-and the basis for future clinical stratification and 
      subtype-based targeted interventions.

TI  - Excess TGF-beta mediates muscle weakness associated with bone metastases in mice.
PG  - 1262-1271
LID - 10.1038/nm.3961 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-associated muscle weakness is a poorly understood phenomenon, and there is
      no effective treatment. Here we find that seven different mouse models of human
      osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers, as
      well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role
      for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We
      found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, released from the bone surface 
      as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4
      (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including 
      the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized 
      RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is
      required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage,
      TGF-beta signaling, TGF-beta release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle
      function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung
      cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is 
      not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4
      binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of
      Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated
      with increased TGF-beta activity. Thus, pathological TGF-beta release from bone
      contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force
      production.

AB  - Retention of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) in the
      bone marrow is essential for hematopoiesis and for protection from myelotoxic
      injury. We report that signaling cascades that are traditionally viewed as
      coagulation related also control retention of endothelial protein C
      receptor-positive (EPCR(+)) LT-HSCs in the bone marrow and their recruitment to
      the blood via two pathways mediated by protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1).
      Thrombin-PAR1 signaling induces nitric oxide (NO) production, leading to EPCR
      shedding mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE),
      enhanced CXCL12-CXCR4-induced motility and rapid stem and progenitor cell
      mobilization. Conversely, bone marrow blood vessels provide a microenvironment
      enriched with activated protein C (aPC) that retains EPCR(+) LT-HSCs by limiting 
      NO generation, reducing Cdc42 activity and enhancing integrin VLA4 affinity and
      adhesion. Inhibition of NO production by aPC-EPCR-PAR1 signaling reduces
      progenitor cell egress from the bone marrow, increases retention of bone marrow
      NO(low) EPCR(+) LT-HSCs and protects mice from chemotherapy-induced hematological
      failure and death. Our study reveals new roles for PAR1 and EPCR in controlling
      NO production to balance maintenance and recruitment of bone marrow EPCR(+)
      LT-HSCs, with potential clinical relevance for stem cell transplantation.

TI  - Viral variants that initiate and drive maturation of V1V2-directed HIV-1 broadly 
      neutralizing antibodies.
PG  - 1332-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3963 [doi]
AB  - The elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is likely to be
      essential for a preventative HIV-1 vaccine, but this has not yet been achieved by
      immunization. In contrast, some HIV-1-infected individuals naturally mount bNAb
      responses during chronic infection, suggesting that years of maturation may be
      required for neutralization breadth. Recent studies have shown that viral
      diversification precedes the emergence of bNAbs, but the significance of this
      observation is unknown. Here we delineate the key viral events that drove
      neutralization breadth within the CAP256-VRC26 family of 33 monoclonal antibodies
      (mAbs) isolated from a superinfected individual. First, we identified minority
      viral variants, termed bNAb-initiating envelopes, that were distinct from both of
      the transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses and that efficiently engaged the bNAb
      precursor. Second, deep sequencing revealed a pool of diverse epitope variants
      (immunotypes) that were preferentially neutralized by broader members of the
      antibody lineage. In contrast, a 'dead-end' antibody sublineage unable to
      neutralize these immunotypes showed limited evolution and failed to develop
      breadth. Thus, early viral escape at key antibody-virus contact sites selects for
      antibody sublineages that can tolerate these changes, thereby providing a
      mechanism for the generation of neutralization breadth within a developing
      antibody lineage.

LID - 10.1038/nm.3947 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressors BAP1 and ASXL1 interact to form a polycomb deubiquitinase
      complex that removes monoubiquitin from histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub).
      However, BAP1 and ASXL1 are mutated in distinct cancer types, consistent with
      independent roles in regulating epigenetic state and malignant transformation.
      Here we demonstrate that Bap1 loss in mice results in increased trimethylated
      histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), elevated enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive
      complex 2 subunit (Ezh2) expression, and enhanced repression of polycomb
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. These findings contrast with the reduction
      in H3K27me3 levels seen with Asxl1 loss. Conditional deletion of Bap1 and Ezh2 in
      vivo abrogates the myeloid progenitor expansion induced by Bap1 loss alone. Loss 
      of BAP1 results in a marked decrease in H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1).
      Consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in the transcriptional regulation of EZH2,
      expression of SETD8-the H4K20me1 methyltransferase-reduces EZH2 expression and
      abrogates the proliferation of BAP1-mutant cells. Furthermore, mesothelioma cells
      that lack BAP1 are sensitive to EZH2 pharmacologic inhibition, suggesting a novel
      therapeutic approach for BAP1-mutant malignancies.

TI  - MicroRNA-148a regulates LDL receptor and ABCA1 expression to control circulating 
      lipoprotein levels.
PG  - 1280-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3949 [doi]
AB  - The hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway is essential for
      clearing circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Whereas the transcriptional
      regulation of LDLR is well characterized, the post-transcriptional mechanisms
      that govern LDLR expression are just beginning to emerge. Here we develop a
      high-throughput genome-wide screening assay to systematically identify microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) that regulate LDLR activity in human hepatic cells. From this screen we 
      identified and characterized miR-148a as a negative regulator of LDLR expression 
      and activity and defined a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1
      (SREBP1)-mediated pathway through which miR-148a regulates LDL-C uptake. In mice,
      inhibition of miR-148a increased hepatic LDLR expression and decreased plasma
      LDL-C. Moreover, we found that miR-148a regulates hepatic expression of
      ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) and circulating high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in vivo. These studies uncover a role for 
      miR-148a as a key regulator of hepatic LDL-C clearance through direct modulation 
      of LDLR expression and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting
      miR-148a to ameliorate an elevated LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, a prominent risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease.

TI  - CAUSEL: an epigenome- and genome-editing pipeline for establishing function of
      noncoding GWAS variants.
PG  - 1357-63
LID - 10.1038/nm.3975 [doi]
AB  - The vast majority of disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      mapped by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are located in the
      non-protein-coding genome, but establishing the functional and mechanistic roles 
      of these sequence variants has proven challenging. Here we describe a general
      pipeline in which candidate functional SNPs are first evaluated by fine mapping, 
      epigenomic profiling, and epigenome editing, and then interrogated for causal
      function by using genome editing to create isogenic cell lines followed by
      phenotypic characterization. To validate this approach, we analyzed the 6q22.1
      prostate cancer risk locus and identified rs339331 as the top-scoring SNP.
      Epigenome editing confirmed that the rs339331 region possessed regulatory
      potential. By using transcription activator-like effector nuclease
      (TALEN)-mediated genome editing, we created a panel of isogenic 22Rv1 prostate
      cancer cell lines representing all three genotypes (TT, TC, CC) at rs339331.
      Introduction of the 'T' risk allele increased transcription of the regulatory
      factor 6 (RFX6) gene, increased homeobox B13 (HOXB13) binding at the rs339331
      region, and increased deposition of the enhancer-associated H3K4me2 histone mark 
      at the rs339331 region compared to lines homozygous for the 'C' protective
      allele. The cell lines also differed in cellular morphology and adhesion, and
      pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested an influence of
      androgens. In summary, we have developed and validated a widely accessible
      approach that can be used to establish functional causality for noncoding
      sequence variants identified by GWASs.

TI  - Natural and therapy-induced immunosurveillance in breast cancer.
PG  - 1128-38
LID - 10.1038/nm.3944 [doi]
AB  - The immunosurveillance theory postulates that tumors evolve and progress in an
      uncontrolled fashion only when anticancer immune responses fail. Natural
      immunosurveillance clearly influences human breast cancer (BC) progression
      because the prognosis of BC patients is dictated by the density, composition and 
      activity of the tumor immune infiltrate at diagnosis. Moreover, chemotherapeutic 
      and radiotherapeutic regimens commonly employed for the treatment of BC affect
      the tumor immune infiltrate, and accumulating data suggest that the clinical
      efficacy of these treatments is largely determined by T cell-dependent
      tumor-specific immune responses. In addition, the mechanism of action of targeted
      anticancer therapeutics, such as the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2
      (ERBB2)-targeting agent trastuzumab, involves the innate and adaptive arms of the
      immune system. In this Review, we discuss these findings as well as preliminary
      evidence indicating that immunotherapy constitutes a promising option for the
      treatment of BC. Moreover, we point out that the successful implementation of
      immunotherapy to BC management requires the optimization of current
      immunotherapeutic regimens and the identification of immunological biomarkers
      that enable improved risk stratification and the design of personalized, dynamic 
      treatment plans.

TI  - Clinical translation of a high-performance neural prosthesis.
PG  - 1142-5
LID - 10.1038/nm.3953 [doi]
AB  - Neural prostheses have the potential to improve the quality of life of
      individuals with paralysis by directly mapping neural activity to limb- and
      computer-control signals. We translated a neural prosthetic system previously
      developed in animal model studies for use by two individuals with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis who had intracortical microelectrode arrays placed in motor
      cortex. Measured more than 1 year after implant, the neural cursor-control system
      showed the highest published performance achieved by a person to date, more than 
      double that of previous pilot clinical trial participants.

TI  - Endogenous antigen processing drives the primary CD4+ T cell response to
      influenza.
PG  - 1216-22

AB  - By convention, CD4+ T lymphocytes recognize foreign and self peptides derived
      from internalized antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex
      class II molecules. Alternative pathways of epitope production have been
      identified, but their contributions to host defense have not been established. We
      show here in a mouse infection model that the CD4+ T cell response to influenza, 
      critical for durable protection from the virus, is driven principally by
      unconventional processing of antigen synthesized within the infected
      antigen-presenting cell, not by classical processing of endocytosed virions or
      material from infected cells. Investigation of the cellular components involved, 
      including the H2-M molecular chaperone, the proteasome and
      gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase revealed considerable
      heterogeneity in the generation of individual epitopes, an arrangement that
      ensures peptide diversity and broad CD4+ T cell engagement. These results could
      fundamentally revise strategies for rational vaccine design and may lead to key
      insights into the induction of autoimmune and anti-tumor responses.

TI  - Metabolic reprogramming induces resistance to anti-NOTCH1 therapies in T cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 1182-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3955 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in NOTCH1 are common in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (T-ALL). Here we identify glutaminolysis as a critical pathway for leukemia cell 
      growth downstream of NOTCH1 and a key determinant of the response to anti-NOTCH1 
      therapies in vivo. Mechanistically, inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL
      induces a metabolic shutdown, with prominent inhibition of glutaminolysis and
      triggers autophagy as a salvage pathway supporting leukemia cell metabolism.
      Consequently, inhibition of glutaminolysis and inhibition of autophagy strongly
      and synergistically enhance the antileukemic effects of anti-NOTCH1 therapy in
      mice harboring T-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that Pten loss upregulates
      glycolysis and consequently rescues leukemic cell metabolism, thereby abrogating 
      the antileukemic effects of NOTCH1 inhibition. Overall, these results identify
      glutaminolysis as a major node in cancer metabolism controlled by NOTCH1 and as
      therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL.

TI  - Combined inhibition of BET family proteins and histone deacetylases as a
      potential epigenetics-based therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1163-71
LID - 10.1038/nm.3952 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers
      and shows resistance to any therapeutic strategy used. Here we tested
      small-molecule inhibitors targeting chromatin regulators as possible therapeutic 
      agents in PDAC. We show that JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and
      extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, suppresses PDAC development in mice by
      inhibiting both MYC activity and inflammatory signals. The histone deacetylase
      (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA synergizes with JQ1 to augment cell death and more potently
      suppress advanced PDAC. Finally, using a CRISPR-Cas9-based method for gene
      editing directly in the mouse adult pancreas, we show that de-repression of p57
      (also known as KIP2 or CDKN1C) upon combined BET and HDAC inhibition is required 
      for the induction of combination therapy-induced cell death in PDAC. SAHA is
      approved for human use, and molecules similar to JQ1 are being tested in clinical
      trials. Thus, these studies identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic
      strategy that may be rapidly implemented in fatal human tumors.

      deficits.
PG  - 1154-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.3951 [doi]
AB  - Tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), are neurodegenerative diseases in which tau fibrils accumulate. Recent
      evidence supports soluble tau species as the major toxic species. How soluble tau
      accumulates and causes neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we identify tau
      acetylation at Lys174 (K174) as an early change in AD brains and a critical
      determinant in tau homeostasis and toxicity in mice. The acetyl-mimicking mutant 
      K174Q slows tau turnover and induces cognitive deficits in vivo.
      Acetyltransferase p300-induced tau acetylation is inhibited by salsalate and
      salicylate, which enhance tau turnover and reduce tau levels. In the PS19
      transgenic mouse model of FTD, administration of salsalate after disease onset
      inhibited p300 activity, lowered levels of total tau and tau acetylated at K174, 
      rescued tau-induced memory deficits and prevented hippocampal atrophy. The
      tau-lowering and protective effects of salsalate were diminished in neurons
      expressing K174Q tau. Targeting tau acetylation could be a new therapeutic
      strategy against human tauopathies.

TI  - ACF chromatin-remodeling complex mediates stress-induced depressive-like
      behavior.
PG  - 1146-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.3939 [doi]
AB  - Improved treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) remains elusive because of
      the limited understanding of its underlying biological mechanisms. It is likely
      that stress-induced maladaptive transcriptional regulation in limbic neural
      circuits contributes to the development of MDD, possibly through epigenetic
      factors that regulate chromatin structure. We establish that persistent
      upregulation of the ACF (ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) 
      ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, occurring in the nucleus accumbens of
      stress-susceptible mice and depressed humans, is necessary for stress-induced
      depressive-like behaviors. We found that altered ACF binding after chronic stress
      was correlated with altered nucleosome positioning, particularly around the
      transcription start sites of affected genes. These alterations in ACF binding and
      nucleosome positioning were associated with repressed expression of genes
      implicated in susceptibility to stress. Together, our findings identify the ACF
      chromatin-remodeling complex as a critical component in the development of
      susceptibility to depression and in regulating stress-related behaviors.

TI  - Disruption of KMT2D perturbs germinal center B cell development and promotes
      lymphomagenesis.
PG  - 1190-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3940 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding the KMT2D (or MLL2) methyltransferase are highly
      recurrent and occur early during tumorigenesis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL). However, the functional consequences of
      these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that 
      FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading
      to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL
      cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not
      after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and
      enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in
      mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas
      resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor
      suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the
      epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of
      KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for
      targeting early tumorigenic events.

TI  - Early life dynamics of the human gut virome and bacterial microbiome in infants.
PG  - 1228-34
LID - 10.1038/nm.3950 [doi]
AB  - The early years of life are important for immune development and influence health
      in adulthood. Although it has been established that the gut bacterial microbiome 
      is rapidly acquired after birth, less is known about the viral microbiome (or
      'virome'), consisting of bacteriophages and eukaryotic RNA and DNA viruses,
      during the first years of life. Here, we characterized the gut virome and
      bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of healthy infant twins. The virome
      and bacterial microbiome were more similar between co-twins than between
      unrelated infants. From birth to 2 years of age, the eukaryotic virome and the
      bacterial microbiome expanded, but this was accompanied by a contraction of and
      shift in the bacteriophage virome composition. The bacteriophage-bacteria
      relationship begins from birth with a high predator-low prey dynamic, consistent 
      with the Lotka-Volterra prey model. Thus, in contrast to the stable microbiome
      observed in adults, the infant microbiome is highly dynamic and associated with
      early life changes in the composition of bacteria, viruses and bacteriophages
      with age.

TI  - The histone lysine methyltransferase KMT2D sustains a gene expression program
      that represses B cell lymphoma development.
PG  - 1199-208
LID - 10.1038/nm.3943 [doi]
AB  - The gene encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase KMT2D has emerged
      as one of the most frequently mutated genes in follicular lymphoma and diffuse
      large B cell lymphoma; however, the biological consequences of KMT2D mutations on
      lymphoma development are not known. Here we show that KMT2D functions as a bona
      fide tumor suppressor and that its genetic ablation in B cells promotes lymphoma 
      development in mice. KMT2D deficiency also delays germinal center involution and 
      impedes B cell differentiation and class switch recombination. Integrative
      genomic analyses indicate that KMT2D affects methylation of lysine 4 on histone
      H3 (H3K4) and expression of a set of genes, including those in the CD40,
      JAK-STAT, Toll-like receptor and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Notably,
      other KMT2D target genes include frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes such
      as TNFAIP3, SOCS3 and TNFRSF14. Therefore, KMT2D mutations may promote malignant 
      outgrowth by perturbing the expression of tumor suppressor genes that control B
      cell-activating pathways.

TI  - Minimal PU.1 reduction induces a preleukemic state and promotes development of
      acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1172-81
LID - 10.1038/nm.3936 [doi]
AB  - Modest transcriptional changes caused by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms are
      frequent in human cancer. Although loss or near-complete loss of the
      hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in
      mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, 
      moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional
      consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in
      mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell
      aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35%
      reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic
      stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch
      repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of
      expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found
      marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human
      myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction 
      of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human
      disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides
      mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells 
      in AML.

AB  - Finding new treatment-shortening antibiotics to improve cure rates and curb the
      alarming emergence of drug resistance is the major objective of tuberculosis (TB)
      drug development. Using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)
      mass spectrometry imaging suite in a biosafety containment facility, we show that
      the key sterilizing drugs rifampicin and pyrazinamide efficiently penetrate the
      sites of TB infection in lung lesions. Rifampicin even accumulates in necrotic
      caseum, a critical lesion site where persisting tubercle bacilli reside. In
      contrast, moxifloxacin, which is active in vitro against a subpopulation of
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis that persists in specific niches under drug pressure
      and has achieved treatment shortening in mice, does not diffuse well in caseum,
      concordant with its failure to shorten therapy in recent clinical trials. We
      suggest that such differential spatial distribution and kinetics of accumulation 
      in lesions may create temporal and spatial windows of monotherapy in specific
      niches, allowing the gradual development of multidrug-resistant TB. We propose an
      alternative working model to prioritize new antibiotic regimens based on
      quantitative and spatial distribution of TB drugs in the major lesion types found
      in human lungs. The finding that lesion penetration may contribute to treatment
      outcome has wide implications for TB.

TI  - HIV-1 infections with multiple founders are associated with higher viral loads
      than infections with single founders.
PG  - 1139-41
LID - 10.1038/nm.3932 [doi]
AB  - Given the variation in the HIV-1 viral load (VL) set point across subjects, as
      opposed to a fairly stable VL over time within an infected individual, it is
      important to identify the characteristics of the host and virus that affect VL
      set point. Although recently infected individuals with multiple phylogenetically 
      linked HIV-1 founder variants represent a minority of HIV-1 infections, we
      found--n two different cohorts--hat more diverse HIV-1 populations in early

AB  - Macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells mediated by CD47-specific blocking
      antibodies has been proposed to be the major effector mechanism in xenograft
      models. Here, using syngeneic immunocompetent mouse tumor models, we reveal that 
      the therapeutic effects of CD47 blockade depend on dendritic cell but not
      macrophage cross-priming of T cell responses. The therapeutic effects of
      anti-CD47 antibody therapy were abrogated in T cell-deficient mice. In addition, 
      the antitumor effects of CD47 blockade required expression of the cytosolic DNA
      sensor STING, but neither MyD88 nor TRIF, in CD11c+ cells, suggesting that
      cytosolic sensing of DNA from tumor cells is enhanced by anti-CD47 treatment,
      further bridging the innate and adaptive responses. Notably, the timing of
      administration of standard chemotherapy markedly impacted the induction of
      antitumor T cell responses by CD47 blockade. Together, our findings indicate that
      CD47 blockade drives T cell-mediated elimination of immunogenic tumors.

TI  - Modeling psychiatric disorders for developing effective treatments.
PG  - 979-88
LID - 10.1038/nm.3935 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in identifying risk-associated genes have provided unprecedented 
      opportunities for developing animal models for psychiatric disease research with 
      the goal of attaining translational utility to ultimately develop novel
      treatments. However, at this early stage, successful translation has yet to be
      achieved. Here we review recent advances in modeling psychiatric disease, discuss
      the utility and limitations of animal models, and emphasize the importance of
      shifting from behavioral analysis to identifying neurophysiological
      abnormalities, which are likely to be more conserved across species and thus may 
      increase translatability. Looking forward, we envision that preclinical research 
      will align with clinical research to build a common framework of comparable
      neurobiological abnormalities and to help form subgroups of patients on the basis
      of similar pathophysiology. Experimental neuroscience can then use animal models 
      to discover mechanisms underlying distinct abnormalities and develop strategies
      for effective treatments.

TI  - Hemagglutinin-stem nanoparticles generate heterosubtypic influenza protection.
PG  - 1065-70
LID - 10.1038/nm.3927 [doi]
AB  - The antibody response to influenza is primarily focused on the head region of the
      hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, which in turn undergoes antigenic drift, thus
      necessitating annual updates of influenza vaccines. In contrast, the
      immunogenically subdominant stem region of HA is highly conserved and recognized 
      by antibodies capable of binding multiple HA subtypes. Here we report the
      structure-based development of an H1 HA stem-only immunogen that confers
      heterosubtypic protection in mice and ferrets. Six iterative cycles of
      structure-based design (Gen1-Gen6) yielded successive H1 HA stabilized-stem
      (HA-SS) immunogens that lack the immunodominant head domain. Antigenic
      characterization, determination of two HA-SS crystal structures in complex with
      stem-specific monoclonal antibodies and cryo-electron microscopy analysis of
      HA-SS on ferritin nanoparticles (H1-SS-np) confirmed the preservation of key
      structural elements. Vaccination of mice and ferrets with H1-SS-np elicited
      broadly cross-reactive antibodies that completely protected mice and partially
      protected ferrets against lethal heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza virus challenge
      despite the absence of detectable H5N1 neutralizing activity in vitro. Passive
      transfer of immunoglobulin from H1-SS-np-immunized mice to naive mice conferred
      protection against H5N1 challenge, indicating that vaccine-elicited HA
      stem-specific antibodies can protect against diverse group 1 influenza strains.

TI  - Nogo-B regulates endothelial sphingolipid homeostasis to control vascular
      function and blood pressure.
PG  - 1028-1037
LID - 10.1038/nm.3934 [doi]
AB  - Endothelial dysfunction is a critical factor in many cardiovascular diseases,
      including hypertension. Although lipid signaling has been implicated in
      endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, specific molecular mechanisms
      are poorly understood. Here we report that Nogo-B, a membrane protein of the
      endoplasmic reticulum, regulates endothelial sphingolipid biosynthesis with
      direct effects on vascular function and blood pressure. Nogo-B inhibits serine
      palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo sphingolipid
      biosynthetic pathway, thereby controlling production of endothelial sphingosine
      1-phosphate and autocrine, G protein-coupled receptor-dependent signaling by this
      metabolite. Mice lacking Nogo-B either systemically or specifically in
      endothelial cells are hypotensive, resistant to angiotensin II-induced
      hypertension and have preserved endothelial function and nitric oxide release. In
      mice that lack Nogo-B, pharmacological inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase 
      with myriocin reinstates endothelial dysfunction and angiotensin II-induced
      hypertension. Our study identifies Nogo-B as a key inhibitor of local
      sphingolipid synthesis and shows that autocrine sphingolipid signaling within the
      endothelium is critical for vascular function and blood pressure homeostasis.

TI  - RAS-MAPK dependence underlies a rational polytherapy strategy in
      EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer.
PG  - 1038-47
LID - 10.1038/nm.3930 [doi]
AB  - One strategy for combating cancer-drug resistance is to deploy rational
      polytherapy up front that suppresses the survival and emergence of resistant
      tumor cells. Here we demonstrate in models of lung adenocarcinoma harboring the
      oncogenic fusion of ALK and EML4 that the GTPase RAS-mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for
      tumor-cell survival. EML4-ALK activated RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three 
      major RAS isoforms through the HELP domain of EML4. Reactivation of the MAPK
      pathway via either a gain in the number of copies of the gene encoding wild-type 
      K-RAS (KRAS(WT)) or decreased expression of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted
      resistance to ALK inhibitors in vitro, and each was associated with resistance to
      ALK inhibitors in individuals with EML4-ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Upfront
      inhibition of both ALK and the kinase MEK enhanced both the magnitude and
      duration of the initial response in preclinical models of EML4-ALK lung
      adenocarcinoma. Our findings identify RAS-MAPK dependence as a hallmark of
      EML4-ALK lung adenocarcinoma and provide a rationale for the upfront inhibition
      of both ALK and MEK to forestall resistance and improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Meta-analysis of shared genetic architecture across ten pediatric autoimmune

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of
      susceptibility genes, including shared associations across clinically distinct
      autoimmune diseases. We performed an inverse chi(2) meta-analysis across ten
      pediatric-age-of-onset autoimmune diseases (pAIDs) in a case-control study
      including more than 6,035 cases and 10,718 shared population-based controls. We
      identified 27 genome-wide significant loci associated with one or more pAIDs,
      mapping to in silico-replicated autoimmune-associated genes (including IL2RA) and
      new candidate loci with established immunoregulatory functions such as ADGRL2,
      TENM3, ANKRD30A, ADCY7 and CD40LG. The pAID-associated single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally enriched for deoxyribonuclease
      (DNase)-hypersensitivity sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs),
      microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites and coding variants. We also identified
      biologically correlated, pAID-associated candidate gene sets on the basis of
      immune cell expression profiling and found evidence of genetic sharing. Network
      and protein-interaction analyses demonstrated converging roles for the signaling 
      pathways of type 1, 2 and 17 helper T cells (TH1, TH2 and TH17), JAK-STAT,
      interferon and interleukin in multiple autoimmune diseases.

TI  - APP intracellular domain-WAVE1 pathway reduces amyloid-beta production.
PG  - 1054-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3924 [doi]
AB  - An increase in amyloid-beta (Abeta) production is a major pathogenic mechanism
      associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about possible
      homeostatic control of the amyloidogenic pathway. Here we report that the amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) downregulates Wiskott-Aldrich
      syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin homologous protein 1 (WAVE1 or WASF1) as
      part of a negative feedback mechanism to limit Abeta production. The AICD binds
      to the Wasf1 promoter, negatively regulates its transcription and downregulates
      Wasf1 mRNA and protein expression in Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. WAVE1 interacts and
      colocalizes with APP in the Golgi apparatus. Experimentally reducing WAVE1 in N2a
      cells decreased the budding of APP-containing vesicles and reduced cell-surface
      APP, thereby reducing the production of Abeta. WAVE1 downregulation was observed 
      in mouse models of AD. Reduction of Wasf1 gene expression dramatically reduced
      Abeta levels and restored memory deficits in a mouse model of AD. A decrease in
      amounts of WASF1 mRNA was also observed in human AD brains, suggesting clinical
      relevance of the negative feedback circuit involved in homeostatic regulation of 
      Abeta production.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha confers cardioprotection through ectopic expression

LID - 10.1038/nm.3925 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), one of the major stress-induced
      proinflammatory cytokines, is upregulated in the heart after tissue injury, and
      its sustained expression can contribute to the development of heart failure.
      Whether TNF-alpha also exerts cytoprotective effects in heart failure is not
      known. Here we provide evidence for a cardioprotective function of TNF-alpha in a
      genetic heart failure model, desmin-deficient mice. The cardioprotective effects 
      of TNF-alpha are a consequence of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated
      ectopic expression in cardiomyocytes of keratin 8 (K8) and keratin 18 (K18), two 
      epithelial-specific intermediate filament proteins. In cardiomyocytes, K8 and K18
      (K8/K18) formed an alternative cytoskeletal network that localized mainly at
      intercalated discs (IDs) and conferred cardioprotection by maintaining normal ID 
      structure and mitochondrial integrity and function. Ectopic induction of K8/K18
      expression in cardiomyocytes also occurred in other genetic and experimental
      models of heart failure. Loss of the K8/K18 network resulted in a maladaptive
      cardiac phenotype following transverse aortic constriction. In human failing
      myocardium, where TNF-alpha expression is upregulated, K8/K18 were also
      ectopically expressed and localized primarily at IDs, which did not contain
      detectable amounts of desmin. Thus, TNF-alpha- and NF-kappaB-mediated formation
      of an alternative, stress-induced intermediate filament cytoskeleton has
      cardioprotective function in mice and potentially in humans.

AB  - The intestine is densely populated by anaerobic commensal bacteria. These
      microorganisms shape immune system development, but understanding of
      host-commensal interactions is hampered by a lack of tools for studying the
      anaerobic intestinal environment. We applied metabolic oligosaccharide
      engineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry to label various commensal
      anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, a common and immunologically important
      commensal. We studied the dissemination of B. fragilis after acute peritonitis
      and characterized the interactions of the intact microbe and its polysaccharide
      components in myeloid and B cell lineages. We were able to assess the
      distribution and colonization of labeled B. fragilis along the intestine, as well
      as niche competition after coadministration of multiple species of the
      microbiota. We also fluorescently labeled nine additional commensals (eight
      anaerobic and one microaerophilic) from three phyla common in the
      gut--Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria--as well as one aerobic
      pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus). This strategy permits visualization of the
      anaerobic microbial niche by various methods, including intravital two-photon
      microscopy and non-invasive whole-body imaging, and can be used to study
      microbial colonization and host-microbe interactions in real time.

PG  - 1010-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3922 [doi]
AB  - T cell stimulation via glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor
      (TNFR)-related protein (GITR) elicits antitumor activity in various tumor models;
      however, the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we demonstrate 
      a crucial role for interleukin (IL)-9 in antitumor immunity generated by the GITR
      agonistic antibody DTA-1. IL-4 receptor knockout (Il4ra(-/-)) mice, which have
      reduced expression of IL-9, were resistant to tumor growth inhibition by DTA-1.
      Notably, neutralization of IL-9 considerably impaired tumor rejection induced by 
      DTA-1. In particular, DTA-1-induced IL-9 promoted tumor-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL) responses by enhancing the function of dendritic cells in vivo. 
      Furthermore, GITR signaling enhanced the differentiation of IL-9-producing CD4(+)
      T-helper (TH9) cells in a TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)- and
      NF-kappaB-dependent manner and inhibited the generation of induced regulatory T
      cells in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that GITR co-stimulation mediates
      antitumor immunity by promoting TH9 cell differentiation and enhancing CTL
      responses and thus provide a mechanism of action for GITR agonist-mediated cancer
      immunotherapies.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed after the disease 
      has metastasized; it is among the most lethal forms of cancer. We recently
      described aberrant expression of an open reading frame 1 protein, ORF1p, encoded 
      by long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1; L1) retrotransposon, in PDAC. To test
      whether LINE-1 expression leads to somatic insertions of this mobile DNA, we used
      a targeted method to sequence LINE-1 insertion sites in matched PDAC and normal
      samples. We found evidence of 465 somatic LINE-1 insertions in 20 PDAC genomes,
      which were absent from corresponding normal samples. In cases in which matched
      normal tissue, primary PDAC and metastatic disease sites were available,
      insertions were found in primary and metastatic tissues in differing proportions.
      Two adenocarcinomas secondarily involving the pancreas, but originating in the
      stomach and duodenum, acquired insertions with a similar discordance between
      primary and metastatic sites. Together, our findings show that LINE-1 contributes
      to the genetic evolution of PDAC and suggest that somatic insertions are acquired
      discontinuously in gastrointestinal neoplasms.

TI  - PCSK6-mediated corin activation is essential for normal blood pressure.
PG  - 1048-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.3920 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease, afflicting >30% of
      adults. The cause of hypertension in most individuals remains unknown, suggesting
      that additional contributing factors have yet to be discovered. Corin is a serine
      protease that activates the natriuretic peptides, thereby regulating blood
      pressure. It is synthesized as a zymogen that is activated by proteolytic
      cleavage. CORIN variants and mutations impairing corin activation have been
      identified in people with hypertension and pre-eclampsia. To date, however, the
      identity of the protease that activates corin remains elusive. Here we show that 
      proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6, also named PACE4; ref. 10)
      cleaves and activates corin. In cultured cells, we found that corin activation
      was inhibited by inhibitors of PCSK family proteases and by small interfering
      RNAs blocking PCSK6 expression. Conversely, PCSK6 overexpression enhanced corin
      activation. In addition, purified PCSK6 cleaved wild-type corin but not the R801A
      variant that lacks the conserved activation site. Pcsk6-knockout mice developed
      salt-sensitive hypertension, and corin activation and pro-atrial natriuretic
      peptide processing activity were undetectable in these mice. Moreover, we found
      that CORIN variants in individuals with hypertension and pre-eclampsia were
      defective in PCSK6-mediated activation. We also identified a PCSK6 mutation that 
      impaired corin activation activity in a hypertensive patient. Our results
      indicate that PCSK6 is the long-sought corin activator and is important for
      sodium homeostasis and normal blood pressure.

TI  - Myostatin is a direct regulator of osteoclast differentiation and its inhibition 
      reduces inflammatory joint destruction in mice.
PG  - 1085-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.3917 [doi]
AB  - Myostatin (also known as growth and differentiation factor 8) is a secreted
      member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family that is mainly
      expressed in skeletal muscle, which is also its primary target tissue. Deletion
      of the myostatin gene (Mstn) in mice leads to muscle hypertrophy, and animal
      studies support the concept that myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle
      growth and regeneration. However, myostatin deficiency also increases bone
      formation, mainly through loading-associated effects on bone. Here we report a
      previously unknown direct role for myostatin in osteoclastogenesis and in the
      progressive loss of articular bone in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We demonstrate
      that myostatin is highly expressed in the synovial tissues of RA subjects and of 
      human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha transgenic (hTNFtg) mice, a model for
      human RA. Myostatin strongly accelerates receptor activator of nuclear factor
      kappaB ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast formation in vitro through
      transcription factor SMAD2-dependent regulation of nuclear factor of activated
      T-cells (NFATC1). Myostatin deficiency or antibody-mediated inhibition leads to
      an amelioration of arthritis severity in hTNFtg mice, chiefly reflected by less
      bone destruction. Consistent with these effects in hTNFtg mice, the lack of
      myostatin leads to increased grip strength and less bone erosion in the K/BxN
      serum-induced arthritis model in mice. The results strongly suggest that
      myostatin is a potent therapeutic target for interfering with osteoclast
      formation and joint destruction in RA.

TI  - Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induces cell cycle arrest and parenchymal
      damage in renal fibrosis.
PG  - 998-1009
LID - 10.1038/nm.3902 [doi]
AB  - Kidney fibrosis is marked by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of
      tubular epithelial cells (TECs). Here we find that, during renal fibrosis, TECs
      acquire a partial EMT program during which they remain associated with their
      basement membrane and express markers of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.
      The functional consequence of the EMT program during fibrotic injury is an arrest
      in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and lower expression of several solute and
      solvent transporters in TECs. We also found that transgenic expression of either 
      Twist1 (encoding twist family bHLH transcription factor 1, known as Twist) or
      Snai1 (encoding snail family zinc finger 1, known as Snail) expression is
      sufficient to promote prolonged TGF-beta1-induced G2 arrest of TECs, limiting the
      cells' potential for repair and regeneration. In mouse models of experimentally
      induced renal fibrosis, conditional deletion of Twist1 or Snai1 in proximal TECs 
      resulted in inhibition of the EMT program and the maintenance of TEC integrity,
      while also restoring cell proliferation, dedifferentiation-associated repair and 
      regeneration of the kidney parenchyma and attenuating interstitial fibrosis.
      Thus, inhibition of the EMT program in TECs during chronic renal injury
      represents a potential anti-fibrosis therapy.

AB  - Endogenous mechanisms leading to host protection and resolution of infections
      without immunosuppression are of wide interest. Here we elucidate the structures 
      of four new host-protective molecules produced in neutrophil-endothelial
      cocultures and present in human and mouse tissues after sterile inflammation or
      infection. The bioactive molecules contain conjugated triene and diene double
      bonds, carry an alcohol at C13 and are derived from n-3 docosapentaenoic acid
      (DPA, C22:5). These compounds, termed 13-series resolvins (RvTs), demonstrated
      potent protective actions increasing mice survival during Escherichia coli
      infections. RvTs also regulated human and mouse phagocyte responses stimulating
      bacterial phagocytosis and regulating inflammasome components. Their biosynthesis
      during neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions was initiated by endothelial
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased by atorvastatin via S-nitrosylation of COX-2 
      and reduced by COX-2 inhibitors. The actions of atorvastatin and RvTs were
      additive in E. coli infections in mice, where they accelerated resolution of
      inflammation and increased survival >60%. Taken together, these results document 
      host-protective molecules in bacterial infections, namely RvTs, derived from n-3 
      DPA via transcellular biosynthesis and increased by atorvastatin. These molecules
      regulate key innate protective responses in the resolution of infectious
      inflammation.

TI  - Snail1-induced partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition drives renal fibrosis
      in mice and can be targeted to reverse established disease.
PG  - 989-97
LID - 10.1038/nm.3901 [doi]
AB  - Progressive kidney fibrosis contributes greatly to end-stage renal failure, and
      no specific treatment is available to preserve organ function. During renal
      fibrosis, myofibroblasts accumulate in the interstitium of the kidney, leading to
      massive deposition of extracellular matrix and organ dysfunction. The origin of
      myofibroblasts is manifold, but the contribution of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) undergone by renal epithelial cells during kidney fibrosis is
      still debated. We show that the reactivation of Snai1 (encoding snail family zinc
      finger 1, known as Snail1) in mouse renal epithelial cells is required for the
      development of fibrosis in the kidney. Damage-mediated Snail1 reactivation
      induces a partial EMT in tubular epithelial cells that, without directly
      contributing to the myofibroblast population, relays signals to the interstitium 
      to promote myofibroblast differentiation and fibrogenesis and to sustain
      inflammation. We also show that Snail1-induced fibrosis can be reversed in vivo
      and that obstructive nephropathy can be therapeutically ameliorated in mice by
      targeting Snail1 expression. These results reconcile conflicting data on the role
      of the EMT in renal fibrosis and provide avenues for the design of novel
      anti-fibrotic therapies.

TI  - The central role of muscle stem cells in regenerative failure with aging.
PG  - 854-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.3918 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle mass, function, and repair capacity all progressively decline
      with aging, restricting mobility, voluntary function, and quality of life.
      Skeletal muscle repair is facilitated by a population of dedicated muscle stem
      cells (MuSCs), also known as satellite cells, that reside in anatomically defined
      niches within muscle tissues. In adult tissues, MuSCs are retained in a quiescent
      state until they are primed to regenerate damaged muscle through cycles of
      self-renewal divisions. With aging, muscle tissue homeostasis is progressively
      disrupted and the ability of MuSCs to repair injured muscle markedly declines.
      Until recently, this decline has been largely attributed to extrinsic age-related
      alterations in the microenvironment to which MuSCs are exposed. However, as
      highlighted in this Perspective, recent reports show that MuSCs also
      progressively undergo cell-intrinsic alterations that profoundly affect stem cell
      regenerative function with aging. A more comprehensive understanding of the
      interplay of stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors will set the stage for
      improving cell therapies capable of restoring tissue homeostasis and enhancing
      muscle repair in the aged.

TI  - Toward understanding and exploiting tumor heterogeneity.
PG  - 846-53
LID - 10.1038/nm.3915 [doi]
AB  - The extent of tumor heterogeneity is an emerging theme that researchers are only 
      beginning to understand. How genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity affects tumor
      evolution and clinical progression is unknown. The precise nature of the
      environmental factors that influence this heterogeneity is also yet to be
      characterized. Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology and the Volkswagen
      Foundation organized a meeting focused on identifying the obstacles that need to 
      be overcome to advance translational research in and tumor heterogeneity. Once
      these key questions were established, the attendees devised potential solutions. 
      Their ideas are presented here.

TI  - Neutrophils promote Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive decline via 
      LFA-1 integrin.
PG  - 880-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3913 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and innate immune
      cells have been shown to contribute to disease pathogenesis. In two transgenic
      models of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice), neutrophils extravasated 
      and were present in areas with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits, where they released
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and IL-17. Abeta42 peptide triggered the
      LFA-1 integrin high-affinity state and rapid neutrophil adhesion to integrin
      ligands. In vivo, LFA-1 integrin controlled neutrophil extravasation into the CNS
      and intraparenchymal motility. In transgenic Alzheimer's disease models,
      neutrophil depletion or inhibition of neutrophil trafficking via LFA-1 blockade
      reduced Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology and improved memory in mice
      already showing cognitive dysfunction. Temporary depletion of neutrophils for 1
      month at early stages of disease led to sustained improvements in memory.
      Transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice lacking LFA-1 were protected from
      cognitive decline and had reduced gliosis. In humans with Alzheimer's disease,
      neutrophils adhered to and spread inside brain venules and were present in the
      parenchyma, along with NETs. Our results demonstrate that neutrophils contribute 
      to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment and suggest that the
      inhibition of neutrophil trafficking may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - The oral and gut microbiomes are perturbed in rheumatoid arthritis and partly
      normalized after treatment.
PG  - 895-905
LID - 10.1038/nm.3914 [doi]
AB  - We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association
      study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort of individuals 
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. Concordance was observed
      between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting overlap in the abundance and
      function of species at different body sites. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut
      and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially resolved after RA
      treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or saliva microbiome distinguished
      individuals with RA from healthy controls, were correlated with clinical measures
      and could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to
      therapy. In particular, Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at 
      all three sites and negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies,
      whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at
      all three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA. 
      Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron, sulfur,
      zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with RA.
      Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable. Our
      results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in
      individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome composition
      for prognosis and diagnosis.

TI  - NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-engineered T cells mediate sustained antigen-specific
      antitumor effects in myeloma.
PG  - 914-921
LID - 10.1038/nm.3910 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely
      incurable. Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety
      and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T
      cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the
      cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive
      MM received an average 2.4 x 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem
      cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent
      cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded,
      persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence 
      of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in
      the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or
      antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the
      transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20
      patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 
      19.1 months. NY-ESO-1-LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T cells were safe, trafficked to
      marrow and showed extended persistence that correlated with clinical activity
      against antigen-positive myeloma.

TI  - Targeting B cell receptor signaling with ibrutinib in diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma.
PG  - 922-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3884 [doi]
AB  - The two major subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)--activated B
      cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB)--arise by distinct
      mechanisms, with ABC selectively acquiring mutations that target the B cell
      receptor (BCR), fostering chronic active BCR signaling. The ABC subtype has a
      approximately 40% cure rate with currently available therapies, which is worse
      than the rate for GCB DLBCL, and highlights the need for ABC subtype-specific
      treatment strategies. We hypothesized that ABC, but not GCB, DLBCL tumors would
      respond to ibrutinib, an inhibitor of BCR signaling. In a phase 1/2 clinical
      trial that involved 80 subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, ibrutinib
      produced complete or partial responses in 37% (14/38) of those with ABC DLBCL,
      but in only 5% (1/20) of subjects with GCB DLBCL (P = 0.0106). ABC tumors with
      BCR mutations responded to ibrutinib frequently (5/9; 55.5%), especially those
      with concomitant myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations
      (4/5; 80%), a result that is consistent with in vitro cooperation between the BCR
      and MYD88 pathways. However, the highest number of responses occurred in ABC
      tumors that lacked BCR mutations (9/29; 31%), suggesting that oncogenic BCR
      signaling in ABC does not require BCR mutations and might be initiated by
      non-genetic mechanisms. These results support the selective development of
      ibrutinib for the treatment of ABC DLBCL.

      cancers.
PG  - 938-945
LID - 10.1038/nm.3909 [doi]
AB  - Molecular profiles of tumors and tumor-associated cells hold great promise as
      biomarkers of clinical outcomes. However, existing data sets are fragmented and
      difficult to analyze systematically. Here we present a pan-cancer resource and
      meta-analysis of expression signatures from approximately 18,000 human tumors
      with overall survival outcomes across 39 malignancies. By using this resource, we
      identified a forkhead box MI (FOXM1) regulatory network as a major predictor of
      adverse outcomes, and we found that expression of favorably prognostic genes,
      including KLRB1 (encoding CD161), largely reflect tumor-associated leukocytes. By
      applying CIBERSORT, a computational approach for inferring leukocyte
      representation in bulk tumor transcriptomes, we identified complex associations
      between 22 distinct leukocyte subsets and cancer survival. For example,
      tumor-associated neutrophil and plasma cell signatures emerged as significant but
      opposite predictors of survival for diverse solid tumors, including breast and

TI  - STAT3-dependent reactive astrogliosis in the spinal dorsal horn underlies chronic
      itch.
PG  - 927-31
LID - 10.1038/nm.3912 [doi]
AB  - Chronic itch is an intractable symptom of inflammatory skin diseases, such as
      atopic and contact dermatitis. Recent studies have revealed neuronal pathways
      selective for itch, but the mechanisms by which itch turns into a pathological
      chronic state are poorly understood. Using mouse models of atopic and contact
      dermatitis, we demonstrate a long-term reactive state of astrocytes in the dorsal
      horn of the spinal segments that corresponds to lesioned, itchy skin. We found
      that reactive astrogliosis depended on the activation of signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Conditional disruption of astrocytic STAT3 
      suppressed chronic itch, and pharmacological inhibition of spinal STAT3
      ameliorated the fully developed chronic itch. Mice with atopic dermatitis
      exhibited an increase in scratching elicited by intrathecal administration of the
      itch-inducer gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and this enhancement was normalized
      by suppressing STAT3-mediated reactive astrogliosis. Moreover, we identified
      lipocalin-2 (LCN2) as an astrocytic STAT3-dependent upregulated factor that was
      crucial for chronic itch, and we demonstrated that intrathecal administration of 
      LCN2 to normal mice increased spinal GRP-evoked scratching. Our findings indicate
      that STAT3-dependent reactive astrocytes act as critical amplifiers of itching
      through a mechanism involving the enhancement of spinal itch signals by LCN2,
      thereby providing a previously unrecognized target for treating chronic itch.

TI  - Detection of colorectal polyps in humans using an intravenously administered
      fluorescent peptide targeted against c-Met.
PG  - 955-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.3641 [doi]
AB  - Colon cancer prevention currently relies on colonoscopy using white light to
      detect and remove polyps, but small and flat polyps are difficult to detect and
      frequently missed when using this technique. Fluorescence colonoscopy combined
      with a fluorescent probe specific for a polyp biomarker may improve polyp
      detection. Here we describe GE-137, a water-soluble probe consisting of a
      26-amino acid cyclic peptide that binds the human tyrosine kinase c-Met
      conjugated to a fluorescent cyanine dye. Intravenous administration of GE-137
      leads to its accumulation specifically in c-Met-expressing tumors in mice, and it
      is safe and well tolerated in humans. Fluorescence colonoscopy in patients
      receiving intravenous GE-137 enabled visualization of all neoplastic polyps that 
      were visible with white light (38), as well as an additional nine polyps that
      were not visible with white light. This first-in-human pilot study shows that
      molecular imaging using an intravenous fluorescent agent specific for c-Met is
      feasible and safe, and that it may enable the detection of polyps missed by other
      techniques.

      enabling lung repair in mice.
PG  - 869-79
LID - 10.1038/nm.3889 [doi]
AB  - Repair of injured lungs represents a longstanding therapeutic challenge. We show 
      that human and mouse embryonic lung tissue from the canalicular stage of
      development (20-22 weeks of gestation for humans, and embryonic day 15-16
      (E15-E16) for mouse) are enriched with progenitors residing in distinct niches.
      On the basis of the marked analogy to progenitor niches in bone marrow (BM), we
      attempted strategies similar to BM transplantation, employing sublethal radiation
      to vacate lung progenitor niches and to reduce stem cell competition. Intravenous
      infusion of a single cell suspension of canalicular lung tissue from GFP-marked
      mice or human fetal donors into naphthalene-injured and irradiated syngeneic or
      SCID mice, respectively, induced marked long-term lung chimerism. Donor type
      structures or 'patches' contained epithelial, mesenchymal and endothelial cells. 
      Transplantation of differentially labeled E16 mouse lung cells indicated that
      these patches were probably of clonal origin from the donor. Recipients of the
      single cell suspension transplant exhibited marked improvement in lung compliance
      and tissue damping reflecting the energy dissipation in the lung tissues. Our
      study provides proof of concept for lung reconstitution by canalicular-stage
      human lung cells after preconditioning of the pulmonary niche.

TI  - Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase regulates hepatic nutrient metabolism through
      Sirt1 protein stabilization.
PG  - 887-94
LID - 10.1038/nm.3882 [doi]
AB  - Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) methylates nicotinamide, a form of
      vitamin B3, to produce N(1)-methylnicotinamide (MNAM). Nnmt has emerged as a
      metabolic regulator in adipocytes, but its role in the liver, the tissue with the
      strongest Nnmt expression, is not known. In spite of its overall high expression,
      here we find that hepatic expression of Nnmt is highly variable and correlates
      with multiple metabolic parameters in mice and humans. Further, we find that
      suppression of hepatic Nnmt expression in vivo alters glucose and cholesterol
      metabolism and that the metabolic effects of Nnmt in the liver are mediated by
      its product MNAM. Supplementation of high-fat diet with MNAM decreases serum and 
      liver cholesterol and liver triglycerides levels in mice. Mechanistically,
      increasing Nnmt expression or MNAM levels stabilizes sirtuin 1 protein, an effect
      that is required for their metabolic benefits. In summary, we describe here a
      novel regulatory pathway for vitamin B3 that could provide a new opportunity for 
      metabolic disease therapy.

TI  - c-kit(+) cells adopt vascular endothelial but not epithelial cell fates during
      lung maintenance and repair.
PG  - 866-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3888 [doi]
AB  - Unraveling the fate specification of resident stem cells during lung regeneration
      is of clinical importance. It has been reported that c-kit(+) progenitor cells
      resident in the human lung regenerate epithelial lineages upon transplantation
      into injured mouse lung. Here we test the lineage potential of c-kit(+) cells by 
      inducible genetic lineage tracing. We find that c-kit(+) cells do not contribute 
      to lung epithelium during homeostasis and repair, and instead maintain a vascular
      endothelial cell fate. These findings call attention to the clinical application 
      of c-kit(+) stem cells as lung epithelial progenitors for the treatment of
      pulmonary disease.

TI  - Genomic landscape of carcinogen-induced and genetically induced mouse skin
      squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 946-54
LID - 10.1038/nm.3878 [doi]
AB  - Mouse models of cancers are routinely used to study cancer biology. However, it
      remains unclear whether carcinogenesis in mice is driven by the same spectrum of 
      genomic alterations found in humans. Here we conducted a comprehensive genomic
      analysis of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA)-induced skin cancer, the most
      commonly used skin cancer model, which appears as benign papillomas that progress
      into squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We also studied genetically induced SCCs
      that expressed G12D mutant Kras (Kras G12D) but were deficient for p53. Using
      whole-exome sequencing, we uncovered a characteristic mutational signature of
      DMBA-induced SCCs. We found that the vast majority of DMBA-induced SCCs presented
      recurrent mutations in Hras, Kras or Rras2 and mutations in several additional
      putative oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Similar genes were recurrently
      mutated in mouse and human SCCs that were from different organs or had been
      exposed to different carcinogens. Invasive SCCs, but not papillomas, presented
      substantial chromosomal aberrations, especially in DMBA-induced and genetically
      induced Trp53-mutated SCCs. Metastasis occurred through sequential spreading,
      with relatively few additional genetic events. This study provides a framework
      for future functional cancer genomic studies in mice.

TI  - beta2-microglobulin is a systemic pro-aging factor that impairs cognitive
      function and neurogenesis.
PG  - 932-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3898 [doi]
AB  - Aging drives cognitive and regenerative impairments in the adult brain,
      increasing susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders in healthy individuals. 
      Experiments using heterochronic parabiosis, in which the circulatory systems of
      young and old animals are joined, indicate that circulating pro-aging factors in 
      old blood drive aging phenotypes in the brain. Here we identify
      beta2-microglobulin (B2M), a component of major histocompatibility complex class 
      1 (MHC I) molecules, as a circulating factor that negatively regulates cognitive 
      and regenerative function in the adult hippocampus in an age-dependent manner.
      B2M is elevated in the blood of aging humans and mice, and it is increased within
      the hippocampus of aged mice and young heterochronic parabionts. Exogenous B2M
      injected systemically, or locally in the hippocampus, impairs
      hippocampal-dependent cognitive function and neurogenesis in young mice. The
      negative effects of B2M and heterochronic parabiosis are, in part, mitigated in
      the hippocampus of young transporter associated with antigen processing 1
      (Tap1)-deficient mice with reduced cell surface expression of MHC I. The absence 
      of endogenous B2M expression abrogates age-related cognitive decline and enhances
      neurogenesis in aged mice. Our data indicate that systemic B2M accumulation in
      aging blood promotes age-related cognitive dysfunction and impairs neurogenesis, 
      in part via MHC I, suggesting that B2M may be targeted therapeutically in old
      age.

AB  - Cold exposure may be a potential therapy for diabetes by increasing brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) mass and activity. Here we report that 10 d of cold acclimation
      (14-15 degrees C) increased peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately 43%
      in eight type 2 diabetes subjects. Basal skeletal muscle GLUT4 translocation
      markedly increased, without effects on insulin signaling or AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK) activation and only a minor increase in BAT glucose uptake.

TI  - Inflammasome-independent role of AIM2 in suppressing colon tumorigenesis via
      DNA-PK and Akt.
PG  - 906-13
LID - 10.1038/nm.3908 [doi]
AB  - The inflammasome activates caspase-1 and the release of interleukin-1beta
      (IL-1beta) and IL-18, and several inflammasomes protect against intestinal
      inflammation and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in animal models. The
      absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome is activated by double-stranded DNA, and
      AIM2 expression is reduced in several types of cancer, but the mechanism by which
      AIM2 restricts tumor growth remains unclear. We found that Aim2-deficient mice
      had greater tumor load than Asc-deficient mice in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium
      sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colorectal cancer. Tumor burden was also higher in
      Aim2(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) than in APC(Min/+) mice. The effects of AIM2 on CAC were
      independent of inflammasome activation and IL-1beta and were primarily mediated
      by a non-bone marrow source of AIM2. In resting cells, AIM2 physically interacted
      with and limited activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a
      PI3K-related family member that promotes Akt phosphorylation, whereas loss of
      AIM2 promoted DNA-PK-mediated Akt activation. AIM2 reduced Akt activation and
      tumor burden in colorectal cancer models, while an Akt inhibitor reduced tumor
      load in Aim2(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that Akt inhibitors could be used 
      to treat AIM2-deficient human cancers.

      inflammation.
PG  - 698-708
LID - 10.1038/nm.3892 [doi]
AB  - A previously unappreciated cell type of the innate immune system, termed innate
      lymphoid cells (ILCs), has been characterized in mice and humans and found to
      influence the induction, regulation and resolution of inflammation. ILCs have an 
      important role in these processes in mouse models of infection, inflammation and 
      tissue repair. Further, disease-association studies in defined patient
      populations have identified significant alterations in ILC responses, suggesting 
      a potential role for these cell populations in human health and disease. In this 
      review we discuss the emerging family of ILCs, the role of ILCs in inflammation, 
      and how current or novel therapeutic strategies could be used to selectively
      modulate ILC responses and limit chronic inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics.
PG  - 677-87
LID - 10.1038/nm.3893 [doi]
AB  - The inflammasomes are innate immune system receptors and sensors that regulate
      the activation of caspase-1 and induce inflammation in response to infectious
      microbes and molecules derived from host proteins. They have been implicated in a
      host of inflammatory disorders. Recent developments have greatly enhanced our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which different inflammasomes are
      activated. Additionally, increasing evidence in mouse models, supported by human 
      data, strongly implicates an involvement of the inflammasome in the initiation or
      progression of diseases with a high impact on public health, such as metabolic
      disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, recent developments pointing
      toward promising therapeutics that target inflammasome activity in inflammatory
      diseases have been reported. This review will focus on these three areas of
      inflammasome research.

      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
PG  - 719-29
LID - 10.1038/nm.3895 [doi]
AB  - The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) was thought to have a central role in T
      cell-mediated responses in inflammation for more than a decade after it was first
      identified. Discovery of the cytokine IL-23, which shares a common p40 subunit
      with IL-12, prompted efforts to clarify the relative contribution of these two
      cytokines in immune regulation. Ustekinumab, a therapeutic agent targeting both
      cytokines, was recently approved to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and 
      related agents are in clinical testing for a variety of inflammatory disorders.
      Here we discuss the therapeutic rationale for targeting these cytokines, the
      unintended consequences for host defense and tumor surveillance and potential
      ways in which these therapies can be applied to treat additional immune
      disorders.

TI  - The emerging role of resident memory T cells in protective immunity and
      inflammatory disease.
PG  - 688-97
LID - 10.1038/nm.3883 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, it has become clear that there is an important subset of
      memory T cells that resides in tissues-tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells.
      There is an emerging understanding that TRM cells have a role in human
      tissue-specific immune and inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the nature of the 
      molecular signals that maintain TRM cells in tissues is the subject of much
      investigation. In addition, whereas it is logical for TRM cells to be located in 
      barrier tissues at interfaces with the environment, these cells have also been
      found in brain, kidney, joint and other non-barrier tissues in humans and mice.
      Given the biology and behavior of these cells, it is likely that they have a role
      in chronic relapsing and remitting diseases of both barrier and non-barrier
      tissues. In this Review we discuss recent insights into the biology of TRM cells 
      with a particular focus on their roles in disease, both proven and putative.

AB  - Organisms need to protect themselves against potential dangers from their
      surroundings, yet they require constant and intimate interactions with the same
      environment for their survival. The immune system is instrumental for protection 
      against invading organisms and their toxins. The immune system consists of many
      cell types and is highly integrated within other tissues. Immune activity is
      particularly enriched at surfaces that separate the host from its environment,
      such as the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. This enables protection at sites
      directly at risk but also enables environmental factors to influence the
      maturation and function of immune structures and cells. Recent work has indicated
      that the diet in particular is able to influence the immune system and thus
      affect the development of inflammatory disease. This review aims to highlight
      recent work on how external factors, with a focus on those derived from the diet 
      such as vitamin A, can have a direct or indirect deterministic influence on the
      activity and function of immunity.

TI  - Heterogeneity of autoimmune diseases: pathophysiologic insights from genetics and
      implications for new therapies.
PG  - 730-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3897 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across autoimmune and
      immune-mediated diseases have augmented our understanding of pathogenic
      mechanisms underlying these diseases. This has further highlighted their
      heterogeneous nature, both within and between diseases. Furthermore, varying
      responses to therapy have also served to underline the importance of this
      heterogeneity in the manner in which these diseases are diagnosed and treated.
      Here we discuss our current understanding of the shared pathways of autoimmunity,
      including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC), interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) and protein tyrosine phosphatase
      non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) pathways. In addition, we summarize effective
      specific therapies tested across major autoimmune diseases, highlighting the
      insight they have provided into disease mechanisms and their implications for
      potential future improvements.

TI  - Inhibition of amyloid-beta plaque formation by alpha-synuclein.
PG  - 802-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3885 [doi]
AB  - Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-rich Lewy bodies are
      the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's
      disease, respectively. An overlap of pathologies is found in most individuals
      with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in more than 50% of AD cases. Their
      brains display substantial alpha-syn accumulation not only in Lewy bodies, but
      also in dystrophic neurites decorating Abeta plaques. Several studies report
      binding and coaggregation of Abeta and alpha-syn, yet the precise role of
      alpha-syn in amyloid plaque formation remains elusive. Here we performed
      intracerebral injections of alpha-syn-containing preparations into amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (expressing APP695(KM670/671NL) and
      PSEN1(L166P) under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter; referred to
      here as 'APPPS1'). Unexpectedly, alpha-syn failed to cross-seed Abeta plaques in 
      vivo, but rather it inhibited plaque formation in APPPS1 mice coexpressing
      SNCA(A30P) (referred to here as 'APPPS1 x [A30P]aSYN' double-transgenic mice).
      This was accompanied by increased Abeta levels in cerebrospinal fluid despite
      unchanged overall Abeta levels. Notably, the seeding activity of Abeta-containing
      brain homogenates was considerably reduced by alpha-syn, and Abeta deposition was
      suppressed in grafted tissue from [A30P]aSYN transgenic mice. Thus, we conclude
      that an interaction between Abeta and alpha-syn leads to inhibition of Abeta
      deposition and to reduced plaque formation.

TI  - Interleukin 18 function in atherosclerosis is mediated by the interleukin 18
      receptor and the Na-Cl co-transporter.
PG  - 820-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3890 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-18 (IL18) participates in atherogenesis through several putative
      mechanisms. Interruption of IL18 action reduces atherosclerosis in mice. Here, we
      show that absence of the IL18 receptor (IL18r) does not affect atherosclerosis in
      apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice, nor does it affect IL18 cell surface
      binding to or signaling in endothelial cells. As identified initially by
      co-immunoprecipitation with IL18, we found that IL18 interacts with the Na-Cl
      co-transporter (NCC; also known as SLC12A3), a 12-transmembrane-domain ion
      transporter protein preferentially expressed in the kidney. NCC is expressed in
      atherosclerotic lesions, where it colocalizes with IL18r. In Apoe(-/-) mice,
      combined deficiency of IL18r and NCC, but not single deficiency of either
      protein, protects mice from atherosclerosis. Peritoneal macrophages from
      Apoe(-/-) mice or from Apoe(-/-) mice lacking IL18r or NCC show IL18 binding and 
      induction of cell signaling and cytokine and chemokine expression, but
      macrophages from Apoe(-/-) mice with combined deficiency of IL18r and NCC have a 
      blunted response. An interaction between NCC and IL18r on macrophages was
      detected by co-immunoprecipitation. IL18 binds to the cell surface of
      NCC-transfected COS-7 cells, which do not express IL18r, and induces cell
      signaling and cytokine expression. This study identifies NCC as an IL18-binding
      protein that collaborates with IL18r in cell signaling, inflammatory molecule
      expression, and experimental atherogenesis.

AB  - The sequencing of cancer genomes may enable tailoring of therapeutics to the
      underlying biological abnormalities driving a particular patient's tumor.
      However, sequencing-based strategies rely heavily on representative sampling of
      tumors. To understand the subclonal structure of primary breast cancer, we
      applied whole-genome and targeted sequencing to multiple samples from each of 50 
      patients' tumors (303 samples in total). The extent of subclonal diversification 
      varied among cases and followed spatial patterns. No strict temporal order was
      evident, with point mutations and rearrangements affecting the most common breast
      cancer genes, including PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, BRCA2 and MYC, occurring early in
      some tumors and late in others. In 13 out of 50 cancers, potentially targetable
      mutations were subclonal. Landmarks of disease progression, such as resistance to
      chemotherapy and the acquisition of invasive or metastatic potential, arose
      within detectable subclones of antecedent lesions. These findings highlight the
      importance of including analyses of subclonal structure and tumor evolution in
      clinical trials of primary breast cancer.

AB  - Genetic evidence implicates the loss of bone morphogenetic protein type II
      receptor (BMPR-II) signaling in the endothelium as an initiating factor in
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, selective targeting of this
      signaling pathway using BMP ligands has not yet been explored as a therapeutic
      strategy. Here, we identify BMP9 as the preferred ligand for preventing apoptosis
      and enhancing monolayer integrity in both pulmonary arterial endothelial cells
      and blood outgrowth endothelial cells from subjects with PAH who bear mutations
      in the gene encoding BMPR-II, BMPR2. Mice bearing a heterozygous knock-in allele 
      of a human BMPR2 mutation, R899X, which we generated as an animal model of PAH
      caused by BMPR-II deficiency, spontaneously developed PAH. Administration of BMP9
      reversed established PAH in these mice, as well as in two other experimental PAH 
      models, in which PAH develops in response to either monocrotaline or VEGF
      receptor inhibition combined with chronic hypoxia. These results demonstrate the 
      promise of direct enhancement of endothelial BMP signaling as a new therapeutic
      strategy for PAH.

TI  - Diabetes primes neutrophils to undergo NETosis, which impairs wound healing.
PG  - 815-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3887 [doi]
AB  - Wound healing is impaired in diabetes, resulting in significant morbidity and
      mortality. Neutrophils are the main leukocytes involved in the early phase of
      healing. As part of their anti-microbial defense, neutrophils form extracellular 
      traps (NETs) by releasing decondensed chromatin lined with cytotoxic proteins.
      NETs, however, can also induce tissue damage. Here we show that neutrophils
      isolated from type 1 and type 2 diabetic humans and mice were primed to produce
      NETs (a process termed NETosis). Expression of peptidylarginine deiminase 4
      (PAD4, encoded by Padi4 in mice), an enzyme important in chromatin
      decondensation, was elevated in neutrophils from individuals with diabetes. When 
      subjected to excisional skin wounds, wild-type (WT) mice produced large
      quantities of NETs in wounds, but this was not observed in Padi4(-/-) mice. In
      diabetic mice, higher levels of citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit, a NET marker)
      were found in their wounds than in normoglycemic mice and healing was delayed.
      Wound healing was accelerated in Padi4(-/-) mice as compared to WT mice, and it
      was not compromised by diabetes. DNase 1, which disrupts NETs, accelerated wound 
      healing in diabetic and normoglycemic WT mice. Thus, NETs impair wound healing,
      particularly in diabetes, in which neutrophils are more susceptible to NETosis.
      Inhibiting NETosis or cleaving NETs may improve wound healing and reduce
      NET-driven chronic inflammation in diabetes.

AB  - Targeting brown adipose tissue (BAT) content or activity has therapeutic
      potential for treating obesity and the metabolic syndrome by increasing energy
      expenditure. However, both inter- and intra-individual differences contribute to 
      heterogeneity in human BAT and potentially to differential thermogenic capacity
      in human populations. Here we generated clones of brown and white preadipocytes
      from human neck fat and characterized their adipogenic and thermogenic
      differentiation. We combined an uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) reporter system and
      expression profiling to define novel sets of gene signatures in human
      preadipocytes that could predict the thermogenic potential of the cells once they
      were maturated. Knocking out the positive UCP1 regulators, PREX1 and EDNRB, in
      brown preadipocytes using CRISPR-Cas9 markedly abolished the high level of UCP1
      in brown adipocytes differentiated from the preadipocytes. Finally, we were able 
      to prospectively isolate adipose progenitors with great thermogenic potential
      using the cell surface marker CD29. These data provide new insights into the
      cellular heterogeneity in human fat and offer potential biomarkers for
      identifying thermogenically competent preadipocytes.

TI  - Urocortin3 mediates somatostatin-dependent negative feedback control of insulin
      secretion.
PG  - 769-76
LID - 10.1038/nm.3872 [doi]
AB  - The peptide hormone urocortin3 (Ucn3) is abundantly expressed by mature beta
      cells, yet its physiological role is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Ucn3 is
      stored and co-released with insulin and potentiates glucose-stimulated
      somatostatin secretion via cognate receptors on delta cells. Further, we found
      that islets lacking endogenous Ucn3 have fewer delta cells, reduced somatostatin 
      content, impaired somatostatin secretion, and exaggerated insulin release, and
      that these defects are rectified by treatment with synthetic Ucn3 in vitro. Our
      observations indicate that the paracrine actions of Ucn3 activate a negative
      feedback loop that promotes somatostatin release to ensure the timely reduction
      of insulin secretion upon normalization of plasma glucose. Moreover, Ucn3 is
      markedly depleted from beta cells in mouse and macaque models of diabetes and in 
      human diabetic islets. This suggests that Ucn3 is a key contributor to stable
      glycemic control, whose reduction during diabetes aggravates glycemic volatility 
      and contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease.

      albicans colonization.
PG  - 808-14
LID - 10.1038/nm.3871 [doi]
AB  - Candida albicans colonization is required for invasive disease. Unlike humans,
      adult mice with mature intact gut microbiota are resistant to C. albicans
      gastrointestinal (GI) colonization, but the factors that promote C. albicans
      colonization resistance are unknown. Here we demonstrate that commensal anaerobic
      bacteria-specifically clostridial Firmicutes (clusters IV and XIVa) and
      Bacteroidetes-are critical for maintaining C. albicans colonization resistance in
      mice. Using Bacteroides thetaiotamicron as a model organism, we find that
      hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor important
      for activating innate immune effectors, and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37
      (CRAMP in mice) are key determinants of C. albicans colonization resistance.
      Although antibiotic treatment enables C. albicans colonization, pharmacologic
      activation of colonic Hif1a induces CRAMP expression and results in a significant
      reduction of C. albicans GI colonization and a 50% decrease in mortality from
      invasive disease. In the setting of antibiotics, Hif1a and Camp (which encodes
      CRAMP) are required for B. thetaiotamicron-induced protection against C. albicans
      colonization of the gut. Thus, modulating C. albicans GI colonization by
      activation of gut mucosal immune effectors may represent a novel therapeutic
      approach for preventing invasive fungal disease in humans.

TI  - Nilotinib reduces muscle fibrosis in chronic muscle injury by promoting
      TNF-mediated apoptosis of fibro/adipogenic progenitors.
PG  - 786-94
LID - 10.1038/nm.3869 [doi]
AB  - Depending on the inflammatory milieu, injury can result either in a tissue's
      complete regeneration or in its degeneration and fibrosis, the latter of which
      could potentially lead to permanent organ failure. Yet how inflammatory cells
      regulate matrix-producing cells involved in the reparative process is unknown.
      Here we show that in acutely damaged skeletal muscle, sequential interactions
      between multipotent mesenchymal progenitors and infiltrating inflammatory cells
      determine the outcome of the reparative process. We found that infiltrating
      inflammatory macrophages, through their expression of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF), directly induce apoptosis of fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). In
      states of chronic damage, however, such as those in mdx mice, macrophages express
      high levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), which prevents the
      apoptosis of FAPs and induces their differentiation into matrix-producing cells. 
      Treatment with nilotinib, a kinase inhibitor with proposed anti-fibrotic
      activity, can block the effect of TGF-beta1 and reduce muscle fibrosis in mdx
      mice. Our findings reveal an unexpected anti-fibrotic role of TNF and suggest
      that disruption of the precisely timed progression from a TNF-rich to a
      TGF-beta-rich environment favors fibrotic degeneration of the muscle during
      chronic injury.

TI  - Clonal evolution and resistance to EGFR blockade in the blood of colorectal
      cancer patients.
PG  - 795-801
LID - 10.1038/nm.3870 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancers (CRCs) evolve by a reiterative process of genetic
      diversification and clonal evolution. The molecular profile of CRC is routinely
      assessed in surgical or bioptic samples. Genotyping of CRC tissue has inherent
      limitations; a tissue sample represents a single snapshot in time, and it is
      subjected to spatial selection bias owing to tumor heterogeneity. Repeated tissue
      samples are difficult to obtain and cannot be used for dynamic monitoring of
      disease progression and response to therapy. We exploited circulating tumor DNA
      (ctDNA) to genotype colorectal tumors and track clonal evolution during treatment
      with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific antibodies cetuximab or
      panitumumab. We identified alterations in ctDNA of patients with primary or
      acquired resistance to EGFR blockade in the following genes: KRAS, NRAS, MET,
      ERBB2, FLT3, EGFR and MAP2K1. Mutated KRAS clones, which emerge in blood during
      EGFR blockade, decline upon withdrawal of EGFR-specific antibodies, indicating
      that clonal evolution continues beyond clinical progression. Pharmacogenomic
      analysis of CRC cells that had acquired resistance to cetuximab reveals that upon
      antibody withdrawal KRAS clones decay, whereas the population regains drug
      sensitivity. ctDNA profiles of individuals who benefit from multiple challenges
      with anti-EGFR antibodies exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS. These results 
      indicate that the CRC genome adapts dynamically to intermittent drug schedules
      and provide a molecular explanation for the efficacy of rechallenge therapies
      based on EGFR blockade.

TI  - Epigenetic activation of a cryptic TBC1D16 transcript enhances melanoma
      progression by targeting EGFR.
PG  - 741-50
LID - 10.1038/nm.3863 [doi]
AB  - Metastasis is responsible for most cancer-related deaths, and, among common tumor
      types, melanoma is one with great potential to metastasize. Here we study the
      contribution of epigenetic changes to the dissemination process by analyzing the 
      changes that occur at the DNA methylation level between primary cancer cells and 
      metastases. We found a hypomethylation event that reactivates a cryptic
      transcript of the Rab GTPase activating protein TBC1D16 (TBC1D16-47 kDa; referred
      to hereafter as TBC1D16-47KD) to be a characteristic feature of the metastatic
      cascade. This short isoform of TBC1D16 exacerbates melanoma growth and metastasis
      both in vitro and in vivo. By combining immunoprecipitation and mass
      spectrometry, we identified RAB5C as a new TBC1D16 target and showed that it
      regulates EGFR in melanoma cells. We also found that epigenetic reactivation of
      TBC1D16-47KD is associated with poor clinical outcome in melanoma, while
      conferring greater sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

TI  - Metabolic control of type 1 regulatory T cell differentiation by AHR and
      HIF1-alpha.
PG  - 638-46
LID - 10.1038/nm.3868 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of the pathways that regulate lymphocyte metabolism, as well as
      the effects of metabolism and its products on the immune response, is still
      limited. We report that a metabolic program controlled by the transcription
      factors hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1-alpha) and aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor (AHR) supports the differentiation of type 1 regulatory T cell (Tr1)
      cells. HIF1-alpha controls the early metabolic reprograming of Tr1 cells. At
      later time points, AHR promotes HIF1-alpha degradation and takes control of Tr1
      cell metabolism. Extracellular ATP (eATP) and hypoxia, linked to inflammation,
      trigger AHR inactivation by HIF1-alpha and inhibit Tr1 cell differentiation.
      Conversely, CD39 promotes Tr1 cell differentiation by depleting eATP. CD39 also
      contributes to Tr1 suppressive activity by generating adenosine in cooperation
      with CD73 expressed by responder T cells and antigen-presenting cells. These
      results suggest that HIF1-alpha and AHR integrate immunological, metabolic and
      environmental signals to regulate the immune response.

      myeloma cells.
PG  - 572-80
LID - 10.1038/nm.3867 [doi]
AB  - B cell malignancies frequently colonize the bone marrow. The mechanisms
      responsible for this preferential homing are incompletely understood. Here we
      studied multiple myeloma (MM) as a model of a terminally differentiated B cell
      malignancy that selectively colonizes the bone marrow. We found that
      extracellular CyPA (eCyPA), secreted by bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs),
      promoted the colonization and proliferation of MM cells in an in vivo scaffold
      system via binding to its receptor, CD147, on MM cells. The expression and
      secretion of eCyPA by BMECs was enhanced by BCL9, a Wnt-beta-catenin
      transcriptional coactivator that is selectively expressed by these cells. eCyPA
      levels were higher in bone marrow serum than in peripheral blood in individuals
      with MM, and eCyPA-CD147 blockade suppressed MM colonization and tumor growth in 
      the in vivo scaffold system. eCyPA also promoted the migration of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma cells, two other B cell
      malignancies that colonize the bone marrow and express CD147. These findings
      suggest that eCyPA-CD147 signaling promotes the bone marrow homing of B cell
      malignancies and offer a compelling rationale for exploring this axis as a
      therapeutic target for these malignancies.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cell death is a hallmark of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D)
      diabetes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this aspect of diabetic
      pathology are poorly understood. Here we report that expression of the microRNA
      (miR)-200 family is strongly induced in islets of diabetic mice and that beta
      cell-specific overexpression of miR-200 in mice is sufficient to induce beta cell
      apoptosis and lethal T2D. Conversely, mir-200 ablation in mice reduces beta cell 
      apoptosis and ameliorates T2D. We show that miR-200 negatively regulates a
      conserved anti-apoptotic and stress-resistance network that includes the
      essential beta cell chaperone Dnajc3 (also known as p58IPK) and the caspase
      inhibitor Xiap. We also observed that mir-200 dosage positively controls
      activation of the tumor suppressor Trp53 and thereby creates a pro-apoptotic
      gene-expression signature found in islets of diabetic mice. Consequently,
      miR-200-induced T2D is suppressed by interfering with the signaling of Trp53 and 
      Bax, a proapoptotic member of the B cell lymphoma 2 protein family. Our results
      reveal a crucial role for the miR-200 family in beta cell survival and the
      pathophysiology of diabetes.

TI  - KLF4-dependent phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells has a key role in
      atherosclerotic plaque pathogenesis.
PG  - 628-37
LID - 10.1038/nm.3866 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies investigating the role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and
      macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have provided controversial
      results owing to the use of unreliable methods for clearly identifying each of
      these cell types. Here, using Myh11-CreER(T2) ROSA floxed STOP eYFP Apoe(-/-)
      mice to perform SMC lineage tracing, we find that traditional methods for
      detecting SMCs based on immunostaining for SMC markers fail to detect >80% of
      SMC-derived cells within advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These unidentified
      SMC-derived cells exhibit phenotypes of other cell lineages, including
      macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). SMC-specific conditional knockout 
      of Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) resulted in reduced numbers of SMC-derived MSC-
      and macrophage-like cells, a marked reduction in lesion size, and increases in
      multiple indices of plaque stability, including an increase in fibrous cap
      thickness as compared to wild-type controls. On the basis of in vivo KLF4
      chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses and studies of
      cholesterol-treated cultured SMCs, we identified >800 KLF4 target genes,
      including many that regulate pro-inflammatory responses of SMCs. Our findings
      indicate that the contribution of SMCs to atherosclerotic plaques has been
      greatly underestimated, and that KLF4-dependent transitions in SMC phenotype are 
      critical in lesion pathogenesis.

TI  - Metabolic regulation of hepatitis B immunopathology by myeloid-derived suppressor
      cells.
PG  - 591-600
LID - 10.1038/nm.3856 [doi]
AB  - Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in disparate degrees of tissue
      injury: the virus can either replicate without pathological consequences or
      trigger immune-mediated necroinflammatory liver damage. We investigated the
      potential for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to suppress T
      cell-mediated immunopathology in this setting. Granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs)
      expanded transiently in acute resolving HBV, decreasing in frequency prior to
      peak hepatic injury. In persistent infection, arginase-expressing gMDSCs (and
      circulating arginase) increased most in disease phases characterized by HBV
      replication without immunopathology, whilst L-arginine decreased. gMDSCs
      expressed liver-homing chemokine receptors and accumulated in the liver, their
      expansion supported by hepatic stellate cells. We provide in vitro and ex vivo
      evidence that gMDSCs potently inhibited T cells in a partially arginase-dependent
      manner. L-arginine-deprived T cells upregulated system L amino acid transporters 
      to increase uptake of essential nutrients and attempt metabolic reprogramming.
      These data demonstrate the capacity of expanded arginase-expressing gMDSCs to
      regulate liver immunopathology in HBV infection.

TI  - Common clonal origin of central and resident memory T cells following skin
      immunization.
PG  - 647-53

AB  - Central memory T (TCM) cells in lymph nodes (LNs) and resident memory T (TRM)
      cells in peripheral tissues have distinct roles in protective immunity. Both are 
      generated after primary infections, but their clonal origins have been unclear.
      To address this question, we immunized mice through the skin with a protein
      antigen, a chemical hapten, or a non-replicating poxvirus. We then analyzed
      antigen-activated T cells from different tissues using high-throughput sequencing
      (HTS) of the gene encoding the T cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain (Trb, also known 
      as Tcrb) using CDR3 sequences to simultaneously track thousands of unique T
      cells. For every abundant TRM cell clone generated in the skin, an abundant TCM
      cell clone bearing the identical TCR was present in the LNs. Thus,
      antigen-reactive skin TRM and LN TCM cell clones were derived from a common naive
      T cell precursor after skin immunization, generating overlapping TCR repertoires.
      Although they bore the same TCR, TRM cells mediated rapid contact
      hypersensitivity responses, whereas TCM cells mediated delayed and attenuated
      responses. Studies in human subjects confirmed the generation of skin TRM cells
      in allergic contact dermatitis. Thus, immunization through skin simultaneously
      generates skin TRM and LN TCM cells in similar numbers from the same naive T
      cells.

TI  - Pharmacological targeting of actin-dependent dynamin oligomerization ameliorates 
      chronic kidney disease in diverse animal models.
PG  - 601-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3843 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes represents a common pathway 
      in the pathogenesis of proteinuria across a spectrum of chronic kidney diseases
      (CKD). The GTPase dynamin has been implicated in the maintenance of cellular
      architecture in podocytes through its direct interaction with actin. Furthermore,
      the propensity of dynamin to oligomerize into higher-order structures in an
      actin-dependent manner and to cross-link actin microfilaments into higher-order
      structures has been correlated with increased actin polymerization and global
      organization of the actin cytoskeleton in the cell. We found that use of the
      small molecule Bis-T-23, which promotes actin-dependent dynamin oligomerization
      and thus increased actin polymerization in injured podocytes, was sufficient to
      improve renal health in diverse models of both transient kidney disease and CKD. 
      In particular, administration of Bis-T-23 in these renal disease models restored 
      the normal ultrastructure of podocyte foot processes, lowered proteinuria,
      lowered collagen IV deposits in the mesangial matrix, diminished mesangial matrix
      expansion and extended lifespan. These results further establish that alterations
      in the actin cytoskeleton of kidney podocytes is a common hallmark of CKD, while 
      also underscoring the substantial regenerative potential of injured glomeruli and
      identifying the oligomerization cycle of dynamin as an attractive potential
      therapeutic target to treat CKD.

PG  - 563-71
LID - 10.1038/nm.3840 [doi]
AB  - Relapse is the leading cause of mortality in children with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL). Among chemotherapeutics, thiopurines are key drugs in ALL
      combination therapy. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified relapse-specific
      mutations in the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS1), which
      encodes a rate-limiting purine biosynthesis enzyme, in 24/358 (6.7%) relapsed
      childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL) cases. All individuals who harbored PRPS1 mutations 
      relapsed early during treatment, and mutated ALL clones expanded exponentially
      before clinical relapse. Our functional analyses of PRPS1 mutants uncovered a new
      chemotherapy-resistance mechanism involving reduced feedback inhibition of de
      novo purine biosynthesis and competitive inhibition of thiopurine activation.
      Notably, the de novo purine synthesis inhibitor lometrexol effectively abrogated 
      PRPS1 mutant-driven drug resistance. These results highlight the importance of
      constitutive activation of the de novo purine synthesis pathway in thiopurine
      resistance, and they offer therapeutic strategies for the treatment of relapsed
      and thiopurine-resistant ALL.

TI  - Irf5 deficiency in macrophages promotes beneficial adipose tissue expansion and
      insulin sensitivity during obesity.
PG  - 610-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3829 [doi]
AB  - Accumulation of visceral adipose tissue correlates with elevated inflammation and
      increased risk of metabolic diseases. However, little is known about the
      molecular mechanisms that control its pathological expansion. Transcription
      factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) has been implicated in polarizing
      macrophages towards an inflammatory phenotype. Here we demonstrate that mice
      lacking Irf5, when placed on a high-fat diet, show no difference in the growth of
      their epididymal white adipose tissue (epiWAT) but they show expansion of their
      subcutaneous white adipose tissue, as compared to wild-type (WT) mice on the same
      diet. EpiWAT from Irf5-deficient mice is marked by accumulation of alternatively 
      activated macrophages, higher collagen deposition that restricts adipocyte size, 
      and enhanced insulin sensitivity compared to epiWAT from WT mice. In obese
      individuals, IRF5 expression is negatively associated with insulin sensitivity
      and collagen deposition in visceral adipose tissue. Genome-wide analysis of gene 
      expression in adipose tissue macrophages highlights the transforming growth
      factor beta1 (TGFB1) gene itself as a direct target of IRF5-mediated inhibition. 
      This study uncovers a new function for IRF5 in controlling the relative mass of
      different adipose tissue depots and thus insulin sensitivity in obesity, and it
      suggests that inhibition of IRF5 may promote a healthy metabolic state during
      this condition.

TI  - 4-1BB costimulation ameliorates T cell exhaustion induced by tonic signaling of
      chimeric antigen receptors.
PG  - 581-90
LID - 10.1038/nm.3838 [doi]
AB  - Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 have mediated dramatic antitumor
      responses in hematologic malignancies, but tumor regression has rarely occurred
      using CARs targeting other antigens. It remains unknown whether the impressive
      effects of CD19 CARs relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies
      to CAR therapies, or superior functionality of the CD19 CAR itself. We show that 
      tonic CAR CD3-zeta phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering
      of CAR single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of CAR T
      cells that limits antitumor efficacy. Such activation is present to varying
      degrees in all CARs studied, except the highly effective CD19 CAR. We further
      determine that CD28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1BB costimulation reduces, 
      exhaustion induced by persistent CAR signaling. Our results provide biological
      explanations for the antitumor effects of CD19 CARs and for the observations that
      CD19 CAR T cells incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory domain are more persistent
      than those incorporating CD28 in clinical trials.

AB  - Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal childhood cancer. We performed
      a chemical screen in patient-derived DIPG cultures along with RNA-seq analyses
      and integrated computational modeling to identify potentially effective
      therapeutic strategies. The multi-histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat
      demonstrated therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in DIPG orthotopic xenograft 
      models. Combination testing of panobinostat and the histone demethylase inhibitor
      GSK-J4 revealed that the two had synergistic effects. Together, these data
      suggest a promising therapeutic strategy for DIPG.

TI  - Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell
      lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M.
PG  - 560-2
LID - 10.1038/nm.3854 [doi]
AB  - Here we studied cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) collected from subjects with
      advanced lung cancer whose tumors had developed resistance to the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD9291. We first
      performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an
      acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in 
      a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital
      PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All
      were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing
      AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S
      mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S 
      mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the
      underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the
      diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and
      highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by
      the EGFR C797S mutation.

TI  - Translational value of mouse models in oncology drug development.
PG  - 431-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3853 [doi]
AB  - Much has been written about the advantages and disadvantages of various oncology 
      model systems, with the overall finding that these models lack the predictive
      power required to translate preclinical efficacy into clinical activity. Despite 
      assertions that some preclinical model systems are superior to others, no single 
      model can suffice to inform preclinical target validation and molecule selection.
      This perspective provides a balanced albeit critical view of these claims of
      superiority and outlines a framework for the proper use of existing preclinical
      models for drug testing and discovery. We also highlight gaps in oncology mouse
      models and discuss general and pervasive model-independent shortcomings in
      preclinical oncology work, and we propose ways to address these issues.

PG  - 476-82
LID - 10.1038/nm.3851 [doi]
AB  - Patients with retinal degeneration lose sight due to the gradual demise of
      photoreceptors. Electrical stimulation of surviving retinal neurons provides an
      alternative route for the delivery of visual information. We demonstrate that
      subretinal implants with 70-mum-wide photovoltaic pixels provide highly localized
      stimulation of retinal neurons in rats. The electrical receptive fields recorded 
      in retinal ganglion cells were similar in size to the natural visual receptive
      fields. Similarly to normal vision, the retinal response to prosthetic
      stimulation exhibited flicker fusion at high frequencies, adaptation to static
      images and nonlinear spatial summation. In rats with retinal degeneration, these 
      photovoltaic arrays elicited retinal responses with a spatial resolution of 64
      +/- 11 mum, corresponding to half of the normal visual acuity in healthy rats.
      The ease of implantation of these wireless and modular arrays, combined with
      their high resolution, opens the door to the functional restoration of sight in
      patients blinded by retinal degeneration.

TI  - The serine protease inhibitor SerpinA3N attenuates neuropathic pain by inhibiting
      T cell-derived leukocyte elastase.
PG  - 518-23
LID - 10.1038/nm.3852 [doi]
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a major, intractable clinical problem and its pathophysiology
      is not well understood. Although recent gene expression profiling studies have
      enabled the identification of novel targets for pain therapy, classical study
      designs provide unclear results owing to the differential expression of hundreds 
      of genes across sham and nerve-injured groups, which can be difficult to
      validate, particularly with respect to the specificity of pain modulation. To
      circumvent this, we used two outbred lines of rats, which are genetically similar
      except for being genetically segregated as a result of selective breeding for
      differences in neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. SerpinA3N, a serine protease
      inhibitor, was upregulated in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after nerve injury,
      which was further validated for its mouse homolog. Mice lacking SerpinA3N
      developed more neuropathic mechanical allodynia than wild-type (WT) mice, and
      exogenous delivery of SerpinA3N attenuated mechanical allodynia in WT mice. T
      lymphocytes infiltrate the DRG after nerve injury and release leukocyte elastase 
      (LE), which was inhibited by SerpinA3N derived from DRG neurons. Genetic loss of 
      LE or exogenous application of a LE inhibitor (Sivelastat) in WT mice attenuated 
      neuropathic mechanical allodynia. Overall, we reveal a novel and clinically
      relevant role for a member of the serpin superfamily and a leukocyte elastase and
      crosstalk between neurons and T cells in the modulation of neuropathic pain.

TI  - Inhibition of the glucose transporter SGLT2 with dapagliflozin in pancreatic
      alpha cells triggers glucagon secretion.
PG  - 512-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3828 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from a 
      deficiency in insulin signaling, because of insulin resistance and/or defects in 
      insulin secretion; it is also associated with increases in glucagon and
      endogenous glucose production (EGP). Gliflozins, including dapagliflozin, are a
      new class of approved oral antidiabetic agents that specifically inhibit
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) function in the kidney, thus preventing
      renal glucose reabsorption and increasing glycosuria in diabetic individuals
      while reducing hyperglycemia. However, gliflozin treatment in subjects with T2D
      increases both plasma glucagon and EGP by unknown mechanisms. In spite of the
      rise in EGP, T2D patients treated with gliflozin have lower blood glucose levels 
      than those receiving placebo, possibly because of increased glycosuria; however, 
      the resulting increase in plasma glucagon levels represents a possible concerning
      side effect, especially in a patient population already affected by
      hyperglucagonemia. Here we demonstrate that SGLT2 is expressed in
      glucagon-secreting alpha cells of the pancreatic islets. We further found that
      expression of SLC5A2 (which encodes SGLT2) was lower and glucagon (GCG) gene
      expression was higher in islets from T2D individuals and in normal islets exposed
      to chronic hyperglycemia than in islets from non-diabetics. Moreover, hepatocyte 
      nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) is specifically expressed in human alpha cells, in
      which it controls SLC5A2 expression, and its expression is downregulated by
      hyperglycemia. In addition, inhibition of either SLC5A2 via siRNA-induced gene
      silencing or SGLT2 via dapagliflozin treatment in human islets triggered glucagon
      secretion through KATP channel activation. Finally, we found that dapagliflozin
      treatment further promotes glucagon secretion and hepatic gluconeogenesis in
      healthy mice, thereby limiting the decrease of plasma glucose induced by fasting.
      Collectively, these results identify a heretofore unknown role of SGLT2 and
      designate dapagliflozin an alpha cell secretagogue.

TI  - Molecular analysis of gastric cancer identifies subtypes associated with distinct
      clinical outcomes.
PG  - 449-56
LID - 10.1038/nm.3850 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, is a heterogeneous
      disease. We aim to establish clinically relevant molecular subtypes that would
      encompass this heterogeneity and provide useful clinical information. We use gene
      expression data to describe four molecular subtypes linked to distinct patterns
      of molecular alterations, disease progression and prognosis. The mesenchymal-like
      type includes diffuse-subtype tumors with the worst prognosis, the tendency to
      occur at an earlier age and the highest recurrence frequency (63%) of the four
      subtypes. Microsatellite-unstable tumors are hyper-mutated intestinal-subtype
      tumors occurring in the antrum; these have the best overall prognosis and the
      lowest frequency of recurrence (22%) of the four subtypes. The tumor protein 53
      (TP53)-active and TP53-inactive types include patients with intermediate
      prognosis and recurrence rates (with respect to the other two subtypes), with the
      TP53-active group showing better prognosis. We describe key molecular alterations
      in each of the four subtypes using targeted sequencing and genome-wide copy
      number microarrays. We validate these subtypes in independent cohorts in order to
      provide a consistent and unified framework for further clinical and preclinical
      translational research.

TI  - Homeostatic regulation of T cell trafficking by a B cell-derived peptide is
      impaired in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease.
PG  - 467-475
LID - 10.1038/nm.3842 [doi]
AB  - During an inflammatory response, lymphocyte recruitment into tissue must be
      tightly controlled because dysregulated trafficking contributes to the
      pathogenesis of chronic disease. Here we show that during inflammation and in
      response to adiponectin, B cells tonically inhibit T cell trafficking by
      secreting a peptide (PEPITEM) proteolytically derived from 14.3.3 zeta delta
      (14.3.3.zetadelta) protein. PEPITEM binds cadherin-15 on endothelial cells,
      promoting synthesis and release of sphingosine-1 phosphate, which inhibits
      trafficking of T cells without affecting recruitment of other leukocytes.
      Expression of adiponectin receptors on B cells and adiponectin-induced PEPITEM
      secretion wanes with age, implying immune senescence of the pathway.
      Additionally, these changes are evident in individuals with type 1 diabetes or
      rheumatoid arthritis, and circulating PEPITEM in patient serum is reduced
      compared to that of healthy age-matched donors. In both diseases, tonic
      inhibition of T cell trafficking across inflamed endothelium is lost. Control of 
      patient T cell trafficking is re-established by treatment with exogenous PEPITEM.
      Moreover, in animal models of peritonitis, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury,
      Salmonella infection, uveitis and Sjogren's syndrome, PEPITEM reduced T cell
      recruitment into inflamed tissues.

TI  - Slit2 signaling through Robo1 and Robo2 is required for retinal
      neovascularization.
PG  - 483-91
LID - 10.1038/nm.3849 [doi]
AB  - Ocular neovascular diseases are a leading cause of blindness. Vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade improves vision, but not all
      individuals respond to anti-VEGF treatment, making additional means to prevent
      neovascularization necessary. Slit-family proteins (Slits) are ligands of
      Roundabout (Robo) receptors that repel developing axons in the nervous system.
      Robo1 expression is altered in ocular neovascular diseases, and previous in vitro
      studies have reported both pro- and anti-angiogenic effects of Slits. However,
      genetic evidence supporting a role for Slits in ocular neovascularization is
      lacking. Here we generated conditional knockout mice deficient in various Slit
      and Robo proteins and found that Slit2 potently and selectively promoted
      angiogenesis via Robo1 and Robo2 in mouse postnatal retina and in a model of
      ocular neovascular disease. Mechanistically, Slit2 acting through Robo1 and Robo2
      promoted the migration of endothelial cells. These receptors are required for
      both Slit2- and VEGF-induced Rac1 activation and lamellipodia formation. Thus,
      Slit2 blockade could potentially be used therapeutically to inhibit angiogenesis 
      in individuals with ocular neovascular disease.

TI  - Reciprocal cellular cross-talk within the tumor microenvironment promotes
      oncolytic virus activity.
PG  - 530-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3848 [doi]
AB  - Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of networks of interacting 'normal' and
      malignant cells. It is well recognized that cytokine-mediated cross-talk between 
      normal stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular
      endothelial cells, immune cells, and cancer cells, influences all aspects of
      tumor biology. Here we demonstrate that the cross-talk between CAFs and cancer
      cells leads to enhanced growth of oncolytic virus (OV)-based therapeutics.
      Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) produced by tumor cells reprogrammed
      CAFs, dampened their steady-state level of antiviral transcripts and rendered
      them sensitive to virus infection. In turn, CAFs produced high levels of
      fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), initiating a signaling cascade in cancer cells
      that reduced retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) expression and impeded the
      ability of malignant cells to detect and respond to virus. In xenografts derived 
      from individuals with pancreatic cancer, the expression of FGF2 correlated with
      the susceptibility of the cancer cells to OV infection, and local application of 
      FGF2 to resistant tumor samples sensitized them to virotherapy both in vitro and 
      in vivo. An OV engineered to express FGF2 was safe in tumor-bearing mice, showed 
      improved therapeutic efficacy compared to parental virus and merits consideration
      for clinical testing.

TI  - Active Pin1 is a key target of all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic
      leukemia and breast cancer.
PG  - 457-66
LID - 10.1038/nm.3839 [doi]
AB  - A common key regulator of oncogenic signaling pathways in multiple tumor types is
      the unique isomerase Pin1. However, available Pin1 inhibitors lack the required
      specificity and potency for inhibiting Pin1 function in vivo. By using
      mechanism-based screening, here we find that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)--a
      therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that is considered the first
      example of targeted therapy in cancer, but whose drug target remains
      elusive--inhibits and degrades active Pin1 selectively in cancer cells by
      directly binding to the substrate phosphate- and proline-binding pockets in the
      Pin1 active site. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation degrades the protein encoded by the 
      fusion oncogene PML-RARA and treats APL in APL cell and animal models as well as 
      in human patients. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation also potently inhibits
      triple-negative breast cancer cell growth in human cells and in animal models by 
      acting on many Pin1 substrate oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Thus, ATRA
      simultaneously blocks multiple Pin1-regulated cancer-driving pathways, an
      attractive property for treating aggressive and drug-resistant tumors.

TI  - Heparanase promotes tumor infiltration and antitumor activity of CAR-redirected T
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 524-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3833 [doi]
AB  - Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T lymphocytes
      (CAR-T cells) has had less striking therapeutic effects in solid tumors than in
      lymphoid malignancies. Although active tumor-mediated immunosuppression may have 
      a role in limiting the efficacy of CAR-T cells, functional changes in T
      lymphocytes after their ex vivo manipulation may also account for the reduced
      ability of cultured CAR-T cells to penetrate stroma-rich solid tumors compared
      with lymphoid tissues. We therefore studied the capacity of human in
      vitro-cultured CAR-T cells to degrade components of the extracellular matrix
      (ECM). In contrast to freshly isolated T lymphocytes, we found that in
      vitro-cultured T lymphocytes lack expression of the enzyme heparanase (HPSE),
      which degrades heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the main components of ECM. We
      found that HPSE mRNA is downregulated in in vitro-expanded T cells, which may be 
      a consequence of p53 (officially known as TP53, encoding tumor protein 53)
      binding to the HPSE gene promoter. We therefore engineered CAR-T cells to express
      HPSE and showed their improved capacity to degrade the ECM, which promoted tumor 
      T cell infiltration and antitumor activity. The use of this strategy may enhance 
      the activity of CAR-T cells in individuals with stroma-rich solid tumors.

TI  - Metformin activates a duodenal Ampk-dependent pathway to lower hepatic glucose
      production in rats.
PG  - 506-11
LID - 10.1038/nm.3787 [doi]
AB  - Metformin is a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes, even though its underlying mechanisms of action are relatively unclear.
      Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic glucose production
      (HGP), an effect originally postulated to be due to a hepatic AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. However, studies have questioned the
      contribution of hepatic AMPK to the effects of metformin on lowering
      hyperglycemia, and a gut-brain-liver axis that mediates intestinal nutrient- and 
      hormone-induced lowering of HGP has been identified. Thus, it is possible that
      metformin affects HGP through this inter-organ crosstalk. Here we show that
      intraduodenal infusion of metformin for 50 min activated duodenal mucosal Ampk
      and lowered HGP in a rat 3 d high fat diet (HFD)-induced model of insulin
      resistance. Inhibition of duodenal Ampk negated the HGP-lowering effect of
      intraduodenal metformin, and both duodenal glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
      (Glp-1r)-protein kinase A (Pka) signaling and a neuronal-mediated gut-brain-liver
      pathway were required for metformin to lower HGP. Preabsorptive metformin also
      lowered HGP in rat models of 28 d HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance and 
      nicotinamide (NA)-streptozotocin (STZ)-HFD-induced type 2 diabetes. In an
      unclamped setting, inhibition of duodenal Ampk reduced the glucose-lowering
      effects of a bolus metformin treatment in rat models of diabetes. These findings 
      show that, in rat models of both obesity and diabetes, metformin activates a
      previously unappreciated duodenal Ampk-dependent pathway to lower HGP and plasma 
      glucose levels.

TI  - An RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin to rebalance the coagulation system
      and promote hemostasis in hemophilia.
PG  - 492-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3847 [doi]
AB  - Hemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders characterized by deficiencies
      in procoagulant factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. There
      remains a substantial unmet medical need in hemophilia, especially in patients
      with inhibitory antibodies against replacement factor therapy, for novel and
      improved therapeutic agents that can be used prophylactically to provide
      effective hemostasis. Guided by reports suggesting that co-inheritance of
      prothrombotic mutations may ameliorate the clinical phenotype in hemophilia, we
      developed an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic (ALN-AT3) targeting antithrombin
      (AT) as a means to promote hemostasis in hemophilia. When administered
      subcutaneously, ALN-AT3 showed potent, dose-dependent, and durable reduction of
      AT levels in wild-type mice, mice with hemophilia A, and nonhuman primates
      (NHPs). In NHPs, a 50% reduction in AT levels was achieved with weekly dosing at 
      approximately 0.125 mg/kg, and a near-complete reduction in AT levels was
      achieved with weekly dosing at 1.5 mg/kg. Treatment with ALN-AT3 promoted
      hemostasis in mouse models of hemophilia and led to improved thrombin generation 
      in an NHP model of hemophilia A with anti-factor VIII inhibitors. This
      investigational compound is currently in phase 1 clinical testing in subjects
      with hemophilia A or B.

TI  - Resveratrol activates duodenal Sirt1 to reverse insulin resistance in rats
      through a neuronal network.
PG  - 498-505
LID - 10.1038/nm.3821 [doi]
AB  - Resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity and lowers hepatic glucose production
      (HGP) in rat models of obesity and diabetes, but the underlying mechanisms for
      these antidiabetic effects remain elusive. One process that is considered a key
      feature of resveratrol action is the activation of the nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in various tissues.
      However, the low bioavailability of resveratrol raises questions about whether
      the antidiabetic effects of oral resveratrol can act directly on these tissues.
      We show here that acute intraduodenal infusion of resveratrol reversed a 3 d high
      fat diet (HFD)-induced reduction in duodenal-mucosal Sirt1 protein levels while
      also enhancing insulin sensitivity and lowering HGP. Further, we found that
      duodenum-specific knockdown of Sirt1 expression for 14 d was sufficient to induce
      hepatic insulin resistance in rats fed normal chow. We also found that the
      glucoregulatory role of duodenally acting resveratrol required activation of
      Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) in this tissue to initiate a
      gut-brain-liver neuronal axis that improved hypothalamic insulin sensitivity and 
      in turn, reduced HGP. In addition to the effects of duodenally acting resveratrol
      in an acute 3 d HFD-fed model of insulin resistance, we also found that
      short-term infusion of resveratrol into the duodenum lowered HGP in two other rat
      models of insulin resistance--a 28 d HFD-induced model of obesity and a
      nicotinamide (NA)-streptozotocin (STZ)-HFD-induced model of mild type 2 diabetes.
      Together, these studies highlight the therapeutic relevance of targeting duodenal
      SIRT1 to reverse insulin resistance and improve glucose homeostasis in obesity
      and diabetes.

      barcoding.
PG  - 440-8

AB  - Resistance to cancer therapies presents a significant clinical challenge. Recent 
      studies have revealed intratumoral heterogeneity as a source of therapeutic
      resistance. However, it is unclear whether resistance is driven predominantly by 
      pre-existing or de novo alterations, in part because of the resolution limits of 
      next-generation sequencing. To address this, we developed a high-complexity
      barcode library, ClonTracer, which enables the high-resolution tracking of more
      than 1 million cancer cells under drug treatment. In two clinically relevant
      models, ClonTracer studies showed that the majority of resistant clones were part
      of small, pre-existing subpopulations that selectively escaped under therapeutic 
      challenge. Moreover, the ClonTracer approach enabled quantitative assessment of
      the ability of combination treatments to suppress resistant clones. These
      findings suggest that resistant clones are present before treatment, which would 
      make up-front therapeutic combinations that target non-overlapping resistance a
      preferred approach. Thus, ClonTracer barcoding may be a valuable tool for
      optimizing therapeutic regimens with the goal of curative combination therapies
      for cancer.

TI  - Targeting the MLL complex in castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 344-52
LID - 10.1038/nm.3830 [doi]
AB  - Resistance to androgen deprivation therapies and increased androgen receptor (AR)
      activity are major drivers of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
      Although prior work has focused on targeting AR directly, co-activators of AR
      signaling, which may represent new therapeutic targets, are relatively
      underexplored. Here we demonstrate that the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) 
      complex, a well-known driver of MLL fusion-positive leukemia, acts as a
      co-activator of AR signaling. AR directly interacts with the MLL complex via the 
      menin-MLL subunit. Menin expression is higher in CRPC than in both hormone-naive 
      prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue, and high menin expression correlates 
      with poor overall survival of individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer.
      Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of menin-MLL interaction blocks AR
      signaling and inhibits the growth of castration-resistant tumors in vivo in mice.
      Taken together, this work identifies the MLL complex as a crucial co-activator of
      AR and a potential therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.

TI  - DOT1L inhibits SIRT1-mediated epigenetic silencing to maintain leukemic gene
      expression in MLL-rearranged leukemia.
PG  - 335-43
LID - 10.1038/nm.3832 [doi]
AB  - Rearrangements of MLL (encoding lysine-specific methyltransferase 2A and
      officially known as KMT2A; herein referred to as MLL to denote the gene
      associated with mixed-lineage leukemia) generate MLL fusion proteins that bind
      DNA and drive leukemogenic gene expression. This gene expression program is
      dependent on the disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like histone 3 lysine 79
      (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L, and small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors show promise
      as therapeutics for these leukemias. However, the mechanisms underlying this
      dependency are unclear. We conducted a genome-scale RNAi screen and found that
      the histone deacetylase SIRT1 is required for the establishment of a
      heterochromatin-like state around MLL fusion target genes after DOT1L inhibition.
      DOT1L inhibits chromatin localization of a repressive complex composed of SIRT1
      and the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1, thereby maintaining an open chromatin
      state with elevated H3K9 acetylation and minimal H3K9 methylation at MLL fusion
      target genes. Furthermore, the combination of SIRT1 activators and DOT1L
      inhibitors shows enhanced antiproliferative activity against MLL-rearranged
      leukemia cells. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between
      chromatin regulators controlling the activation and repression of gene expression
      could provide novel opportunities for combination therapy.

TI  - Prostaglandin E2 and programmed cell death 1 signaling coordinately impair CTL
      function and survival during chronic viral infection.
PG  - 327-34
LID - 10.1038/nm.3831 [doi]
AB  - More than 10% of the world's population is chronically infected with HIV,
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), all of which can cause severe
      disease and death. These viruses persist in part because continuous antigenic
      stimulation causes the deterioration of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      (CTL) function and survival. Additionally, antiviral CTLs autonomously suppress
      their responses to limit immunopathology by upregulating inhibitory receptors
      such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). Identification and blockade of the
      pathways that induce CTL dysfunction may facilitate the clearance of chronic
      viral infections. We found that the prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) receptors EP2 and
      EP4 were upregulated on virus-specific CTLs during chronic lymphocytic
      choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and suppressed CTL survival and function.
      We show that the combined blockade of PGE(2) and PD-1 signaling was therapeutic
      in terms of improving viral control and augmenting the numbers of functional
      virus-specific CTLs. Thus, PGE(2) inhibition is both an independent candidate
      therapeutic target and a promising adjunct therapy to PD-1 blockade for the
      treatment of HIV and other chronic viral infections.

TI  - Brain somatic mutations in MTOR cause focal cortical dysplasia type II leading to
      intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a sporadic developmental malformation
      of the cerebral cortex characterized by dysmorphic neurons, dyslamination and
      medically refractory epilepsy. It has been hypothesized that FCD is caused by
      somatic mutations in affected regions. Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing 
      (read depth, 412-668x) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing
      (100-347,499x) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and
      uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin
      (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene
      in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon
      sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in
      multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted
      for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations
      induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant
      MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal
      migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of
      mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This
      study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic
      activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target 
      for intractable epilepsy in FCD.

TI  - Activation of AMPKalpha2 in adipocytes is essential for nicotine-induced insulin 
      resistance in vivo.
PG  - 373-82
LID - 10.1038/nm.3826 [doi]
AB  - Cigarette smoking promotes body weight reduction in humans while paradoxically
      also promoting insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinemia. However, the
      mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. Here we show that nicotine, a major 
      constituent of cigarette smoke, selectively activates AMP-activated protein
      kinase alpha2 (AMPKalpha2) in adipocytes, which in turn phosphorylates MAP kinase
      phosphatase-1 (MKP1) at serine 334, initiating its proteasome-dependent
      degradation. The nicotine-dependent reduction of MKP1 induces the aberrant
      activation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal
      kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1
      (IRS1) at serine 307. Phosphorylation of IRS1 leads to its degradation, protein
      kinase B inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis.
      Consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight
      reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty
      acids and thus causes IR in insulin-sensitive tissues. These results establish
      AMPKalpha2 as an essential mediator of nicotine-induced whole-body IR in spite of
      reductions in adiposity.

TI  - Characterization of pancreatic NMDA receptors as possible drug targets for
      diabetes treatment.
PG  - 363-72
LID - 10.1038/nm.3822 [doi]
AB  - In the nervous system, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) participate in neurotransmission
      and modulate the viability of neurons. In contrast, little is known about the
      role of NMDARs in pancreatic islets and the insulin-secreting beta cells whose
      functional impairment contributes to diabetes mellitus. Here we found that
      inhibition of NMDARs in mouse and human islets enhanced their glucose-stimulated 
      insulin secretion (GSIS) and survival of islet cells. Further, NMDAR inhibition
      prolonged the amount of time that glucose-stimulated beta cells spent in a
      depolarized state with high cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations. We also noticed
      that, in vivo, the NMDAR antagonist dextromethorphan (DXM) enhanced glucose
      tolerance in mice, and that in vitro dextrorphan, the main metabolite of DXM,
      amplified the stimulatory effect of exendin-4 on GSIS. In a mouse model of type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), long-term treatment with DXM improved islet insulin
      content, islet cell mass and blood glucose control. Further, in a small clinical 
      trial we found that individuals with T2DM treated with DXM showed enhanced serum 
      insulin concentrations and glucose tolerance. Our data highlight the possibility 
      that antagonists of NMDARs may provide a useful adjunct treatment for diabetes.

TI  - Reversing excitatory GABAAR signaling restores synaptic plasticity and memory in 
      a mouse model of Down syndrome.
PG  - 318-26
LID - 10.1038/nm.3827 [doi]
AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability,
      and altered GABAergic transmission through Cl(-)-permeable GABAA receptors
      (GABAARs) contributes considerably to learning and memory deficits in DS mouse
      models. However, the efficacy of GABAergic transmission has never been directly
      assessed in DS. Here GABAAR signaling was found to be excitatory rather than
      inhibitory, and the reversal potential for GABAAR-driven Cl(-) currents (ECl) was
      shifted toward more positive potentials in the hippocampi of adult DS mice.
      Accordingly, hippocampal expression of the cation Cl(-) cotransporter NKCC1 was
      increased in both trisomic mice and individuals with DS. Notably, NKCC1
      inhibition by the FDA-approved drug bumetanide restored ECl, synaptic plasticity 
      and hippocampus-dependent memory in adult DS mice. Our findings demonstrate that 
      GABA is excitatory in adult DS mice and identify a new therapeutic approach for
      the potential rescue of cognitive disabilities in individuals with DS.

TI  - Genetic and functional characterization of clonally derived adult human brown
      adipocytes.
PG  - 389-94
LID - 10.1038/nm.3819 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) acts in mammals as a natural defense system against
      hypothermia, and its activation to a state of increased energy expenditure is
      believed to protect against the development of obesity. Even though the existence
      of BAT in adult humans has been widely appreciated, its cellular origin and
      molecular identity remain elusive largely because of high cellular heterogeneity 
      within various adipose tissue depots. To understand the nature of adult human
      brown adipocytes at single cell resolution, we isolated clonally derived
      adipocytes from stromal vascular fractions of adult human BAT from two
      individuals and globally analyzed their molecular signatures. We used RNA
      sequencing followed by unbiased genome-wide expression analyses and found that a 
      population of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive human adipocytes possessed
      molecular signatures resembling those of a recruitable form of thermogenic
      adipocytes (that is, beige adipocytes). In addition, we identified molecular
      markers that were highly enriched in UCP1-positive human adipocytes, a set that
      included potassium channel K3 (KCNK3) and mitochondrial tumor suppressor 1
      (MTUS1). Further, we functionally characterized these two markers using a
      loss-of-function approach and found that KCNK3 and MTUS1 were required for beige 
      adipocyte differentiation and thermogenic function. The results of this study
      present new opportunities for human BAT research, such as facilitating cell-based
      disease modeling and unbiased screens for thermogenic regulators.

TI  - Myocardial healing requires Reg3beta-dependent accumulation of macrophages in the
      ischemic heart.
PG  - 353-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.3816 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac healing after myocardial ischemia depends on the recruitment and local
      expansion of myeloid cells, particularly macrophages. Here we identify Reg3beta
      as an essential regulator of macrophage trafficking to the damaged heart. Using
      mass spectrometry-based secretome analysis, we found that dedifferentiating
      cardiomyocytes release Reg3beta in response to the cytokine OSM, which signals
      through Jak1 and Stat3. Loss of Reg3beta led to a large decrease in the number of
      macrophages in the ischemic heart, accompanied by increased ventricular
      dilatation and insufficient removal of neutrophils. This defect in neutrophil
      removal in turn caused enhanced matrix degradation, delayed collagen deposition
      and increased susceptibility to cardiac rupture. Our data indicate that OSM,
      acting through distinct intracellular pathways, regulates both cardiomyocyte
      dedifferentiation and cardiomyocyte-dependent regulation of macrophage
      trafficking. Release of OSM from infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages
      initiates a positive feedback loop in which OSM-induced production of Reg3beta in
      cardiomyocytes attracts additional OSM-secreting macrophages. The activity of the
      feedback loop controls the degree of macrophage accumulation in the heart, which 
      is instrumental in myocardial healing.

TI  - RIFINs are adhesins implicated in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
PG  - 314-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3812 [doi]
AB  - Rosetting is a virulent Plasmodium falciparum phenomenon associated with severe
      malaria. Here we demonstrate that P. falciparum-encoded repetitive interspersed
      families of polypeptides (RIFINs) are expressed on the surface of infected red
      blood cells (iRBCs), where they bind to RBCs--preferentially of blood group A--to
      form large rosettes and mediate microvascular binding of iRBCs. We suggest that
      RIFINs have a fundamental role in the development of severe malaria and thereby
      contribute to the varying global distribution of ABO blood groups in the human
      population.

TI  - A high-throughput chemical screen reveals that harmine-mediated inhibition of
      DYRK1A increases human pancreatic beta cell replication.
PG  - 383-8

AB  - Types 1 and 2 diabetes affect some 380 million people worldwide. Both ultimately 
      result from a deficiency of functional pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells.
      Beta cells proliferate in humans during a brief temporal window beginning around 
      the time of birth, with a peak percentage ( approximately 2%) engaged in the cell
      cycle in the first year of life. In embryonic life and after early childhood,
      beta cell replication is barely detectable. Whereas beta cell expansion seems an 
      obvious therapeutic approach to beta cell deficiency, adult human beta cells have
      proven recalcitrant to such efforts. Hence, there remains an urgent need for
      antidiabetic therapeutic agents that can induce regeneration and expansion of
      adult human beta cells in vivo or ex vivo. Here, using a high-throughput
      small-molecule screen (HTS), we find that analogs of the small molecule harmine
      function as a new class of human beta cell mitogenic compounds. We also define
      dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a (DYRK1A) as the likely target of
      harmine and the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) family of
      transcription factors as likely mediators of human beta cell proliferation and
      differentiation. Using three different mouse and human islet in vivo-based
      models, we show that harmine is able to induce beta cell proliferation, increase 
      islet mass and improve glycemic control. These observations suggest that harmine 
      analogs may have unique therapeutic promise for human diabetes therapy. Enhancing
      the potency and beta cell specificity of these compounds are important future
      challenges.

TI  - A bacterial cyclic dinucleotide activates the cytosolic surveillance pathway and 
      mediates innate resistance to tuberculosis.
PG  - 401-6
LID - 10.1038/nm.3813 [doi]
AB  - Detection of cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), a bacterial second
      messenger, by the host cytoplasmic surveillance pathway (CSP) is known to elicit 
      type I interferon (IFN) responses, which are crucial to antimicrobial defense.
      However, the mechanisms and role of c-di-AMP signaling in Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis virulence remain unclear. Here we show that resistance to
      tuberculosis requires CSP-mediated detection of c-di-AMP produced by M.
      tuberculosis and that levels of c-di-AMP modulate the fate of infection. We found
      that a di-adenylate cyclase (disA or dacA)-overexpressing M. tuberculosis strain 
      that secretes excess c-di-AMP activates the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)
      pathway with enhanced levels of IFN-beta, elicits increased macrophage autophagy,
      and exhibits substantial virulence attenuation in mice. We show that
      c-di-AMP-mediated IFN-beta induction during M. tuberculosis infection requires
      stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-signaling. We observed that c-di-AMP
      induction of IFN-beta is independent of the cytosolic nucleic acid receptor
      cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), but cGAS nevertheless contributes
      substantially to the overall IFN-beta response to M. tuberculosis infection. In
      sum, our results reveal c-di-AMP to be a key mycobacterial pathogen-associated
      molecular pattern (PAMP) driving host type I IFN responses and autophagy. These
      findings suggest that modulating the levels of this small molecule may lead to
      novel immunotherapeutic strategies against tuberculosis.

TI  - Rapid mass spectrometric conversion of tissue biopsy samples into permanent
      quantitative digital proteome maps.
PG  - 407-13
LID - 10.1038/nm.3807 [doi]
AB  - Clinical specimens are each inherently unique, limited and nonrenewable. Small
      samples such as tissue biopsies are often completely consumed after a limited
      number of analyses. Here we present a method that enables fast and reproducible
      conversion of a small amount of tissue (approximating the quantity obtained by a 
      biopsy) into a single, permanent digital file representing the mass spectrometry 
      (MS)-measurable proteome of the sample. The method combines pressure cycling
      technology (PCT) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment
      ion spectra (SWATH)-MS. The resulting proteome maps can be analyzed, re-analyzed,
      compared and mined in silico to detect and quantify specific proteins across
      multiple samples. We used this method to process and convert 18 biopsy samples
      from nine patients with renal cell carcinoma into SWATH-MS fragment ion maps.
      From these proteome maps we detected and quantified more than 2,000 proteins with
      a high degree of reproducibility across all samples. The measured proteins
      clearly distinguished tumorous kidney tissues from healthy tissues and
      differentiated distinct histomorphological kidney cancer subtypes.

TI  - Anemia: progress in molecular mechanisms and therapies.
PG  - 221-30
LID - 10.1038/nm.3814 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here we review
      recent insights into how red blood cells (RBCs) are produced, the pathogenic
      mechanisms underlying various forms of anemia, and novel therapies derived from
      these findings. It is likely that these new insights, mainly arising from basic
      scientific studies, will contribute immensely to both the understanding of
      frequently debilitating forms of anemia and the ability to treat affected
      patients. Major worldwide diseases that are likely to benefit from new advances
      include the hemoglobinopathies (beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease); rare
      genetic disorders of RBC production; and anemias associated with chronic kidney
      disease, inflammation, and cancer. Promising new approaches to treatment include 
      drugs that target recently defined pathways in RBC production, iron metabolism,
      and fetal globin-family gene expression, as well as gene therapies that use
      improved viral vectors and newly developed genome editing technologies.

TI  - Modeling colorectal cancer using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of human
      intestinal organoids.
PG  - 256-62
LID - 10.1038/nm.3802 [doi]
AB  - Human colorectal tumors bear recurrent mutations in genes encoding proteins
      operative in the WNT, MAPK, TGF-beta, TP53 and PI3K pathways. Although these
      pathways influence intestinal stem cell niche signaling, the extent to which
      mutations in these pathways contribute to human colorectal carcinogenesis remains
      unclear. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing system to introduce multiple 
      such mutations into organoids derived from normal human intestinal epithelium. By
      modulating the culture conditions to mimic that of the intestinal niche, we
      selected isogenic organoids harboring mutations in the tumor suppressor genes
      APC, SMAD4 and TP53, and in the oncogenes KRAS and/or PIK3CA. Organoids
      engineered to express all five mutations grew independently of niche factors in
      vitro, and they formed tumors after implantation under the kidney subcapsule in
      mice. Although they formed micrometastases containing dormant tumor-initiating
      cells after injection into the spleen of mice, they failed to colonize in the
      liver. In contrast, engineered organoids derived from chromosome-instable human
      adenomas formed macrometastatic colonies. These results suggest that 'driver'
      pathway mutations enable stem cell maintenance in the hostile tumor
      microenvironment, but that additional molecular lesions are required for invasive
      behavior.

TI  - LTB4 promotes insulin resistance in obese mice by acting on macrophages,
      hepatocytes and myocytes.
PG  - 239-247
LID - 10.1038/nm.3800 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance results from several pathophysiologic mechanisms, including
      chronic tissue inflammation and defective insulin signaling. We found that liver,
      muscle and adipose tissue exhibit higher levels of the chemotactic eicosanoid
      LTB4 in obese high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Inhibition of the LTB4 receptor
      Ltb4r1, through either genetic or pharmacologic loss of function, led to an
      anti-inflammatory phenotype with protection from insulin resistance and hepatic
      steatosis. In vitro treatment with LTB4 directly enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, 
      stimulated inflammatory pathways, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6
      myocytes, and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output in 
      primary mouse hepatocytes. This was accompanied by lower insulin-stimulated Akt
      phosphorylation and higher Irs-1/2 serine phosphorylation, and all of these
      events were dependent on Galphai and Jnk1, two downstream mediators of Ltb4r1
      signaling. These observations elucidate a novel role of the LTB4-Ltb4r1 signaling
      pathway in hepatocyte and myocyte insulin resistance, and they show that in vivo 
      inhibition of Ltb4r1 leads to robust insulin-sensitizing effects.

TI  - DNA methyltransferase 3a regulates osteoclast differentiation by coupling to an
      S-adenosylmethionine-producing metabolic pathway.
PG  - 281-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3774 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic reprogramming occurs in response to the cellular environment to mediate
      differentiation, but the fundamental mechanisms linking metabolic processes to
      differentiation programs remain to be elucidated. During osteoclast
      differentiation, a shift toward more oxidative metabolic processes occurs. In
      this study we identified the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) as a
      transcription factor that couples these metabolic changes to osteoclast
      differentiation. We also found that receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB
      ligand (RANKL), an essential cytokine for osteoclastogenesis, induces this
      metabolic shift towards oxidative metabolism, which is accompanied by an increase
      in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) production. We found that SAM-mediated DNA
      methylation by Dnmt3a regulates osteoclastogenesis via epigenetic repression of
      anti-osteoclastogenic genes. The importance of Dnmt3a in bone homeostasis was
      underscored by the observations that Dnmt3a-deficient osteoclast precursor cells 
      do not differentiate efficiently into osteoclasts and that mice with an
      osteoclast-specific deficiency in Dnmt3a have elevated bone mass due to a smaller
      number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA methylation by
      theaflavin-3,3'-digallate abrogated bone loss in models of osteoporosis. Thus,
      this study reveals the role of epigenetic processes in the regulation of cellular
      metabolism and differentiation, which may provide the molecular basis for a new
      therapeutic strategy for a variety of bone disorders.

TI  - The ketone metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate blocks NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated
      inflammatory disease.
PG  - 263-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3804 [doi]
AB  - The ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) support
      mammalian survival during states of energy deficit by serving as alternative
      sources of ATP. BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction,
      high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Prolonged
      fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other
      alternative metabolic fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate
      immune response is unknown. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the
      structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and acetate, suppresses
      activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and
      lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to
      pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or
      absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical
      caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3
      inflammasome by preventing K(+) efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck
      formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality 
      or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the
      NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and
      independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G
      protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB
      reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 production
      in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1
      activation and IL-1beta secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such
      as Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and urate
      crystal-induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory
      effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated
      inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

      inflammasome is a component of the inflammatory process, and its aberrant
      activation is pathogenic in inherited disorders such as cryopyrin-associated
      periodic syndrome (CAPS) and complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 2 
      diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. We describe the development of
      MCC950, a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of NLRP3. MCC950 blocked
      canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 activation at nanomolar concentrations. MCC950
      specifically inhibited activation of NLRP3 but not the AIM2, NLRC4 or NLRP1
      inflammasomes. MCC950 reduced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production in vivo and
      attenuated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a
      disease model of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, MCC950 treatment rescued
      neonatal lethality in a mouse model of CAPS and was active in ex vivo samples
      from individuals with Muckle-Wells syndrome. MCC950 is thus a potential
      therapeutic for NLRP3-associated syndromes, including autoinflammatory and
      autoimmune diseases, and a tool for further study of the NLRP3 inflammasome in
      human health and disease.

TI  - Synthetic lethality by targeting EZH2 methyltransferase activity in
      ARID1A-mutated cancers.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3799 [doi]
AB  - The gene encoding ARID1A, a chromatin remodeler, shows one of the highest
      mutation rates across many cancer types. Notably, ARID1A is mutated in over 50%
      of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which currently have no effective therapy. To
      date, clinically applicable targeted cancer therapy based on ARID1A mutational
      status has not been described. Here we show that inhibition of the EZH2
      methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A-mutated ovarian
      cancer cells and that ARID1A mutational status correlated with response to the
      EZH2 inhibitor. We identified PIK3IP1 as a direct target of ARID1A and EZH2 that 
      is upregulated by EZH2 inhibition and contributed to the observed synthetic
      lethality by inhibiting PI3K-AKT signaling. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition caused
      regression of ARID1A-mutated ovarian tumors in vivo. To our knowledge, this is
      the first data set to demonstrate a synthetic lethality between ARID1A mutation
      and EZH2 inhibition. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2
      represents a novel treatment strategy for cancers involving ARID1A mutations.

TI  - A C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor restores glucocorticoid sensitivity and relieves a
      mouse allograft model of Cushing disease.
PG  - 276-80
LID - 10.1038/nm.3776 [doi]
AB  - One function of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticotroph cells is to
      suppress the transcription of the gene encoding proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the
      precursor of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Cushing disease is a 
      neuroendocrine condition caused by partially glucocorticoid-resistant
      corticotroph adenomas that excessively secrete ACTH, which leads to
      hypercortisolism. Mutations that impair GR function explain glucocorticoid
      resistance only in sporadic cases. However, the proper folding of GR depends on
      direct interactions with the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90, refs. 7,8). 
      We show here that corticotroph adenomas overexpress HSP90 compared to the normal 
      pituitary. N- and C-terminal HSP90 inhibitors act at different steps of the HSP90
      catalytic cycle to regulate corticotroph cell proliferation and GR
      transcriptional activity. C-terminal inhibitors cause the release of mature GR
      from HSP90, which promotes its exit from the chaperone cycle and potentiates its 
      transcriptional activity in a corticotroph cell line and in primary cultures of
      human corticotroph adenomas. In an allograft mouse model, the C-terminal HSP90
      inhibitor silibinin showed anti-tumorigenic effects, partially reverted hormonal 
      alterations, and alleviated symptoms of Cushing disease. These results suggest
      that the pathogenesis of Cushing disease caused by overexpression of heat shock
      proteins and consequently misregulated GR sensitivity may be overcome
      pharmacologically with an appropriate HSP90 inhibitor.

AB  - Currently, major concerns about the safety and efficacy of RNA interference
      (RNAi)-based bone anabolic strategies still exist because of the lack of direct
      osteoblast-specific delivery systems for osteogenic siRNAs. Here we screened the 
      aptamer CH6 by cell-SELEX, specifically targeting both rat and human osteoblasts,
      and then we developed CH6 aptamer-functionalized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
      encapsulating osteogenic pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1 
      (Plekho1) siRNA (CH6-LNPs-siRNA). Our results showed that CH6 facilitated in
      vitro osteoblast-selective uptake of Plekho1 siRNA, mainly via macropinocytosis, 
      and boosted in vivo osteoblast-specific Plekho1 gene silencing, which promoted
      bone formation, improved bone microarchitecture, increased bone mass and enhanced
      mechanical properties in both osteopenic and healthy rodents. These results
      indicate that osteoblast-specific aptamer-functionalized LNPs could act as a new 
      RNAi-based bone anabolic strategy, advancing the targeted delivery selectivity of
      osteogenic siRNAs from the tissue level to the cellular level.

TI  - Functional correction in mouse models of muscular dystrophy using exon-skipping
      tricyclo-DNA oligomers.
PG  - 270-5
LID - 10.1038/nm.3765 [doi]
AB  - Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) hold promise for therapeutic correction of many
      genetic diseases via exon skipping, and the first AON-based drugs have entered
      clinical trials for neuromuscular disorders. However, despite advances in AON
      chemistry and design, systemic use of AONs is limited because of poor tissue
      uptake, and recent clinical reports confirm that sufficient therapeutic efficacy 
      has not yet been achieved. Here we present a new class of AONs made of
      tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA), which displays unique pharmacological properties and
      unprecedented uptake by many tissues after systemic administration. We
      demonstrate these properties in two mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
      (DMD), a neurogenetic disease typically caused by frame-shifting deletions or
      nonsense mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin and characterized by
      progressive muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure and
      neurocognitive impairment. Although current naked AONs do not enter the heart or 
      cross the blood-brain barrier to any substantial extent, we show that systemic
      delivery of tcDNA-AONs promotes a high degree of rescue of dystrophin expression 
      in skeletal muscles, the heart and, to a lesser extent, the brain. Our results
      demonstrate for the first time a physiological improvement of cardio-respiratory 
      functions and a correction of behavioral features in DMD model mice. This makes
      tcDNA-AON chemistry particularly attractive as a potential future therapy for
      patients with DMD and other neuromuscular disorders or with other diseases that
      are eligible for exon-skipping approaches requiring whole-body treatment.

AB  - Recent advances in the development of genome editing technologies based on
      programmable nucleases have substantially improved our ability to make precise
      changes in the genomes of eukaryotic cells. Genome editing is already broadening 
      our ability to elucidate the contribution of genetics to disease by facilitating 
      the creation of more accurate cellular and animal models of pathological
      processes. A particularly tantalizing application of programmable nucleases is
      the potential to directly correct genetic mutations in affected tissues and cells
      to treat diseases that are refractory to traditional therapies. Here we discuss
      current progress toward developing programmable nuclease-based therapies as well 
      as future prospects and challenges.

TI  - Whole-genome sequencing of quartet families with autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 185-91
LID - 10.1038/nm.3792 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evidence for
      hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome-sequencing studies
      have examined portions of the genome in simplex families (parents and one
      ASD-affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet families (parents and two
      ASD-affected siblings), consisting of 170 individuals with ASD, to generate a
      comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation
      (including noncoding variants) and accompanying phenotypes, in apparently
      familial forms of ASD. By examining de novo and rare inherited single-nucleotide 
      and structural variations in genes previously reported to be associated with ASD 
      or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that some (69.4%) of the affected
      siblings carried different ASD-relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant
      mutations tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared a
      risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists 
      in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non-genic
      susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics.

LID - 10.1038/nm.3788 [doi]
AB  - Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 proteins alter the epigenetic
      landscape in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through production of the
      oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Here we performed a large-scale RNA
      interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are synthetic lethal to the
      IDH1(R132H) mutation in AML and identified the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. IDH1-
      and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type
      cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical
      trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models.
      This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HG-mediated inhibition of the
      activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport
      chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to
      trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2
      mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic
      BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt
      ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies.

AB  - Chronic-phase HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication is reduced 
      by as much as 10,000-fold in elite controllers (ECs) compared with typical
      progressors (TPs), but sufficient viral replication persists in EC tissues to
      allow viral sequence evolution and induce excess immune activation. Here we show 
      that productive SIV infection in rhesus monkey ECs, but not TPs, is markedly
      restricted to CD4(+) follicular helper T (TFH) cells, suggesting that these EC
      monkeys' highly effective SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells can effectively clear
      productive SIV infection from extrafollicular sites, but their relative exclusion
      from B cell follicles prevents their elimination of productively infected TFH
      cells. CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion in EC monkeys resulted in a dramatic
      re-distribution of productive SIV infection to non-TFH cells, with restriction of
      productive infection to TFH cells resuming upon CD8(+) T cell recovery. Thus, B
      cell follicles constitute 'sanctuaries' for persistent SIV replication in the
      presence of potent anti-viral CD8(+) T cell responses, potentially complicating
      efforts to cure HIV infection with therapeutic vaccination or T cell
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Loss of FFA2 and FFA3 increases insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance 
      in type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 173-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3779 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem worldwide, and one of its key features 
      is the inability of elevated glucose to stimulate the release of sufficient
      amounts of insulin from pancreatic beta cells to maintain normal blood glucose
      levels. New therapeutic strategies to improve beta cell function are therefore
      believed to be beneficial. Here we demonstrate that the short-chain fatty acid
      receptors FFA2 (encoded by FFAR2) and FFA3 (encoded by FFAR3) are expressed in
      mouse and human pancreatic beta cells and mediate an inhibition of insulin
      secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. We also provide evidence that mice
      with dietary-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes, as compared to non-obese
      control mice, have increased local formation by pancreatic islets of acetate, an 
      endogenous agonist of FFA2 and FFA3, as well as increased systemic levels. This
      elevation may contribute to the insufficient capacity of beta cells to respond to
      hyperglycemia in obese states. Indeed, we found that genetic deletion of both
      receptors, either on the whole-body level or specifically in pancreatic beta
      cells, leads to greater insulin secretion and a profound improvement of glucose
      tolerance when mice are on a high-fat diet compared to controls. On the other
      hand, deletion of Ffar2 and Ffar3 in intestinal cells did not alter glucose
      tolerance in diabetic animals, suggesting these receptors act in a
      cell-autonomous manner in beta cells to regulate insulin secretion. In summary,
      under diabetic conditions elevated acetate acts on FFA2 and FFA3 to inhibit
      proper glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and we expect antagonists of FFA2
      and FFA3 to improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Myeloid-derived growth factor (C19orf10) mediates cardiac repair following
      myocardial infarction.
PG  - 140-9
LID - 10.1038/nm.3778 [doi]
AB  - Paracrine-acting proteins are emerging as a central mechanism by which bone
      marrow cell-based therapies improve tissue repair and heart function after
      myocardial infarction (MI). We carried out a bioinformatic secretome analysis in 
      bone marrow cells from patients with acute MI to identify novel secreted proteins
      with therapeutic potential. Functional screens revealed a secreted protein
      encoded by an open reading frame on chromosome 19 (C19orf10) that promotes
      cardiac myocyte survival and angiogenesis. We show that bone marrow-derived
      monocytes and macrophages produce this protein endogenously to protect and repair
      the heart after MI, and we named it myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF).
      Whereas Mydgf-deficient mice develop larger infarct scars and more severe
      contractile dysfunction compared to wild-type mice, treatment with recombinant
      Mydgf reduces scar size and contractile dysfunction after MI. This study is the
      first to assign a biological function to MYDGF, and it may serve as a
      prototypical example for the development of protein-based therapies for ischemic 
      tissue repair.

TI  - Orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 regulates transforming growth factor-beta signaling
      and fibrosis.
PG  - 150-8
LID - 10.1038/nm.3777 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal responses are an essential aspect of tissue repair. Failure to
      terminate this repair process correctly, however, results in fibrosis and organ
      dysfunction. Therapies that block fibrosis and restore tissue homeostasis are not
      yet available for clinical use. Here we characterize the nuclear receptor NR4A1
      as an endogenous inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
      signaling and as a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapies. NR4A1 recruits a
      repressor complex comprising SP1, SIN3A, CoREST, LSD1, and HDAC1 to TGF-beta
      target genes, thereby limiting pro-fibrotic TGF-beta effects. Even though
      temporary upregulation of TGF-beta in physiologic wound healing induces NR4A1
      expression and thereby creates a negative feedback loop, the persistent
      activation of TGF-beta signaling in fibrotic diseases uses AKT- and
      HDAC-dependent mechanisms to inhibit NR4A1 expression and activation.
      Small-molecule NR4A1 agonists can overcome this lack of active NR4A1 and inhibit 
      experimentally-induced skin, lung, liver, and kidney fibrosis in mice. Our data
      demonstrate a regulatory role of NR4A1 in TGF-beta signaling and fibrosis,
      providing the first proof of concept for targeting NR4A1 in fibrotic diseases.

PG  - 159-65

AB  - The systemic expression of the bile acid (BA) sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR)
      has led to promising new therapies targeting cholesterol metabolism, triglyceride
      production, hepatic steatosis and biliary cholestasis. In contrast to systemic
      therapy, bile acid release during a meal selectively activates intestinal FXR. By
      mimicking this tissue-selective effect, the gut-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine
      (Fex) robustly induces enteric fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), leading to
      alterations in BA composition, but does so without activating FXR target genes in
      the liver. However, unlike systemic agonism, we find that Fex reduces
      diet-induced weight gain, body-wide inflammation and hepatic glucose production, 
      while enhancing thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). These
      pronounced metabolic improvements suggest tissue-restricted FXR activation as a
      new approach in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

TI  - Structure-inherent targeting of near-infrared fluorophores for parathyroid and
      thyroid gland imaging.
PG  - 192-7
LID - 10.1038/nm.3728 [doi]
AB  - The typical method for creating targeted contrast agents requires covalent
      conjugation of separate targeting and fluorophore domains. In this study, we
      demonstrate that it is possible to create near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores with
      different tissue specificities driven by their inherent chemical structures.
      Thus, a single compact molecule performs both targeting and imaging. We use this 
      strategy to solve a major problem in head and neck surgery: the identification
      and preservation of parathyroid and thyroid glands. We synthesized 700-nm and
      800-nm halogenated fluorophores that show high uptake into these glands after a
      single intravenous (IV) injection of 0.06 mg kg(-1) in a pig. By using a
      dual-channel NIR imaging system, we observed-in real time and with high
      sensitivity-the unambiguous distinction of parathyroid and thyroid glands
      simultaneously in the context of blood and surrounding soft tissue. This novel
      technology lays a foundation for performing head and neck surgery with increased 
      precision and efficiency along with potentially lower morbidity, and it provides 
      a general strategy for developing targeted NIR fluorophores.

TI  - Inhibiting peripheral serotonin synthesis reduces obesity and metabolic
      dysfunction by promoting brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.
PG  - 166-72
LID - 10.1038/nm.3766 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is enriched within interscapular brown 
      adipose tissue (iBAT) and beige (also known as brite) adipose tissue, but its
      thermogenic potential is reduced with obesity and type 2 diabetes for reasons
      that are not understood. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a highly
      conserved biogenic amine that resides in non-neuronal and neuronal tissues that
      are specifically regulated via tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) and Tph2,
      respectively. Recent findings suggest that increased peripheral serotonin and
      polymorphisms in TPH1 are associated with obesity; however, whether this is
      directly related to reduced BAT thermogenesis and obesity is not known. We find
      that Tph1-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) are protected from obesity,
      insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) while exhibiting 
      greater energy expenditure by BAT. Small-molecule chemical inhibition of Tph1 in 
      HFD-fed mice mimics the benefits ascribed to Tph1 genetic deletion, effects that 
      depend on UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. The inhibitory effects of serotonin on
      energy expenditure are cell autonomous, as serotonin blunts beta-adrenergic
      induction of the thermogenic program in brown and beige adipocytes in vitro. As
      obesity increases peripheral serotonin, the inhibition of serotonin signaling or 
      its synthesis in adipose tissue may be an effective treatment for obesity and its
      comorbidities.

AB  - Tumor-specific neo-antigens that arise as a consequence of mutations are thought 
      to be important for the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.
      Accumulating evidence suggests that neo-antigens may be commonly recognized by
      intratumoral CD8+ T cells, but it is unclear whether neo-antigen-specific CD4+ T 
      cells also frequently reside within human tumors. In view of the accepted role of
      tumor-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in tumor control, we addressed whether
      neo-antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell reactivity is a common property in human
      melanoma.

AB  - High-throughput immune repertoire sequencing has emerged as a critical step in
      the understanding of adaptive responses following infection or vaccination or in 
      autoimmunity. However, determination of native antibody variable heavy-light
      pairs (VH-VL pairs) remains a major challenge, and no technologies exist to
      adequately interrogate the >1 x 10(6) B cells in typical specimens. We developed 
      a low-cost, single-cell, emulsion-based technology for sequencing antibody VH-VL 
      repertoires from >2 x 10(6) B cells per experiment with demonstrated pairing
      precision >97%. A simple flow-focusing apparatus was used to sequester single B
      cells into emulsion droplets containing lysis buffer and magnetic beads for mRNA 
      capture; subsequent emulsion RT-PCR generated VH-VL amplicons for next-generation
      sequencing. Massive VH-VL repertoire analyses of three human donors provided new 
      immunological insights including (i) the identity, frequency and pairing
      propensity of shared, or 'public', VL genes, (ii) the detection of allelic
      inclusion (an implicated autoimmune mechanism) in healthy individuals and (iii)
      the occurrence of antibodies with features, in terms of gene usage and CDR3
      length, associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies to rapidly evolving
      viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza.

TI  - Inducible depletion of satellite cells in adult, sedentary mice impairs muscle
      regenerative capacity without affecting sarcopenia.
PG  - 76-80
LID - 10.1038/nm.3710 [doi]
AB  - A key determinant of geriatric frailty is sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of 
      skeletal muscle mass and strength. Although the etiology of sarcopenia is
      unknown, the correlation during aging between the loss of activity of satellite
      cells, which are endogenous muscle stem cells, and impaired muscle regenerative
      capacity has led to the hypothesis that the loss of satellite cell activity is
      also a cause of sarcopenia. We tested this hypothesis in male sedentary mice by
      experimentally depleting satellite cells in young adult animals to a degree
      sufficient to impair regeneration throughout the rest of their lives. A detailed 
      analysis of multiple muscles harvested at various time points during aging in
      different cohorts of these mice showed that the muscles were of normal size,
      despite low regenerative capacity, but did have increased fibrosis. These results
      suggest that lifelong reduction of satellite cells neither accelerated nor

AB  - Means for temporally regulating gene expression and cellular activity are
      invaluable for elucidating underlying physiological processes and would have
      therapeutic implications. Here we report the development of a genetically encoded
      system for remote regulation of gene expression by low-frequency radio waves
      (RFs) or a magnetic field. Iron oxide nanoparticles are synthesized
      intracellularly as a GFP-tagged ferritin heavy and light chain fusion. The
      ferritin nanoparticles associate with a camelid anti-GFP-transient receptor
      potential vanilloid 1 fusion protein, alphaGFP-TRPV1, and can transduce
      noninvasive RF or magnetic fields into channel activation, also showing that
      TRPV1 can transduce a mechanical stimulus. This, in turn, initiates
      calcium-dependent transgene expression. In mice with stem cell or viral
      expression of these genetically encoded components, remote stimulation of insulin
      transgene expression with RF or a magnet lowers blood glucose. This robust,
      repeatable method for remote regulation in vivo may ultimately have applications 
      in basic science, technology and therapeutics.

TI  - Notch controls the survival of memory CD4+ T cells by regulating glucose uptake.
PG  - 55-61
LID - 10.1038/nm.3758 [doi]
AB  - CD4+ T cells differentiate into memory T cells that protect the host from
      subsequent infection. In contrast, autoreactive memory CD4+ T cells harm the body
      by persisting in the tissues. The underlying pathways controlling the maintenance
      of memory CD4+ T cells remain undefined. We show here that memory CD4+ T cell
      survival is impaired in the absence of the Notch signaling protein known as
      recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (Rbpj).
      Treatment of mice with a Notch inhibitor reduced memory CD4+ T cell numbers and
      prevented the recurrent induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
      Rbpj-deficient CD4+ memory T cells exhibit reduced glucose uptake due to impaired
      AKT phosphorylation, resulting in low Glut1 expression. Treating mice with
      pyruvic acid, which bypasses glucose uptake and supplies the metabolite
      downstream of glucose uptake, inhibited the decrease of autoimmune memory CD4+ T 
      cells in the absence of Notch signaling, suggesting memory CD4+ T cell survival
      relies on glucose metabolism. Together, these data define a central role for
      Notch signaling in maintaining memory CD4+ T cells through the regulation of
      glucose uptake.

TI  - The Ashwell-Morell receptor regulates hepatic thrombopoietin production via
      JAK2-STAT3 signaling.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1038/nm.3770 [doi]
AB  - The hepatic Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR) can bind and remove desialylated
      platelets. Here we demonstrate that platelets become desialylated as they
      circulate and age in blood. Binding of desialylated platelets to the AMR induces 
      hepatic expression of thrombopoietin (TPO) mRNA and protein, thereby regulating
      platelet production. Endocytic AMR controls TPO expression through Janus kinase 2
      (JAK2) and the acute phase response signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 (STAT3) in vivo and in vitro. Recognition of this newly
      identified physiological feedback mechanism illuminates the pathophysiology of
      platelet diseases, such as essential thrombocythemia and immune thrombocytopenia,
      and contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia
      observed with JAK1/2 inhibition.

TI  - Mutations in G protein beta subunits promote transformation and kinase inhibitor 
      resistance.
PG  - 71-5
LID - 10.1038/nm.3751 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in genes encoding G protein alpha (Galpha) subunits occur in
      4-5% of all human cancers, but oncogenic alterations in Gbeta subunits have not
      been defined. Here we demonstrate that recurrent mutations in the Gbeta proteins 
      GNB1 and GNB2 confer cytokine-independent growth and activate canonical G protein
      signaling. Multiple mutations in GNB1 affect the protein interface that binds
      Galpha subunits as well as downstream effectors and disrupt Galpha interactions
      with the Gbetagamma dimer. Different mutations in Gbeta proteins clustered partly
      on the basis of lineage; for example, all 11 GNB1 K57 mutations were in myeloid
      neoplasms, and seven of eight GNB1 I80 mutations were in B cell neoplasms.
      Expression of patient-derived GNB1 variants in Cdkn2a-deficient mouse bone marrow
      followed by transplantation resulted in either myeloid or B cell malignancies. In
      vivo treatment with the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 suppressed GNB1-induced
      signaling and markedly increased survival. In several human tumors, mutations in 
      the gene encoding GNB1 co-occurred with oncogenic kinase alterations, including
      the BCR-ABL fusion protein, the V617F substitution in JAK2 and the V600K
      substitution in BRAF. Coexpression of patient-derived GNB1 variants with these
      mutant kinases resulted in inhibitor resistance in each context. Thus, GNB1 and
      GNB2 alterations confer transformed and resistance phenotypes across a range of
      human tumors and may be targetable with inhibitors of G protein signaling.

TI  - A rationally designed monomeric peptide triagonist corrects obesity and diabetes 
      in rodents.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1038/nm.3761 [doi]
AB  - We report the discovery of a new monomeric peptide that reduces body weight and
      diabetic complications in rodent models of obesity by acting as an agonist at
      three key metabolically-related peptide hormone receptors: glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and
      glucagon receptors. This triple agonist demonstrates supraphysiological potency
      and equally aligned constituent activities at each receptor, all without
      cross-reactivity at other related receptors. Such balanced unimolecular triple
      agonism proved superior to any existing dual coagonists and best-in-class
      monoagonists to reduce body weight, enhance glycemic control and reverse hepatic 
      steatosis in relevant rodent models. Various loss-of-function models, including
      genetic knockout, pharmacological blockade and selective chemical knockout,
      confirmed contributions of each constituent activity in vivo. We demonstrate that
      these individual constituent activities harmonize to govern the overall metabolic
      efficacy, which predominantly results from synergistic glucagon action to
      increase energy expenditure, GLP-1 action to reduce caloric intake and improve
      glucose control, and GIP action to potentiate the incretin effect and buffer
      against the diabetogenic effect of inherent glucagon activity. These preclinical 
      studies suggest that, so far, this unimolecular, polypharmaceutical strategy has 
      potential to be the most effective pharmacological approach to reversing obesity 
      and related metabolic disorders.

PG  - 19-26
LID - 10.1038/nm.3759 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most common and intractable brain disorders. Mutations in 
      the human gene LGI1, encoding a neuronal secreted protein, cause autosomal
      dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). However, the pathogenic
      mechanisms of LGI1 mutations remain unclear. We classified 22 reported LGI1
      missense mutations as either secretion defective or secretion competent, and we
      generated and analyzed two mouse models of ADLTE encoding mutant proteins
      representative of the two groups. The secretion-defective LGI1(E383A) protein was
      recognized by the ER quality-control machinery and prematurely degraded, whereas 
      the secretable LGI1(S473L) protein abnormally dimerized and was selectively
      defective in binding to one of its receptors, ADAM22. Both mutations caused a
      loss of function, compromising intracellular trafficking or ligand activity of
      LGI1 and converging on reduced synaptic LGI1-ADAM22 interaction. A chemical
      corrector, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), restored LGI1(E383A) folding and binding to
      ADAM22 and ameliorated the increased seizure susceptibility of the LGI1(E383A)
      model mice. This study establishes LGI1-related epilepsy as a conformational
      disease and suggests new therapeutic options for human epilepsy.

TI  - Aberrant epithelial GREM1 expression initiates colonic tumorigenesis from cells
      outside the stem cell niche.
PG  - 62-70
LID - 10.1038/nm.3750 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS) is characterized by the development of
      mixed-morphology colorectal tumors and is caused by a 40-kb genetic duplication
      that results in aberrant epithelial expression of the gene encoding mesenchymal
      bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, GREM1. Here we use HMPS tissue and a mouse
      model of the disease to show that epithelial GREM1 disrupts homeostatic
      intestinal morphogen gradients, altering cell fate that is normally determined by
      position along the vertical epithelial axis. This promotes the persistence and/or
      reacquisition of stem cell properties in Lgr5-negative progenitor cells that have
      exited the stem cell niche. These cells form ectopic crypts, proliferate,
      accumulate somatic mutations and can initiate intestinal neoplasia, indicating
      that the crypt base stem cell is not the sole cell of origin of colorectal
      cancer. Furthermore, we show that epithelial expression of GREM1 also occurs in
      traditional serrated adenomas, sporadic premalignant lesions with a hitherto
      unknown pathogenesis, and these lesions can be considered the sporadic
      equivalents of HMPS polyps.

TI  - Defective fatty acid oxidation in renal tubular epithelial cells has a key role
      in kidney fibrosis development.
PG  - 37-46
LID - 10.1038/nm.3762 [doi]
AB  - Renal fibrosis is the histological manifestation of a progressive, usually
      irreversible process causing chronic and end-stage kidney disease. We performed
      genome-wide transcriptome studies of a large cohort (n = 95) of normal and
      fibrotic human kidney tubule samples followed by systems and network analyses and
      identified inflammation and metabolism as the top dysregulated pathways in the
      diseased kidneys. In particular, we found that humans and mouse models with
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis had lower expression of key enzymes and regulators of
      fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and higher intracellular lipid deposition compared to 
      controls. In vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of FAO in tubule
      epithelial cells caused ATP depletion, cell death, dedifferentiation and
      intracellular lipid deposition, phenotypes observed in fibrosis. In contrast,
      restoring fatty acid metabolism by genetic or pharmacological methods protected
      mice from tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our results raise the possibility that
      correcting the metabolic defect in FAO may be useful for preventing and treating 
      chronic kidney disease.
