PG  - 484-493
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0118-0 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal network operations supporting spatial navigation and declarative
      memory are traditionally interpreted in a framework where each hippocampal area, 
      such as the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1, consists of homogeneous populations of
      functionally equivalent principal neurons. However, heterogeneity within
      hippocampal principal cell populations, in particular within pyramidal cells at
      the main CA1 output node, is increasingly recognized and includes developmental, 
      molecular, anatomical, and functional differences. Here we review recent progress
      in the delineation of hippocampal principal cell subpopulations by focusing on
      radially defined subpopulations of CA1 pyramidal cells, and we consider how
      functional segregation of information streams, in parallel channels with
      nonuniform properties, could represent a general organizational principle of the 
      hippocampus supporting diverse behaviors.

      model of ALS-FTD.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) constitutes a
      devastating disease spectrum characterized by 43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein
      (TDP-43) pathology. Understanding how TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration
      will help direct therapeutic efforts. Here we have created a TDP-43 knock-in
      mouse with a human-equivalent mutation in the endogenous mouse Tardbp gene.
      TDP-43(Q331K) mice demonstrate cognitive dysfunction and a paucity of parvalbumin
      interneurons. Critically, TDP-43 autoregulation is perturbed, leading to a gain
      of TDP-43 function and altered splicing of Mapt, another pivotal
      dementia-associated gene. Furthermore, a new approach to stratify transcriptomic 
      data by phenotype in differentially affected mutant mice revealed 471 changes
      linked with improved behavior. These changes included downregulation of two known
      modifiers of neurodegeneration, Atxn2 and Arid4a, and upregulation of myelination
      and translation genes. With one base change in murine Tardbp, this study
      identifies TDP-43 misregulation as a pathogenic mechanism that may underpin
      ALS-FTD and exploits phenotypic heterogeneity to yield candidate suppressors of
      neurodegenerative disease.

PG  - 576-588
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0093-5 [doi]
AB  - Severe spinal cord contusions interrupt nearly all brain projections to lumbar
      circuits producing leg movement. Failure of these projections to reorganize leads
      to permanent paralysis. Here we modeled these injuries in rodents. A severe
      contusion abolished all motor cortex projections below injury. However, the motor
      cortex immediately regained adaptive control over the paralyzed legs during
      electrochemical neuromodulation of lumbar circuits. Glutamatergic reticulospinal 
      neurons with residual projections below the injury relayed the cortical command
      downstream. Gravity-assisted rehabilitation enabled by the neuromodulation
      therapy reinforced these reticulospinal projections, rerouting cortical
      information through this pathway. This circuit reorganization mediated a motor
      cortex-dependent recovery of natural walking and swimming without requiring
      neuromodulation. Cortico-reticulo-spinal circuit reorganization may also improve 
      recovery in humans.

PG  - 607-616
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0095-3 [doi]
AB  - Behavior is driven by coordinated activity across a population of neurons.
      Learning requires the brain to change the neural population activity produced to 
      achieve a given behavioral goal. How does population activity reorganize during
      learning? We studied intracortical population activity in the primary motor
      cortex of rhesus macaques during short-term learning in a brain-computer
      interface (BCI) task. In a BCI, the mapping between neural activity and behavior 
      is exactly known, enabling us to rigorously define hypotheses about neural
      reorganization during learning. We found that changes in population activity
      followed a suboptimal neural strategy of reassociation: animals relied on a fixed
      repertoire of activity patterns and associated those patterns with different
      movements after learning. These results indicate that the activity patterns that 
      a neural population can generate are even more constrained than previously
      thought and might explain why it is often difficult to quickly learn to a high
      level of proficiency.

      deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition.
PG  - 564-575
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0110-8 [doi]
AB  - Haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene is causally linked to autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), and ASD-associated genes are also enriched for chromatin
      remodelers. Here we found that brief treatment with romidepsin, a highly potent
      class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, alleviated social deficits in
      Shank3-deficient mice, which persisted for ~3 weeks. HDAC2 transcription was
      upregulated in these mice, and knockdown of HDAC2 in prefrontal cortex also
      rescued their social deficits. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin, a
      Shank3-binding protein that regulates cell adhesion and transcription, was
      increased in Shank3-deficient mice, which induced HDAC2 upregulation and social
      deficits. At the downstream molecular level, romidepsin treatment elevated the
      expression and histone acetylation of Grin2a and actin-regulatory genes and
      restored NMDA-receptor function and actin filaments in Shank3-deficient mice.
      Taken together, these findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism underlying
      social deficits linked to Shank3 deficiency, which may suggest potential
      therapeutic strategies for ASD patients bearing SHANK3 mutations.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0104-6 [doi]
AB  - Changing one's mind on the basis of new evidence is a hallmark of cognitive
      flexibility. To revise our confidence in a previous decision, we should use new
      evidence to update beliefs about choice accuracy. How this process unfolds in the
      human brain, however, remains unknown. Here we manipulated whether additional
      sensory evidence supports or negates a previous motion direction discrimination
      judgment while recording markers of neural activity in the human brain using
      fMRI. A signature of post-decision evidence (change in log-odds correct) was
      selectively observed in the activity of posterior medial frontal cortex. In
      contrast, distinct activity profiles in anterior prefrontal cortex mediated the
      impact of post-decision evidence on subjective confidence, independently of
      changes in decision value. Together our findings reveal candidate neural
      mediators of post-decisional changes of mind in the human brain and indicate
      possible targets for ameliorating deficits in cognitive flexibility.

AB  - Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration may represent two poles of brain
      pathology. Brain myeloid cells, particularly microglia, play key roles in these
      conditions. We employed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to compare myeloid
      cell populations in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of 
      multiple sclerosis, the R6/2 model of Huntington's disease (HD) and the mutant
      superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We
      identified three myeloid cell populations exclusive to the CNS and present in
      each disease model. Blood-derived monocytes comprised five populations and
      migrated to the brain in EAE, but not in HD and ALS models. Single-cell analysis 
      resolved differences in signaling and cytokine production within similar myeloid 
      populations in EAE compared to HD and ALS models. Moreover, these analyses
      highlighted alpha5 integrin on myeloid cells as a potential therapeutic target
      for neuroinflammation. Together, these findings illustrate how neuropathology may
      differ between inflammatory and degenerative brain disease.

PG  - 497-505
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0101-9 [doi]
AB  - Aging is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The chromatin state, in particular through 
      the mark H4K16ac, has been implicated in aging and thus may play a pivotal role
      in age-associated neurodegeneration. Here we compare the genome-wide enrichment
      of H4K16ac in the lateral temporal lobe of AD individuals against both younger
      and elderly cognitively normal controls. We found that while normal aging leads
      to H4K16ac enrichment, AD entails dramatic losses of H4K16ac in the proximity of 
      genes linked to aging and AD. Our analysis highlights the presence of three
      classes of AD-related changes with distinctive functional roles. Furthermore, we 
      discovered an association between the genomic locations of significant H4K16ac
      changes with genetic variants identified in prior AD genome-wide association
      studies and with expression quantitative trait loci. Our results establish the
      basis for an epigenetic link between aging and AD.

AB  - Repair of complex CNS circuitry requires newly incorporated neurons to become
      appropriately, functionally integrated. One approach is to direct differentiation
      of endogenous progenitors in situ, or ex vivo followed by transplantation. Prior 
      studies find that newly incorporated neurons can establish long-distance axon
      projections, form synapses and functionally integrate in evolutionarily old
      hypothalamic energy-balance circuitry. We now demonstrate that postnatal
      neocortical connectivity can be reconstituted with point-to-point precision,
      including cellular integration of specific, molecularly identified projection
      neuron subtypes into correct positions, combined with development of appropriate 
      long-distance projections and synapses. Using optogenetics-based
      electrophysiology, experiments demonstrate functional afferent and efferent
      integration of transplanted neurons into transcallosal projection neuron
      circuitry. Results further indicate that 'primed' early postmitotic neurons,
      including already fate-restricted deep-layer projection neurons and/or plastic
      postmitotic neuroblasts with partially fate-restricted potential, account for the
      predominant population of neurons capable of achieving this optimal level of
      integration.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0091-7 [doi]
AB  - Recombinant rabies viral vectors have proven useful for applications including
      retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing, but their
      cytotoxicity has limited their use to short-term experiments. Here we introduce a
      new class of double-deletion-mutant rabies viral vectors that left transduced
      cells alive and healthy indefinitely. Deletion of the viral polymerase gene
      abolished cytotoxicity and reduced transgene expression to trace levels but left 
      vectors still able to retrogradely infect projection neurons and express
      recombinases, allowing downstream expression of other transgene products such as 
      fluorophores and calcium indicators. The morphology of retrogradely targeted
      cells appeared unperturbed at 1 year postinjection. Whole-cell patch-clamp
      recordings showed no physiological abnormalities at 8 weeks. Longitudinal
      two-photon structural and functional imaging in vivo, tracking thousands of
      individual neurons for up to 4 months, showed that transduced neurons did not die
      but retained stable visual response properties even at the longest time points
      imaged.

AB  - Items held in working memory can be either attended or not, depending on their
      current behavioral relevance. It has been suggested that unattended contents
      might be solely retained in an activity-silent form. Instead, we demonstrate here
      that encoding unattended contents involves a division of labor. While visual
      cortex only maintains attended items, intraparietal areas and the frontal eye
      fields represent both attended and unattended items.

PG  - 506-516
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0106-4 [doi]
AB  - During brain development, the immune system mediates neurogenesis, gliogenesis
      and synapse formation. However, it remains unclear whether peripheral lymphocytes
      contribute to brain development. Here we identified the subtypes of lymphocytes
      that are present in neonatal mouse brains and investigated their functions. We
      found that B-1a cells, a subtype of B cells, were abundant in the neonatal mouse 
      brain and infiltrated into the brain in a CXCL13-CXCR5-dependent manner. B-1a
      cells promoted the proliferation of oligodendrocyte-precursor cells (OPCs) in
      vitro, and depletion of B-1a cells from developing brains resulted in a reduction
      of numbers of OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, neutralizing
      Fcalpha/muR, the receptor for the Fc region of IgM secreted by B-1a cells,
      inhibited OPC proliferation and reduced the proportion of myelinated axons in
      neonatal mouse brains. Our results demonstrate that B-1a cells infiltrate into
      the brain and contribute to oligodendrogenesis and myelination by promoting OPC
      proliferation via IgM-Fcalpha/muR signaling.

AB  - A three-dimensional single-cell-resolution mammalian brain atlas will accelerate 
      systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits underlying various
      brain functions. However, its construction requires efficient
      subcellular-resolution imaging throughout the entire brain. To address this
      challenge, we developed a fluorescent-protein-compatible, whole-organ clearing
      and homogeneous expansion protocol based on an aqueous chemical solution
      (CUBIC-X). The expanded, well-cleared brain enabled us to construct a point-based
      mouse brain atlas with single-cell annotation (CUBIC-Atlas). CUBIC-Atlas reflects
      inhomogeneous whole-brain development, revealing a significant decrease in the
      cerebral visual and somatosensory cortical areas during postnatal development.
      Probabilistic activity mapping of pharmacologically stimulated Arc-dVenus
      reporter mouse brains onto CUBIC-Atlas revealed the existence of distinct
      functional structures in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. CUBIC-Atlas is shareable 
      by an open-source web-based viewer, providing a new platform for whole-brain cell
      profiling.

PG  - 474-483
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0108-2 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), also known as electrocorticography
      when using subdural grid electrodes or stereotactic EEG when using depth
      electrodes, is blossoming in various fields of human neuroscience. In this
      article, we highlight the potentials of iEEG in exploring functions of the human 
      brain while also considering its limitations. The iEEG signal provides
      anatomically precise information about the selective engagement of neuronal
      populations at the millimeter scale and the temporal dynamics of their engagement
      at the millisecond scale. If several nodes of a given network are monitored
      simultaneously with implanted electrodes, the iEEG signals can also reveal
      information about functional interactions within and across networks during
      different stages of neural computation. As such, human iEEG can complement other 
      methods of neuroscience beyond simply replicating what is already known, or can
      be known, from noninvasive lines of research in humans or from invasive
      recordings in nonhuman mammalian brains.

AB  - The complex skills underlying verbal and musical expression can be learned
      without external punishment or reward, indicating their learning is internally
      guided. The neural mechanisms that mediate internally guided learning are poorly 
      understood, but a circuit comprising dopamine-releasing neurons in the midbrain
      ventral tegmental area (VTA) and their targets in the basal ganglia are important
      to externally reinforced learning. Juvenile zebra finches copy a tutor song in a 
      process that is internally guided and, in adulthood, can learn to modify the
      fundamental frequency (pitch) of a target syllable in response to external
      reinforcement with white noise. Here we combined intersectional genetic ablation 
      of VTA neurons, reversible blockade of dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia,
      and singing-triggered optogenetic stimulation of VTA terminals to establish that 
      a common VTA-basal ganglia circuit enables internally guided song copying and
      externally reinforced syllable pitch learning.

TI  - Feedback determines the structure of correlated variability in primary visual
      cortex.

AB  - The variable responses of sensory neurons tend to be weakly correlated
      (spike-count correlation, rsc). This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared
      afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding.
      However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions.
      Currently, the relative contributions of these sources are unknown. We addressed 
      this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different
      discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure
      of rsc (the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed
      systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in
      the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily
      reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc
      constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that
      correlations between the activity of single neurons and choice depend on feedback
      engaged by the task.

      microglia after acute depletion.
PG  - 530-540
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0090-8 [doi]
AB  - Newborn microglia rapidly replenish the whole brain after selective elimination
      of most microglia (>99%) in adult mice. Previous studies reported that
      repopulated microglia were largely derived from microglial progenitor cells
      expressing nestin in the brain. However, the origin of these repopulated
      microglia has been hotly debated. In this study, we investigated the origin of
      repopulated microglia by a series of fate-mapping approaches. We first excluded
      the blood origin of repopulated microglia via parabiosis. With different
      transgenic mouse lines, we then demonstrated that all repopulated microglia were 
      derived from the proliferation of the few surviving microglia (<1%). Despite a
      transient pattern of nestin expression in newly forming microglia, none of
      repopulated microglia were derived from nestin-positive non-microglial cells. In 
      summary, we conclude that repopulated microglia are solely derived from residual 
      microglia rather than de novo progenitors, suggesting the absence of microglial
      progenitor cells in the adult brain.

TI  - Imbalance between firing homeostasis and synaptic plasticity drives early-phase
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 463-473
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0080-x [doi]
AB  - During recent years, the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become
      a major focus of research. Continued failures in clinical trials and the
      realization that early intervention may offer better therapeutic outcome
      triggered a conceptual shift from late-stage AD pathology to early-stage
      pathophysiology. While much effort has been directed at understanding the factors
      initiating AD, little is known about the principle basis underlying the disease
      progression at its early stages. In this Perspective, we suggest a hypothesis to 
      explain the transition from 'silent' signatures of aberrant neural circuit
      activity to clinically evident memory impairments. Namely, we propose that
      failures in firing homeostasis and imbalance between firing stability and
      synaptic plasticity in cortico-hippocampal circuits represent the driving force
      of early disease progression. We analyze the main types of possible homeostatic
      failures and provide the essential conceptual framework for examining the causal 
      link between dysregulation of firing homeostasis, aberrant neural circuit
      activity and memory-related plasticity impairments associated with early AD.

TI  - Lifelong cortical myelin plasticity and age-related degeneration in the live
      mammalian brain.
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0120-6 [doi]
AB  - Axonal myelin increases neural processing speed and efficiency. It is unknown
      whether patterns of myelin distribution are fixed or whether myelinating
      oligodendrocytes are continually generated in adulthood and maintain the capacity
      for structural remodeling. Using high-resolution, intravital label-free and
      fluorescence optical imaging in mouse cortex, we demonstrate lifelong
      oligodendrocyte generation occurring in parallel with structural plasticity of
      individual myelin internodes. Continuous internode formation occurred on both
      partially myelinated and unmyelinated axons, and the total myelin coverage along 
      individual axons progressed up to two years of age. After peak myelination,
      gradual oligodendrocyte death and myelin degeneration in aging were associated
      with pronounced internode loss and myelin debris accumulation within microglia.
      Thus, cortical myelin remodeling is protracted throughout life, potentially
      playing critical roles in neuronal network homeostasis. The gradual loss of
      internodes and myelin degeneration in aging could contribute significantly to
      brain pathogenesis.

TI  - Circuit dissection of the role of somatostatin in itch and pain.
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0119-z [doi]
AB  - Stimuli that elicit itch are detected by sensory neurons that innervate the skin.
      This information is processed by the spinal cord; however, the way in which this 
      occurs is still poorly understood. Here we investigated the neuronal pathways for
      itch neurotransmission, particularly the contribution of the neuropeptide
      somatostatin. We find that in the periphery, somatostatin is exclusively
      expressed in Nppb(+) neurons, and we demonstrate that Nppb(+)somatostatin(+)
      cells function as pruriceptors. Employing chemogenetics, pharmacology and
      cell-specific ablation methods, we demonstrate that somatostatin potentiates itch
      by inhibiting inhibitory dynorphin neurons, which results in disinhibition of
      GRPR(+) neurons. Furthermore, elimination of somatostatin from primary afferents 
      and/or from spinal interneurons demonstrates differential involvement of the
      peptide released from these sources in itch and pain. Our results define the
      neural circuit underlying somatostatin-induced itch and characterize a
      contrasting antinociceptive role for the peptide.

TI  - Myelin remodeling through experience-dependent oligodendrogenesis in the adult
      somatosensory cortex.
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0121-5 [doi]
AB  - Oligodendrocyte generation in the adult CNS provides a means to adapt the
      properties of circuits to changes in life experience. However, little is known
      about the dynamics of oligodendrocytes and the extent of myelin remodeling in the
      mature brain. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging of oligodendrocytes
      and their progenitors in the mouse cerebral cortex, we show that myelination is
      an inefficient and extended process, with half of the final complement of
      oligodendrocytes generated after 4 months of age. Oligodendrocytes that
      successfully integrated formed new sheaths on unmyelinated and sparsely
      myelinated axons, and they were extremely stable, gradually changing the pattern 
      of myelination. Sensory enrichment robustly increased oligodendrocyte
      integration, but did not change the length of existing sheaths. This
      experience-dependent enhancement of myelination in the mature cortex may
      accelerate information transfer in these circuits and strengthen the ability of
      axons to sustain activity by providing additional metabolic support.

      consortium.
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0102-8 [doi]
AB  - In the version of this article initially published, the consortium authorship and
      corresponding authors were not presented correctly. In the PDF and print
      versions, the Whole Genome Sequencing for Psychiatric Disorders (WGSPD)
      consortium was missing from the author list at the beginning of the paper, where 
      it should have appeared as the seventh author; it was present in the author list 
      at the end of the paper, but the footnote directing readers to the Supplementary 
      Note for a list of members was missing. In the HTML version, the consortium was
      listed as the last author instead of as the seventh, and the line directing
      readers to the Supplementary Note for a list of members appeared at the end of
      the paper under Author Information but not in association with the consortium
      name itself. Also, this line stated that both member names and affiliations could
      be found in the Supplementary Note; in fact, only names are given. In all
      versions of the paper, the corresponding author symbols were attached to A.
      Jeremy Willsey, Steven E. Hyman, Anjene M. Addington and Thomas Lehner; they
      should have been attached, respectively, to Steven E. Hyman, Anjene M. Addington,
      Thomas Lehner and Nelson B. Freimer. As a result of this shift, the respective
      contact links in the HTML version did not lead to the indicated individuals. The 
      errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.

AB  - In the version of this article initially published, a sentence in the fifth
      paragraph of the Results read, "Immunohistochemistry revealed that VGLUT2(+) MPA 
      neurons rarely expressed CaMKIIalpha, which is a putative marker for subcortical 
      glutamatergic neurons." It should have read, "Immunohistochemistry revealed that 
      CaMKIIalpha(+) MPA neurons rarely expressed VGLUT2, which is a putative marker
      for subcortical glutamatergic neurons." The error has been corrected in the HTML 
      and PDF versions of the article. In the supplementary information originally
      posted online, the wrong version of Supplementary Fig. 1 was posted and some of
      the supplementary videos were interchanged. In the corrected Supplementary Fig.
      1, the top right subpanel was added and the original Supplementary Fig. 1a was
      divided into 1a and 1b, with subsequent panels incremented accordingly. The
      legend was changed from "a. Schematic illustrating electrical lesioning of the
      rat anterior hypothalamus. Electrical lesion areas (gray) in five representative 
      brain sections are depicted. Scale bar, 1 mm" to "a. Repetitive electrical
      stimulations of the anterior hypothalamus using bipolar electrodes (Left) caused

      mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy.
PG  - 329-340
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0083-7 [doi]
AB  - Though motor neurons selectively degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
      other cell types are likely involved in this disease. We recently generated rNLS8
      mice in which human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) pathology could be reversibly induced in
      neurons and expected that microglia would contribute to neurodegeneration.
      However, only subtle microglial changes were detected during disease in the
      spinal cord, despite progressive motor neuron loss; microglia still reacted to
      inflammatory triggers in these mice. Notably, after hTDP-43 expression was
      suppressed, microglia dramatically proliferated and changed their morphology and 
      gene expression profiles. These abundant, reactive microglia selectively cleared 
      neuronal hTDP-43. Finally, when microgliosis was blocked during the early
      recovery phase using PLX3397, a CSF1R and c-kit inhibitor, rNLS8 mice failed to
      regain full motor function, revealing an important neuroprotective role for
      microglia. Therefore, reactive microglia exert neuroprotective functions in this 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model, and definition of the underlying mechanism
      could point toward novel therapeutic strategies.

PG  - 415-423
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0082-8 [doi]
AB  - The social brain hypothesis posits that dedicated neural systems process social
      information. In support of this, neurophysiological data have shown that some
      brain regions are specialized for representing faces. It remains unknown,
      however, whether distinct anatomical substrates also represent more complex
      social variables, such as the hierarchical rank of individuals within a social
      group. Here we show that the primate amygdala encodes the hierarchical rank of
      individuals in the same neuronal ensembles that encode the rewards associated
      with nonsocial stimuli. By contrast, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate
      cortices lack strong representations of hierarchical rank while still
      representing reward values. These results challenge the conventional view that
      dedicated neural systems process social information. Instead, information about
      hierarchical rank-which contributes to the assessment of the social value of
      individuals within a group-is linked in the amygdala to representations of
      rewards associated with nonsocial stimuli.

PG  - 353-363
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0084-6 [doi]
AB  - CA1 pyramidal neurons are a major output of the hippocampus and encode features
      of experience that constitute episodic memories. Feature-selective firing of
      these neurons results from the dendritic integration of inputs from multiple
      brain regions. While it is known that synchronous activation of spatially
      clustered inputs can contribute to firing through the generation of dendritic
      spikes, there is no established mechanism for spatiotemporal synaptic clustering.
      Here we show that single presynaptic axons form multiple, spatially clustered
      inputs onto the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.
      These compound connections exhibit ultrastructural features indicative of strong 
      synapses and occur much more commonly in entorhinal than in thalamic afferents.
      Computational simulations revealed that compound connections depolarize dendrites
      in a biophysically efficient manner, owing to their inherent spatiotemporal
      clustering. Our results suggest that distinct afferent projections use different 
      connectivity motifs that differentially contribute to dendritic integration.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0079-3 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of chromatin accessibility can reveal transcriptional regulatory
      sequences, but heterogeneity of primary tissues poses a significant challenge in 
      mapping the precise chromatin landscape in specific cell types. Here we report
      single-nucleus ATAC-seq, a combinatorial barcoding-assisted single-cell assay for
      transposase-accessible chromatin that is optimized for use on flash-frozen
      primary tissue samples. We apply this technique to the mouse forebrain through
      eight developmental stages. Through analysis of more than 15,000 nuclei, we
      identify 20 distinct cell populations corresponding to major neuronal and
      non-neuronal cell types. We further define cell-type-specific transcriptional
      regulatory sequences, infer potential master transcriptional regulators and
      delineate developmental changes in forebrain cellular composition. Our results
      provide insight into the molecular and cellular dynamics that underlie forebrain 
      development in the mouse and establish technical and analytical frameworks that
      are broadly applicable to other heterogeneous tissues.

AB  - The modification of synaptic strength produced by long-term potentiation (LTP) is
      widely thought to underlie memory storage. Indeed, given that hippocampal
      pyramidal neurons have >10,000 independently modifiable synapses, the potential
      for information storage by synaptic modification is enormous. However, recent
      work suggests that CREB-mediated global changes in neuronal excitability also
      play a critical role in memory formation. Because these global changes have a
      modest capacity for information storage compared with that of synaptic
      plasticity, their importance for memory function has been unclear. Here we review
      the newly emerging evidence for CREB-dependent control of excitability and
      discuss two possible mechanisms. First, the CREB-dependent transient change in
      neuronal excitability performs a memory-allocation function ensuring that memory 
      is stored in ways that facilitate effective linking of events with temporal
      proximity (hours). Second, these changes may promote cell-assembly formation
      during the memory-consolidation phase. It has been unclear whether such global
      excitability changes and local synaptic mechanisms are complementary. Here we
      argue that the two mechanisms can work together to promote useful memory
      function.

AB  - Addiction is proposed to arise from alterations in synaptic strength via
      mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). However, the
      causality between these synaptic processes and addictive behaviors is difficult
      to demonstrate. Here we report that LTP and LTD induction altered operant alcohol
      self-administration, a motivated drug-seeking behavior. We first induced LTP by
      pairing presynaptic glutamatergic stimulation with optogenetic postsynaptic
      depolarization in the dorsomedial striatum, a brain region known to control
      goal-directed behavior. Blockade of this LTP by NMDA-receptor inhibition unmasked
      an endocannabinoid-dependent LTD. In vivo application of the LTP-inducing
      protocol caused a long-lasting increase in alcohol-seeking behavior, while the
      LTD protocol decreased this behavior. We further identified that optogenetic LTP 
      and LTD induction at cortical inputs onto striatal dopamine D1
      receptor-expressing neurons controlled these behavioral changes. Our results
      demonstrate a causal link between synaptic plasticity and alcohol-seeking
      behavior and suggest that modulation of this plasticity may inspire a therapeutic
      strategy for addiction.

PG  - 447-454
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0077-5 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 has been demonstrated to delete genes in postmitotic neurons.
      Compared to the establishment of proliferative cell lines or animal strains, it
      is more challenging to acquire a highly homogeneous consequence of gene editing
      in a stable neural network. Here we show that dCas9-based CRISPR interference
      (CRISPRi) can efficiently silence genes in neurons. Using a pseudotarget fishing 
      strategy, we demonstrate that CRISPRi shows superior targeting specificity
      without detectable off-target activity. Furthermore, CRISPRi can achieve
      multiplex inactivation of genes fundamental for neurotransmitter release with
      high efficiency. By developing conditional CRISPRi tools targeting synaptotagmin 
      I (Syt1), we modified the excitatory to inhibitory balance in the dentate gyrus
      of the mouse hippocampus and found that the dentate gyrus has distinct regulatory
      roles in learning and affective processes in mice. We therefore recommend CRISPRi
      as a useful tool for more rapid investigation of gene function in the mammalian
      brain.

AB  - The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the extinction of
      emotional memories, including conditioned fear. We found that ventral hippocampal
      (vHPC) projections to the infralimbic (IL) cortex recruited
      parvalbumin-expressing interneurons to counter the expression of extinguished
      fear and promote fear relapse. Whole-cell recordings ex vivo revealed that
      optogenetic activation of vHPC input to amygdala-projecting pyramidal neurons in 
      the IL was dominated by feed-forward inhibition. Selectively silencing
      parvalbumin-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in the IL
      eliminated vHPC-mediated inhibition. In behaving rats, pharmacogenetic activation
      of vHPC-->IL projections impaired extinction recall, whereas silencing IL
      projectors diminished fear renewal. Intra-IL infusion of GABA receptor agonists
      or antagonists, respectively, reproduced these effects. Together, our findings
      describe a previously unknown circuit mechanism for the contextual control of
      fear, and indicate that vHPC-mediated inhibition of IL is an essential neural
      substrate for fear relapse.

      individuals. Lower baseline hippocampal volume was associated with increased mean
      diffusivity of the connecting hippocampal cingulum bundle (HCB). HCB diffusivity 
      predicted tau accumulation in the downstream-connected posterior cingulate cortex
      in amyloid-positive but not in amyloid-negative individuals. Furthermore, HCB
      diffusivity predicted memory decline in amyloid-positive individuals with high
      posterior cingulate cortex tau binding. Our results provide in vivo evidence that
      higher amyloid pathology strengthens the association between HCB diffusivity and 
      tau accumulation in the downstream posterior cingulate cortex and facilitates
      memory decline. This confirms amyloid's crucial role in potentiating neural
      vulnerability and memory decline marking the onset of preclinical Alzheimer's
      disease.

AB  - Adolescence is a period of social, psychological and biological development.
      During adolescence, relationships with others become more complex, peer
      relationships are paramount and social cognition develops substantially. These
      psychosocial changes are paralleled by structural and functional changes in the
      brain. Existing research in adolescent neurocognitive development has focused
      largely on averages, but this obscures meaningful individual variation in
      development. In this Perspective, we propose that the field should now move
      toward studying individual differences. We start by discussing individual
      variation in structural and functional brain development. To illustrate the
      importance of considering individual differences in development, we consider
      three sources of variation that contribute to neurocognitive processing:
      socioeconomic status, culture and peer environment. To assess individual
      differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories, large-scale longitudinal datasets
      are required. Future developmental neuroimaging studies should attempt to
      characterize individual differences to move toward a more nuanced understanding
      of neurocognitive changes during adolescence.

TI  - Striatal neurons directly converted from Huntington's disease patient fibroblasts
      recapitulate age-associated disease phenotypes.
PG  - 341-352
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0075-7 [doi]
AB  - In Huntington's disease (HD), expansion of CAG codons in the huntingtin gene
      (HTT) leads to the aberrant formation of protein aggregates and the differential 
      degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Modeling HD using
      patient-specific MSNs has been challenging, as neurons differentiated from
      induced pluripotent stem cells are free of aggregates and lack an overt cell
      death phenotype. Here we generated MSNs from HD patient fibroblasts through
      microRNA-based direct neuronal conversion, bypassing the induction of
      pluripotency and retaining age signatures of the original fibroblasts. We found
      that patient MSNs consistently exhibited mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates,
      mHTT-dependent DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous degeneration
      in culture over time. We further provide evidence that erasure of age stored in
      starting fibroblasts or neuronal conversion of presymptomatic HD patient
      fibroblasts results in differential manifestation of cellular phenotypes
      associated with HD, highlighting the importance of age in modeling late-onset
      neurological disorders.

AB  - Asthma, accompanied by lung inflammation, bronchoconstriction and airway

TI  - Medial preoptic circuit induces hunting-like actions to target objects and prey.
PG  - 364-372
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0072-x [doi]
AB  - As animals forage, they must obtain useful targets by orchestrating appropriate
      actions that range from searching to chasing, biting and carrying. Here, we
      reveal that neurons positive for the alpha subunit of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent
      kinase II (CaMKIIalpha) in the medial preoptic area (MPA) that send projections
      to the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) mediate these target-directed actions
      in mice. During photostimulation of the MPA-vPAG circuit, mice vigorously engaged
      with 3D objects and chased moving objects. When exposed to a cricket, they hunted
      down the prey and bit it to kill. By applying a head-mounted object control with 
      timely photostimulation of the MPA-vPAG circuit, we found that MPA-vPAG
      circuit-induced actions occurred only when the target was detected within the
      binocular visual field. Using this device, we successfully guided mice to
      navigate specified routes. Our study explains how the brain yields a strong
      motivation to acquire a target object along the continuum of hunting behavior.

AB  - Social animals detect the affective states of conspecifics and utilize this
      information to orchestrate social interactions. In a social affective preference 
      text in which experimental adult male rats could interact with either naive or
      stressed conspecifics, the experimental rats either approached or avoided the
      stressed conspecific, depending upon the age of the conspecific. Specifically,
      experimental rats approached stressed juveniles but avoided stressed adults.
      Inhibition of insular cortex, which is implicated in social cognition, and
      blockade of insular oxytocin receptors disrupted the social affective behaviors. 
      Oxytocin application increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic efficacy in
      acute insular cortex slices, and insular oxytocin administration recapitulated
      the behaviors observed toward stressed conspecifics. Network analysis of c-Fos
      immunoreactivity in 29 regions identified functional connectivity between insular
      cortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and the social decision-making network. These
      results implicate insular cortex as a key component in the circuit underlying
      age-dependent social responses to stressed conspecifics.

AB  - Despite rapid progresses in the genome-editing field, in vivo simultaneous
      overexpression of multiple genes remains challenging. We generated a transgenic
      mouse using an improved dCas9 system that enables simultaneous and precise in
      vivo transcriptional activation of multiple genes and long noncoding RNAs in the 
      nervous system. As proof of concept, we were able to use targeted activation of
      endogenous neurogenic genes in these transgenic mice to directly and efficiently 
      convert astrocytes into functional neurons in vivo. This system provides a
      flexible and rapid screening platform for studying complex gene networks and
      gain-of-function phenotypes in the mammalian brain.

AB  - Stress can trigger enduring changes in neural circuits and synapses. The
      behavioral and hormonal consequences of stress can also be transmitted to others,
      but whether this transmitted stress has similar effects on synapses is not known.
      We found that authentic stress and transmitted stress in mice primed
      paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone
      (CRH) neurons, enabling the induction of metaplasticity at glutamate synapses. In
      female mice that were subjected to authentic stress, this metaplasticity was
      diminished following interactions with a naive partner. Transmission from the
      stressed subject to the naive partner required the activation of PVN CRH neurons 
      in both subject and partner to drive and detect the release of a putative alarm
      pheromone from the stressed mouse. Finally, metaplasticity could be transmitted
      sequentially from the stressed subject to multiple partners. Our findings
      demonstrate that transmitted stress has the same lasting effects on glutamate
      synapses as authentic stress and reveal an unexpected role for PVN CRH neurons in
      transmitting distress signals among individuals.

AB  - Pattern separation, the ability to independently represent and store similar
      experiences, is a crucial facet of episodic memory. Growing evidence suggests
      that the hippocampus possesses unique circuitry that is computationally capable
      of resolving mnemonic interference by using pattern separation. In this Review,
      we discuss recent advances in the understanding of this process and evaluate the 
      caveats and limitations of linking across animal and human studies. We summarize 
      clinical and translational studies using methods that are sensitive to pattern
      separation impairments, an approach that stems from the fact that the hippocampus
      is a major site of disruption in many brain disorders. We critically evaluate the
      assumptions that guide fundamental and translational studies in this area.
      Finally, we suggest guidelines for future research and offer ways to overcome
      potential interpretational challenges to increase the utility of pattern
      separation as a construct that can further understanding of both memory processes
      and brain disease.

PG  - 218-227
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0064-2 [doi]
AB  - Cortical sensory maps are remodeled during early life to adapt to the surrounding
      environment. Both sensory and contextual signals are important for induction of
      this plasticity, but how these signals converge to sculpt developing
      thalamocortical circuits remains largely unknown. Here we show that layer 1 (L1) 
      of primary auditory cortex (A1) is a key hub where neuromodulatory and
      topographically organized thalamic inputs meet to tune the cortical layers below.
      Inhibitory interneurons in L1 send narrowly descending projections to
      differentially modulate thalamic drive to pyramidal and parvalbumin-expressing
      (PV) cells in L4, creating brief windows of intracolumnar activation. Silencing
      of L1 (but not VIP-expressing) cells abolishes map plasticity during the
      tonotopic critical period. Developmental transitions in nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptor (nAChR) sensitivity in these cells caused by Lynx1 protein can be
      overridden to extend critical-period closure. Notably, thalamocortical maps in L1
      are themselves stable, and serve as a scaffold for cortical plasticity throughout
      life.

TI  - N(6)-methyladenosine RNA modification regulates embryonic neural stem cell
      self-renewal through histone modifications.
PG  - 195-206
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0057-1 [doi]
AB  - Internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification is widespread in messenger
      RNAs (mRNAs) and is catalyzed by heterodimers of methyltransferase-like protein 3
      (Mettl3) and Mettl14. To understand the role of m(6)A in development, we deleted 
      Mettl14 in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model. Phenotypically,
      NSCs lacking Mettl14 displayed markedly decreased proliferation and premature
      differentiation, suggesting that m(6)A modification enhances NSC self-renewal.
      Decreases in the NSC pool led to a decreased number of late-born neurons during
      cortical neurogenesis. Mechanistically, we discovered a genome-wide increase in
      specific histone modifications in Mettl14 knockout versus control NSCs. These
      changes correlated with altered gene expression and observed cellular phenotypes,
      suggesting functional significance of altered histone modifications in knockout
      cells. Finally, we found that m(6)A regulates histone modification in part by
      destabilizing transcripts that encode histone-modifying enzymes. Our results
      suggest an essential role for m(6)A in development and reveal m(6)A-regulated
      histone modifications as a previously unknown mechanism of gene regulation in
      mammalian cells.

AB  - Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cells fire at regular spatial intervals and
      project to the hippocampus, where place cells are active in spatially restricted 
      locations. One feature of the grid population is the increase in grid spatial
      scale along the dorsal-ventral MEC axis. However, the difficulty in perturbing
      grid scale without impacting the properties of other functionally defined MEC
      cell types has obscured how grid scale influences hippocampal coding and spatial 
      memory. Here we use a targeted viral approach to knock out HCN1 channels
      selectively in MEC, causing the grid scale to expand while leaving other MEC
      spatial and velocity signals intact. Grid scale expansion resulted in place scale
      expansion in fields located far from environmental boundaries, reduced long-term 
      place field stability and impaired spatial learning. These observations, combined
      with simulations of a grid-to-place cell model and position decoding of place
      cells, illuminate how grid scale impacts place coding and spatial memory.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0056-2 [doi]
AB  - The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is a brain region in which neurogenesis
      persists into adulthood; however, the relationship between developmental and
      adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis has not been examined in detail. Here we used
      single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of
      dentate gyrus cell types in perinatal, juvenile, and adult mice. We found
      distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient
      intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. We
      observed shifts in the molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial
      glia and granule cells during the postnatal period that were then maintained
      through adult stages. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts,
      and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These
      findings demonstrate the fundamental similarity of postnatal and adult
      neurogenesis in the hippocampus and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation
      of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0059-z [doi]
AB  - A diet rich in salt is linked to an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases
      and dementia, but it remains unclear how dietary salt harms the brain. We report 
      that, in mice, excess dietary salt suppresses resting cerebral blood flow and
      endothelial function, leading to cognitive impairment. The effect depends on
      expansion of TH17 cells in the small intestine, resulting in a marked increase in
      plasma interleukin-17 (IL-17). Circulating IL-17, in turn, promotes endothelial
      dysfunction and cognitive impairment by the Rho kinase-dependent inhibitory
      phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and reduced nitric oxide
      production in cerebral endothelial cells. The findings reveal a new gut-brain
      axis linking dietary habits to cognitive impairment through a gut-initiated
      adaptive immune response compromising brain function via circulating IL-17. Thus,
      the TH17 cell-IL-17 pathway is a putative target to counter the deleterious brain
      effects induced by dietary salt and other diseases associated with TH17
      polarization.

TI  - Dentate network activity is necessary for spatial working memory by supporting
      CA3 sharp-wave ripple generation and prospective firing of CA3 neurons.

AB  - Complex spatial working memory tasks have been shown to require both hippocampal 
      sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity and dentate gyrus (DG) neuronal activity. We
      therefore asked whether DG inputs to CA3 contribute to spatial working memory by 
      promoting SWR generation. Recordings from DG and CA3 while rats performed a
      dentate-dependent working memory task on an eight-arm radial maze revealed that
      the activity of dentate neurons and the incidence rate of SWRs both increased
      during reward consumption. We then found reduced reward-related CA3 SWR
      generation without direct input from dentate granule neurons. Furthermore, CA3
      cells with place fields in not-yet-visited arms preferentially fired during SWRs 
      at reward locations, and these prospective CA3 firing patterns were more
      pronounced for correct trials and were dentate-dependent. These results indicate 
      that coordination of CA3 neuronal activity patterns by DG is necessary for the
      generation of neuronal firing patterns that support goal-directed behavior and
      memory.

AB  - In the past three decades, our understanding of brain-behavior relationships has 
      been significantly shaped by research using non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)
      techniques. These methods allow non-invasive and safe modulation of neural
      processes in the healthy brain, enabling researchers to directly study how
      experimentally altered neural activity causally affects behavior. This unique
      property of NIBS methods has, on the one hand, led to groundbreaking findings on 
      the brain basis of various aspects of behavior and has raised interest in
      possible clinical and practical applications of these methods. On the other hand,
      it has also triggered increasingly critical debates about the properties and
      possible limitations of these methods. In this review, we discuss these issues,
      clarify the challenges associated with the use of currently available NIBS
      techniques for basic research and practical applications, and provide
      recommendations for studies using NIBS techniques to establish brain-behavior
      relationships.

AB  - Entorhinal grid cells map the local environment, but their involvement beyond
      spatial navigation remains elusive. We examined human functional MRI responses
      during a highly controlled visual tracking task and show that entorhinal cortex
      exhibited a sixfold rotationally symmetric signal encoding gaze direction. Our
      results provide evidence for a grid-like entorhinal code for visual space and
      suggest a more general role of the entorhinal grid system in coding information
      along continuous dimensions.

PG  - 207-217
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0053-5 [doi]
AB  - The formation of the vertebrate brain requires the generation, migration,
      differentiation and survival of neurons. Genetic mutations that perturb these
      critical cellular events can result in malformations of the telencephalon,
      providing a molecular window into brain development. Here we report the
      identification of an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mouse mutant characterized by 
      a fractured hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, attributable to defects in neuronal
      migration. We show that this is caused by a hypomorphic mutation in Vps15 that
      perturbs endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and autophagy, resulting in an
      upregulation of Nischarin, which inhibits Pak1 signaling. The complete ablation
      of Vps15 results in the accumulation of autophagic substrates, the induction of
      apoptosis and severe cortical atrophy. Finally, we report that mutations in VPS15
      are associated with cortical atrophy and epilepsy in humans. These data highlight
      the importance of the Vps15-Vps34 complex and the Nischarin-Pak1 signaling hub in
      the development of the telencephalon.

TI  - TDP-43 pathology disrupts nuclear pore complexes and nucleocytoplasmic transport 
      in ALS/FTD.

AB  - The cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43
      (TDP-43) is a common histopathological hallmark of the amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia disease spectrum (ALS/FTD). However, the
      composition of aggregates and their contribution to the disease process remain
      unknown. Here we used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to
      interrogate the interactome of detergent-insoluble TDP-43 aggregates and found
      them enriched for components of the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic
      transport machinery. Aggregated and disease-linked mutant TDP-43 triggered the
      sequestration and/or mislocalization of nucleoporins and transport factors, and
      interfered with nuclear protein import and RNA export in mouse primary cortical
      neurons, human fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons.
      Nuclear pore pathology is present in brain tissue in cases of sporadic ALS and
      those involving genetic mutations in TARDBP and C9orf72. Our data strongly
      implicate TDP-43-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport defects as a common disease
      mechanism in ALS/FTD.

AB  - A neuron that extracts directionally selective motion information from upstream
      signals lacking this selectivity must compare visual responses from spatially
      offset inputs. Distinguishing among prevailing algorithmic models for this
      computation requires measuring fast neuronal activity and inhibition. In the
      Drosophila melanogaster visual system, a fourth-order neuron-T4-is the first cell
      type in the ON pathway to exhibit directionally selective signals. Here we use in
      vivo whole-cell recordings of T4 to show that directional selectivity originates 
      from simple integration of spatially offset fast excitatory and slow inhibitory
      inputs, resulting in a suppression of responses to the nonpreferred motion
      direction. We constructed a passive, conductance-based model of a T4 cell that
      accurately predicts the neuron's response to moving stimuli. These results
      connect the known circuit anatomy of the motion pathway to the algorithmic
      mechanism by which the direction of motion is computed.

      medial frontal cortex.
PG  - 283-289
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0051-7 [doi]
AB  - The medial frontal cortex, including anterior midcingulate cortex, has been
      linked to multiple psychological domains, including cognitive control, pain, and 
      emotion. However, it is unclear whether this region encodes representations of
      these domains that are generalizable across studies and subdomains. Additionally,
      if there are generalizable representations, do they reflect a single underlying
      process shared across domains or multiple domain-specific processes? We
      decomposed multivariate patterns of functional MRI activity from 270 participants
      across 18 studies into study-specific, subdomain-specific, and domain-specific
      components and identified latent multivariate representations that generalized
      across subdomains but were specific to each domain. Pain representations were
      localized to anterior midcingulate cortex, negative emotion representations to
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and cognitive control representations to portions
      of the dorsal midcingulate. These findings provide evidence for medial frontal
      cortex representations that generalize across studies and subdomains but are
      specific to distinct psychological domains rather than reducible to a single
      underlying process.

TI  - Reducing the RNA binding protein TIA1 protects against tau-mediated
      neurodegeneration in vivo.
PG  - 72-80
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0022-z [doi]
AB  - Emerging studies suggest a role for tau in regulating the biology of RNA binding 
      proteins (RBPs). We now show that reducing the RBP T-cell intracellular antigen 1
      (TIA1) in vivo protects against neurodegeneration and prolongs survival in
      transgenic P301S Tau mice. Biochemical fractionation shows co-enrichment and
      co-localization of tau oligomers and RBPs in transgenic P301S Tau mice. Reducing 
      TIA1 decreased the number and size of granules co-localizing with stress granule 
      markers. Decreasing TIA1 also inhibited the accumulation of tau oligomers at the 
      expense of increasing neurofibrillary tangles. Despite the increase in
      neurofibrillary tangles, TIA1 reduction increased neuronal survival and rescued
      behavioral deficits and lifespan. These data provide in vivo evidence that TIA1
      plays a key role in mediating toxicity and further suggest that RBPs direct the
      pathway of tau aggregation and the resulting neurodegeneration. We propose a
      model in which dysfunction of the translational stress response leads to
      tau-mediated pathology.

AB  - Injury or disease to the CNS results in multifaceted cellular and molecular
      responses. One such response, the glial scar, is a structural formation of
      reactive glia around an area of severe tissue damage. While traditionally viewed 
      as a barrier to axon regeneration, beneficial functions of the glial scar have
      also been recently identified. In this Perspective, we discuss the divergent
      roles of the glial scar during CNS regeneration and explore the possibility that 
      these disparities are due to functional heterogeneity within the cells of the
      glial scar-specifically, astrocytes, NG2 glia and microglia.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0032-x [doi]
AB  - Delay discounting (DD), the tendency to discount the value of delayed versus
      current rewards, is elevated in a constellation of diseases and behavioral
      conditions. We performed a genome-wide association study of DD using 23,127
      research participants of European ancestry. The most significantly associated
      single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs6528024 (P = 2.40 x 10(-8)), which is
      located in an intron of the gene GPM6B. We also showed that 12% of the variance
      in DD was accounted for by genotype and that the genetic signature of DD
      overlapped with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, major
      depression, smoking, personality, cognition and body weight.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0040-x [doi]
AB  - During myelination, individual oligodendrocytes initially over-produce short
      myelin sheaths, which are either retracted or stabilized. By live-imaging
      oligodendrocyte Ca(2+) activity in vivo, we find that high-amplitude,
      long-duration Ca(2+) transients in sheaths prefigure retractions, mediated by
      calpain. Following stabilization, myelin sheaths grow along axons, and we find
      that higher-frequency Ca(2+) transient activity in sheaths precedes faster
      elongation. Our data implicate local Ca(2+) signaling in regulating distinct
      stages of myelination.

TI  - Synaptotagmin-1 drives synchronous Ca(2+)-triggered fusion by C2B-domain-mediated
      synaptic-vesicle-membrane attachment.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0037-5 [doi]
AB  - The synaptic vesicle (SV) protein synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is the Ca(2+) sensor for
      fast synchronous release. Biochemical and structural data suggest that Syt1
      interacts with phospholipids and SNARE complex, but the manner in which these
      interactions translate into SV fusion remains poorly understood. Using
      flash-and-freeze electron microscopy, which triggers action potentials with light
      and coordinately arrests synaptic structures with rapid freezing, we found that
      synchronous-release-impairing mutations in the Syt1 C2B domain (K325, 327; R398, 
      399) also disrupt SV-active-zone plasma-membrane attachment. Single action
      potential induction rescued membrane attachment in these mutants within less than
      10 ms through activation of the Syt1 Ca(2+)-binding site. The rapid SV membrane
      translocation temporarily correlates with resynchronization of release and paired
      pulse facilitation. On the basis of these findings, we redefine the role of Syt1 
      as part of the Ca(2+)-dependent vesicle translocation machinery and propose that 
      Syt1 enables fast neurotransmitter release by means of its dynamic membrane
      attachment activities.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) at glutamatergic synapses are
      intensively investigated processes for understanding the synaptic basis for
      learning and memory, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly
      understood. We have made three mouse lines where the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of
      endogenous AMPA receptors (AMPARs), the principal mediators of fast excitatory
      synaptic transmission, are specifically exchanged. These mice display profound
      deficits in synaptic plasticity without any effects on basal synaptic
      transmission. Our study reveals that the CTDs of GluA1 and GluA2, the key
      subunits of AMPARs, are necessary and sufficient to drive NMDA receptor-dependent
      LTP and LTD, respectively. In addition, these domains exert differential effects 
      on spatial and contextual learning and memory. These results establish dominant
      roles of AMPARs in governing bidirectional synaptic and behavioral plasticity in 
      the CNS.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0039-3 [doi]
AB  - Path integration (PI) is a highly conserved, self-motion-based navigation
      strategy. Since the discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex,
      neurophysiological data and computational models have suggested that these
      neurons serve PI. However, more direct empirical evidence supporting this
      hypothesis has been missing due to a lack of selective manipulations of grid cell
      activity and suitable behavioral assessments. Here we report that selective
      disruption of grid cell activity in mice can be achieved by removing NMDA
      glutamate receptors from the retro-hippocampal region and that disrupted grid
      cell firing accounts for impaired PI performance. Notably, the genetic
      manipulation did not affect the activity of other spatially selective cells in
      the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. By directly linking grid cell
      activity to PI, these results contribute to a better understanding of how grid
      cells support navigation and spatial memory.

AB  - Activity-dependent transcriptional responses shape cortical function. However, a 
      comprehensive understanding of the diversity of these responses across the full
      range of cortical cell types, and how these changes contribute to neuronal
      plasticity and disease, is lacking. To investigate the breadth of transcriptional
      changes that occur across cell types in the mouse visual cortex after exposure to
      light, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified
      significant and divergent transcriptional responses to stimulation in each of the
      30 cell types characterized, thus revealing 611 stimulus-responsive genes.
      Excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibited inter- and intralaminar heterogeneity in
      the induction of stimulus-responsive genes. Non-neuronal cells showed clear
      transcriptional responses that may regulate experience-dependent changes in
      neurovascular coupling and myelination. Together, these results reveal the
      dynamic landscape of the stimulus-dependent transcriptional changes occurring
      across cell types in the visual cortex; these changes are probably critical for
      cortical function and may be sites of deregulation in developmental brain
      disorders.

PG  - 63-71
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0038-4 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence support a causal link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection
      during gestation and congenital microcephaly. However, the mechanism of
      ZIKV-associated microcephaly remains unclear. We combined analyses of
      ZIKV-infected human fetuses, cultured human neural stem cells and mouse embryos
      to understand how ZIKV induces microcephaly. We show that ZIKV triggers
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response in the cerebral cortex
      of infected postmortem human fetuses as well as in cultured human neural stem
      cells. After intracerebral and intraplacental inoculation of ZIKV in mouse
      embryos, we show that it triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress in embryonic
      brains in vivo. This perturbs a physiological unfolded protein response within
      cortical progenitors that controls neurogenesis. Thus, ZIKV-infected progenitors 
      generate fewer projection neurons that eventually settle in the cerebral cortex, 
      whereupon sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to apoptosis. Furthermore,
      we demonstrate that administration of pharmacological inhibitors of unfolded
      protein response counteracts these pathophysiological mechanisms and prevents
      microcephaly in ZIKV-infected mouse embryos. Such defects are specific to ZIKV,
      as they are not observed upon intraplacental injection of other related
      flaviviruses in mice.

AB  - How action potentials regulate myelination by oligodendrocytes is uncertain. We
      show that neuronal activity raises [Ca(2+)]i in developing oligodendrocytes in
      vivo and that myelin sheath elongation is promoted by a high frequency of
      [Ca(2+)]i transients and prevented by [Ca(2+)]i buffering. Sheath elongation
      occurs ~1 h after [Ca(2+)]i elevation. Sheath shortening is associated with a low
      frequency of [Ca(2+)]i transients but with longer duration [Ca(2+)]i bursts.
      Thus, [Ca(2+)]i controls myelin sheath development.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0036-6 [doi]
AB  - Natural environments are represented by local maps of grid cells and place cells 
      that are stitched together. The manner by which transitions between map fragments
      are generated is unknown. We recorded grid cells while rats were trained in two
      rectangular compartments, A and B (each 1 m x 2 m), separated by a wall. Once
      distinct grid maps were established in each environment, we removed the partition
      and allowed the rat to explore the merged environment (2 m x 2 m). The grid
      patterns were largely retained along the distal walls of the box. Nearer the
      former partition line, individual grid fields changed location, resulting almost 
      immediately in local spatial periodicity and continuity between the two original 
      maps. Grid cells belonging to the same grid module retained phase relationships
      during the transformation. Thus, when environments are merged, grid fields
      reorganize rapidly to establish spatial periodicity in the area where the
      environments meet.

TI  - Synaptic weight set by Munc13-1 supramolecular assemblies.
PG  - 41-49
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0041-9 [doi]
AB  - The weight of synaptic connections, which is controlled not only postsynaptically
      but also presynaptically, is a key determinant in neuronal network dynamics. The 
      mechanisms controlling synaptic weight, especially on the presynaptic side,
      remain elusive. Using single-synapse imaging of the neurotransmitter glutamate
      combined with super-resolution imaging of presynaptic proteins, we identify a
      presynaptic mechanism for setting weight in central glutamatergic synapses. In
      the presynaptic terminal, Munc13-1 molecules form multiple and discrete
      supramolecular self-assemblies that serve as independent vesicular release sites 
      by recruiting syntaxin-1, a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment 
      receptor (SNARE) protein essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The
      multiplicity of these Munc13-1 assemblies affords multiple stable states
      conferring presynaptic weight, potentially encoding several bits of information
      at individual synapses. Supramolecular assembling enables a stable synaptic
      weight, which confers robustness of synaptic computation on neuronal circuits and
      may be a general mechanism by which biological processes operate despite the
      presence of molecular noise.

PG  - 139-149
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0027-7 [doi]
AB  - To deconstruct the architecture and function of brain circuits, it is necessary
      to generate maps of neuronal connectivity and activity on a whole-brain scale.
      New methods now enable large-scale mapping of the mouse brain at cellular and
      subcellular resolution. We developed a framework to automatically annotate,
      analyze, visualize and easily share whole-brain data at cellular resolution,
      based on a scale-invariant, interactive mouse brain atlas. This framework enables
      connectivity and mapping projects in individual laboratories and across imaging
      platforms, as well as multiplexed quantitative information on the molecular
      identity of single neurons. As a proof of concept, we generated a comparative
      connectivity map of five major neuron types in the corticostriatal circuit, as
      well as an activity-based map to identify hubs mediating the behavioral effects
      of cocaine. Thus, this computational framework provides the necessary tools to
      generate brain maps that integrate data from connectivity, neuron identity and
      function.

TI  - Flexible timing by temporal scaling of cortical responses.
PG  - 102-110
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0028-6 [doi]
AB  - Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can control the cadence of
      their speech, and children can flexibly vary their temporal expectations of
      events. To understand the neural basis of such flexibility, we recorded from the 
      medial frontal cortex of nonhuman primates trained to produce different time
      intervals with different effectors. Neural responses were heterogeneous,
      nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable form of temporal
      invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally scaled to match the produced
      intervals. Recording from downstream neurons in the caudate and from thalamic
      neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex indicated that this phenomenon
      originates within cortical networks. Recurrent neural network models trained to
      perform the task revealed that temporal scaling emerges from nonlinearities in
      the network and that the degree of scaling is controlled by the strength of
      external input. These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism for
      conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and cognitive functions.

AB  - The postsynaptic proteome of excitatory synapses comprises ~1,000 highly
      conserved proteins that control the behavioral repertoire, and mutations
      disrupting their function cause >130 brain diseases. Here, we document the
      composition of postsynaptic proteomes in human neocortical regions and integrate 
      it with genetic, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging, positron
      emission tomography imaging, and behavioral data. Neocortical regions show
      signatures of expression of individual proteins, protein complexes, biochemical
      and metabolic pathways. We characterized the compositional signatures in brain
      regions involved with language, emotion and memory functions. Integrating
      large-scale GWAS with regional proteome data identifies the same cortical region 
      for smoking behavior as found with fMRI data. The neocortical postsynaptic
      proteome data resource can be used to link genetics to brain imaging and
      behavior, and to study the role of postsynaptic proteins in localization of brain
      functions.

PG  - 111-119
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0024-x [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication,
      often attributed to misreading of emotional cues. Why individuals with ASD
      misread emotions remains unclear. Given that terrestrial mammals rely on their
      sense of smell to read conspecific emotions, we hypothesized that misreading of
      emotional cues in ASD partially reflects altered social chemosignaling. We found 
      no difference between typically developed (TD) and cognitively able adults with
      ASD at explicit detection and perception of social chemosignals. Nevertheless, TD
      and ASD participants dissociated in their responses to subliminal presentation of
      these same compounds: the undetected 'smell of fear' (skydiver sweat) increased
      physiological arousal and reduced explicit and implicit measures of trust in TD
      but acted opposite in ASD participants. Moreover, two different undetected
      synthetic putative social chemosignals increased or decreased arousal in TD but
      acted opposite in ASD participants. These results implicate social chemosignaling
      as a sensory substrate of social impairment in ASD.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0023-y [doi]
AB  - Excitation of accumbal D2 cells governs vital actions, including avoidance of
      learned risks, but the origins of this excitation and roles of D2 cells in innate
      risk-avoidance are unclear. Hypothalamic neurons producing orexins (also called
      hypocretins) enhance innate risk-avoidance via poorly understood neurocircuits.
      We describe a direct orexin-->D2 excitatory circuit and show that D2 cell
      activity is necessary for orexin-dependent innate risk-avoidance in mice, thus
      revealing an unsuspected hypothalamus-accumbens interplay in action selection.

PG  - 1752-1760
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0010-3 [doi]
AB  - Studies suggest that heightened peripheral inflammation contributes to the
      pathogenesis of major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of chronic 
      social defeat stress, a mouse model of depression, on blood-brain barrier (BBB)
      permeability and infiltration of peripheral immune signals. We found reduced
      expression of the endothelial cell tight junction protein claudin-5 (Cldn5) and
      abnormal blood vessel morphology in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of stress-susceptible
      but not resilient mice. CLDN5 expression was also decreased in NAc of depressed
      patients. Cldn5 downregulation was sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors
      following subthreshold social stress whereas chronic antidepressant treatment
      rescued Cldn5 loss and promoted resilience. Reduced BBB integrity in NAc of
      stress-susceptible or mice injected with adeno-associated virus expressing shRNA 
      against Cldn5 caused infiltration of the peripheral cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      into brain parenchyma and subsequent expression of depression-like behaviors.
      These findings suggest that chronic social stress alters BBB integrity through
      loss of tight junction protein Cldn5, promoting peripheral IL-6 passage across
      the BBB and depression.

AB  - Brain regions that regulate fluid satiation are not well characterized, yet are
      essential for understanding fluid homeostasis. We found that
      oxytocin-receptor-expressing neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of mice
      (Oxtr(PBN) neurons) are key regulators of fluid satiation. Chemogenetic
      activation of Oxtr(PBN) neurons robustly suppressed noncaloric fluid intake, but 
      did not decrease food intake after fasting or salt intake following salt
      depletion; inactivation increased saline intake after dehydration and hypertonic 
      saline injection. Under physiological conditions, Oxtr(PBN) neurons were
      activated by fluid satiation and hypertonic saline injection. Oxtr(PBN) neurons
      were directly innervated by oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus 
      (Oxt(PVH) neurons), which mildly attenuated fluid intake. Activation of neurons
      in the nucleus of the solitary tract substantially suppressed fluid intake and
      activated Oxtr(PBN) neurons. Our results suggest that Oxtr(PBN) neurons act as a 
      key node in the fluid satiation neurocircuitry, which acts to decrease water
      and/or saline intake to prevent or attenuate hypervolemia and hypernatremia.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0020-1 [doi]
AB  - Cognition can be conceptualized as a set of algorithmic control functions whose
      real-time deployment determines how an organism stores and uses information to
      guide thought and action. A subset of these functions is required for
      goal-directed selection and amplification of sensory signals-broadly referred to 
      as attention-and for its flexible control and its interaction with processes such
      as working memory and decision making. While the contribution of recurrent
      cortical microcircuits to cognition has been extensively studied, the role of the
      thalamus is just beginning to be elucidated. Here we highlight recent studies
      across rodents and primates showing how thalamus contributes to attentional
      control. In addition to high-fidelity information relay to or between cortical
      regions, thalamic circuits shift and sustain functional interactions within and
      across cortical areas. This thalamic process enables rapid coordination of
      spatially segregated cortical computations, thereby constructing task-relevant
      functional networks. Because such function may be critical for cognitive
      flexibility, clarifying its mechanisms will likely expand our basic understanding
      of cognitive control and its perturbation in disease.

TI  - A craniofacial-specific monosynaptic circuit enables heightened affective pain.
PG  - 1734-1743
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0012-1 [doi]
AB  - Humans often rank craniofacial pain as more severe than body pain. Evidence
      suggests that a stimulus of the same intensity induces stronger pain in the face 
      than in the body. However, the underlying neural circuitry for the differential
      processing of facial versus bodily pain remains unknown. Interestingly, the
      lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBL), a critical node in the affective pain
      circuit, is activated more strongly by noxious stimulation of the face than of
      the hindpaw. Using a novel activity-dependent technology called CANE developed in
      our laboratory, we identified and selectively labeled noxious-stimulus-activated 
      PBL neurons and performed comprehensive anatomical input-output mapping.
      Surprisingly, we uncovered a hitherto uncharacterized monosynaptic connection
      between cranial sensory neurons and the PBL-nociceptive neurons. Optogenetic
      activation of this monosynaptic craniofacial-to-PBL projection induced robust
      escape and avoidance behaviors and stress calls, whereas optogenetic silencing
      specifically reduced facial nociception. The monosynaptic circuit revealed here
      provides a neural substrate for heightened craniofacial affective pain.

AB  - Optogenetic control of individual neurons with high temporal precision within
      intact mammalian brain circuitry would enable powerful explorations of how neural
      circuits operate. Two-photon computer-generated holography enables precise
      sculpting of light and could in principle enable simultaneous illumination of
      many neurons in a network, with the requisite temporal precision to simulate
      accurate neural codes. We designed a high-efficacy soma-targeted opsin, finding
      that fusing the N-terminal 150 residues of kainate receptor subunit 2 (KA2) to
      the recently discovered high-photocurrent channelrhodopsin CoChR restricted
      expression of this opsin primarily to the cell body of mammalian cortical
      neurons. In combination with two-photon holographic stimulation, we found that
      this somatic CoChR (soCoChR) enabled photostimulation of individual cells in
      mouse cortical brain slices with single-cell resolution and <1-ms temporal
      precision. We used soCoChR to perform connectivity mapping on intact cortical
      circuits.

      dominance plasticity in adult mice.

LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0021-0 [doi]
AB  - Experience-dependent plasticity in the mature visual system is widely considered 
      to be cortical. Using chronic two-photon Ca(2+) imaging of thalamic afferents in 
      layer 1 of binocular visual cortex, we provide evidence against this tenet: the
      respective dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) cells showed pronounced
      ocular dominance (OD) shifts after monocular deprivation in adult mice. Most
      (86%), but not all, of dLGN cell boutons were monocular during normal visual
      experience. Following deprivation, initially deprived-eye-dominated boutons
      reduced or lost their visual responsiveness to that eye and frequently became
      responsive to the non-deprived eye. This cannot be explained by eye-specific
      cortical changes propagating to dLGN via cortico-thalamic feedback because the
      shift in dLGN responses was largely resistant to cortical inactivation using the 
      GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Our data suggest that OD shifts observed in the 
      binocular visual cortex of adult mice may at least partially reflect plasticity
      of eye-specific inputs onto dLGN neurons.

AB  - Detailed observations of transcriptional, translational and post-translational
      events in the human brain are essential to improving our understanding of its
      development, function and vulnerability to disease. Here, we exploited label-free
      quantitative tandem mass-spectrometry to create an in-depth proteomic survey of
      regions of the postnatal human brain, ranging in age from early infancy to
      adulthood. Integration of protein data with existing matched whole-transcriptome 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) from the BrainSpan project revealed varied patterns of
      protein-RNA relationships, with generally increased magnitudes of protein
      abundance differences between brain regions compared to RNA. Many of the
      differences amplified in protein data were reflective of cytoarchitectural and
      functional variation between brain regions. Comparing structurally similar
      cortical regions revealed significant differences in the abundances of
      receptor-associated and resident plasma membrane proteins that were not readily
      observed in the RNA expression data.

AB  - Spontaneous fluctuations in hemodynamic signals in the absence of a task or overt
      stimulation are used to infer neural activity. We tested this coupling by
      simultaneously measuring neural activity and changes in cerebral blood volume
      (CBV) in the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during periods of
      true rest and during whisker stimulation and volitional whisking. We found that
      neurovascular coupling was similar across states and that large, spontaneous CBV 
      changes in the absence of sensory input were driven by volitional whisker and
      body movements. Hemodynamic signals during periods of rest were weakly correlated
      with neural activity. Spontaneous fluctuations in CBV and vessel diameter
      persisted when local neural spiking and glutamatergic input were blocked, as well
      as during blockade of noradrenergic receptors, suggesting a non-neuronal origin
      for spontaneous CBV fluctuations. Spontaneous hemodynamic signals reflect a
      combination of behavior, local neural activity, and putatively non-neural
      processes.

AB  - Haploinsufficiency of the AT-rich interactive domain 1B (ARID1B) gene causes
      autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability; however, the
      neurobiological basis for this is unknown. Here we generated Arid1b-knockout mice
      and examined heterozygotes to model human patients. Arid1b-heterozygous mice
      showed a decreased number of cortical GABAergic interneurons and reduced
      proliferation of interneuron progenitors in the ganglionic eminence. Arid1b
      haploinsufficiency also led to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory
      synapses in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we found that Arid1b
      haploinsufficiency suppressed histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) overall
      and particularly reduced H3K9ac of the Pvalb promoter, resulting in decreased
      transcription. Arid1b-heterozygous mice exhibited abnormal cognitive and social
      behaviors, which were rescued by treatment with a positive allosteric GABAA
      receptor modulator. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Arid1b in
      interneuron development and behavior and provide insight into the pathogenesis of
      autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability.

AB  - Experience-driven synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala is thought to
      underlie the formation of associations between sensory stimuli and an ensuing
      threat. However, how the central amygdala participates in such a learning process
      remains unclear. Here we show that PKC-delta-expressing central amygdala neurons 
      are essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral
      amygdala, as they convey information about the unconditioned stimulus to lateral 
      amygdala neurons during fear conditioning.

AB  - The valuation of food is a fundamental component of our decision-making. Yet
      little is known about how value signals for food and other rewards are
      constructed by the brain. Using a food-based decision task in human participants,
      we found that subjective values can be predicted from beliefs about constituent
      nutritive attributes of food: protein, fat, carbohydrates and vitamin content.
      Multivariate analyses of functional MRI data demonstrated that, while food value 
      is represented in patterns of neural activity in both medial and lateral parts of
      the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), only the lateral OFC represents the elemental
      nutritive attributes. Effective connectivity analyses further indicate that
      information about the nutritive attributes represented in the lateral OFC is
      integrated within the medial OFC to compute an overall value. These findings
      provide a mechanistic account for the construction of food value from its
      constituent nutrients.

AB  - Cerebellar abnormalities, particularly in Right Crus I (RCrusI), are consistently
      reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although RCrusI is functionally
      connected with ASD-implicated circuits, the contribution of RCrusI dysfunction to
      ASD remains unclear. Here neuromodulation of RCrusI in neurotypical humans
      resulted in altered functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule,
      and children with ASD showed atypical functional connectivity in this circuit.
      Atypical RCrusI-inferior parietal lobule structural connectivity was also evident
      in the Purkinje neuron (PN) TscI ASD mouse model. Additionally, chemogenetically 
      mediated inhibition of RCrusI PN activity in mice was sufficient to generate
      ASD-related social, repetitive, and restricted behaviors, while stimulation of
      RCrusI PNs rescued social impairment in the PN TscI ASD mouse model. Together,
      these studies reveal important roles for RCrusI in ASD-related behaviors.
      Further, the rescue of social behaviors in an ASD mouse model suggests that
      investigation of the therapeutic potential of cerebellar neuromodulation in ASD
      may be warranted.

TI  - Thalamic inhibition regulates critical-period plasticity in visual cortex and

PG  - 1715-1721
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0002-3 [doi]
AB  - During critical periods of development, experience shapes cortical circuits,
      resulting in the acquisition of functions used throughout life. The classic
      example of critical-period plasticity is ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, which 
      optimizes binocular vision but can reduce the responsiveness of the primary
      visual cortex (V1) to an eye providing low-grade visual input. The onset of the
      critical period of OD plasticity involves the maturation of inhibitory synapses
      within V1, specifically those containing the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. Here 
      we show that thalamic relay neurons in mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus
      (dLGN) also undergo OD plasticity. This process depends on thalamic
      alpha1-containing synapses and is required for consolidation of the OD shift in
      V1 during long-term deprivation. Our findings demonstrate that thalamic
      inhibitory circuits play a central role in the regulation of the critical period.
      This has far-reaching consequences for the interpretation of studies
      investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating critical periods
      of brain development.

      mechanism for animal nociception.

AB  - All animals must detect noxious stimuli to initiate protective behavior, but the 
      evolutionary origin of nociceptive systems is not well understood. Here we show
      that noxious heat and irritant chemicals elicit robust escape behaviors in the
      planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and that the conserved ion channel TRPA1 is
      required for these responses. TRPA1-mutant Drosophila flies are also defective in
      noxious-heat responses. We find that either planarian or human TRPA1 can restore 
      noxious-heat avoidance to TRPA1-mutant Drosophila, although neither is directly
      activated by heat. Instead, our data suggest that TRPA1 activation is mediated by
      H2O2 and reactive oxygen species, early markers of tissue damage rapidly produced
      as a result of heat exposure. Together, our data reveal a core function for TRPA1
      in noxious heat transduction, demonstrate its conservation from planarians to
      humans, and imply that animal nociceptive systems may share a common ancestry,
      tracing back to a progenitor that lived more than 500 million years ago.

TI  - Mixed selectivity morphs population codes in prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 1770-1779
LID - 10.1038/s41593-017-0003-2 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex maintains working memory information in the presence of
      distracting stimuli. It has long been thought that sustained activity in
      individual neurons or groups of neurons was responsible for maintaining
      information in the form of a persistent, stable code. Here we show that, upon the
      presentation of a distractor, information in the lateral prefrontal cortex was
      reorganized into a different pattern of activity to create a morphed stable code 
      without losing information. In contrast, the code in the frontal eye fields
      persisted across different delay periods but exhibited substantial instability
      and information loss after the presentation of a distractor. We found that
      neurons with mixed-selective responses were necessary and sufficient for the
      morphing of code and that these neurons were more abundant in the lateral
      prefrontal cortex than the frontal eye fields. This suggests that mixed
      selectivity provides populations with code-morphing capability, a property that
      may underlie cognitive flexibility.

TI  - The hippocampus as a predictive map.
PG  - 1643-1653
LID - 10.1038/nn.4650 [doi]
AB  - A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function,
      embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space.
      However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity and policy dependence
      in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We
      approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of
      spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that 
      the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation
      captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional
      view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode 
      a low-dimensionality basis set for the predictive representation, useful for
      suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for
      hierarchical planning.

TI  - Cellular and oscillatory substrates of fear extinction learning.
PG  - 1624-1633
LID - 10.1038/nn.4651 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian brain contains dedicated circuits for both the learned expression
      and suppression of fear. These circuits require precise coordination to
      facilitate the appropriate expression of fear behavior, but the mechanisms
      underlying this coordination remain unclear. Using a combination of
      chemogenetics, activity-based neuronal-ensemble labeling and in vivo
      electrophysiology, we found that fear extinction learning confers on
      parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) a
      dedicated role in the selective suppression of a previously encoded fear memory
      and BLA fear-encoding neurons. In addition, following extinction learning, PV
      interneurons enable a competing interaction between a 6-12 Hz oscillation and a
      fear-associated 3-6 Hz oscillation within the BLA. Loss of this competition
      increases a 3-6 Hz oscillatory signature, with BLA-->medial prefrontal cortex
      directionality signaling the recurrence of fear expression. The discovery of
      cellular and oscillatory substrates of fear extinction learning that critically
      depend on BLA PV interneurons could inform therapies aimed at preventing the
      pathological recurrence of fear following extinction learning.

TI  - Synapse-specific astrocyte gating of amygdala-related behavior.
PG  - 1540-1548
LID - 10.1038/nn.4649 [doi]
AB  - The amygdala plays key roles in fear and anxiety. Studies of the amygdala have
      largely focused on neuronal function and connectivity. Astrocytes functionally
      interact with neurons, but their role in the amygdala remains largely unknown. We
      show that astrocytes in the medial subdivision of the central amygdala (CeM)
      determine the synaptic and behavioral outputs of amygdala circuits. To
      investigate the role of astrocytes in amygdala-related behavior and identify the 
      underlying synaptic mechanisms, we used exogenous or endogenous signaling to
      selectively activate CeM astrocytes. Astrocytes depressed excitatory synapses
      from basolateral amygdala via A1 adenosine receptor activation and enhanced
      inhibitory synapses from the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala via A2A 
      receptor activation. Furthermore, astrocytic activation decreased the firing rate
      of CeM neurons and reduced fear expression in a fear-conditioning paradigm.
      Therefore, we conclude that astrocyte activity determines fear responses by
      selectively regulating specific synapses, which indicates that animal behavior
      results from the coordinated activity of neurons and astrocytes.

PG  - 1569-1579
LID - 10.1038/nn.4648 [doi]
AB  - Synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are
      neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of
      alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies.
      Prefibrillar soluble aSyn oligomers, rather than larger inclusions, are currently
      considered to be crucial species underlying synaptic dysfunction. We identified
      the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) as a key mediator in aSyn-induced synaptic
      impairment. The aSyn-associated impairment of long-term potentiation was blocked 
      in Prnp null mice and rescued following PrP(C) blockade. We found that
      extracellular aSyn oligomers formed a complex with PrP(C) that induced the
      phosphorylation of Fyn kinase via metabotropic glutamate receptors 5 (mGluR5).
      aSyn engagement of PrP(C) and Fyn activated NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and altered
      calcium homeostasis. Blockade of mGluR5-evoked phosphorylation of NMDAR in aSyn
      transgenic mice rescued synaptic and cognitive deficits, supporting the
      hypothesis that a receptor-mediated mechanism, independent of pore formation and 
      membrane leakage, is sufficient to trigger early synaptic damage induced by
      extracellular aSyn.

AB  - Communication between glia cells and neurons is crucial for brain functions, but 
      the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of gliotransmission remain
      enigmatic. Here we report that astrocytes express synaptobrevin II and
      cellubrevin as functionally non-overlapping vesicular SNARE proteins on
      glutamatergic vesicles and neuropeptide Y-containing large dense-core vesicles,
      respectively. Using individual null-mutants for Vamp2 (synaptobrevin II) and
      Vamp3 (cellubrevin), as well as the corresponding compound null-mutant for genes 
      encoding both v-SNARE proteins, we delineate previously unrecognized individual
      v-SNARE dependencies of astrocytic release processes and their functional impact 
      on neuronal signaling. Specifically, we show that astroglial
      cellubrevin-dependent neuropeptide Y secretion diminishes synaptic signaling,
      while synaptobrevin II-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes enhances
      synaptic signaling. Our experiments thereby uncover the molecular mechanisms of
      two distinct v-SNARE-dependent astrocytic release pathways that oppositely
      control synaptic strength at presynaptic sites, elucidating new avenues of
      communication between astrocytes and neurons.

TI  - Dopamine induces soluble alpha-synuclein oligomers and nigrostriatal
      degeneration.
PG  - 1560-1568
LID - 10.1038/nn.4641 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the
      substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy body inclusions containing aggregated 
      alpha-synuclein. Efforts to explain dopamine neuron vulnerability are hindered by
      the lack of dopaminergic cell death in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. To
      address this, we manipulated both dopamine levels and alpha-synuclein expression.
      Nigrally targeted expression of mutant tyrosine hydroxylase with enhanced
      catalytic activity increased dopamine levels without damaging neurons in
      non-transgenic mice. In contrast, raising dopamine levels in mice expressing
      human A53T mutant alpha-synuclein induced progressive nigrostriatal degeneration 
      and reduced locomotion. Dopamine elevation in A53T mice increased levels of
      potentially toxic alpha-synuclein oligomers, resulting in conformationally and
      functionally modified species. Moreover, in genetically tractable Caenorhabditis 
      elegans models, expression of alpha-synuclein mutated at the site of interaction 
      with dopamine prevented dopamine-induced toxicity. These data suggest that a
      unique mechanism links two cardinal features of PD: dopaminergic cell death and
      alpha-synuclein aggregation.

PG  - 1549-1559
LID - 10.1038/nn.4643 [doi]
AB  - Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) causes systemic immunosuppression and
      life-threatening infections, thought to result from noradrenergic overactivation 
      and excess glucocorticoid release via hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
      stimulation. Instead of consecutive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
      activation, we report that acute SCI in mice induced suppression of serum
      norepinephrine and concomitant increase in cortisol, despite suppressed
      adrenocorticotropic hormone, indicating primary (adrenal) hypercortisolism. This 
      neurogenic effect was more pronounced after high-thoracic level (Th1) SCI
      disconnecting adrenal gland innervation, compared with low-thoracic level (Th9)
      SCI. Prophylactic adrenalectomy completely prevented SCI-induced glucocorticoid
      excess and lymphocyte depletion but did not prevent pneumonia. When
      adrenalectomized mice were transplanted with denervated adrenal glands to restore
      physiologic glucocorticoid levels, the animals were completely protected from
      pneumonia. These findings identify a maladaptive sympathetic-neuroendocrine
      adrenal reflex mediating immunosuppression after SCI, implying that therapeutic
      normalization of the glucocorticoid and catecholamine imbalance in SCI patients
      could be a strategy to prevent detrimental infections.

AB  - As an essential means of resolving conflicts, aggression is expressed by both
      sexes but often at a higher level in males than in females. Recent studies
      suggest that cells in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus
      (VMHvl) that express estrogen receptor-alpha (Esr1) and progesterone receptor are
      essential for male but not female mouse aggression. In contrast, here we show
      that VMHvl(Esr1+) cells are indispensable for female aggression. This population 
      was active when females attacked naturally. Inactivation of these cells reduced
      female aggression whereas their activation elicited attack. Additionally, we
      found that female VMHvl contains two anatomically distinguishable subdivisions
      that showed differential gene expression, projection and activation patterns
      after mating and fighting. These results support an essential role of the VMHvl
      in both male and female aggression and reveal the existence of two previously
      unappreciated subdivisions in the female VMHvl that are involved in distinct
      social behaviors.

AB  - Noradrenaline modulates global brain states and diverse behaviors through what is
      traditionally believed to be a homogeneous cell population in the brainstem locus
      coeruleus (LC). However, it is unclear how LC coordinates disparate behavioral
      functions. We report a modular LC organization in rats, endowed with distinct
      neural projection patterns and coding properties for flexible specification of
      opposing behavioral learning states. LC projection mapping revealed functionally 
      distinct cell modules with specific anatomical connectivity. An
      amygdala-projecting ensemble promoted aversive learning, while an independent
      medial prefrontal cortex-projecting ensemble extinguished aversive responses to
      enable flexible behavior. LC neurons displayed context-dependent
      inter-relationships, with moderate, discrete activation of distinct cell
      populations by fear or safety cues and robust, global recruitment of most cells
      by strong aversive stimuli. These results demonstrate a modular organization in
      LC in which combinatorial activation modes are coordinated with projection- and
      behavior-specific cell populations, enabling adaptive tuning of emotional
      responding and behavioral flexibility.

TI  - A pathway from midcingulate cortex to posterior insula gates nociceptive
      hypersensitivity.
PG  - 1591-1601
LID - 10.1038/nn.4645 [doi]
AB  - The identity of cortical circuits mediating nociception and pain is largely
      unclear. The cingulate cortex is consistently activated during pain, but the
      functional specificity of cingulate divisions, the roles at distinct temporal
      phases of central plasticity and the underlying circuitry are unknown. Here we
      show in mice that the midcingulate division of the cingulate cortex (MCC) does
      not mediate acute pain sensation and pain affect, but gates sensory
      hypersensitivity by acting in a wide cortical and subcortical network. Within
      this complex network, we identified an afferent MCC-posterior insula pathway that
      can induce and maintain nociceptive hypersensitivity in the absence of
      conditioned peripheral noxious drive. This facilitation of nociception is brought
      about by recruitment of descending serotonergic facilitatory projections to the
      spinal cord. These results have implications for our understanding of neuronal
      mechanisms facilitating the transition from acute to long-lasting pain.

AB  - Long-range enhancer interactions critically regulate gene expression, yet little 
      is known about how their coordinated activities contribute to CNS development or 
      how this may, in turn, relate to disease states. By examining the regulation of
      the transcription factor NFIA in the developing spinal cord, we identified
      long-range enhancers that recapitulate NFIA expression across glial and neuronal 
      lineages in vivo. Complementary genetic studies found that Sox9-Brn2 and
      Isl1-Lhx3 regulate enhancer activity and NFIA expression in glial and neuronal
      populations. Chromatin conformation analysis revealed that these enhancers and
      transcription factors form distinct architectures within these lineages in the
      spinal cord. In glioma models, the glia-specific architecture is present in
      tumors, and these enhancers are required for NFIA expression and contribute to
      glioma formation. By delineating three-dimensional mechanisms of gene expression 
      regulation, our studies identify lineage-specific chromatin architectures and
      associated enhancers that regulate cell fate and tumorigenesis in the CNS.

PG  - 1634-1642
LID - 10.1038/nn.4637 [doi]
AB  - The consolidation of context-dependent emotional memory requires communication
      between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), but the mechanisms of
      this process are unknown. We recorded neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and
      BLA while rats learned the location of an aversive air puff on a linear track, as
      well as during sleep before and after training. We found coordinated
      reactivations between the hippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following 
      training. These reactivations peaked during hippocampal sharp wave-ripples
      (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated during
      hippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA
      correlation patterns representing the run direction that involved the air puff
      than for the 'safe' direction. These findings suggest that consolidation of
      contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation of
      hippocampus-amygdala circuits.

AB  - Hippocampal place cells represent the cellular substrate of episodic memory.
      Place cell ensembles reorganize to support learning but must also maintain stable
      representations to facilitate memory recall. Despite extensive research, the
      learning-related role of place cell dynamics in health and disease remains
      elusive. Using chronic two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in hippocampal area CA1 of
      wild-type and Df(16)A(+/-) mice, an animal model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,
      one of the most common genetic risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and
      schizophrenia, we found that goal-oriented learning in wild-type mice was
      supported by stable spatial maps and robust remapping of place fields toward the 
      goal location. Df(16)A(+/-) mice showed a significant learning deficit
      accompanied by reduced spatial map stability and the absence of goal-directed
      place cell reorganization. These results expand our understanding of the
      hippocampal ensemble dynamics supporting cognitive flexibility and demonstrate
      their importance in a model of 22q11.2-associated cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - The cognitive map in humans: spatial navigation and beyond.
PG  - 1504-1513

AB  - The 'cognitive map' hypothesis proposes that brain builds a unified
      representation of the spatial environment to support memory and guide future
      action. Forty years of electrophysiological research in rodents suggest that
      cognitive maps are neurally instantiated by place, grid, border and head
      direction cells in the hippocampal formation and related structures. Here we
      review recent work that suggests a similar functional organization in the human
      brain and yields insights into how cognitive maps are used during spatial
      navigation. Specifically, these studies indicate that (i) the human hippocampus
      and entorhinal cortex support map-like spatial codes, (ii) posterior brain
      regions such as parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices provide critical
      inputs that allow cognitive maps to be anchored to fixed environmental landmarks,
      and (iii) hippocampal and entorhinal spatial codes are used in conjunction with
      frontal lobe mechanisms to plan routes during navigation. We also discuss how
      these three basic elements of cognitive map based navigation-spatial coding,
      landmark anchoring and route planning-might be applied to nonspatial domains to
      provide the building blocks for many core elements of human thought.

PG  - 1474-1482
LID - 10.1038/nn.4654 [doi]
AB  - Technological advances in profiling cells along genetic, anatomical and
      physiological axes have fomented interest in identifying all neuronal cell types.
      This goal nears completion in specialized circuits such as the retina, while
      remaining more elusive in higher order cortical regions. We propose that this
      differential success of cell type identification may not simply reflect
      technological gaps in co-registering genetic, anatomical and physiological
      features in the cortex. Rather, we hypothesize it reflects evolutionarily driven 
      differences in the computational principles governing specialized circuits versus
      more general-purpose learning machines. In this framework, we consider the
      question of cell types in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a region likely to be
      involved in memory and navigation. While MEC contains subsets of identifiable
      functionally defined cell types, recent work employing unbiased statistical
      methods and more diverse tasks reveals unsuspected heterogeneity and adaptivity
      in MEC firing patterns. This suggests MEC may operate more as a generalist
      circuit, obeying computational design principles resembling those governing other
      higher cortical regions.

AB  - Synaptic integrative mechanisms have profound effects on electrical signaling in 
      the brain that, although largely hidden from recording methods that observe the
      spiking activity of neurons, may be critical for the encoding, storage and
      retrieval of information. Here we review roles for synaptic integrative
      mechanisms in the selection, generation and plasticity of place and grid fields, 
      and in related temporal codes for the representation of space. We outline
      outstanding questions and challenges in the testing of hypothesized models for
      spatial computation and memory.

TI  - Integration of objects and space in perception and memory.
PG  - 1493-1503
LID - 10.1038/nn.4657 [doi]
AB  - Distinct processing of objects and space has been an organizing principle for
      studying higher-level vision and medial temporal lobe memory. Here, however, we
      discuss how object and spatial information are in fact closely integrated in
      vision and memory. The ventral, object-processing visual pathway carries precise 
      spatial information, transformed from retinotopic coordinates into relative
      dimensions. At the final stages of the ventral pathway, including the dorsal
      anterior temporal lobe (TEd), object-sensitive neurons are intermixed with
      neurons that process large-scale environmental space. TEd projects primarily to
      perirhinal cortex (PRC), which in turn projects to lateral entorhinal cortex
      (LEC). PRC and LEC also combine object and spatial information. For example, PRC 
      and LEC neurons exhibit place fields that are evoked by landmark objects or the
      remembered locations of objects. Thus, spatial information, on both local and
      global scales, is deeply integrated into the ventral (temporal) object-processing
      pathway in vision and memory.

PG  - 1448-1464
LID - 10.1038/nn.4653 [doi]
AB  - Since the first place cell was recorded and the cognitive-map theory was
      subsequently formulated, investigation of spatial representation in the
      hippocampal formation has evolved in stages. Early studies sought to verify the
      spatial nature of place cell activity and determine its sensory origin. A new
      epoch started with the discovery of head direction cells and the realization of
      the importance of angular and linear movement-integration in generating spatial
      maps. A third epoch began when investigators turned their attention to the
      entorhinal cortex, which led to the discovery of grid cells and border cells.
      This review will show how ideas about integration of self-motion cues have shaped
      our understanding of spatial representation in hippocampal-entorhinal systems
      from the 1970s until today. It is now possible to investigate how specialized
      cell types of these systems work together, and spatial mapping may become one of 
      the first cognitive functions to be understood in mechanistic detail.

PG  - 1465-1473

AB  - In this Perspective, we evaluate current progress in understanding how the brain 
      encodes our sense of direction, within the context of parallel work focused on
      how early vestibular pathways encode self-motion. In particular, we discuss how
      these systems work together and provide evidence that they involve common
      mechanisms. We first consider the classic view of the head direction cell and
      results of recent experiments in rodents and primates indicating that inputs to
      these neurons encode multimodal information during self-motion, such as
      proprioceptive and motor efference copy signals, including gaze-related
      information. We also consider the paradox that, while the head-direction network 
      is generally assumed to generate a fixed representation of perceived directional 
      heading, this computation would need to be dynamically updated when the
      relationship between voluntary motor command and its sensory consequences
      changes. Such situations include navigation in virtual reality and
      head-restricted conditions, since the natural relationship between visual and
      extravisual cues is altered.

AB  - We report a multi-omic resource generated by applying quantitative trait locus
      (xQTL) analyses to RNA sequence, DNA methylation and histone acetylation data
      from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 411 older adults who have all three
      data types. We identify SNPs significantly associated with gene expression, DNA
      methylation and histone modification levels. Many of these SNPs influence
      multiple molecular features, and we demonstrate that SNP effects on RNA
      expression are fully mediated by epigenetic features in 9% of these loci.
      Further, we illustrate the utility of our new resource, xQTL Serve, by using it
      to prioritize the cell type(s) most affected by an xQTL. We also reanalyze
      published genome wide association studies using an xQTL-weighted analysis
      approach and identify 18 new schizophrenia and 2 new bipolar susceptibility
      variants, which is more than double the number of loci that can be discovered
      with a larger blood-based expression eQTL resource.

PG  - 1395-1403

AB  - Animal navigation requires multiple types of information for decisions on
      directional heading. We identified neural processing channels that encode
      multiple cues during navigational decision-making in Drosophila melanogaster. In 
      a flight simulator, we found that flies made directional choices on the basis of 
      the location of a recently presented landmark. This experience-guided navigation 
      was impaired by silencing neurons in the bulb (BU), a region in the central
      brain. Two-photon calcium imaging during flight revealed that the dorsal part of 
      the BU encodes the location of a recent landmark, whereas the ventral part of the
      BU tracks self-motion reflecting turns. Photolabeling-based circuit tracing
      indicated that these functional compartments of the BU constitute adjacent, yet
      distinct, anatomical pathways that both enter the navigation center. Thus, the
      fly's navigation system organizes multiple types of information in parallel
      channels, which may compactly transmit signals without interference for
      decision-making during flight.

TI  - Seeing faces is necessary for face-domain formation.
PG  - 1404-1412
LID - 10.1038/nn.4635 [doi]
AB  - Here we report that monkeys raised without exposure to faces did not develop face
      domains, but did develop domains for other categories and did show normal
      retinotopic organization, indicating that early face deprivation leads to a
      highly selective cortical processing deficit. Therefore, experience must be
      necessary for the formation (or maintenance) of face domains. Gaze tracking
      revealed that control monkeys looked preferentially at faces, even at ages prior 
      to the emergence of face domains, but face-deprived monkeys did not, indicating
      that face looking is not innate. A retinotopic organization is present throughout
      the visual system at birth, so selective early viewing behavior could bias
      category-specific visual responses toward particular retinotopic representations,
      thereby leading to domain formation in stereotyped locations in inferotemporal
      cortex, without requiring category-specific templates or biases. Thus, we propose
      that environmental importance influences viewing behavior, viewing behavior
      drives neuronal activity, and neuronal activity sculpts domain formation.

      in C. elegans.
PG  - 1350-1360
LID - 10.1038/nn.4630 [doi]
AB  - Brain assembly is hypothesized to begin when pioneer axons extend over
      non-neuronal cells, forming tracts guiding follower axons. Yet pioneer-neuron
      identities, their guidance substrates, and their interactions are not well
      understood. Here, using time-lapse embryonic imaging, genetics,
      protein-interaction, and functional studies, we uncover the early events of C.
      elegans brain assembly. We demonstrate that C. elegans glia are key for assembly 
      initiation, guiding pioneer and follower axons using distinct signals. Pioneer
      sublateral neurons, with unique growth properties, anatomy, and innervation,
      cooperate with glia to mediate follower-axon guidance. We further identify a
      Chimaerin (CHIN-1)- Furin (KPC-1) double-mutant that severely disrupts assembly. 
      CHIN-1 and KPC-1 function noncanonically, in glia and pioneer neurons, for
      guidance-cue trafficking. We exploit this bottleneck to define roles for glial
      Netrin and Semaphorin in pioneer- and follower-axon guidance, respectively, and
      for glial and pioneer-neuron Flamingo (CELSR) in follower-axon navigation. Taken 
      together, our studies reveal previously undescribed glial roles in pioneer-axon
      guidance, suggesting conserved principles of brain assembly.

AB  - Human perception thresholds can improve through learning. Here we report findings
      challenging the fundamental 'practice makes perfect' basis of procedural learning
      theory, showing that brief reactivations of encoded visual memories are
      sufficient to improve perceptual discrimination thresholds. Learning was
      comparable to standard practice-induced learning and was not due to short
      training per se, nor to an epiphenomenon of primed retrieval enhancement. The
      results demonstrate that basic perceptual functions can be substantially improved
      by memory reactivation, supporting a new account of perceptual learning dynamics.

AB  - To clarify the role of microglia in brain homeostasis and disease, an
      understanding of their maintenance, proliferation and turnover is essential. The 
      lifespan of brain microglia, however, remains uncertain, and reflects confounding
      factors in earlier assessments that were largely indirect. We genetically labeled
      single resident microglia in living mice and then used multiphoton microscopy to 
      monitor these cells over time. Under homeostatic conditions, we found that
      neocortical resident microglia were long-lived, with a median lifetime of well
      over 15 months; thus, approximately half of these cells survive the entire mouse 
      lifespan. While proliferation of resident neocortical microglia under homeostatic
      conditions was low, microglial proliferation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's
      beta-amyloidosis was increased threefold. The persistence of individual microglia
      throughout the mouse lifespan provides an explanation for how microglial priming 
      early in life can induce lasting functional changes and how microglial senescence
      may contribute to age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

      mechanism.
PG  - 1384-1394
LID - 10.1038/nn.4623 [doi]
AB  - The complex behaviors underlying reward seeking and consumption are integral to
      organism survival. The hypothalamus and mesolimbic dopamine system are key
      mediators of these behaviors, yet regulation of appetitive and consummatory
      behaviors outside of these regions is poorly understood. The central nucleus of
      the amygdala (CeA) has been implicated in feeding and reward, but the neurons and
      circuit mechanisms that positively regulate these behaviors remain unclear. Here,
      we defined the neuronal mechanisms by which CeA neurons promote food consumption.
      Using in vivo activity manipulations and Ca(2+) imaging in mice, we found that
      GABAergic serotonin receptor 2a (Htr2a)-expressing CeA neurons modulate food
      consumption, promote positive reinforcement and are active in vivo during eating.
      We demonstrated electrophysiologically, anatomically and behaviorally that
      intra-CeA and long-range circuit mechanisms underlie these behaviors. Finally, we
      showed that CeA(Htr2a) neurons receive inputs from feeding-relevant brain
      regions. Our results illustrate how defined CeA neural circuits positively
      regulate food consumption.

PG  - 1377-1383
LID - 10.1038/nn.4624 [doi]
AB  - The neocortex comprises multiple information processing streams mediated by
      subsets of glutamatergic pyramidal cells (PCs) that receive diverse inputs and
      project to distinct targets. How GABAergic interneurons regulate the segregation 
      and communication among intermingled PC subsets that contribute to separate brain
      networks remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that a subset of GABAergic
      chandelier cells (ChCs) in the prelimbic cortex, which innervate PCs at spike
      initiation site, selectively control PCs projecting to the basolateral amygdala
      (BLAPC) compared to those projecting to contralateral cortex (CCPC). These ChCs
      in turn receive preferential input from local and contralateral CCPCs as opposed 
      to BLAPCs and BLA neurons (the prelimbic cortex-BLA network). Accordingly,
      optogenetic activation of ChCs rapidly suppresses BLAPCs and BLA activity in
      freely behaving mice. Thus, the exquisite connectivity of ChCs not only mediates 
      directional inhibition between local PC ensembles but may also shape
      communication hierarchies between global networks.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4622 [doi]
AB  - Efficient control of attentional resources and high-acuity vision are both
      fundamental for survival. Shifts in visual attention are known to covertly
      enhance processing at locations away from the center of gaze, where visual
      resolution is low. It is unknown, however, whether selective spatial attention
      operates where the observer is already looking-that is, within the high-acuity
      foveola, the small yet disproportionally important rod-free region of the retina.
      Using new methods for precisely controlling retinal stimulation, here we show
      that covert attention flexibly improves and speeds up both detection and
      discrimination at loci only a fraction of a degree apart within the foveola.
      These findings reveal a surprisingly precise control of attention and its
      involvement in fine spatial vision. They show that the commonly studied covert
      shifts of attention away from the fovea are the expression of a global mechanism 
      that exerts its action across the entire visual field.

AB  - A causative understanding of genetic factors that regulate glioblastoma
      pathogenesis is of central importance. Here we developed an adeno-associated
      virus-mediated, autochthonous genetic CRISPR screen in glioblastoma. Stereotaxic 
      delivery of a virus library targeting genes commonly mutated in human cancers
      into the brains of conditional-Cas9 mice resulted in tumors that recapitulate
      human glioblastoma. Capture sequencing revealed diverse mutational profiles
      across tumors. The mutation frequencies in mice correlated with those in two
      independent patient cohorts. Co-mutation analysis identified co-occurring driver 
      combinations such as B2m-Nf1, Mll3-Nf1 and Zc3h13-Rb1, which were subsequently
      validated using AAV minipools. Distinct from Nf1-mutant tumors, Rb1-mutant tumors
      are undifferentiated and aberrantly express homeobox gene clusters. The addition 
      of Zc3h13 or Pten mutations altered the gene expression profiles of Rb1 mutants, 
      rendering them more resistant to temozolomide. Our study provides a functional
      landscape of gliomagenesis suppressors in vivo.

AB  - Regeneration of several organs involves adaptive reprogramming of progenitors,
      but the intrinsic capacity of the developing brain to replenish lost cells
      remains largely unknown. Here we found that the developing cerebellum has
      unappreciated progenitor plasticity, since it undergoes near full growth and
      functional recovery following acute depletion of granule cells, the most
      plentiful neuron population in the brain. We demonstrate that following postnatal
      ablation of granule cell progenitors, Nestin-expressing progenitors, specified
      during mid-embryogenesis to produce astroglia and interneurons, switch their fate
      and generate granule neurons in mice. Moreover, Hedgehog signaling in two
      Nestin-expressing progenitor populations is crucial not only for the compensatory
      replenishment of granule neurons but also for scaling interneuron and astrocyte
      numbers. Thus, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying robustness of
      circuit formation in the cerebellum and speculate that adaptive reprogramming of 
      progenitors in other brain regions plays a greater role than appreciated in
      developmental regeneration.

TI  - Analysis of genome-wide association data highlights candidates for drug
      repositioning in psychiatry.
PG  - 1342-1349
LID - 10.1038/nn.4618 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge of psychiatric disease genetics has advanced rapidly during the past
      decade with the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, less
      progress has been made in harnessing these data to reveal new therapies. Here we 
      propose a framework for drug repositioning by comparing transcriptomes imputed
      from GWAS data with drug-induced gene expression profiles from the Connectivity
      Map database and apply this approach to seven psychiatric disorders. We found a
      number of repositioning candidates, many supported by preclinical or clinical
      evidence. Repositioning candidates for a number of disorders were also
      significantly enriched for known psychiatric medications or therapies considered 
      in clinical trials. For example, candidates for schizophrenia were enriched for
      antipsychotics, while those for bipolar disorder were enriched for both
      antipsychotics and antidepressants. These findings provide support for the
      usefulness of GWAS data in guiding drug discovery.

TI  - Structure in neural population recordings: an expected byproduct of simpler
      phenomena?
PG  - 1310-1318

AB  - Neuroscientists increasingly analyze the joint activity of multineuron recordings
      to identify population-level structures believed to be significant and
      scientifically novel. Claims of significant population structure support
      hypotheses in many brain areas. However, these claims require first investigating
      the possibility that the population structure in question is an expected
      byproduct of simpler features known to exist in data. Classically, this critical 
      examination can be either intuited or addressed with conventional controls.
      However, these approaches fail when considering population data, raising concerns
      about the scientific merit of population-level studies. Here we develop a
      framework to test the novelty of population-level findings against simpler
      features such as correlations across times, neurons and conditions. We apply this
      framework to test two recent population findings in prefrontal and motor
      cortices, providing essential context to those studies. More broadly, the
      methodologies we introduce provide a general neural population control for many
      population-level hypotheses.

TI  - Antipsychotic-induced Hdac2 transcription via NF-kappaB leads to synaptic and
      cognitive side effects.
PG  - 1247-1259

AB  - Antipsychotic drugs remain the standard for schizophrenia treatment. Despite
      their effectiveness in treating hallucinations and delusions, prolonged exposure 
      to antipsychotic medications leads to cognitive deficits in both schizophrenia
      patients and animal models. The molecular mechanisms underlying these negative
      effects on cognition remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that chronic
      antipsychotic drug exposure increases nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in both 
      mouse and human frontal cortex, a trafficking event triggered via
      5-HT2A-receptor-dependent downregulation of the NF-kappaB repressor IkappaBalpha.
      This upregulation of NF-kappaB activity led to its increased binding at the Hdac2
      promoter, thereby augmenting Hdac2 transcription. Deletion of HDAC2 in forebrain 
      pyramidal neurons prevented the negative effects of antipsychotic treatment on
      synaptic remodeling and cognition. Conversely, virally mediated activation of
      NF-kappaB signaling decreased cortical synaptic plasticity via HDAC2. Together,
      these observations may aid in developing therapeutic strategies to improve the
      outcome of schizophrenia treatment.

TI  - Necroptosis activation in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1236-1246
LID - 10.1038/nn.4608 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe neuronal loss; however, the
      mechanisms by which neurons die remain elusive. Necroptosis, a programmed form of
      necrosis, is executed by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein,
      which is triggered by receptor-interactive protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3. We
      found that necroptosis was activated in postmortem human AD brains, positively
      correlated with Braak stage, and inversely correlated with brain weight and
      cognitive scores. In addition, we found that the set of genes regulated by RIPK1 
      overlapped significantly with multiple independent AD transcriptomic signatures, 
      indicating that RIPK1 activity could explain a substantial portion of
      transcriptomic changes in AD. Furthermore, we observed that lowering necroptosis 
      activation reduced cell loss in a mouse model of AD. We anticipate that our
      findings will spur a new area of research in the AD field focused on developing
      new therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking its activation.

TI  - Functional dissection of signal and noise in MT and LIP during decision-making.
PG  - 1285-1292
LID - 10.1038/nn.4611 [doi]
AB  - During perceptual decision-making, responses in the middle temporal (MT) and
      lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas appear to map onto theoretically defined
      quantities, with MT representing instantaneous motion evidence and LIP reflecting
      the accumulated evidence. However, several aspects of the transformation between 
      the two areas have not been empirically tested. We therefore performed multistage
      systems identification analyses of the simultaneous activity of MT and LIP during
      individual decisions. We found that monkeys based their choices on evidence
      presented in early epochs of the motion stimulus and that substantial early
      weighting of motion was present in MT responses. LIP responses recapitulated MT
      early weighting and contained a choice-dependent buildup that was distinguishable
      from motion integration. Furthermore, trial-by-trial variability in LIP did not
      depend on MT activity. These results identify important deviations from
      idealizations of MT and LIP and motivate inquiry into sensorimotor computations
      that may intervene between MT and LIP.

PG  - 1209-1212

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with neurological disorders of both the
      CNS and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), yet few studies have directly examined 
      PNS infection. Here we show that intraperitoneally or intraventricularly injected
      ZIKV in the mouse can infect and impact peripheral neurons in vivo. Moreover,
      ZIKV productively infects stem-cell-derived human neural crest cells and
      peripheral neurons in vitro, leading to increased cell death, transcriptional
      dysregulation and cell-type-specific molecular pathology.

TI  - Adults with autism overestimate the volatility of the sensory environment.
PG  - 1293-1299
LID - 10.1038/nn.4615 [doi]
AB  - Insistence on sameness and intolerance of change are among the diagnostic
      criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but little research has addressed
      how people with ASD represent and respond to environmental change. Here,
      behavioral and pupillometric measurements indicated that adults with ASD are less
      surprised than neurotypical adults when their expectations are violated, and
      decreased surprise is predictive of greater symptom severity. A hierarchical
      Bayesian model of learning suggested that in ASD, a tendency to overlearn about
      volatility in the face of environmental change drives a corresponding reduction
      in learning about probabilistically aberrant events, thus putatively rendering
      these events less surprising. Participant-specific modeled estimates of surprise 
      about environmental conditions were linked to pupil size in the ASD group, thus
      suggesting heightened noradrenergic responsivity in line with compromised neural 
      gain. This study offers insights into the behavioral, algorithmic and
      physiological mechanisms underlying responses to environmental volatility in ASD.

TI  - Dorsal hippocampus contributes to model-based planning.
PG  - 1269-1276
LID - 10.1038/nn.4613 [doi]
AB  - Planning can be defined as action selection that leverages an internal model of
      the outcomes likely to follow each possible action. Its neural mechanisms remain 
      poorly understood. Here we adapt recent advances from human research for rats,
      presenting for the first time an animal task that produces many trials of planned
      behavior per session, making multitrial rodent experimental tools available to
      study planning. We use part of this toolkit to address a perennially
      controversial issue in planning: the role of the dorsal hippocampus. Although
      prospective hippocampal representations have been proposed to support planning,
      intact planning in animals with damaged hippocampi has been repeatedly observed. 
      Combining formal algorithmic behavioral analysis with muscimol inactivation, we
      provide causal evidence directly linking dorsal hippocampus with planning
      behavior. Our results and methods open the door to new and more detailed
      investigations of the neural mechanisms of planning in the hippocampus and
      throughout the brain.

PG  - 1300-1309
LID - 10.1038/nn.4610 [doi]
AB  - The brain and its borders create a highly dynamic microenvironment populated with
      immune cells. Yet characterization of immune cells within the naive brain
      compartment remains limited. In this study, we used CyTOF mass cytometry to
      characterize the immune populations of the naive mouse brain using 44 cell
      surface markers. By comparing immune cell composition and cell profiles between
      the brain compartment and blood, we were able to characterize previously
      undescribed cell subsets of CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells and dendritic cells in
      the naive brain. Using flow cytometry, we show differential distributions of
      immune populations between meninges, choroid plexus and parenchyma. We
      demonstrate the phenotypic ranges of resident myeloid cells and identify CD44 as 
      a marker for infiltrating immune populations. This study provides an approach for
      a system-wide view of immune populations in the brain and is expected to serve as
      a resource for understanding brain immunity.

TI  - C9orf72 expansion disrupts ATM-mediated chromosomal break repair.
PG  - 1225-1235
LID - 10.1038/nn.4604 [doi]
AB  - Hexanucleotide repeat expansions represent the most common genetic cause of
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, though the
      mechanisms by which such expansions cause neurodegeneration are poorly
      understood. We report elevated levels of DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loops) and double
      strand breaks in rat neurons, human cells and C9orf72 ALS patient spinal cord
      tissues. Accumulation of endogenous DNA damage is concomitant with defective
      ATM-mediated DNA repair signaling and accumulation of protein-linked DNA breaks. 
      We reveal that defective ATM-mediated DNA repair is a consequence of P62
      accumulation, which impairs H2A ubiquitylation and perturbs ATM signaling.
      Virus-mediated expression of C9orf72-related RNA and dipeptide repeats in the
      mouse central nervous system increases double strand breaks and ATM defects and
      triggers neurodegeneration. These findings identify R-loops, double strand breaks
      and defective ATM-mediated repair as pathological consequences of C9orf72
      expansions and suggest that C9orf72-linked neurodegeneration is driven at least
      partly by genomic instability.

PG  - 1213-1216
LID - 10.1038/nn.4606 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy-induced pain is a dose-limiting condition that affects 30% of
      patients undergoing chemotherapy. We found that gut microbiota promotes the
      development of chemotherapy-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Oxaliplatin-induced 
      mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced in germ-free mice and in mice pretreated with
      antibiotics. Restoring the microbiota of germ-free mice abrogated this
      protection. These effects appear to be mediated, in part, by TLR4 expressed on
      hematopoietic cells, including macrophages.

TI  - A circuit-based mechanism underlying familiarity signaling and the preference for
      novelty.
PG  - 1260-1268
LID - 10.1038/nn.4607 [doi]
AB  - Novelty preference (NP) is an evolutionarily conserved, essential survival
      mechanism often dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders. NP is mediated by a
      motivational dopamine signal that increases in response to novel stimuli, thereby
      driving exploration. However, the mechanism by which once-novel stimuli
      transition to familiar stimuli is unknown. Here we describe a neuroanatomical
      substrate for familiarity signaling, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the
      midbrain, which is activated as novel stimuli become familiar with multiple
      exposures. In mice, optogenetic silencing of IPN neurons increases salience of
      and interaction with familiar stimuli without affecting novelty responses,
      whereas photoactivation of the same neurons reduces exploration of novel stimuli 
      mimicking familiarity. Bidirectional control of NP by the IPN depends on
      familiarity signals and novelty signals arising from excitatory habenula and
      dopaminergic ventral tegmentum inputs, which activate and reduce IPN activity,
      respectively. These results demonstrate that familiarity signals through unique
      IPN circuitry that opposes novelty seeking to control NP.

PG  - 1217-1224
LID - 10.1038/nn.4598 [doi]
AB  - We systematically analyzed postzygotic mutations (PZMs) in whole-exome sequences 
      from the largest collection of trios (5,947) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
      available, including 282 unpublished trios, and performed resequencing using
      multiple independent technologies. We identified 7.5% of de novo mutations as
      PZMs, 83.3% of which were not described in previous studies. Damaging,
      nonsynonymous PZMs within critical exons of prenatally expressed genes were more 
      common in ASD probands than controls (P < 1 x 10(-6)), and genes carrying these
      PZMs were enriched for expression in the amygdala (P = 5.4 x 10(-3)). Two genes
      (KLF16 and MSANTD2) were significantly enriched for PZMs genome-wide, and other
      PZMs involved genes (SCN2A, HNRNPU and SMARCA4) whose mutation is known to cause 
      ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders. PZMs constitute a significant
      proportion of de novo mutations and contribute importantly to ASD risk.

TI  - Neural reactivations during sleep determine network credit assignment.
PG  - 1277-1284
LID - 10.1038/nn.4601 [doi]
AB  - A fundamental goal of motor learning is to establish the neural patterns that
      produce a desired behavioral outcome. It remains unclear how and when the nervous
      system solves this 'credit assignment' problem. Using neuroprosthetic learning,
      in which we could control the causal relationship between neurons and behavior,
      we found that sleep-dependent processing was required for credit assignment and
      the establishment of task-related functional connectivity reflecting the casual
      neuron-behavior relationship. Notably, we observed a strong link between the
      microstructure of sleep reactivations and credit assignment, with downscaling of 
      non-causal activity. Decoupling of spiking to slow oscillations using optogenetic
      methods eliminated rescaling. Thus, our results suggest that coordinated firing
      during sleep is essential for establishing sparse activation patterns that
      reflect the causal neuron-behavior relationship.

PG  - 1199-1208
LID - 10.1038/nn.4619 [doi]
AB  - Neocortical inhibitory neurons exhibit remarkably diverse morphology,
      physiological properties and connectivity. Genetic access to molecularly defined 
      subtypes of inhibitory neurons has aided their functional characterization in
      recent years. These studies have established that, instead of simply balancing
      excitatory neuron activity, inhibitory neurons actively shape excitatory circuits
      in a subtype-specific manner. We review the emerging view that inhibitory neuron 
      subtypes perform context-dependent modulation of excitatory activity, as well as 
      regulate experience-dependent plasticity of excitatory circuits. We then review
      the roles of neuromodulators in regulating the subtype-specific functions of
      inhibitory neurons. Finally, we discuss the idea that dysfunctions of inhibitory 
      neuron subtypes may be responsible for various aspects of neurological disorders.

AB  - During competitive interactions, humans have to estimate the impact of their own 
      actions on their opponent's strategy. Here we provide evidence that neural
      computations in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) and interconnected
      structures are causally involved in this process. By combining inhibitory
      continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation with model-based
      functional MRI, we show that disrupting neural excitability in the rTPJ reduces
      behavioral and neural indices of mentalizing-related computations, as well as
      functional connectivity of the rTPJ with ventral and dorsal parts of the medial
      prefrontal cortex. These results provide a causal demonstration that neural
      computations instantiated in the rTPJ are neurobiological prerequisites for the
      ability to integrate opponent beliefs into strategic choice, through system-level
      interaction within the valuation and mentalizing networks.

      complex brain disorders.
PG  - 1150-1161
LID - 10.1038/nn.4594 [doi]
AB  - The postsynaptic density (PSD) contains a collection of scaffold proteins used
      for assembling synaptic signaling complexes. However, it is not known how the
      core-scaffold machinery associates in protein-interaction networks or how
      proteins encoded by genes involved in complex brain disorders are distributed
      through spatiotemporal protein complexes. Here using immunopurification,
      proteomics and bioinformatics, we isolated 2,876 proteins across 41 in vivo
      interactomes and determined their protein domain composition, correlation to gene
      expression levels and developmental integration to the PSD. We defined clusters
      for enrichment of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, developmental delay
      and intellectual disability risk factors at embryonic day 14 and adult PSD in
      mice. Mutations in highly connected nodes alter protein-protein interactions
      modulating macromolecular complexes enriched in disease risk candidates. These
      results were integrated into a software platform, Synaptic Protein/Pathways
      Resource (SyPPRes), enabling the prioritization of disease risk factors and their
      placement within synaptic protein interaction networks.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4593 [doi]
AB  - Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are commonly used for in vivo gene transfer.
      Nevertheless, AAVs that provide efficient transduction across specific organs or 
      cell populations are needed. Here, we describe AAV-PHP.eB and AAV-PHP.S, capsids 
      that efficiently transduce the central and peripheral nervous systems,
      respectively. In the adult mouse, intravenous administration of 1 x 10(11) vector
      genomes (vg) of AAV-PHP.eB transduced 69% of cortical and 55% of striatal
      neurons, while 1 x 10(12) vg of AAV-PHP.S transduced 82% of dorsal root ganglion 
      neurons, as well as cardiac and enteric neurons. The efficiency of these vectors 
      facilitates robust cotransduction and stochastic, multicolor labeling for
      individual cell morphology studies. To support such efforts, we provide methods
      for labeling a tunable fraction of cells without compromising color diversity.
      Furthermore, when used with cell-type-specific promoters and enhancers, these
      AAVs enable efficient and targetable genetic modification of cells throughout the
      nervous system of transgenic and non-transgenic animals.

TI  - Reorganization of corticospinal output during motor learning.
PG  - 1133-1141
LID - 10.1038/nn.4596 [doi]
AB  - Motor learning is accompanied by widespread changes within the motor cortex, but 
      it is unknown whether these changes are ultimately funneled through a stable
      corticospinal output channel or whether the corticospinal output itself is
      plastic. We investigated the consistency of the relationship between
      corticospinal neuron activity and movement through in vivo two-photon calcium
      imaging in mice learning a lever-press task. Corticospinal neurons exhibited
      heterogeneous correlations with movement, with the majority of movement-modulated
      neurons decreasing activity during movement. Individual cells changed their
      activity across days, which led to changed associations between corticospinal
      activity and movement. Unlike previous observations in layer 2/3, activity
      accompanying learned movements did not become more consistent with learning;
      instead, the activity of dissimilar movements became more decorrelated. These
      results indicate that the relationship between corticospinal activity and
      movement is dynamic and that the types of activity and plasticity are different
      from and possibly complementary to those in layer 2/3.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4597 [doi]
AB  - Microglia are essential for CNS homeostasis and innate neuroimmune function, and 
      play important roles in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Here we present gene
      expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal
      cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. Overall, genes expressed by
      human microglia were similar to those in mouse, including established microglial 
      genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and ITGAM (CD11B). However, a number of immune genes, not
      identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed
      in human microglia, including TLR, Fcgamma and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 
      and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in 
      human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal
      guidance, cell surface receptor expression and actin (dis)assembly. Limited
      overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and 
      humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently.

AB  - Neuropathic pain involves long-lasting modifications of pain pathways that result
      in abnormal cortical activity. How cortical circuits are altered and contribute
      to the intense sensation associated with allodynia is unclear. Here we report a
      persistent elevation of layer V pyramidal neuron activity in the somatosensory
      cortex of a mouse model of neuropathic pain. This enhanced pyramidal neuron
      activity was caused in part by increases of synaptic activity and
      NMDA-receptor-dependent calcium spikes in apical tuft dendrites. Furthermore,
      local inhibitory interneuron networks shifted their activity in favor of
      pyramidal neuron hyperactivity: somatostatin-expressing and
      parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons reduced their activity, whereas
      vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons increased their
      activity. Pharmacogenetic activation of somatostatin-expressing cells reduced
      pyramidal neuron hyperactivity and reversed mechanical allodynia. These findings 
      reveal cortical circuit changes that arise during the development of neuropathic 
      pain and identify the activation of specific cortical interneurons as therapeutic
      targets for chronic pain treatment.

TI  - Germline Chd8 haploinsufficiency alters brain development in mouse.
PG  - 1062-1073
LID - 10.1038/nn.4592 [doi]
AB  - The chromatin remodeling gene CHD8 represents a central node in
      neurodevelopmental gene networks implicated in autism. We examined the impact of 
      germline heterozygous frameshift Chd8 mutation on neurodevelopment in mice.
      Chd8(+/del5) mice displayed normal social interactions with no repetitive
      behaviors but exhibited cognitive impairment correlated with increased regional
      brain volume, validating that phenotypes of Chd8(+/del5) mice overlap pathology
      reported in humans with CHD8 mutations. We applied network analysis to
      characterize neurodevelopmental gene expression, revealing widespread
      transcriptional changes in Chd8(+/del5) mice across pathways disrupted in
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurogenesis, synaptic processes and
      neuroimmune signaling. We identified a co-expression module with peak expression 
      in early brain development featuring dysregulation of RNA processing, chromatin
      remodeling and cell-cycle genes enriched for promoter binding by Chd8, and we
      validated increased neuronal proliferation and developmental splicing
      perturbation in Chd8(+/del5) mice. This integrative analysis offers an initial
      picture of the consequences of Chd8 haploinsufficiency for brain development.

      firing.
PG  - 1114-1121
LID - 10.1038/nn.4582 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how active dendrites are exploited for behaviorally relevant
      computations is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Grid cells in medial
      entorhinal cortex are an attractive model system for addressing this question, as
      the computation they perform is clear: they convert synaptic inputs into
      spatially modulated, periodic firing. Whether active dendrites contribute to the 
      generation of the dual temporal and rate codes characteristic of grid cell output
      is unknown. We show that dendrites of medial entorhinal cortex neurons are highly
      excitable and exhibit a supralinear input-output function in vitro, while in vivo
      recordings reveal membrane potential signatures consistent with recruitment of
      active dendritic conductances. By incorporating these nonlinear dynamics into
      grid cell models, we show that they can sharpen the precision of the temporal
      code and enhance the robustness of the rate code, thereby supporting a stable,
      accurate representation of space under varying environmental conditions. Our
      results suggest that active dendrites may therefore constitute a key cellular
      mechanism for ensuring reliable spatial navigation.

AB  - A genome-wide survival analysis of 14,406 Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and
      25,849 controls identified eight previously reported AD risk loci and 14 novel
      loci associated with age at onset. Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220
      cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The
      minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk
      locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in
      monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for
      myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the
      PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally,
      experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of 
      many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells. Our
      results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid 
      gene expression and cell function.

AB  - Susceptibility to obesity is linked to genes regulating neurotransmission,
      pancreatic beta-cell function and energy homeostasis. Genome-wide association
      studies have identified associations between body mass index and two loci near
      cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2), which
      encode membrane proteins that mediate synaptic assembly. We found that these
      respective risk variants associate with increased CADM1 and CADM2 expression in
      the hypothalamus of human subjects. Expression of both genes was elevated in
      obese mice, and induction of Cadm1 in excitatory neurons facilitated weight gain 
      while exacerbating energy expenditure. Loss of Cadm1 protected mice from obesity,
      and tract-tracing analysis revealed Cadm1-positive innervation of POMC neurons
      via afferent projections originating from beyond the arcuate nucleus. Reducing
      Cadm1 expression in the hypothalamus and hippocampus promoted a negative energy
      balance and weight loss. These data identify essential roles for Cadm1-mediated
      neuronal input in weight regulation and provide insight into the central pathways
      contributing to human obesity.

PG  - 1180-1188
LID - 10.1038/nn.4591 [doi]
AB  - Optogenetics promises precise spatiotemporal control of neural processes using
      light. However, the spatial extent of illumination within the brain is difficult 
      to control and cannot be adjusted using standard fiber optics. We demonstrate
      that optical fibers with tapered tips can be used to illuminate either spatially 
      restricted or large brain volumes. Remotely adjusting the light input angle to
      the fiber varies the light-emitting portion of the taper over several millimeters
      without movement of the implant. We use this mode to activate dorsal versus
      ventral striatum of individual mice and reveal different effects of each
      manipulation on motor behavior. Conversely, injecting light over the full
      numerical aperture of the fiber results in light emission from the entire taper
      surface, achieving broader and more efficient optogenetic activation of neurons, 
      compared to standard flat-faced fiber stimulation. Thus, tapered fibers permit
      focal or broad illumination that can be precisely and dynamically matched to
      experimental needs.

AB  - Although de novo missense mutations have been predicted to account for more cases
      of autism than gene-truncating mutations, most research has focused on the
      latter. We identified the properties of de novo missense mutations in patients
      with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and highlight 35 genes with excess
      missense mutations. Additionally, 40 amino acid sites were recurrently mutated in
      36 genes, and targeted sequencing of 20 sites in 17,688 patients with NDD
      identified 21 new patients with identical missense mutations. One recurrent site 
      substitution (p.A636T) occurs in a glutamate receptor subunit, GRIA1. This same
      amino acid substitution in the homologous but distinct mouse glutamate receptor
      subunit Grid2 is associated with Lurcher ataxia. Phenotypic follow-up in five
      individuals with GRIA1 mutations shows evidence of specific learning disabilities
      and autism. Overall, we find significant clustering of de novo mutations in 200
      genes, highlighting specific functional domains and synaptic candidate genes
      important in NDD pathology.

TI  - A TNF-JNK-Axl-ERK signaling axis mediates primary resistance to EGFR inhibition
      in glioblastoma.
PG  - 1074-1084
LID - 10.1038/nn.4584 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is widespread in
      cancer, making the EGFR an important target for therapy. EGFR gene amplification 
      and mutation are common in glioblastoma (GBM), but EGFR inhibition has not been
      effective in treating this tumor. Here we propose that primary resistance to EGFR
      inhibition in glioma cells results from a rapid compensatory response to EGFR
      inhibition that mediates cell survival. We show that in glioma cells expressing
      either EGFR wild type or the mutant EGFRvIII, EGFR inhibition triggers a rapid
      adaptive response driven by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion,
      which leads to activation in turn of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the Axl
      receptor tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK).
      Inhibition of this adaptive axis at multiple nodes rendered glioma cells with
      primary resistance sensitive to EGFR inhibition. Our findings provide a possible 
      explanation for the failures of anti-EGFR therapy in GBM and suggest a new
      approach to the treatment of EGFR-expressing GBM using a combination of EGFR and 
      TNF inhibition.

TI  - Sensory integration and neuromodulatory feedback facilitate Drosophila
      mechanonociceptive behavior.
PG  - 1085-1095
LID - 10.1038/nn.4580 [doi]
AB  - Nociception is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to encode and process
      harmful environmental stimuli. Like most animals, Drosophila melanogaster larvae 
      respond to a variety of nociceptive stimuli, including noxious touch and
      temperature, with stereotyped escape responses through activation of multimodal
      nociceptors. How behavioral responses to these different modalities are processed
      and integrated by the downstream network remains poorly understood. By combining 
      trans-synaptic labeling, ultrastructural analysis, calcium imaging, optogenetics 
      and behavioral analyses, we uncovered a circuit specific for mechanonociception
      but not thermonociception. Notably, integration of mechanosensory input from
      innocuous and nociceptive sensory neurons is required for robust
      mechanonociceptive responses. We further show that neurons integrating
      mechanosensory input facilitate primary nociceptive output by releasing short
      neuropeptide F, the Drosophila neuropeptide Y homolog. Our findings unveil how
      integration of somatosensory input and neuropeptide-mediated modulation can
      produce robust modality-specific escape behavior.

AB  - Many animals orient using visual cues, but how a single cue is selected from
      among many is poorly understood. Here we show that Drosophila ring
      neurons-central brain neurons implicated in navigation-display visual stimulus
      selection. Using in vivo two-color two-photon imaging with genetically encoded
      calcium indicators, we demonstrate that individual ring neurons inherit
      simple-cell-like receptive fields from their upstream partners. Stimuli in the
      contralateral visual field suppressed responses to ipsilateral stimuli in both
      populations. Suppression strength depended on when and where the contralateral
      stimulus was presented, an effect stronger in ring neurons than in their upstream
      inputs. This history-dependent effect on the temporal structure of visual
      responses, which was well modeled by a simple biphasic filter, may determine how 
      visual references are selected for the fly's internal compass. Our approach
      highlights how two-color calcium imaging can help identify and localize the
      origins of sensory transformations across synaptically connected neural
      populations.

PG  - 1004-1013
LID - 10.1038/nn.4576 [doi]
AB  - Uncovering structural regularities and architectural topologies of cortical
      circuitry is vital for understanding neural computations. Recently, an
      experimentally constrained algorithm generated a dense network reconstruction of 
      a approximately 0.3-mm(3) volume from juvenile rat somatosensory neocortex,
      comprising approximately 31,000 cells and approximately 36 million synapses.
      Using this reconstruction, we found a small-world topology with an average of 2.5
      synapses separating any two cells and multiple cell-type-specific wiring
      features. Amounts of excitatory and inhibitory innervations varied across cells, 
      yet pyramidal neurons maintained relatively constant excitation/inhibition
      ratios. The circuit contained highly connected hub neurons belonging to a small
      subset of cell types and forming an interconnected cell-type-specific rich club. 
      Certain three-neuron motifs were overrepresented, matching recent experimental
      results. Cell-type-specific network properties were even more striking when
      synaptic strength and sign were considered in generating a functional topology.
      Our systematic approach enables interpretation of microconnectomics 'big data'
      and provides several experimentally testable predictions.

PG  - 934-942
LID - 10.1038/nn.4574 [doi]
AB  - Anorexia is a common manifestation of chronic diseases, including cancer. Here we
      investigate the contribution to cancer anorexia made by calcitonin gene-related
      peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that transmit anorexic
      signals. We show that CGRP(PBN) neurons are activated in mice implanted with
      Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Inactivation of CGRP(PBN) neurons before tumor
      implantation prevents anorexia and loss of lean mass, and their inhibition after 
      symptom onset reverses anorexia. CGRP(PBN) neurons are also activated in
      Apc(min/+) mice, which develop intestinal cancer and lose weight despite the
      absence of reduced food intake. Inactivation of CGRP(PBN) neurons in Apc(min/+)
      mice permits hyperphagia that counteracts weight loss, revealing a role for these
      neurons in a 'nonanorexic' cancer model. We also demonstrate that inactivation of
      CGRP(PBN) neurons prevents lethargy, anxiety and malaise associated with cancer. 
      These findings establish CGRP(PBN) neurons as key mediators of cancer-induced
      appetite suppression and associated behavioral changes.

TI  - Reinstated episodic context guides sampling-based decisions for reward.
PG  - 997-1003
LID - 10.1038/nn.4573 [doi]
AB  - How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided 
      by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice
      patterns similar to model-free reinforcement learning; however, samples can vary 
      from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here we show that context
      retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply
      from the predictions of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we show that, when 
      a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the
      properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This
      effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial,
      suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then
      triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes 
      a new avenue by which experience can guide choice and, as such, has broad
      implications for the study of decisions.

TI  - The cellular mechanism for water detection in the mammalian taste system.
PG  - 927-933
LID - 10.1038/nn.4575 [doi]
AB  - Initiation of drinking behavior relies on both internal state and peripheral
      water detection. While central neural circuits regulating thirst have been well
      studied, it is still unclear how mammals recognize external water. Here we show
      that acid-sensing taste receptor cells (TRCs) that were previously suggested as
      the sour taste sensors also mediate taste responses to water. Genetic silencing
      of these TRCs abolished water-evoked responses in taste nerves. Optogenetic
      self-stimulation of acid-sensing TRCs in thirsty animals induced robust drinking 
      responses toward light even without water. This behavior was only observed when
      animals were water-deprived but not under food- or salt-depleted conditions,
      indicating that the hedonic value of water-evoked responses is highly
      internal-state dependent. Conversely, thirsty animals lacking functional
      acid-sensing TRCs showed compromised discrimination between water and nonaqueous 
      fluids. Taken together, this study revealed a function of mammalian acid-sensing 
      TRCs that provide a cue for external water.

TI  - Attention-related changes in correlated neuronal activity arise from
      normalization mechanisms.
PG  - 969-977
LID - 10.1038/nn.4572 [doi]
AB  - Attention is believed to enhance perception by altering the activity-level
      correlations between pairs of neurons. How attention changes neuronal activity
      correlations is unknown. Using multielectrodes in monkey visual cortex, we
      measured spike-count correlations when single or multiple stimuli were presented 
      and when stimuli were attended or unattended. When stimuli were unattended,
      adding a suppressive, nonpreferred stimulus beside a preferred stimulus increased
      spike-count correlations between pairs of similarly tuned neurons but decreased
      spike-count correlations between pairs of oppositely tuned neurons. A stochastic 
      normalization model containing populations of oppositely tuned, mutually
      suppressive neurons explains these changes and also explains why attention
      decreased or increased correlations: as an indirect consequence of
      attention-related changes in the inputs to normalization mechanisms. Our findings
      link normalization mechanisms to correlated neuronal activity and attention,
      showing that normalization mechanisms shape response correlations and that these 
      correlations change when attention biases normalization mechanisms.

TI  - Flexible information routing by transient synchrony.
PG  - 1014-1022
LID - 10.1038/nn.4569 [doi]
AB  - Perception, cognition and behavior rely on flexible communication between
      microcircuits in distinct cortical regions. The mechanisms underlying rapid
      information rerouting between such microcircuits are still unknown. It has been
      proposed that changing patterns of coherence between local gamma rhythms support 
      flexible information rerouting. The stochastic and transient nature of gamma
      oscillations in vivo, however, is hard to reconcile with such a function. Here we
      show that models of cortical circuits near the onset of oscillatory synchrony
      selectively route input signals despite the short duration of gamma bursts and
      the irregularity of neuronal firing. In canonical multiarea circuits, we find
      that gamma bursts spontaneously arise with matched timing and frequency and that 
      they organize information flow by large-scale routing states. Specific
      self-organized routing states can be induced by minor modulations of background
      activity.

TI  - A cerebellum-like circuit in the auditory system cancels responses to
      self-generated sounds.
PG  - 943-950
LID - 10.1038/nn.4567 [doi]
AB  - The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) integrates auditory nerve input with a diverse 
      array of sensory and motor signals processed in circuitry similar to that of the 
      cerebellum. Yet how the DCN contributes to early auditory processing has been a
      longstanding puzzle. Using electrophysiological recordings in mice during licking
      behavior, we show that DCN neurons are largely unaffected by self-generated
      sounds while remaining sensitive to external acoustic stimuli. Recordings in
      deafened mice, together with neural activity manipulations, indicate that
      self-generated sounds are cancelled by non-auditory signals conveyed by mossy
      fibers. In addition, DCN neurons exhibit gradual reductions in their responses to
      acoustic stimuli that are temporally correlated with licking. Together, these
      findings suggest that DCN may act as an adaptive filter for cancelling
      self-generated sounds. Adaptive filtering has been established previously for
      cerebellum-like sensory structures in fish, suggesting a conserved function for
      such structures across vertebrates.

PG  - 917-926

AB  - Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is typically produced by cancer cells and 
      suppresses immunity through the receptor PD-1 expressed on T cells. However, the 
      role of PD-L1 and PD-1 in regulating pain and neuronal function is unclear. Here 
      we report that both melanoma and normal neural tissues including dorsal root
      ganglion (DRG) produce PD-L1 that can potently inhibit acute and chronic pain.
      Intraplantar injection of PD-L1 evoked analgesia in naive mice via PD-1, whereas 
      PD-L1 neutralization or PD-1 blockade induced mechanical allodynia. Mice lacking 
      Pd1 (Pdcd1) exhibited thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. PD-1 activation in
      DRG nociceptive neurons by PD-L1 induced phosphorylation of the tyrosine
      phosphatase SHP-1, inhibited sodium channels and caused hyperpolarization through
      activation of TREK2 K(+) channels. PD-L1 also potently suppressed nociceptive
      neuron excitability in human DRGs. Notably, blocking PD-L1 or PD-1 elicited
      spontaneous pain and allodynia in melanoma-bearing mice. Our findings identify a 
      previously unrecognized role of PD-L1 as an endogenous pain inhibitor and a
      neuromodulator.

AB  - How neuronal computations in the sensory periphery contribute to computations in 
      the cortex is not well understood. We examined this question in the context of
      visual-motion processing in the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) of mice. We
      disrupted retinal direction selectivity, either exclusively along the horizontal 
      axis using FRMD7 mutants or along all directions by ablating starburst amacrine
      cells, and monitored neuronal activity in layer 2/3 of V1 during stimulation with
      visual motion. In control mice, we found an over-representation of cortical cells
      preferring posterior visual motion, the dominant motion direction an animal
      experiences when it moves forward. In mice with disrupted retinal direction
      selectivity, the over-representation of posterior-motion-preferring cortical
      cells disappeared, and their responses at higher stimulus speeds were reduced.
      This work reveals the existence of two functionally distinct,
      sensory-periphery-dependent and -independent computations of visual motion in the
      cortex.

TI  - A fluoro-Nissl dye identifies pericytes as distinct vascular mural cells during
      in vivo brain imaging.
PG  - 1023-1032
LID - 10.1038/nn.4564 [doi]
AB  - Pericytes and smooth muscle cells are integral components of the brain
      microvasculature. However, no techniques exist to unambiguously identify these
      cell types, greatly limiting their investigation in vivo. Here we show that the
      fluorescent Nissl dye NeuroTrace 500/525 labels brain pericytes with specificity,
      allowing high-resolution optical imaging in the live mouse. We demonstrate that
      capillary pericytes are a population of mural cells with distinct morphological, 
      molecular and functional features that do not overlap with precapillary or
      arteriolar smooth muscle actin-expressing cells. The remarkable specificity for
      dye uptake suggests that pericytes have molecular transport mechanisms not
      present in other brain cells. We demonstrate feasibility of longitudinal pericyte
      imaging during microvascular development and aging and in models of brain
      ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. The ability to easily label pericytes in any
      mouse model opens the possibility of a broad range of investigations of mural
      cells in vascular development, neurovascular coupling and neuropathology.

TI  - Identification of a motor-to-auditory pathway important for vocal learning.
PG  - 978-986
LID - 10.1038/nn.4563 [doi]
AB  - Learning to vocalize depends on the ability to adaptively modify the temporal and
      spectral features of vocal elements. Neurons that convey motor-related signals to
      the auditory system are theorized to facilitate vocal learning, but the identity 
      and function of such neurons remain unknown. Here we identify a previously
      unknown neuron type in the songbird brain that transmits vocal motor signals to
      the auditory cortex. Genetically ablating these neurons in juveniles disrupted
      their ability to imitate features of an adult tutor's song. Ablating these
      neurons in adults had little effect on previously learned songs but interfered
      with their ability to adaptively modify the duration of vocal elements and
      largely prevented the degradation of songs' temporal features that is normally
      caused by deafening. These findings identify a motor to auditory circuit
      essential to vocal imitation and to the adaptive modification of vocal timing.

      spinal muscular atrophy.
PG  - 905-916
LID - 10.1038/nn.4561 [doi]
AB  - Behavioral deficits in neurodegenerative diseases are often attributed to the
      selective dysfunction of vulnerable neurons via cell-autonomous mechanisms.
      Although vulnerable neurons are embedded in neuronal circuits, the contributions 
      of their synaptic partners to disease process are largely unknown. Here we show
      that, in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a reduction in
      proprioceptive synaptic drive leads to motor neuron dysfunction and motor
      behavior impairments. In SMA mice or after the blockade of proprioceptive
      synaptic transmission, we observed a decrease in the motor neuron firing that
      could be explained by the reduction in the expression of the potassium channel
      Kv2.1 at the surface of motor neurons. Chronically increasing neuronal activity
      pharmacologically in vivo led to a normalization of Kv2.1 expression and an
      improvement in motor function. Our results demonstrate a key role of excitatory
      synaptic drive in shaping the function of motor neurons during development and
      the contribution of its disruption to a neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) shares reciprocal connectivity with the prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC), and decreased MD-PFC connectivity is observed in schizophrenia
      patients. Patients also display cognitive deficits including impairments in
      working memory, but a mechanistic link between thalamo-prefrontal circuit
      function and working memory is missing. Using pathway-specific inhibition, we
      found directional interactions between mouse MD and medial PFC (mPFC), with
      MD-to-mPFC supporting working memory maintenance and mPFC-to-MD supporting
      subsequent choice. We further identify mPFC neurons that display elevated spiking
      during the delay, a feature that was absent on error trials and required MD
      inputs for sustained maintenance. Strikingly, delay-tuned neurons had minimal
      overlap with spatially tuned neurons, and each mPFC population exhibited mutually
      exclusive dependence on MD and hippocampal inputs. These findings indicate a role
      for MD in sustaining prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance.
      Consistent with this idea, we found that enhancing MD excitability was sufficient
      to enhance task performance.

TI  - Cortical gamma band synchronization through somatostatin interneurons.
PG  - 951-959
LID - 10.1038/nn.4562 [doi]
AB  - Gamma band rhythms may synchronize distributed cell assemblies to facilitate
      information transfer within and across brain areas, yet their underlying
      mechanisms remain hotly debated. Most circuit models postulate that
      soma-targeting parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons are the essential
      inhibitory neuron subtype necessary for gamma rhythms. Using cell-type-specific
      optogenetic manipulations in behaving animals, we show that dendrite-targeting
      somatostatin (SOM) interneurons are critical for a visually induced,
      context-dependent gamma rhythm in visual cortex. A computational model
      independently predicts that context-dependent gamma rhythms depend critically on 
      SOM interneurons. Further in vivo experiments show that SOM neurons are required 
      for long-distance coherence across the visual cortex. Taken together, these data 
      establish an alternative mechanism for synchronizing distributed networks in
      visual cortex. By operating through dendritic and not just somatic inhibition,
      SOM-mediated oscillations may expand the computational power of gamma rhythms for
      optimizing the synthesis and storage of visual perceptions.

      dopamine-depleted mice.
PG  - 815-823
LID - 10.1038/nn.4559 [doi]
AB  - The identification of distinct cell types in the basal ganglia has been critical 
      to our understanding of basal ganglia function and the treatment of neurological 
      disorders. The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a key contributor to motor
      suppressing pathways in the basal ganglia, yet its neuronal heterogeneity has
      remained an untapped resource for therapeutic interventions. Here we demonstrate 
      that optogenetic interventions that dissociate the activity of two neuronal
      populations in the GPe, elevating the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GPe
      neurons over that of Lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6)-expressing GPe neurons, restores
      movement in dopamine-depleted mice and attenuates pathological activity of basal 
      ganglia output neurons for hours beyond stimulation. These results establish the 
      utility of cell-specific interventions in the GPe to target functionally distinct
      pathways, with the potential to induce long-lasting recovery of movement despite 
      the continued absence of dopamine.

AB  - Moral systems universally prohibit harming others for personal gain. However, we 
      know little about how such principles guide moral behavior. Using a task that
      assesses the financial cost participants ascribe to harming others versus
      themselves, we probed the relationship between moral behavior and neural
      representations of profit and pain. Most participants displayed moral
      preferences, placing a higher cost on harming others than themselves. Moral
      preferences correlated with neural responses to profit, where participants with
      stronger moral preferences had lower dorsal striatal responses to profit gained
      from harming others. Lateral prefrontal cortex encoded profit gained from harming
      others, but not self, and tracked the blameworthiness of harmful choices. Moral
      decisions also modulated functional connectivity between lateral prefrontal
      cortex and the profit-sensitive region of dorsal striatum. The findings suggest
      moral behavior in our task is linked to a neural devaluation of reward realized
      by a prefrontal modulation of striatal value representations.

TI  - Mural lymphatic endothelial cells regulate meningeal angiogenesis in the
      zebrafish.
PG  - 774-783
LID - 10.1038/nn.4558 [doi]
AB  - Mural cells of the vertebrate brain maintain vascular integrity and function,
      play roles in stroke and are involved in maintenance of neural stem cells.
      However, the origins, diversity and roles of mural cells remain to be fully
      understood. Using transgenic zebrafish, we identified a population of isolated
      mural lymphatic endothelial cells surrounding meningeal blood vessels. These
      meningeal mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs) express lymphatic
      endothelial cell markers and form by sprouting from blood vessels. In larvae,
      muLECs develop from a lymphatic endothelial loop in the midbrain into a
      dispersed, nonlumenized mural lineage. muLEC development requires normal
      signaling through the Vegfc-Vegfd-Ccbe1-Vegfr3 pathway. Mature muLECs produce
      vascular growth factors and accumulate low-density lipoproteins from the
      bloodstream. We find that muLECs are essential for normal meningeal
      vascularization. Together, these data identify an unexpected lymphatic lineage
      and developmental mechanism necessary for establishing normal meningeal blood
      vasculature.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4554 [doi]
AB  - Memory-guided behavior requires maintenance of task-relevant information without 
      sensory input, but the underlying circuit mechanism remains unclear. Calcium
      imaging in mice performing a delayed Go or No-Go task revealed robust delay
      activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, with different pyramidal neurons
      signaling Go and No-Go action plans. Inhibiting pyramidal neurons by
      optogenetically activating somatostatin- or parvalbumin-positive interneurons,
      even transiently during the delay, impaired task performance, primarily by
      increasing inappropriate Go responses. In contrast, activating vasoactive
      intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive interneurons enhanced behavioral performance
      and neuronal action plan representation. Furthermore, while endogenous activity
      of somatostatin and parvalbumin neurons was strongly biased toward Go trials, VIP
      neurons were similarly active in Go and No-Go trials. Somatostatin or VIP neuron 
      activation also impaired or enhanced performance, respectively, in a delayed
      two-alternative forced-choice task. Thus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is a
      crucial component of the short-term memory network, and activation of its VIP
      neurons improves memory retention.

TI  - Identification of spinal circuits involved in touch-evoked dynamic mechanical
      pain.
PG  - 804-814
LID - 10.1038/nn.4549 [doi]
AB  - Mechanical hypersensitivity is a debilitating symptom for millions of chronic
      pain patients. It exists in distinct forms, including brush-evoked dynamic and
      filament-evoked punctate hypersensitivities. We reduced dynamic mechanical
      hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury or inflammation in mice by ablating a
      group of adult spinal neurons defined by developmental co-expression of VGLUT3
      and Lbx1 (VT3(Lbx1) neurons): the mice lost brush-evoked nocifensive responses
      and conditional place aversion. Electrophysiological recordings show that
      VT3(Lbx1) neurons form morphine-resistant polysynaptic pathways relaying inputs
      from low-threshold Abeta mechanoreceptors to lamina I output neurons. The subset 
      of somatostatin-lineage neurons preserved in VT3(Lbx1)-neuron-ablated mice is
      largely sufficient to mediate morphine-sensitive and morphine-resistant forms of 
      von Frey filament-evoked punctate mechanical hypersensitivity. Furthermore, acute
      silencing of VT3(Lbx1) neurons attenuated pre-established dynamic mechanical

AB  - Orchestrating appropriate behavioral responses in the face of competing signals
      that predict either rewards or threats in the environment is crucial for
      survival. The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic (PL) medial
      prefrontal cortex have been implicated in reward-seeking and fear-related
      responses, but how information flows between these reciprocally connected
      structures to coordinate behavior is unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from 
      the BLA and PL while rats performed a task wherein competing shock- and
      sucrose-predictive cues were simultaneously presented. The correlated firing
      primarily displayed a BLA-->PL directionality during the shock-associated cue.
      Furthermore, BLA neurons optogenetically identified as projecting to PL more
      accurately predicted behavioral responses during competition than unidentified
      BLA neurons. Finally photostimulation of the BLA-->PL projection increased
      freezing, whereas both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition reduced freezing. 
      Therefore, the BLA-->PL circuit is critical in governing the selection of
      behavioral responses in the face of competing signals.

TI  - Dynamic hidden states underlying working-memory-guided behavior.
PG  - 864-871
LID - 10.1038/nn.4546 [doi]
AB  - Recent theoretical models propose that working memory is mediated by rapid
      transitions in 'activity-silent' neural states (for example, short-term synaptic 
      plasticity). According to the dynamic coding framework, such hidden state
      transitions flexibly configure memory networks for memory-guided behavior and
      dissolve them equally fast to allow forgetting. We developed a perturbation
      approach to measure mnemonic hidden states in an electroencephalogram. By
      'pinging' the brain during maintenance, we show that memory-item-specific
      information is decodable from the impulse response, even in the absence of
      attention and lingering delay activity. Moreover, hidden memories are remarkably 
      flexible: an instruction cue that directs people to forget one item is sufficient
      to wipe the corresponding trace from the hidden state. In contrast, temporarily
      unattended items remain robustly coded in the hidden state, decoupling
      attentional focus from cue-directed forgetting. Finally, the strength of
      hidden-state coding predicts the accuracy of working-memory-guided behavior,
      including memory precision.

PG  - 886-895
LID - 10.1038/nn.4548 [doi]
AB  - While human cognitive abilities are clearly unique, underlying changes in brain
      organization and function remain unresolved. Here we characterized the
      transcriptome of the cortical layers and adjacent white matter in the prefrontal 
      cortexes of humans, chimpanzees and rhesus macaques using unsupervised sectioning
      followed by RNA sequencing. More than 20% of detected genes were expressed
      predominantly in one layer, yielding 2,320 human layer markers. While the bulk of
      the layer markers were conserved among species, 376 switched their expression to 
      another layer in humans. By contrast, only 133 of such changes were detected in
      the chimpanzee brain, suggesting acceleration of cortical reorganization on the
      human evolutionary lineage. Immunohistochemistry experiments further showed that 
      human-specific expression changes were not limited to neurons but affected a
      broad spectrum of cortical cell types. Thus, despite apparent histological
      conservation, human neocortical organization has undergone substantial changes
      affecting more than 5% of its transcriptome.

TI  - A new fate mapping system reveals context-dependent random or clonal expansion of
      microglia.
PG  - 793-803
LID - 10.1038/nn.4547 [doi]
AB  - Microglia constitute a highly specialized network of tissue-resident immune cells
      that is important for the control of tissue homeostasis and the resolution of
      diseases of the CNS. Little is known about how their spatial distribution is
      established and maintained in vivo. Here we establish a new multicolor
      fluorescence fate mapping system to monitor microglial dynamics during steady
      state and disease. Our findings suggest that microglia establish a dense network 
      with regional differences, and the high regional turnover rates found challenge
      the universal concept of microglial longevity. Microglial self-renewal under
      steady state conditions constitutes a stochastic process. During pathology this
      randomness shifts to selected clonal microglial expansion. In the resolution
      phase, excess disease-associated microglia are removed by a dual mechanism of
      cell egress and apoptosis to re-establish the stable microglial network. This
      study unravels the dynamic yet discrete self-organization of mature microglia in 
      the healthy and diseased CNS.

TI  - Abnormal wiring of CCK(+) basket cells disrupts spatial information coding.
PG  - 784-792

AB  - The function of cortical GABAergic interneurons is largely determined by their
      integration into specific neural circuits, but the mechanisms controlling the
      wiring of these cells remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for a
      major population of basket cells that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin
      (CCK). Here we found that the tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 was required for the
      normal integration into cortical circuits of basket cells expressing CCK and
      vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGlut3). The number of inhibitory synapses
      made by CCK(+)VGlut3(+) basket cells and the inhibitory drive they exerted on
      pyramidal cells were reduced in conditional mice lacking ErbB4. Developmental
      disruption of the connectivity of these cells diminished the power of theta
      oscillations during exploratory behavior, disrupted spatial coding by place
      cells, and caused selective alterations in spatial learning and memory in adult
      mice. These results suggest that normal integration of CCK(+) basket cells in
      cortical networks is key to support spatial coding in the hippocampus.

PG  - 845-853

AB  - Cognitive representation of the environment requires a stable hippocampal map,
      but the mechanisms maintaining a given map are unknown. Because sharp
      wave-ripples (SPW-R) orchestrate both retrospective and prospective spatial
      information, we hypothesized that disrupting neuronal activity during SPW-Rs
      affects spatial representation. Mice learned new sets of three goal locations
      daily in a multiwell maze. We used closed-loop SPW-R detection at goal locations 
      to trigger optogenetic silencing of a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Control
      place cells (nonsilenced or silenced outside SPW-Rs) largely maintained the
      location of their place fields after learning and showed increased spatial
      information content. In contrast, the place fields of SPW-R-silenced place cells 
      remapped, and their spatial information remained unaltered. SPW-R silencing did
      not impact the firing rates or proportions of place cells. These results suggest 
      that interference with SPW-R-associated activity during learning prevents
      stabilization and refinement of hippocampal maps.

TI  - The neural correlates of dreaming.
PG  - 872-878
LID - 10.1038/nn.4545 [doi]
AB  - Consciousness never fades during waking. However, when awakened from sleep, we
      sometimes recall dreams and sometimes recall no experiences. Traditionally,
      dreaming has been identified with rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, characterized
      by wake-like, globally 'activated', high-frequency electroencephalographic
      activity. However, dreaming also occurs in non-REM (NREM) sleep, characterized by
      prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural
      correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density
      electroencephalography, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming in
      NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were 
      associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical
      regions. High-frequency activity in these regions correlated with specific dream 
      contents. Monitoring this posterior 'hot zone' in real time predicted whether an 
      individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences during NREM
      sleep, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious
      experiences in sleep.

TI  - Manipulating fear associations via optogenetic modulation of amygdala inputs to
      prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 836-844
LID - 10.1038/nn.4523 [doi]
AB  - Fear-related disorders are thought to reflect strong and persistent fear
      memories. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 
      form strong reciprocal synaptic connections that play a key role in acquisition
      and extinction of fear memories. While synaptic contacts of BLA cells onto mPFC
      neurons are likely to play a crucial role in this process, the BLA connects with 
      several additional nuclei within the fear circuit that could relay
      fear-associated information to the mPFC, and the contribution of direct
      monosynaptic BLA-mPFC inputs is not yet clear. Here we establish an optogenetic
      stimulation protocol that induces synaptic depression in BLA-mPFC synapses. In
      behaving mice, optogenetic high-frequency stimulation of BLA inputs to mPFC
      interfered with retention of cued associations, attenuated previously acquired
      cue-associated responses in mPFC neurons and facilitated extinction. Our findings
      demonstrate the contribution of BLA inputs to mPFC in forming and maintaining
      cued fear associations.

TI  - Dopamine transients are sufficient and necessary for acquisition of model-based
      associations.
PG  - 735-742
LID - 10.1038/nn.4538 [doi]
AB  - Associative learning is driven by prediction errors. Dopamine transients
      correlate with these errors, which current interpretations limit to endowing cues
      with a scalar quantity reflecting the value of future rewards. We tested whether 
      dopamine might act more broadly to support learning of an associative model of
      the environment. Using sensory preconditioning, we show that prediction errors
      underlying stimulus-stimulus learning can be blocked behaviorally and reinstated 
      by optogenetically activating dopamine neurons. We further show that suppressing 
      the firing of these neurons across the transition prevents normal
      stimulus-stimulus learning. These results establish that the acquisition of
      model-based information about transitions between nonrewarding events is also
      driven by prediction errors and that, contrary to existing canon, dopamine
      transients are both sufficient and necessary to support this type of learning.
      Our findings open new possibilities for how these biological signals might
      support associative learning in the mammalian brain in these and other contexts.

TI  - GLP-1 acts on habenular avoidance circuits to control nicotine intake.
PG  - 708-716
LID - 10.1038/nn.4540 [doi]
AB  - Tobacco smokers titrate their nicotine intake to avoid its noxious effects,
      sensitivity to which may influence vulnerability to tobacco dependence, yet
      mechanisms of nicotine avoidance are poorly understood. Here we show that
      nicotine activates glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) neurons in the nucleus tractus
      solitarius (NTS). The antidiabetic drugs sitagliptin and exenatide, which inhibit
      GLP-1 breakdown and stimulate GLP-1 receptors, respectively, decreased nicotine
      intake in mice. Chemogenetic activation of GLP-1 neurons in NTS similarly
      decreased nicotine intake. Conversely, Glp1r knockout mice consumed greater
      quantities of nicotine than wild-type mice. Using optogenetic stimulation, we
      show that GLP-1 excites medial habenular (MHb) projections to the interpeduncular
      nucleus (IPN). Activation of GLP-1 receptors in the MHb-IPN circuit abolished
      nicotine reward and decreased nicotine intake, whereas their knockdown or
      pharmacological blockade increased intake. GLP-1 neurons may therefore serve as
      'satiety sensors' for nicotine that stimulate habenular systems to promote
      nicotine avoidance before its aversive effects are encountered.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms regulate the formation, consolidation and reconsolidation
      of memories. However, the signaling path from neuronal activation to epigenetic
      modifications within the memory-related brain circuit remains unknown. We report 
      that learning induces long-lasting histone modifications in hippocampal
      memory-activated neurons to regulate memory stability. Neuronal activity triggers
      a late-onset shift in Nrxn1 splice isoform choice at splicing site 4 by
      accumulating a repressive histone marker, H3K9me3, to modulate the splicing
      process. Activity-dependent phosphorylation of p66alpha via AMP-activated protein
      kinase recruits HDAC2 and Suv39h1 to establish repressive histone markers and
      changes the connectivity of the activated neurons. Removal of Suv39h1 abolished
      the activity-dependent shift in Nrxn1 splice isoform choice and reduced the
      stability of established memories. We uncover a cell-autonomous process for
      memory preservation in which memory-related neurons initiate a late-onset
      reduction of their rewiring capacities through activity-induced histone
      modifications.

PG  - 661-673

AB  - Brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), also known as cancer stem cells, hijack
      high-affinity glucose uptake active normally in neurons to maintain energy
      demands. Here we link metabolic dysregulation in human BTICs to a nexus between
      MYC and de novo purine synthesis, mediating glucose-sustained anabolic
      metabolism. Inhibiting purine synthesis abrogated BTIC growth, self-renewal and
      in vivo tumor formation by depleting intracellular pools of purine nucleotides,
      supporting purine synthesis as a potential therapeutic point of fragility. In
      contrast, differentiated glioma cells were unaffected by the targeting of purine 
      biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting selective dependence of BTICs. MYC coordinated
      the control of purine synthetic enzymes, supporting its role in metabolic
      reprogramming. Elevated expression of purine synthetic enzymes correlated with
      poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Collectively, our results suggest that
      stem-like glioma cells reprogram their metabolism to self-renew and fuel the
      tumor hierarchy, revealing potential BTIC cancer dependencies amenable to
      targeted therapy.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4533 [doi]
AB  - Blood flow into the brain is dynamically regulated to satisfy the changing
      metabolic requirements of neurons, but how this is accomplished has remained
      unclear. Here we demonstrate a central role for capillary endothelial cells in
      sensing neural activity and communicating it to upstream arterioles in the form
      of an electrical vasodilatory signal. We further demonstrate that this signal is 
      initiated by extracellular K(+) -a byproduct of neural activity-which activates
      capillary endothelial cell inward-rectifier K(+) (KIR2.1) channels to produce a
      rapidly propagating retrograde hyperpolarization that causes upstream arteriolar 
      dilation, increasing blood flow into the capillary bed. Our results establish
      brain capillaries as an active sensory web that converts changes in external K(+)
      into rapid, 'inside-out' electrical signaling to direct blood flow to active
      brain regions.

PG  - 648-660
LID - 10.1038/nn.4532 [doi]
AB  - Neural cultures derived from Huntington's disease (HD) patient-derived induced
      pluripotent stem cells were used for 'omics' analyses to identify mechanisms
      underlying neurodegeneration. RNA-seq analysis identified genes in glutamate and 
      GABA signaling, axonal guidance and calcium influx whose expression was decreased
      in HD cultures. One-third of gene changes were in pathways regulating neuronal
      development and maturation. When mapped to stages of mouse striatal development, 
      the profiles aligned with earlier embryonic stages of neuronal differentiation.
      We observed a strong correlation between HD-related histone marks, gene
      expression and unique peak profiles associated with dysregulated genes,
      suggesting a coordinated epigenetic program. Treatment with isoxazole-9, which
      targets key dysregulated pathways, led to amelioration of expanded polyglutamine 
      repeat-associated phenotypes in neural cells and of cognitive impairment and
      synaptic pathology in HD model R6/2 mice. These data suggest that mutant
      huntingtin impairs neurodevelopmental pathways that could disrupt synaptic
      homeostasis and increase vulnerability to the pathologic consequence of expanded 
      polyglutamine repeats over time.

AB  - Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply
      Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how 
      they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon
      microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent
      eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense
      representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells
      responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital
      airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored
      granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded
      the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to
      form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of
      nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is 
      widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by
      forward models of cerebellar control.

TI  - alpha-Synuclein promotes dilation of the exocytotic fusion pore.
PG  - 681-689
LID - 10.1038/nn.4529 [doi]
AB  - The protein alpha-synuclein has a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's
      disease. Like that of other proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative
      disease, however, the function of alpha-synuclein remains unknown. Localization
      to the nerve terminal suggests a role in neurotransmitter release, and
      overexpression inhibits regulated exocytosis, but previous work has failed to
      identify a clear physiological defect in mice lacking all three synuclein
      isoforms. Using adrenal chromaffin cells and neurons, we now find that both
      overexpressed and endogenous synuclein accelerate the kinetics of individual
      exocytotic events, promoting cargo discharge and reducing pore closure
      ('kiss-and-run'). Thus, synuclein exerts dose-dependent effects on dilation of
      the exocytotic fusion pore. Remarkably, mutations that cause Parkinson's disease 
      abrogate this property of alpha-synuclein without impairing its ability to
      inhibit exocytosis when overexpressed, indicating a selective defect in normal
      function.

TI  - The effect of face patch microstimulation on perception of faces and objects.
PG  - 743-752
LID - 10.1038/nn.4527 [doi]
AB  - What is the range of stimuli encoded by face-selective regions of the brain? We
      asked how electrical microstimulation of face patches in macaque inferotemporal
      cortex affects perception of faces and objects. We found that microstimulation
      strongly distorted face percepts and that this effect depended on precise
      targeting to the center of face patches. While microstimulation had no effect on 
      the percept of many non-face objects, it did affect the percept of some,
      including non-face objects whose shape is consistent with a face (for example,
      apples) as well as somewhat facelike abstract images (for example, cartoon
      houses). Microstimulation even perturbed the percept of certain objects that did 
      not activate the stimulated face patch at all. Overall, these results indicate
      that representation of facial identity is localized to face patches, but activity
      in these patches can also affect perception of face-compatible non-face objects, 
      including objects normally represented in other parts of inferotemporal cortex.

TI  - Regulatory T cells promote myelin regeneration in the central nervous system.
PG  - 674-680
LID - 10.1038/nn.4528 [doi]
AB  - Regeneration of CNS myelin involves differentiation of oligodendrocytes from
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In multiple sclerosis, remyelination can fail
      despite abundant oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, suggesting impairment of
      oligodendrocyte differentiation. T cells infiltrate the CNS in multiple
      sclerosis, yet little is known about T cell functions in remyelination. We report
      that regulatory T cells (Treg) promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and
      (re)myelination. Treg-deficient mice exhibited substantially impaired
      remyelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation, which was rescued by adoptive 
      transfer of Treg. In brain slice cultures, Treg accelerated developmental
      myelination and remyelination, even in the absence of overt inflammation. Treg
      directly promoted oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and myelination
      in vitro. We identified CCN3 as a Treg-derived mediator of oligodendrocyte
      differentiation and myelination in vitro. These findings reveal a new
      regenerative function of Treg in the CNS, distinct from immunomodulation.
      Although the cells were originally named 'Treg' to reflect immunoregulatory
      roles, this also captures emerging, regenerative Treg functions.

TI  - C1 neurons mediate a stress-induced anti-inflammatory reflex in mice.
PG  - 700-707
LID - 10.1038/nn.4526 [doi]
AB  - C1 neurons, located in the medulla oblongata, mediate adaptive autonomic
      responses to physical stressors (for example, hypotension, hemorrhage and
      presence of lipopolysaccharides). We describe here a powerful anti-inflammatory
      effect of restraint stress, mediated by C1 neurons: protection against renal
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. Restraint stress or optogenetic C1 neuron (C1)
      stimulation (10 min) protected mice from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The
      protection was reproduced by injecting splenic T cells that had been preincubated
      with noradrenaline or splenocytes harvested from stressed mice. Stress-induced
      IRI protection was absent in Chrna7 knockout (a7nAChR(-/-)) mice and greatly
      reduced by destroying or transiently inhibiting C1. The protection conferred by
      C1 stimulation was eliminated by splenectomy, ganglionic-blocker administration
      or beta2-adrenergic receptor blockade. Although C1 stimulation elevated plasma
      corticosterone and increased both vagal and sympathetic nerve activity,
      C1-mediated IRI protection persisted after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or
      corticosterone receptor blockade. Overall, acute stress attenuated IRI by
      activating a cholinergic, predominantly sympathetic, anti-inflammatory pathway.
      C1s were necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect.

AB  - Microglia are resident inflammatory cells of the CNS and have important roles in 
      development, homeostasis and a variety of neurologic and psychiatric diseases.
      Difficulties in procuring human microglia have limited their study and hampered
      the clinical translation of microglia-based treatments shown to be effective in
      animal disease models. Here we report the differentiation of human induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into microglia-like cells by exposure to defined
      factors and co-culture with astrocytes. These iPSC-derived microglia have the
      phenotype, gene expression profile and functional properties of brain-isolated
      microglia. Murine iPSC-derived microglia generated using a similar protocol have 
      equivalent efficacy to primary brain-isolated microglia in treatment of murine
      syngeneic intracranial malignant gliomas. The ability to generate human microglia
      facilitates the further study of this important CNS cell type and raises the
      possibility of their use in personalized medicine applications.

TI  - Cell transplantation therapy for spinal cord injury.
PG  - 637-647
LID - 10.1038/nn.4541 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injury can lead to severe motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction.
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for the injured spinal cord. The
      transplantation of Schwann cells, neural stem cells or progenitor cells,
      olfactory ensheathing cells, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mesenchymal stem
      cells has been investigated as potential therapies for spinal cord injury.
      However, little is known about the mechanisms through which these individual cell
      types promote repair and functional improvements. The five most commonly proposed
      mechanisms include neuroprotection, immunomodulation, axon regeneration, neuronal
      relay formation and myelin regeneration. A better understanding of the mechanisms
      whereby these cells promote functional improvements, as well as an appreciation
      of the obstacles in implementing these therapies and effectively modeling spinal 
      cord injury, will be important to make cell transplantation a viable clinical
      option and may lead to the development of more targeted therapies.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing resource identifies 18 new candidate genes for autism
      spectrum disorder.
PG  - 602-611
LID - 10.1038/nn.4524 [doi]
AB  - We are performing whole-genome sequencing of families with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) to build a resource (MSSNG) for subcategorizing the phenotypes and
      underlying genetic factors involved. Here we report sequencing of 5,205 samples
      from families with ASD, accompanied by clinical information, creating a database 
      accessible on a cloud platform and through a controlled-access internet portal.
      We found an average of 73.8 de novo single nucleotide variants and 12.6 de novo
      insertions and deletions or copy number variations per ASD subject. We identified
      18 new candidate ASD-risk genes and found that participants bearing mutations in 
      susceptibility genes had significantly lower adaptive ability (P = 6 x 10(-4)).
      In 294 of 2,620 (11.2%) of ASD cases, a molecular basis could be determined and
      7.2% of these carried copy number variations and/or chromosomal abnormalities,
      emphasizing the importance of detecting all forms of genetic variation as
      diagnostic and therapeutic targets in ASD.

PG  - 581-589

AB  - Midbrain dopamine neurons signal reward prediction error (RPE), or actual minus
      expected reward. The temporal difference (TD) learning model has been a
      cornerstone in understanding how dopamine RPEs could drive associative learning. 
      Classically, TD learning imparts value to features that serially track elapsed
      time relative to observable stimuli. In the real world, however, sensory stimuli 
      provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment, leading 
      to the proposal that TD learning might instead compute a value signal based on an
      inferred distribution of hidden states (a 'belief state'). Here we asked whether 
      dopaminergic signaling supports a TD learning framework that operates over hidden
      states. We found that dopamine signaling showed a notable difference between two 
      tasks that differed only with respect to whether reward was delivered in a
      deterministic manner. Our results favor an associative learning rule that
      combines cached values with hidden-state inference.

TI  - A distinct entorhinal cortex to hippocampal CA1 direct circuit for olfactory
      associative learning.
PG  - 559-570
LID - 10.1038/nn.4517 [doi]
AB  - Lateral and medial parts of entorhinal cortex (EC) convey nonspatial 'what' and
      spatial 'where' information, respectively, into hippocampal CA1, via both the
      indirect EC layer 2--> hippocampal dentate gyrus-->CA3-->CA1 and the direct EC
      layer 3-->CA1 paths. However, it remains elusive how the direct path transfers
      distinct information and contributes to hippocampal learning functions. Here we
      report that lateral EC projection neurons selectively form direct excitatory
      synapses onto a subpopulation of morphologically complex, calbindin-expressing
      pyramidal cells (PCs) in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1), while medial EC neurons uniformly
      innervate all dCA1 PCs. Optogenetically inactivating the distinct lateral EC-dCA1
      connections or the postsynaptic dCA1 calbindin-expressing PC activity slows
      olfactory associative learning. Moreover, optetrode recordings reveal that dCA1
      calbindin-expressing PCs develop more selective spiking responses to odor cues
      during learning. Thus, our results identify a direct lateral EC-->dCA1 circuit
      that is required for olfactory associative learning.

TI  - Ontogenetic establishment of order-specific nuclear organization in the mammalian
      thalamus.
PG  - 516-528
LID - 10.1038/nn.4519 [doi]
AB  - The thalamus connects the cortex with other brain regions and supports sensory
      perception, movement, and cognitive function via numerous distinct nuclei.
      However, the mechanisms underlying the development and organization of diverse
      thalamic nuclei remain largely unknown. Here we report an intricate ontogenetic
      logic of mouse thalamic structures. Individual radial glial progenitors in the
      developing thalamus actively divide and produce a cohort of neuronal progeny that
      shows striking spatial configuration and nuclear occupation related to
      functionality. Whereas the anterior clonal cluster displays relatively more
      tangential dispersion and contributes predominantly to nuclei with cognitive
      functions, the medial ventral posterior clonal cluster forms prominent radial
      arrays and contributes mostly to nuclei with sensory- or motor-related
      activities. Moreover, the first-order and higher-order sensory and motor nuclei
      across different modalities are largely segregated clonally. Notably, sonic
      hedgehog signaling activity influences clonal spatial distribution. Our study
      reveals lineage relationship to be a critical regulator of nonlaminated thalamus 
      development and organization.

AB  - Neurons and neural networks often extend hundreds of micrometers in three
      dimensions. Capturing the calcium transients associated with their activity
      requires volume imaging methods with subsecond temporal resolution. Such speed is
      a challenge for conventional two-photon laser-scanning microscopy, because it
      depends on serial focal scanning in 3D and indicators with limited brightness.
      Here we present an optical module that is easily integrated into standard
      two-photon laser-scanning microscopes to generate an axially elongated Bessel
      focus, which when scanned in 2D turns frame rate into volume rate. We
      demonstrated the power of this approach in enabling discoveries for neurobiology 
      by imaging the calcium dynamics of volumes of neurons and synapses in fruit
      flies, zebrafish larvae, mice and ferrets in vivo. Calcium signals in objects as 
      small as dendritic spines could be resolved at video rates, provided that the
      samples were sparsely labeled to limit overlap in their axially projected images.

TI  - Hippocampal awake replay in fear memory retrieval.
PG  - 571-580
LID - 10.1038/nn.4507 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal place cells are key to episodic memories. How these cells participate
      in memory retrieval remains unclear. After rats acquired a fear memory by
      receiving mild footshocks in a shock zone on a track, we analyzed place cells
      when the animals were placed on the track again and displayed an apparent memory 
      retrieval behavior: avoidance of the shock zone. We found that place cells
      representing the shock zone were reactivated, despite the fact that the animals
      did not enter the shock zone. This reactivation occurred in ripple-associated
      awake replay of place cell sequences encoding the paths from the animal's current
      positions to the shock zone but not in place cell sequences within individual
      cycles of theta oscillation. The result reveals a specific place-cell pattern
      underlying inhibitory avoidance behavior and provides strong evidence for the
      involvement of awake replay in fear memory retrieval.

TI  - One-step optogenetics with multifunctional flexible polymer fibers.
PG  - 612-619
LID - 10.1038/nn.4510 [doi]
AB  - Optogenetic interrogation of neural pathways relies on delivery of
      light-sensitive opsins into tissue and subsequent optical illumination and
      electrical recording from the regions of interest. Despite the recent development
      of multifunctional neural probes, integration of these modalities in a single
      biocompatible platform remains a challenge. We developed a device composed of an 
      optical waveguide, six electrodes and two microfluidic channels produced via
      fiber drawing. Our probes facilitated injections of viral vectors carrying opsin 
      genes while providing collocated neural recording and optical stimulation. The
      miniature (<200 mum) footprint and modest weight (<0.5 g) of these probes allowed
      for multiple implantations into the mouse brain, which enabled
      opto-electrophysiological investigation of projections from the basolateral
      amygdala to the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus during
      behavioral experiments. Fabricated solely from polymers and polymer composites,
      these flexible probes minimized tissue response to achieve chronic multimodal
      interrogation of brain circuits with high fidelity.

      support working memory.
PG  - 590-601
LID - 10.1038/nn.4509 [doi]
AB  - Persistent neural activity is a putative mechanism for the maintenance of working
      memories. Persistent activity relies on the activity of a distributed network of 
      areas, but the differential contribution of each area remains unclear. We
      recorded single neurons in the human medial frontal cortex and medial temporal
      lobe while subjects held up to three items in memory. We found persistently
      active neurons in both areas. Persistent activity of hippocampal and amygdala
      neurons was stimulus-specific, formed stable attractors and was predictive of
      memory content. Medial frontal cortex persistent activity, on the other hand, was
      modulated by memory load and task set but was not stimulus-specific.
      Trial-by-trial variability in persistent activity in both areas was related to
      memory strength, because it predicted the speed and accuracy by which stimuli
      were remembered. This work reveals, in humans, direct evidence for a distributed 
      network of persistently active neurons supporting working memory maintenance.

TI  - Metabotropic action of postsynaptic kainate receptors triggers hippocampal
      long-term potentiation.
PG  - 529-539
LID - 10.1038/nn.4505 [doi]
AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampus is the most extensively
      studied cellular model for learning and memory. Induction of classical LTP
      involves an NMDA-receptor- and calcium-dependent increase in functional synaptic 
      AMPA receptors, mediated by enhanced recycling of internalized AMPA receptors
      back to the postsynaptic membrane. Here we report a physiologically relevant
      NMDA-receptor-independent mechanism that drives increased AMPA receptor recycling
      and LTP. This pathway requires the metabotropic action of kainate receptors and
      activation of G protein, protein kinase C and phospholipase C. Like classical
      LTP, kainate-receptor-dependent LTP recruits recycling endosomes to spines,
      enhances synaptic recycling of AMPA receptors to increase their surface
      expression and elicits structural changes in spines, including increased growth
      and maturation. These data reveal a new and, to our knowledge, previously
      unsuspected role for postsynaptic kainate receptors in the induction of
      functional and structural plasticity in the hippocampus.

      conditioning.
PG  - 540-549
LID - 10.1038/nn.4503 [doi]
AB  - Drugs of abuse alter synaptic connections in the reward circuitry of the brain,
      which leads to long-lasting behavioral changes that underlie addiction. Here we
      show that cadherin adhesion molecules play a critical role in mediating synaptic 
      plasticity and behavioral changes driven by cocaine. We demonstrate that cadherin
      is essential for long-term potentiation in the ventral tegmental area and is
      recruited to the synaptic membranes of excitatory synapses onto dopaminergic
      neurons following cocaine-mediated behavioral conditioning. Furthermore, we show 
      that stabilization of cadherin at the membrane of these synapses blocks
      cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity, leading to a reduction in conditioned place 
      preference induced by cocaine. Our findings identify cadherins and associated
      molecules as targets of interest for understanding pathological plasticity
      associated with addiction.

TI  - Retinal origin of direction selectivity in the superior colliculus.
PG  - 550-558
LID - 10.1038/nn.4498 [doi]
AB  - Detecting visual features in the environment, such as motion direction, is
      crucial for survival. The circuit mechanisms that give rise to direction
      selectivity in a major visual center, the superior colliculus (SC), are entirely 
      unknown. We optogenetically isolate the retinal inputs that individual
      direction-selective SC neurons receive and find that they are already selective
      as a result of precisely converging inputs from similarly tuned retinal ganglion 
      cells. The direction-selective retinal input is linearly amplified by
      intracollicular circuits without changing its preferred direction or level of
      selectivity. Finally, using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that SC direction
      selectivity is dramatically reduced in transgenic mice that have decreased
      retinal selectivity. Together, our studies demonstrate a retinal origin of
      direction selectivity in the SC and reveal a central visual deficit as a
      consequence of altered feature selectivity in the retina.

PG  - 505-512
LID - 10.1038/nn.4506 [doi]
AB  - Reinforcement learning (RL) is the behavioral process of learning the values of
      actions and objects. Most models of RL assume that the dopaminergic prediction
      error signal drives plasticity in frontal-striatal circuits. The striatum then
      encodes value representations that drive decision processes. However, the
      amygdala has also been shown to play an important role in forming Pavlovian
      stimulus-outcome associations. These Pavlovian associations can drive motivated
      behavior via the amygdala projections to the ventral striatum or the ventral
      tegmental area. The amygdala may, therefore, play a central role in RL. Here we
      compare the contributions of the amygdala and the striatum to RL and show that
      both the amygdala and striatum learn and represent expected values in RL tasks.
      Furthermore, value representations in the striatum may be inherited, to some
      extent, from the amygdala. The striatum may, therefore, play less of a primary
      role in learning stimulus-outcome associations in RL than previously suggested.

AB  - The hypothalamic arcuate-median eminence complex (Arc-ME) controls energy
      balance, fertility and growth through molecularly distinct cell types, many of
      which remain unknown. To catalog cell types in an unbiased way, we profiled gene 
      expression in 20,921 individual cells in and around the adult mouse Arc-ME using 
      Drop-seq. We identify 50 transcriptionally distinct Arc-ME cell populations,
      including a rare tanycyte population at the Arc-ME diffusion barrier, a new
      leptin-sensing neuron population, multiple agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and
      pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) subtypes, and an orexigenic somatostatin neuron
      population. We extended Drop-seq to detect dynamic expression changes across
      relevant physiological perturbations, revealing cell type-specific responses to
      energy status, including distinct responses in AgRP and POMC neuron subtypes.
      Finally, integrating our data with human genome-wide association study data
      implicates two previously unknown neuron populations in the genetic control of
      obesity. This resource will accelerate biological discovery by providing insights
      into molecular and cell type diversity from which function can be inferred.

TI  - Neuronal activity modifies the chromatin accessibility landscape in the adult
      brain.
PG  - 476-483
LID - 10.1038/nn.4494 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal activity-induced gene expression modulates the function and plasticity
      of the nervous system. It is unknown whether and to what extent neuronal activity
      may trigger changes in chromatin accessibility, a major mode of epigenetic
      regulation of gene expression. Here we compared chromatin accessibility
      landscapes of adult mouse dentate granule neurons in vivo before and after
      synchronous neuronal activation using an assay for transposase-accessible
      chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We found genome-wide changes 1 h after
      activation, with enrichment of gained-open sites at active enhancer regions and
      at binding sites for AP1-complex components, including c-Fos. Some changes
      remained stable for at least 24 h. Functional analysis further implicates a
      critical role of c-Fos in initiating, but not maintaining, neuronal
      activity-induced chromatin opening. Our results reveal dynamic changes of
      chromatin accessibility in adult mammalian brains and suggest an epigenetic
      mechanism by which transient neuronal activation leads to dynamic changes in gene
      expression via modifying chromatin accessibility.

TI  - Identification of diverse astrocyte populations and their malignant analogs.
PG  - 396-405
LID - 10.1038/nn.4493 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain, where they perform a
      wide array of functions, yet the nature of their cellular heterogeneity and how
      it oversees these diverse roles remains shrouded in mystery. Using an
      intersectional fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based strategy, we identified 
      five distinct astrocyte subpopulations present across three brain regions that
      show extensive molecular diversity. Application of this molecular insight toward 
      function revealed that these populations differentially support synaptogenesis
      between neurons. We identified correlative populations in mouse and human glioma 
      and found that the emergence of specific subpopulations during tumor progression 
      corresponded with the onset of seizures and tumor invasion. In sum, we have
      identified subpopulations of astrocytes in the adult brain and their correlates
      in glioma that are endowed with diverse cellular, molecular and functional
      properties. These populations selectively contribute to synaptogenesis and tumor 
      pathophysiology, providing a blueprint for understanding diverse astrocyte
      contributions to neurological disease.

TI  - Hormonal gain control of a medial preoptic area social reward circuit.
PG  - 449-458
LID - 10.1038/nn.4487 [doi]
AB  - Neural networks that control reproduction must integrate social and hormonal
      signals, tune motivation, and coordinate social interactions. However, the neural
      circuit mechanisms for these processes remain unresolved. The medial preoptic
      area (mPOA), an essential node for social behaviors, comprises molecularly
      diverse neurons with widespread projections. Here we identify a
      steroid-responsive subset of neurotensin (Nts)-expressing mPOA neurons that
      interface with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to form a socially engaged reward
      circuit. Using in vivo two-photon imaging in female mice, we show that mPOA(Nts) 
      neurons preferentially encode attractive male cues compared to nonsocial
      appetitive stimuli. Ovarian hormone signals regulate both the physiological and
      cue-encoding properties of these cells. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of
      mPOA(Nts)-VTA circuitry promotes rewarding phenotypes, social approach and
      striatal dopamine release. Collectively, these data demonstrate that
      steroid-sensitive mPOA neurons encode ethologically relevant stimuli and co-opt
      midbrain reward circuits to promote prosocial behaviors critical for species
      survival.

TI  - Overlearning hyperstabilizes a skill by rapidly making neurochemical processing
      inhibitory-dominant.
PG  - 470-475
LID - 10.1038/nn.4490 [doi]
AB  - Overlearning refers to the continued training of a skill after performance
      improvement has plateaued. Whether overlearning is beneficial is a question in
      our daily lives that has never been clearly answered. Here we report a new
      important role: overlearning in humans abruptly changes neurochemical processing,
      to hyperstabilize and protect trained perceptual learning from subsequent new
      learning. Usually, learning immediately after training is so unstable that it can
      be disrupted by subsequent new learning until after passive stabilization occurs 
      hours later. However, overlearning so rapidly and strongly stabilizes the
      learning state that it not only becomes resilient against, but also disrupts,
      subsequent new learning. Such hyperstabilization is associated with an abrupt
      shift from glutamate-dominant excitatory to GABA-dominant inhibitory processing
      in early visual areas. Hyperstabilization contrasts with passive and slower
      stabilization, which is associated with a mere reduction of excitatory dominance 
      to baseline levels. Using hyperstabilization may lead to efficient learning
      paradigms.

AB  - Contributions of glial cells to neuroenergetics have been the focus of extensive 
      debate. Here we provide positron emission tomography evidence that activation of 
      astrocytic glutamate transport via the excitatory amino acid transporter GLT-1
      triggers widespread but graded glucose uptake in the rodent brain. Our results
      highlight the need for a reevaluation of the interpretation of [(18)F]FDG
      positron emission tomography data, whereby astrocytes would be recognized as
      contributing to the [(18)F]FDG signal.

TI  - Pericyte degeneration leads to neurovascular uncoupling and limits oxygen supply 
      to brain.
PG  - 406-416
LID - 10.1038/nn.4489 [doi]
AB  - Pericytes are perivascular mural cells of brain capillaries. They are positioned 
      centrally in the neurovascular unit between endothelial cells, astrocytes and
      neurons. This position allows them to regulate key neurovascular functions of the
      brain. The role of pericytes in the regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
      neurovascular coupling remains, however, under debate. Using loss-of-function
      pericyte-deficient mice, here we show that pericyte degeneration diminishes
      global and individual capillary CBF responses to neuronal stimuli, resulting in
      neurovascular uncoupling, reduced oxygen supply to the brain and metabolic
      stress. Neurovascular deficits lead over time to impaired neuronal excitability
      and neurodegenerative changes. Thus, pericyte degeneration as seen in
      neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease may contribute to
      neurovascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration associated with human disease.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a pivotal component of an organism's
      response to stressful challenges, and dysfunction of this neuroendocrine axis is 
      associated with a variety of physiological and psychological pathologies. We

      paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is an important central component of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation that prepares the organism for
      successive exposure to stressful stimuli.

TI  - Inhibitory suppression of heterogeneously tuned excitation enhances spatial
      coding in CA1 place cells.
PG  - 417-426
LID - 10.1038/nn.4486 [doi]
AB  - Place cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus express location-specific firing
      despite receiving a steady barrage of heterogeneously tuned excitatory inputs
      that should compromise output dynamic range and timing. We examined the role of
      synaptic inhibition in countering the deleterious effects of off-target
      excitation. Intracellular recordings in behaving mice demonstrate that bimodal
      excitation drives place cells, while unimodal excitation drives weaker or no
      spatial tuning in interneurons. Optogenetic hyperpolarization of interneurons had
      spatially uniform effects on place cell membrane potential dynamics,
      substantially reducing spatial selectivity. These data and a computational model 
      suggest that spatially uniform inhibitory conductance enhances rate coding in
      place cells by suppressing out-of-field excitation and by limiting dendritic
      amplification. Similarly, we observed that inhibitory suppression of phasic noise
      generated by out-of-field excitation enhances temporal coding by expanding the
      range of theta phase precession. Thus, spatially uniform inhibition allows
      proficient and flexible coding in hippocampal CA1 by suppressing heterogeneously 
      tuned excitation.

TI  - An inhibitory pull-push circuit in frontal cortex.
PG  - 389-392
LID - 10.1038/nn.4483 [doi]
AB  - Push-pull is a canonical computation of excitatory cortical circuits. By
      contrast, we identify a pull-push inhibitory circuit in frontal cortex that
      originates in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons.
      During arousal, VIP cells rapidly and directly inhibit pyramidal neurons; VIP
      cells also indirectly excite these pyramidal neurons via parallel disinhibition. 
      Thus, arousal exerts a feedback pull-push influence on excitatory neurons-an
      inversion of the canonical push-pull of feedforward input.

TI  - Circuit specificity in the inhibitory architecture of the VTA regulates
      cocaine-induced behavior.
PG  - 438-448
LID - 10.1038/nn.4482 [doi]
AB  - Afferent inputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) control reward-related
      behaviors through regulation of dopamine neuron activity. The nucleus accumbens
      (NAc) provides one of the most prominent projections to the VTA; however, recent 
      studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the function of these
      inhibitory inputs. Using optogenetics, cell-specific ablation, whole cell
      patch-clamp and immuno-electron microscopy, we found that NAc inputs synapsed
      directly onto dopamine neurons, preferentially activating GABAB receptors.
      GABAergic inputs from the NAc and local VTA GABA neurons were differentially
      modulated and activated separate receptor populations in dopamine neurons.
      Genetic deletion of GABAB receptors from dopamine neurons in adult mice did not
      affect general or morphine-induced locomotor activity, but markedly increased
      cocaine-induced locomotion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate notable
      selectivity in the inhibitory architecture of the VTA and suggest that long-range
      GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons fundamentally regulate behavioral responses 
      to cocaine.

TI  - An intra-amygdala circuit specifically regulates social fear learning.
PG  - 459-469
LID - 10.1038/nn.4481 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive social behavior requires transmission and reception of salient social
      information. Impairment of this reciprocity is a cardinal symptom of autism. The 
      amygdala is a critical mediator of social behavior and is implicated in social
      symptoms of autism. Here we found that a specific amygdala circuit, from the
      lateral nucleus to the medial nucleus (LA-MeA), is required for using social cues
      to learn about environmental cues that signal imminent threats. Disruption of the
      LA-MeA circuit impaired valuation of these environmental cues and subsequent
      ability to use a cue to guide behavior. Rats with impaired social guidance of
      behavior due to knockout of Nrxn1, an analog of autism-associated gene NRXN,
      exhibited marked LA-MeA deficits. Chemogenetic activation of this circuit
      reversed these impaired social behaviors. These findings identify an amygdala
      circuit required to guide emotional responses to socially significant cues and
      identify an exploratory target for disorders associated with social impairments.

TI  - REM sleep selectively prunes and maintains new synapses in development and
      learning.
PG  - 427-437
LID - 10.1038/nn.4479 [doi]
AB  - The functions and underlying mechanisms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep remain 
      unclear. Here we show that REM sleep prunes newly formed postsynaptic dendritic
      spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex during development 
      and motor learning. This REM sleep-dependent elimination of new spines
      facilitates subsequent spine formation during development and when a new motor
      task is learned, indicating a role for REM sleep in pruning to balance the number
      of new spines formed over time. Moreover, REM sleep also strengthens and
      maintains newly formed spines, which are critical for neuronal circuit
      development and behavioral improvement after learning. We further show that
      dendritic calcium spikes arising during REM sleep are important for pruning and
      strengthening new spines. Together, these findings indicate that REM sleep has
      multifaceted functions in brain development, learning and memory consolidation by
      selectively eliminating and maintaining newly formed synapses via dendritic
      calcium spike-dependent mechanisms.

TI  - Computational approaches to fMRI analysis.
PG  - 304-313
LID - 10.1038/nn.4499 [doi]
AB  - Analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience have not always matched the richness
      of fMRI data. Early methods focused on estimating neural activity within
      individual voxels or regions, averaged over trials or blocks and modeled
      separately in each participant. This approach mostly neglected the distributed
      nature of neural representations over voxels, the continuous dynamics of neural
      activity during tasks, the statistical benefits of performing joint inference
      over multiple participants and the value of using predictive models to constrain 
      analysis. Several recent exploratory and theory-driven methods have begun to
      pursue these opportunities. These methods highlight the importance of
      computational techniques in fMRI analysis, especially machine learning,
      algorithmic optimization and parallel computing. Adoption of these techniques is 
      enabling a new generation of experiments and analyses that could transform our
      understanding of some of the most complex-and distinctly human-signals in the
      brain: acts of cognition such as thoughts, intentions and memories.

AB  - Despite its great promise, neuroimaging has yet to substantially impact clinical 
      practice and public health. However, a developing synergy between emerging
      analysis techniques and data-sharing initiatives has the potential to transform
      the role of neuroimaging in clinical applications. We review the state of
      translational neuroimaging and outline an approach to developing brain signatures
      that can be shared, tested in multiple contexts and applied in clinical settings.
      The approach rests on three pillars: (i) the use of multivariate
      pattern-recognition techniques to develop brain signatures for clinical outcomes 
      and relevant mental processes; (ii) assessment and optimization of their
      diagnostic value; and (iii) a program of broad exploration followed by
      increasingly rigorous assessment of generalizability across samples, research
      contexts and populations. Increasingly sophisticated models based on these
      principles will help to overcome some of the obstacles on the road from basic
      neuroscience to better health and will ultimately serve both basic and applied
      goals.

      must define best practices for data analysis, results reporting, and algorithm

      describe insights from developing a set of recommendations on behalf of the
      Organization for Human Brain Mapping and identify barriers that impede these
      practices, including how the discipline must change to fully exploit the
      potential of the world's neuroimaging data.

AB  - Movement, cognition and perception arise from the collective activity of neurons 
      within cortical circuits and across large-scale systems of the brain. While the
      causes of single neuron spikes have been understood for decades, the processes
      that support collective neural behavior in large-scale cortical systems are less 
      clear and have been at times the subject of contention. Modeling large-scale
      brain activity with nonlinear dynamical systems theory allows the integration of 
      experimental data from multiple modalities into a common framework that
      facilitates prediction, testing and possible refutation. This work reviews the
      core assumptions that underlie this computational approach, the methodological
      framework that fosters the translation of theory into the laboratory, and the
      emerging body of supporting evidence. While substantial challenges remain,
      evidence supports the view that collective, nonlinear dynamics are central to
      adaptive cortical activity. Likewise, aberrant dynamic processes appear to
      underlie a number of brain disorders.

AB  - Despite substantial recent progress, our understanding of the principles and
      mechanisms underlying complex brain function and cognition remains incomplete.
      Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching
      brain structure and function from an explicitly integrative perspective, network 
      neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze and model the elements and 
      interactions of neurobiological systems. Two parallel trends drive the approach: 
      the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record
      dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and
      the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The 
      convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of
      scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain
      networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We 
      review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward
      a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.

AB  - We review the aspects that uniquely characterize magnetoencephalography (MEG)
      among the techniques available to explore and resolve brain function and
      dysfunction. While emphasizing its specific strengths in terms of millisecond
      source imaging, we also identify and discuss current practical challenges, in
      particular in signal extraction and interpretation. We also take issue with some 
      perceived disadvantages of MEG, including the misconception that the technique is
      redundant with electroencephalography. Overall, MEG contributes uniquely to our
      deeper comprehension of both regional and large-scale brain dynamics: from the
      functions of neural oscillations and the nature of event-related brain
      activation, to the mechanisms of functional connectivity between regions and the 
      emergence of modes of network communication in brain systems. We expect MEG to
      play an increasing and pivotal role in the elucidation of these grand mechanistic
      principles of cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience.

AB  - The study of neuroanatomy using imaging enables key insights into how our brains 
      function, are shaped by genes and environment, and change with development, aging
      and disease. Developments in MRI acquisition, image processing and data modeling 
      have been key to these advances. However, MRI provides an indirect measurement of
      the biological signals we aim to investigate. Thus, artifacts and key questions
      of correct interpretation can confound the readouts provided by anatomical MRI.
      In this review we provide an overview of the methods for measuring macro- and
      mesoscopic structure and for inferring microstructural properties; we also
      describe key artifacts and confounds that can lead to incorrect conclusions.
      Ultimately, we believe that, although methods need to improve and caution is
      required in interpretation, structural MRI continues to have great promise in
      furthering our understanding of how the brain works.

TI  - Interactions between the microbiota, immune and nervous systems in health and
      disease.
PG  - 145-155
LID - 10.1038/nn.4476 [doi]
AB  - The diverse collection of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract,
      collectively called the gut microbiota, profoundly influences many aspects of
      host physiology, including nutrient metabolism, resistance to infection and
      immune system development. Studies investigating the gut-brain axis demonstrate a
      critical role for the gut microbiota in orchestrating brain development and
      behavior, and the immune system is emerging as an important regulator of these
      interactions. Intestinal microbes modulate the maturation and function of
      tissue-resident immune cells in the CNS. Microbes also influence the activation
      of peripheral immune cells, which regulate responses to neuroinflammation, brain 
      injury, autoimmunity and neurogenesis. Accordingly, both the gut microbiota and
      immune system are implicated in the etiopathogenesis or manifestation of
      neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism
      spectrum disorder, depression and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we discuss
      the role of CNS-resident and peripheral immune pathways in microbiota-gut-brain
      communication during health and neurological disease.

PG  - 136-144

AB  - The CNS is protected by the immune system, including cells that reside directly
      within the CNS and help to ensure proper neural function, as well as cells that
      traffic into the CNS with disease. The CNS-resident immune system is comprised
      mainly of innate immune cells and operates under homeostatic conditions. These
      myeloid cells in the CNS parenchyma and at CNS-periphery interfaces are highly
      specialized but also extremely plastic cells that immediately react to any
      changes in CNS homeostasis and become reactive in the context of
      neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.
      However, when the blood-brain barrier is impaired during CNS diseases such as
      multiple sclerosis or altered with cerebral ischemia, peripheral adaptive and
      innate immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, T cells and B cells, can
      enter the CNS, where they execute distinct cell-mediated effects. On the basis of
      these observations, we assess strategies for targeting peripheral immune cells to
      reduce CNS disease burden.

AB  - Multiple cortical areas contribute to visual processing in mice. However, the
      functional organization and development of higher visual areas are unclear. Here 
      we used intrinsic signal optical imaging and two-photon calcium imaging to map
      visual responses in adult and developing mice. We found that visually driven
      activity was well correlated among higher visual areas within two distinct
      subnetworks resembling the dorsal and ventral visual streams. Visual response
      magnitude in dorsal stream areas slowly increased over the first 2 weeks of
      visual experience. By contrast, ventral stream areas exhibited strong responses
      shortly after eye opening. Neurons in a dorsal stream area showed little change
      in their tuning sharpness to oriented gratings while those in a ventral stream
      area increased stimulus selectivity and expanded their receptive fields
      significantly. Together, these findings provide a functional basis for grouping
      subnetworks of mouse visual areas and revealed stream differences in the
      development of receptive field properties.

TI  - Prefrontal cortical control of a brainstem social behavior circuit.
PG  - 260-270
LID - 10.1038/nn.4470 [doi]
AB  - The prefrontal cortex helps adjust an organism's behavior to its environment. In 
      particular, numerous studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex in the control
      of social behavior, but the neural circuits that mediate these effects remain
      unknown. Here we investigated behavioral adaptation to social defeat in mice and 
      uncovered a critical contribution of neural projections from the medial
      prefrontal cortex to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, a brainstem area vital for
      defensive responses. Social defeat caused a weakening of functional connectivity 
      between these two areas, and selective inhibition of these projections mimicked
      the behavioral effects of social defeat. These findings define a specific neural 
      projection by which the prefrontal cortex can control and adapt social behavior.

TI  - Modulation of excitation on parvalbumin interneurons by neuroligin-3 regulates
      the hippocampal network.
PG  - 219-229
LID - 10.1038/nn.4471 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal network activity is generated by a complex interplay between
      excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. Although much is known
      about the molecular properties of excitatory synapses on pyramidal cells,
      comparatively little is known about excitatory synapses on interneurons. Here we 
      show that conditional deletion of the postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule
      neuroligin-3 in parvalbumin interneurons causes a decrease in
      NMDA-receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents and an increase in presynaptic
      glutamate release probability by selectively impairing the inhibition of
      glutamate release by presynaptic Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors. As a
      result, the neuroligin-3 deletion altered network activity by reducing gamma
      oscillations and sharp wave ripples, changes associated with a decrease in
      extinction of contextual fear memories. These results demonstrate that
      neuroligin-3 specifies the properties of excitatory synapses on
      parvalbumin-containing interneurons by a retrograde trans-synaptic mechanism and 
      suggest a molecular pathway whereby neuroligin-3 mutations contribute to
      neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - Separate elements of episodic memory subserved by distinct hippocampal-prefrontal
      connections.
PG  - 242-250
LID - 10.1038/nn.4472 [doi]
AB  - Episodic memory formation depends on information about a stimulus being
      integrated within a precise spatial and temporal context, a process dependent on 
      the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Investigations of putative functional
      interactions between these regions are complicated by multiple direct and
      indirect hippocampal-prefrontal connections. Here application of a
      pharmacogenetic deactivation technique enabled us to investigate the mnemonic
      contributions of two direct hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathways,
      one arising in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and the other in the intermediate CA1
      (iCA1). While deactivation of either pathway impaired episodic memory, the
      resulting pattern of mnemonic deficits was different: deactivation of the
      dCA1-->mPFC pathway selectively disrupted temporal order judgments while
      iCA1-->mPFC pathway deactivation disrupted spatial memory. These findings reveal 
      a previously unsuspected division of function among CA1 neurons that project
      directly to the mPFC. Such subnetworks may enable the distinctiveness of
      contextual information to be maintained in an episodic memory circuit.

TI  - Developmental broadening of inhibitory sensory maps.
PG  - 189-199
LID - 10.1038/nn.4467 [doi]
AB  - Sensory maps are created by networks of neuronal responses that vary with their
      anatomical position, such that representations of the external world are
      systematically and topographically organized in the brain. Current understanding 
      from studying excitatory maps is that maps are sculpted and refined throughout
      development and/or through sensory experience. Investigating the mouse olfactory 
      bulb, where ongoing neurogenesis continually supplies new inhibitory granule
      cells into existing circuitry, we isolated the development of sensory maps formed
      by inhibitory networks. Using in vivo calcium imaging of odor responses, we
      compared functional responses of both maturing and established granule cells. We 
      found that, in contrast to the refinement observed for excitatory maps,
      inhibitory sensory maps became broader with maturation. However, like excitatory 
      maps, inhibitory sensory maps are sensitive to experience. These data describe
      the development of an inhibitory sensory map as a network, highlighting the
      differences from previously described excitatory maps.

PG  - 271-278

AB  - Emotional arousal can produce lasting, vivid memories for emotional experiences, 
      but little is known about whether emotion can prospectively enhance memory
      formation for temporally distant information. One mechanism that may support
      prospective memory enhancements is the carry-over of emotional brain states that 
      influence subsequent neutral experiences. Here we found that neutral stimuli
      encountered by human subjects 9-33 min after exposure to emotionally arousing
      stimuli had greater levels of recollection during delayed memory testing compared
      to those studied before emotional and after neutral stimulus exposure. Moreover, 
      multiple measures of emotion-related brain activity showed evidence of
      reinstatement during subsequent periods of neutral stimulus encoding. Both slow
      neural fluctuations (low-frequency connectivity) and transient, stimulus-evoked
      activity predictive of trial-by-trial memory formation present during emotional
      encoding were reinstated during subsequent neutral encoding. These results
      indicate that neural measures of an emotional experience can persist in time and 
      bias how new, unrelated information is encoded and recollected.

TI  - Distinct neural mechanisms for the control of thirst and salt appetite in the
      subfornical organ.
PG  - 230-241
LID - 10.1038/nn.4463 [doi]
AB  - Body fluid conditions are continuously monitored in the brain to regulate thirst 
      and salt-appetite sensations. Angiotensin II drives both thirst and salt
      appetite; however, the neural mechanisms underlying selective water- and/or
      salt-intake behaviors remain unknown. Using optogenetics, we show that thirst and
      salt appetite are driven by distinct groups of angiotensin II receptor type
      1a-positive excitatory neurons in the subfornical organ. Neurons projecting to
      the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis control water intake, while those
      projecting to the ventral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis control
      salt intake. Thirst-driving neurons are suppressed under sodium-depleted
      conditions through cholecystokinin-mediated activation of GABAergic neurons. In
      contrast, the salt appetite-driving neurons were suppressed under dehydrated
      conditions through activation of another population of GABAergic neurons by Nax
      signals. These distinct mechanisms in the subfornical organ may underlie the
      selective intakes of water and/or salt and may contribute to body fluid
      homeostasis.

TI  - Molecular interrogation of hypothalamic organization reveals distinct dopamine
      neuronal subtypes.
PG  - 176-188

AB  - The hypothalamus contains the highest diversity of neurons in the brain. Many of 
      these neurons can co-release neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in a
      use-dependent manner. Investigators have hitherto relied on candidate
      protein-based tools to correlate behavioral, endocrine and gender traits with
      hypothalamic neuron identity. Here we map neuronal identities in the hypothalamus
      by single-cell RNA sequencing. We distinguished 62 neuronal subtypes producing
      glutamatergic, dopaminergic or GABAergic markers for synaptic neurotransmission
      and harboring the ability to engage in task-dependent neurotransmitter switching.
      We identified dopamine neurons that uniquely coexpress the Onecut3 and Nmur2
      genes, and placed these in the periventricular nucleus with many synaptic
      afferents arising from neuromedin S(+) neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
      These neuroendocrine dopamine cells may contribute to the dopaminergic inhibition
      of prolactin secretion diurnally, as their neuromedin S(+) inputs originate from 
      neurons expressing Per2 and Per3 and their tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation
      is regulated in a circadian fashion. Overall, our catalog of neuronal subclasses 
      provides new understanding of hypothalamic organization and function.

PG  - 170-172
LID - 10.1038/nn.4464 [doi]
AB  - Flexible navigation demands knowledge of boundaries, routes and their
      relationships. Within a multi-path environment, a subpopulation of subiculum
      neurons robustly encoded the axis of travel. The firing of axis-tuned neurons
      peaked bimodally, at head orientations 180 degrees apart. Environmental
      manipulations showed these neurons to be anchored to environmental boundaries but
      to lack axis tuning in an open arena. Axis-tuned neurons thus provide a powerful 
      mechanism for mapping relationships between routes and the larger environmental
      context.

TI  - An independent, landmark-dominated head-direction signal in dysgranular
      retrosplenial cortex.
PG  - 173-175
LID - 10.1038/nn.4465 [doi]
AB  - We investigated how landmarks influence the brain's computation of head direction
      and found that in a bidirectionally symmetrical environment, some neurons in
      dysgranular retrosplenial cortex showed bidirectional firing patterns. This
      indicates dominance of neural activity by local environmental cues even when
      these conflicted with the global head direction signal. It suggests a mechanism
      for associating landmarks to or dissociating them from the head direction signal,
      according to their directional stability and/or utility.

TI  - Pregnancy leads to long-lasting changes in human brain structure.
PG  - 287-296
LID - 10.1038/nn.4458 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy involves radical hormone surges and biological adaptations. However,
      the effects of pregnancy on the human brain are virtually unknown. Here we show, 
      using a prospective ('pre'-'post' pregnancy) study involving first-time mothers
      and fathers and nulliparous control groups, that pregnancy renders substantial
      changes in brain structure, primarily reductions in gray matter (GM) volume in
      regions subserving social cognition. The changes were selective for the mothers
      and highly consistent, correctly classifying all women as having undergone
      pregnancy or not in-between sessions. Interestingly, the volume reductions showed
      a substantial overlap with brain regions responding to the women's babies
      postpartum. Furthermore, the GM volume changes of pregnancy predicted measures of
      postpartum maternal attachment, suggestive of an adaptive process serving the
      transition into motherhood. Another follow-up session showed that the GM
      reductions endured for at least 2 years post-pregnancy. Our data provide the
      first evidence that pregnancy confers long-lasting changes in a woman's brain.

TI  - A cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of information processing during memory
      consolidation.
PG  - 251-259
LID - 10.1038/nn.4457 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal replay during sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) is thought to drive
      memory consolidation in hippocampal and cortical circuits. Changes in neocortical
      activity can precede SWR events, but whether and how these changes influence the 
      content of replay remains unknown. Here we show that during sleep there is a
      rapid cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of information flow around the times of 
      SWRs. We recorded neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampus of rats
      as they learned a sound-guided task and during sleep. We found that patterned
      activation in AC precedes and predicts the subsequent content of hippocampal
      activity during SWRs, while hippocampal patterns during SWRs predict subsequent
      AC activity. Delivering sounds during sleep biased AC activity patterns, and
      sound-biased AC patterns predicted subsequent hippocampal activity. These
      findings suggest that activation of specific cortical representations during
      sleep influences the identity of the memories that are consolidated into
      long-term stores.

TI  - Manipulating stored phonological input during verbal working memory.
PG  - 279-286

AB  - Verbal working memory (vWM) involves storing and manipulating information in
      phonological sensory input. An influential theory of vWM proposes that
      manipulation is carried out by a central executive while storage is performed by 
      two interacting systems: a phonological input buffer that captures sound-based
      information and an articulatory rehearsal system that controls speech motor
      output. Whether, when and how neural activity in the brain encodes these
      components remains unknown. Here we read out the contents of vWM from neural
      activity in human subjects as they manipulated stored speech sounds. As
      predicted, we identified storage systems that contained both phonological sensory
      and articulatory motor representations. Unexpectedly, however, we found that
      manipulation did not involve a single central executive but rather involved two
      systems with distinct contributions to successful manipulation. We propose,
      therefore, that multiple subsystems comprise the central executive needed to
      manipulate stored phonological input for articulatory motor output in vWM.

TI  - Small-molecule inhibition of STOML3 oligomerization reverses pathological
      mechanical hypersensitivity.
PG  - 209-218
LID - 10.1038/nn.4454 [doi]
AB  - The skin is equipped with specialized mechanoreceptors that allow the perception 
      of the slightest brush. Indeed, some mechanoreceptors can detect even
      nanometer-scale movements. Movement is transformed into electrical signals via
      the gating of mechanically activated ion channels at sensory endings in the skin.
      The sensitivity of Piezo mechanically gated ion channels is controlled by
      stomatin-like protein-3 (STOML3), which is required for normal mechanoreceptor
      function. Here we identify small-molecule inhibitors of STOML3 oligomerization
      that reversibly reduce the sensitivity of mechanically gated currents in sensory 
      neurons and silence mechanoreceptors in vivo. STOML3 inhibitors in the skin also 
      reversibly attenuate fine touch perception in normal mice. Under
      pathophysiological conditions following nerve injury or diabetic neuropathy, the 
      slightest touch can produce pain, and here STOML3 inhibitors can reverse
      mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, small molecules applied locally to the skin
      can be used to modulate touch and may represent peripherally available drugs to
      treat tactile-driven pain following neuropathy.

AB  - Sodium-depleted animals develop an appetite for aversive concentrations of
      sodium. Here we show that chemogenetic activation of aldosterone-sensitive
      neurons that express 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2) in the
      nucleus of the solitary tract is sufficient to drive consumption of
      sodium-containing solutions in mice, independently of thirst or hunger. These
      HSD2-positive neurons are necessary for full expression of sodium appetite and
      have distinct downstream targets that are activated during sodium depletion.

AB  - Postnatal and adult neurogenesis are region- and modality-specific, but the
      significance of developmentally distinct neuronal populations remains unclear. We
      demonstrate that chemogenetic inactivation of a subset of forebrain and olfactory
      neurons generated at birth disrupts responses to an aversive odor. In contrast,
      novel appetitive odor learning is sensitive to inactivation of adult-born
      neurons, revealing that developmentally defined sets of neurons may
      differentially participate in hedonic aspects of sensory learning.

TI  - Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals.
PG  - 115-125

AB  - Our lives revolve around sharing experiences and memories with others. When
      different people recount the same events, how similar are their underlying neural
      representations? Participants viewed a 50-min movie, then verbally described the 
      events during functional MRI, producing unguided detailed descriptions lasting up
      to 40 min. As each person spoke, event-specific spatial patterns were reinstated 
      in default-network, medial-temporal, and high-level visual areas. Individual
      event patterns were both highly discriminable from one another and similar among 
      people, suggesting consistent spatial organization. In many high-order areas,
      patterns were more similar between people recalling the same event than between
      recall and perception, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory.
      These results reveal the existence of a common spatial organization for memories 
      in high-level cortical areas, where encoded information is largely abstracted
      beyond sensory constraints, and that neural patterns during perception are
      altered systematically across people into shared memory representations for
      real-life events.

TI  - A probabilistic approach to demixing odors.
PG  - 98-106
LID - 10.1038/nn.4444 [doi]
AB  - The olfactory system faces a hard problem: on the basis of noisy information from
      olfactory receptor neurons (the neurons that transduce chemicals to neural
      activity), it must figure out which odors are present in the world. Odors almost 
      never occur in isolation, and different odors excite overlapping populations of
      olfactory receptor neurons, so the central challenge of the olfactory system is
      to demix its input. Because of noise and the large number of possible odors,
      demixing is fundamentally a probabilistic inference task. We propose that the
      early olfactory system uses approximate Bayesian inference to solve it. The
      computations involve a dynamical loop between the olfactory bulb and the piriform
      cortex, with cortex explaining incoming activity from the olfactory receptor
      neurons in terms of a mixture of odors. The model is compatible with known
      anatomy and physiology, including pattern decorrelation, and it performs better
      than other models at demixing odors.

TI  - Mechanosensory hair cells express two molecularly distinct mechanotransduction
      channels.
PG  - 24-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4449 [doi]
AB  - Auditory hair cells contain mechanotransduction channels that rapidly open in
      response to sound-induced vibrations. We report here that auditory hair cells
      contain two molecularly distinct mechanotransduction channels. One ion channel is
      activated by sound and is responsible for sensory transduction. This sensory
      transduction channel is expressed in hair cell stereocilia, and previous studies 
      show that its activity is affected by mutations in the genes encoding the
      transmembrane proteins TMHS, TMIE, TMC1 and TMC2. We show here that the second
      ion channel is expressed at the apical surface of hair cells and that it contains
      the Piezo2 protein. The activity of the Piezo2-dependent channel is controlled by
      the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and can be recorded following disruption
      of the sensory transduction machinery or more generally by disruption of the
      sensory epithelium. We thus conclude that hair cells express two molecularly and 
      functionally distinct mechanotransduction channels with different subcellular
      distributions.

PG  - 16-19
LID - 10.1038/nn.4447 [doi]
AB  - The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) send glutamatergic axons to
      medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). We found that this pathway provides
      speed-correlated input to several MEC cell-types in layer 2/3. The speed signal
      is integrated most effectively by pyramidal cells but also excites stellate cells
      and interneurons. Thus, the MSDB conveys speed information that can be used by
      MEC neurons for spatial representation of self-location.

TI  - Direct dorsal hippocampal-prelimbic cortex connections strengthen fear memories.
PG  - 52-61
LID - 10.1038/nn.4443 [doi]
AB  - The ability to regulate the consolidation and strengthening of memories for
      threatening experiences is critical for mental health, and its dysregulation may 
      lead to psychopathologies. Re-exposure to the context in which the threat was
      experienced can either increase or decrease fear response through distinct
      processes known, respectively, as reconsolidation or extinction. Using a context 
      retrieval-dependent memory-enhancement model in rats, we report that memory
      strengthens through activation of direct projections from dorsal hippocampus to
      prelimbic (PL) cortex and activation of critical PL molecular mechanisms that are
      not required for extinction. Furthermore, while sustained PL brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression is required for memory consolidation,
      retrieval engages PL BDNF to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins
      neuroligin 1 and neuroligin 2, which promote memory strengthening while
      inhibiting extinction. Thus, context retrieval-mediated fear-memory enhancement
      results from a concerted action of mechanisms that strengthen memory through
      reconsolidation while suppressing extinction.

TI  - A rapidly acting glutamatergic ARC-->PVH satiety circuit postsynaptically
      regulated by alpha-MSH.
PG  - 42-51
LID - 10.1038/nn.4442 [doi]
AB  - Arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons sense the fed or fasted state and regulate hunger. 
      Agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARC(AgRP) neurons) are
      stimulated by fasting and, once activated, they rapidly (within minutes) drive
      hunger. Pro-opiomelanocortin (ARC(POMC)) neurons are viewed as the counterpoint
      to ARC(AgRP) neurons. They are regulated in an opposite fashion and decrease
      hunger. However, unlike ARC(AgRP) neurons, ARC(POMC) neurons are extremely slow
      in affecting hunger (many hours). Thus, a temporally analogous, rapid ARC satiety
      pathway does not exist or is presently unidentified. Here we show that
      glutamate-releasing ARC neurons expressing oxytocin receptor, unlike ARC(POMC)
      neurons, rapidly cause satiety when chemo- or optogenetically manipulated. These 
      glutamatergic ARC projections synaptically converge with GABAergic ARC(AgRP)
      projections on melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)-expressing satiety neurons in the
      paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH(MC4R) neurons). Transmission across the

TI  - A feedback neural circuit for calibrating aversive memory strength.
PG  - 90-97
LID - 10.1038/nn.4439 [doi]
AB  - Aversive experiences powerfully regulate memory formation, and memory strength is
      proportional to the intensity of these experiences. Inhibition of the neural
      circuits that convey aversive signals when they are predicted by other sensory
      stimuli is hypothesized to set associative memory strength. However, the neural
      circuit mechanisms that produce this predictive inhibition to regulate memory
      formation are unknown. Here we show that predictive sensory cues recruit a
      descending feedback circuit from the central amygdala that activates a specific
      population of midbrain periaqueductal gray pain-modulatory neurons to control
      aversive memory strength. Optogenetic inhibition of this pathway disinhibited
      predicted aversive responses in lateral amygdala neurons, which store fear
      memories, resulting in the resetting of fear learning levels. These results
      reveal a control mechanism for calibrating learning signals to adaptively
      regulate the strength of behavioral learning. Dysregulation of this circuit could
      contribute to psychiatric disorders associated with heightened fear
      responsiveness.

TI  - Vibrissa motor cortex activity suppresses contralateral whisking behavior.
PG  - 82-89
LID - 10.1038/nn.4437 [doi]
AB  - Anatomical, stimulation and lesion data implicate vibrissa motor cortex in
      whisker motor control. Work on motor cortex has focused on movement generation,
      but correlations between vibrissa motor cortex activity and whisking are weak.
      The exact role of vibrissa motor cortex remains unknown. We recorded vibrissa
      motor cortex neurons during various forms of vibrissal touch, which were
      invariably associated with whisker protraction and movement. Free whisking,
      object palpation and social touch all resulted in decreased cortical activity. To
      understand this activity decrease, we performed juxtacellular recordings,
      nanostimulation and in vivo whole-cell recordings. Social touch resulted in
      decreased spiking activity, decreased cell excitability and membrane
      hyperpolarization. Activation of vibrissa motor cortex by intracortical
      microstimulation elicited whisker retraction, as if to abort vibrissal touch.
      Various vibrissa motor cortex inactivation protocols resulted in contralateral
      protraction and increased whisker movements. These data collectively point to
      movement suppression as a prime function of vibrissa motor cortex activity.

TI  - A faithful internal representation of walking movements in the Drosophila visual 
      system.
PG  - 72-81
LID - 10.1038/nn.4435 [doi]
AB  - The integration of sensorimotor signals to internally estimate self-movement is
      critical for spatial perception and motor control. However, which neural circuits
      accurately track body motion and how these circuits control movement remain
      unknown. We found that a population of Drosophila neurons that were sensitive to 
      visual flow patterns typically generated during locomotion, the horizontal system
      (HS) cells, encoded unambiguous quantitative information about the fly's walking 
      behavior independently of vision. Angular and translational velocity signals were
      integrated with a behavioral-state signal and generated direction-selective and
      speed-sensitive graded changes in the membrane potential of these non-spiking
      cells. The nonvisual direction selectivity of HS cells cooperated with their
      visual selectivity only when the visual input matched that expected from the
      fly's movements, thereby revealing a circuit for internally monitoring voluntary 
      walking. Furthermore, given that HS cells promoted leg-based turning, the
      activity of these cells could be used to control forward walking.

TI  - Parallel processing by cortical inhibition enables context-dependent behavior.
PG  - 62-71
LID - 10.1038/nn.4436 [doi]
AB  - Physical features of sensory stimuli are fixed, but sensory perception is context
      dependent. The precise mechanisms that govern contextual modulation remain
      unknown. Here, we trained mice to switch between two contexts: passively
      listening to pure tones and performing a recognition task for the same stimuli.
      Two-photon imaging showed that many excitatory neurons in auditory cortex were
      suppressed during behavior, while some cells became more active. Whole-cell
      recordings showed that excitatory inputs were affected only modestly by context, 
      but inhibition was more sensitive, with PV(+), SOM(+), and VIP(+) interneurons
      balancing inhibition and disinhibition within the network. Cholinergic modulation
      was involved in context switching, with cholinergic axons increasing activity
      during behavior and directly depolarizing inhibitory cells. Network modeling
      captured these findings, but only when modulation coincidently drove all three
      interneuron subtypes, ruling out either inhibition or disinhibition alone as sole
      mechanism for active engagement. Parallel processing of cholinergic modulation by
      cortical interneurons therefore enables context-dependent behavior.

TI  - The spatial structure of correlated neuronal variability.
PG  - 107-114
LID - 10.1038/nn.4433 [doi]
AB  - Shared neural variability is ubiquitous in cortical populations. While this
      variability is presumed to arise from overlapping synaptic input, its precise
      relationship to local circuit architecture remains unclear. We combine
      computational models and in vivo recordings to study the relationship between the
      spatial structure of connectivity and correlated variability in neural circuits. 
      Extending the theory of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, we find
      that spatially localized lateral projections promote weakly correlated spiking,
      but broader lateral projections produce a distinctive spatial correlation
      structure: nearby neuron pairs are positively correlated, pairs at intermediate
      distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. This
      non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is revealed in a new analysis
      of recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex. Our
      findings show that incorporating distance-dependent connectivity improves the
      extent to which balanced network theory can explain correlated neural
      variability.

TI  - A neuronal PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent program of oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment
      and myelination.
PG  - 10-15
LID - 10.1038/nn.4425 [doi]
AB  - The molecular trigger of CNS myelination is unknown. By targeting Pten in
      cerebellar granule cells and activating the AKT1-mTOR pathway, we increased the
      caliber of normally unmyelinated axons and the expression of numerous genes
      encoding regulatory proteins. This led to the expansion of genetically wild-type 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte differentiation and de novo
      myelination of parallel fibers. Thus, a neuronal program dependent on the
      phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 is sufficient to trigger all steps of myelination.

TI  - TRPA1 mediates sensation of the rate of temperature change in Drosophila larvae.
PG  - 34-41
LID - 10.1038/nn.4416 [doi]
AB  - Avoidance of noxious ambient heat is crucial for survival. A well-known
      phenomenon is that animals are sensitive to the rate of temperature change.
      However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings through which animals sense and
      respond much more vigorously to fast temperature changes are unknown. Using
      Drosophila larvae, we found that nociceptive rolling behavior was triggered at
      lower temperatures and at higher frequencies when the temperature increased
      rapidly. We identified neurons in the brain that were sensitive to the speed of
      the temperature increase rather than just to the absolute temperature. These
      cellular and behavioral responses depended on the TRPA1 channel, whose activity
      responded to the rate of temperature increase. We propose that larvae use
      low-threshold sensors in the brain to monitor rapid temperature increases as a
      protective alert signal to trigger rolling behaviors, allowing fast escape before
      the temperature of the brain rises to dangerous levels.

AB  - Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T
      cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model,
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation 
      of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
      inflammasome-independent and interferon-beta (IFNbeta)-resistant EAE (termed type
      B EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the
      NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFNbeta treatment. Instead, an alternative
      inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin-beta receptor
      (LTbetaR) and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE
      development, and type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors.
      Relative expression of Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with 
      IFNbeta-resistant multiple sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to 
      neuronal damages induced by semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4(+) T cells. Our
      data reveal a new inflammatory mechanism by which an IFNbeta-resistant EAE
      subtype develops.

AB  - A fundamental impediment to understanding the brain is the availability of
      inexpensive and robust methods for targeting and manipulating specific neuronal
      populations. The need to overcome this barrier is pressing because there are
      considerable anatomical, physiological, cognitive and behavioral differences
      between mice and higher mammalian species in which it is difficult to
      specifically target and manipulate genetically defined functional cell types. In 
      particular, it is unclear the degree to which insights from mouse models can shed
      light on the neural mechanisms that mediate cognitive functions in higher
      species, including humans. Here we describe a novel recombinant adeno-associated 
      virus that restricts gene expression to GABAergic interneurons within the
      telencephalon. We demonstrate that the viral expression is specific and robust,
      allowing for morphological visualization, activity monitoring and functional
      manipulation of interneurons in both mice and non-genetically tractable species, 
      thus opening the possibility to study GABAergic function in virtually any
      vertebrate species.

AB  - Gravity may provide a ubiquitous allocentric reference to the brain's spatial
      orientation circuits. Here we describe neurons in the macaque anterior thalamus
      tuned to pitch and roll orientation relative to gravity, independently of visual 
      landmarks. We show that individual cells exhibit two-dimensional tuning curves,
      with peak firing rates at a preferred vertical orientation. These results
      identify a thalamic pathway for gravity cues to influence perception, action and 
      spatial cognition.

TI  - The brain adapts to dishonesty.
PG  - 1727-1732
LID - 10.1038/nn.4426 [doi]
AB  - Dishonesty is an integral part of our social world, influencing domains ranging
      from finance and politics to personal relationships. Anecdotally, digressions
      from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow
      over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of
      self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it.
      Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in
      self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show 
      that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest
      behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala 
      sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one
      predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next
      decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery
      slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger
      transgressions.

TI  - Astrocytes mediate neurovascular signaling to capillary pericytes but not to
      arterioles.
PG  - 1619-1627
LID - 10.1038/nn.4428 [doi]
AB  - Active neurons increase their energy supply by dilating nearby arterioles and
      capillaries. This neurovascular coupling underlies blood oxygen level-dependent
      functional imaging signals, but its mechanism is controversial. Canonically,
      neurons release glutamate to activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) 
      on astrocytes, evoking Ca(2+) release from internal stores, activating
      phospholipase A2 and generating vasodilatory arachidonic acid derivatives.
      However, adult astrocytes lack mGluR5, and knockout of the inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors that release Ca(2+) from stores does not affect
      neurovascular coupling. We now show that buffering astrocyte Ca(2+) inhibits
      neuronally evoked capillary dilation, that astrocyte [Ca(2+)]i is raised not by
      release from stores but by entry through ATP-gated channels, and that Ca(2+)
      generates arachidonic acid via phospholipase D2 and diacylglycerol lipase rather 
      than phospholipase A2. In contrast, dilation of arterioles depends on NMDA
      receptor activation and Ca(2+)-dependent NO generation by interneurons. These
      results reveal that different signaling cascades regulate cerebral blood flow at 
      the capillary and arteriole levels.

AB  - Learning and memory are associated with the formation and modification of

      discuss how a focus on assembly formation and consolidation has provided a
      powerful conceptual framework to relate mechanistic studies of synaptic and
      circuit plasticity to behaviorally relevant aspects of learning and memory.
      Neurons are likely recruited to particular learning-related assemblies as a
      function of their relative excitabilities and synaptic activation, followed by
      selective strengthening of pre-existing synapses, formation of new connections
      and elimination of outcompeted synapses to ensure memory formation.
      Mechanistically, these processes involve linking transcription to circuit
      modification. They include the expression of immediate early genes and specific
      molecular and cellular events, supported by network-wide activities that are
      shaped and modulated by local inhibitory microcircuits.

AB  - Long-range projections from the frontal cortex are known to modulate sensory
      processing in multiple modalities. Although the mouse has become an increasingly 
      important animal model for studying the circuit basis of behavior, the functional
      organization of its frontal cortical long-range connectivity remains poorly
      characterized. Here we used virus-assisted circuit mapping to identify the brain 
      networks for top-down modulation of visual, somatosensory and auditory
      processing. The visual cortex is reciprocally connected to the anterior cingulate
      area, whereas the somatosensory and auditory cortices are connected to the
      primary and secondary motor cortices. Anterograde and retrograde tracing
      identified the cortical and subcortical structures belonging to each network.
      Furthermore, using new viral techniques to target subpopulations of frontal
      neurons projecting to the visual cortex versus the superior colliculus, we
      identified two distinct subnetworks within the visual network. These findings
      provide an anatomical foundation for understanding the brain mechanisms
      underlying top-down control of behavior.

AB  - The balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I balance) is maintained across 
      brain regions though the network size, strength and number of synaptic
      connections, and connection architecture may vary substantially. We use a culture
      preparation to examine the homeostatic synaptic scaling rules that produce E-I
      balance and in vivo-like activity. We show that synaptic strength scales with the
      number of connections K as approximately , close to the ideal theoretical value. 
      Using optogenetic techniques, we delivered spatiotemporally patterned stimuli to 
      neurons and confirmed key theoretical predictions: E-I balance is maintained,
      active decorrelation occurs and the spiking correlation increases with firing
      rate. Moreover, the trial-to-trial response variability decreased during
      stimulation, as observed in vivo. These results-obtained in generic cultures,
      predicted by theory and observed in the intact brain-suggest that the synaptic
      scaling rule and resultant dynamics are emergent properties of networks in
      general.

PG  - 1636-1646

AB  - The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a site of convergence of negative and positive 
      stimuli and is critical for emotional behaviors and associations. However, the
      neural substrate for negative and positive behaviors and relationship between
      negative and positive representations in the basolateral amygdala are unknown.
      Here we identify two genetically distinct, spatially segregated populations of
      excitatory neurons in the mouse BLA that participate in valence-specific
      behaviors and are connected through mutual inhibition. These results identify a
      genetically defined neural circuit for the antagonistic control of emotional
      behaviors and memories.

TI  - Layer 4 fast-spiking interneurons filter thalamocortical signals during active
      somatosensation.
PG  - 1647-1657
LID - 10.1038/nn.4412 [doi]
AB  - We rely on movement to explore the environment, for example, by palpating an
      object. In somatosensory cortex, activity related to movement of digits or
      whiskers is suppressed, which could facilitate detection of touch.
      Movement-related suppression is generally assumed to involve corollary
      discharges. Here we uncovered a thalamocortical mechanism in which cortical
      fast-spiking interneurons, driven by sensory input, suppress movement-related
      activity in layer 4 (L4) excitatory neurons. In mice locating objects with their 
      whiskers, neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) fired in response to
      touch and whisker movement. Cortical L4 fast-spiking interneurons inherited these
      responses from VPM. In contrast, L4 excitatory neurons responded mainly to touch.
      Optogenetic experiments revealed that fast-spiking interneurons reduced
      movement-related spiking in excitatory neurons, enhancing selectivity for
      touch-related information during active tactile sensation. These observations
      suggest a fundamental computation performed by the thalamocortical circuit to
      accentuate salient tactile information.

TI  - Activity flow over resting-state networks shapes cognitive task activations.
PG  - 1718-1726
LID - 10.1038/nn.4406 [doi]
AB  - Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has helped reveal the intrinsic
      network organization of the human brain, yet its relevance to cognitive task
      activations has been unclear. Uncertainty remains despite evidence that
      resting-state FC patterns are highly similar to cognitive task activation
      patterns. Identifying the distributed processes that shape localized cognitive
      task activations may help reveal why resting-state FC is so strongly related to
      cognitive task activations. We found that estimating task-evoked activity flow
      (the spread of activation amplitudes) over resting-state FC networks allowed
      prediction of cognitive task activations in a large-scale neural network model.
      Applying this insight to empirical functional MRI data, we found that cognitive
      task activations can be predicted in held-out brain regions (and held-out
      individuals) via estimated activity flow over resting-state FC networks. This
      suggests that task-evoked activity flow over intrinsic networks is a large-scale 
      mechanism explaining the relevance of resting-state FC to cognitive task
      activations.

TI  - C9ORF72 interaction with cofilin modulates actin dynamics in motor neurons.
PG  - 1610-1618
LID - 10.1038/nn.4407 [doi]
AB  - Intronic hexanucleotide expansions in C9ORF72 are common in amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, but it is unknown whether loss of
      function, toxicity by the expanded RNA or dipeptides from non-ATG-initiated
      translation are responsible for the pathophysiology. We determined the
      interactome of C9ORF72 in motor neurons and found that C9ORF72 was present in a
      complex with cofilin and other actin binding proteins. Phosphorylation of cofilin
      was enhanced in C9ORF72-depleted motor neurons, in patient-derived lymphoblastoid
      cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons and post-mortem brain 
      samples from ALS patients. C9ORF72 modulates the activity of the small GTPases
      Arf6 and Rac1, resulting in enhanced activity of LIM-kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2).
      This results in reduced axonal actin dynamics in C9ORF72-depleted motor neurons. 
      Dominant negative Arf6 rescues this defect, suggesting that C9ORF72 acts as a
      modulator of small GTPases in a pathway that regulates axonal actin dynamics.

AB  - Motor skills can be maintained for decades, but the biological basis of this
      memory persistence remains largely unknown. The zebra finch, for example, sings a
      highly stereotyped song that is stable for years, but it is not known whether the
      precise neural patterns underlying song are stable or shift from day to day. Here
      we demonstrate that the population of projection neurons coding for song in the
      premotor nucleus, HVC, change from day to day. The most dramatic shifts occur
      over intervals of sleep. In contrast to the transient participation of excitatory
      neurons, ensemble measurements dominated by inhibition persist unchanged even
      after damage to downstream motor nerves. These observations offer a principle of 
      motor stability: spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition can maintain a stable
      scaffold for motor dynamics while the population of principal neurons that
      directly drive behavior shift from one day to the next.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4404 [doi]
AB  - Disruptive, damaging ultra-rare variants in highly constrained genes are enriched
      in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. In the general population, this
      class of variants was associated with a decrease in years of education (YOE).
      This effect was stronger among highly brain-expressed genes and explained more
      YOE variance than pathogenic copy number variation but less than common variants.
      Disruptive, damaging ultra-rare variants in highly constrained genes influence
      the determinants of YOE in the general population.

PG  - 1697-1706
LID - 10.1038/nn.4401 [doi]
AB  - Memories are stored and retained through complex, coupled processes operating on 
      multiple timescales. To understand the computational principles behind these
      intricate networks of interactions, we construct a broad class of synaptic models
      that efficiently harness biological complexity to preserve numerous memories by
      protecting them against the adverse effects of overwriting. The memory capacity
      scales almost linearly with the number of synapses, which is a substantial
      improvement over the square root scaling of previous models. This was achieved by
      combining multiple dynamical processes that initially store memories in fast
      variables and then progressively transfer them to slower variables. Notably, the 
      interactions between fast and slow variables are bidirectional. The proposed
      models are robust to parameter perturbations and can explain several properties
      of biological memory, including delayed expression of synaptic modifications,
      metaplasticity, and spacing effects.

TI  - Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume identified through
      genome-wide association.
PG  - 1569-1582

AB  - Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during
      development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly
      heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide
      association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci
      for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were
      also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with
      intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic
      correlation with child head circumference (rhogenetic = 0.748), which indicates a
      similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci
      through meta-analysis (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were
      also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, 
      and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT
      signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial
      volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits.

AB  - We studied how the posterior parietal cortex combines new information with
      ongoing activity dynamics as mice accumulate evidence during a virtual navigation
      task. Using new methods to analyze population activity on single trials, we found
      that activity transitioned rapidly between different sets of active neurons. Each
      event in a trial, whether an evidence cue or a behavioral choice, caused
      seconds-long modifications to the probabilities that govern how one activity
      pattern transitions to the next, forming a short-term memory. A sequence of
      evidence cues triggered a chain of these modifications resulting in a signal for 
      accumulated evidence. Multiple distinguishable activity patterns were possible
      for the same accumulated evidence because representations of ongoing events were 
      influenced by previous within- and across-trial events. Therefore, evidence
      accumulation need not require the explicit competition between groups of neurons,
      as in winner-take-all models, but could instead emerge implicitly from general
      dynamical properties that instantiate short-term memory.

TI  - Neural substrate of dynamic Bayesian inference in the cerebral cortex.
PG  - 1682-1689
LID - 10.1038/nn.4390 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic Bayesian inference allows a system to infer the environmental state under
      conditions of limited sensory observation. Using a goal-reaching task, we found
      that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and adjacent posteromedial cortex (PM)
      implemented the two fundamental features of dynamic Bayesian inference:
      prediction of hidden states using an internal state transition model and updating
      the prediction with new sensory evidence. We optically imaged the activity of
      neurons in mouse PPC and PM layers 2, 3 and 5 in an acoustic virtual-reality
      system. As mice approached a reward site, anticipatory licking increased even
      when sound cues were intermittently presented; this was disturbed by PPC
      silencing. Probabilistic population decoding revealed that neurons in PPC and PM 
      represented goal distances during sound omission (prediction), particularly in
      PPC layers 3 and 5, and prediction improved with the observation of cue sounds
      (updating). Our results illustrate how cerebral cortex realizes mental simulation
      using an action-dependent dynamic model.

TI  - Mechanosensing is critical for axon growth in the developing brain.
PG  - 1592-1598
LID - 10.1038/nn.4394 [doi]
AB  - During nervous system development, neurons extend axons along well-defined
      pathways. The current understanding of axon pathfinding is based mainly on
      chemical signaling. However, growing neurons interact not only chemically but
      also mechanically with their environment. Here we identify mechanical signals as 
      important regulators of axon pathfinding. In vitro, substrate stiffness
      determined growth patterns of Xenopus retinal ganglion cell axons. In vivo atomic
      force microscopy revealed a noticeable pattern of stiffness gradients in the
      embryonic brain. Retinal ganglion cell axons grew toward softer tissue, which was
      reproduced in vitro in the absence of chemical gradients. To test the importance 
      of mechanical signals for axon growth in vivo, we altered brain stiffness,
      blocked mechanotransduction pharmacologically and knocked down the
      mechanosensitive ion channel piezo1. All treatments resulted in aberrant axonal
      growth and pathfinding errors, suggesting that local tissue stiffness, read out
      by mechanosensitive ion channels, is critically involved in instructing neuronal 
      growth in vivo.

TI  - Dynamic GABAergic afferent modulation of AgRP neurons.
PG  - 1628-1635
LID - 10.1038/nn.4392 [doi]
AB  - Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus 
      (ARC) promote homeostatic feeding at times of caloric insufficiency, yet they are
      rapidly suppressed by food-related sensory cues before ingestion. Here we
      identify a highly selective inhibitory afferent to AgRP neurons that serves as a 
      neural determinant of this rapid modulation. Specifically, GABAergic projections 
      arising from the ventral compartment of the dorsomedial nucleus of the
      hypothalamus (vDMH) contribute to the preconsummatory modulation of ARC(AgRP)
      neurons. In a manner reciprocal to ARC(AgRP) neurons, ARC-projecting leptin
      receptor-expressing GABAergic vDMH neurons exhibit rapid activation upon
      availability of food that additionally reflects the relative value of the food.
      Thus, leptin receptor-expressing GABAergic vDMH neurons form part of the sensory 
      network that relays real-time information about the nature and availability of
      food to dynamically modulate ARC(AgRP) neuron activity and feeding behavior.

TI  - Global dynamics of selective attention and its lapses in primary auditory cortex.
PG  - 1707-1717
LID - 10.1038/nn.4386 [doi]
AB  - Previous research demonstrated that while selectively attending to relevant
      aspects of the external world, the brain extracts pertinent information by
      aligning its neuronal oscillations to key time points of stimuli or their
      sampling by sensory organs. This alignment mechanism is termed oscillatory
      entrainment. We investigated the global, long-timescale dynamics of this
      mechanism in the primary auditory cortex of nonhuman primates, and hypothesized
      that lapses of entrainment would correspond to lapses of attention. By examining 
      electrophysiological and behavioral measures, we observed that besides the lack
      of entrainment by external stimuli, attentional lapses were also characterized by
      high-amplitude alpha oscillations, with alpha frequency structuring of neuronal
      ensemble and single-unit operations. Entrainment and alpha-oscillation-dominated 
      periods were strongly anticorrelated and fluctuated rhythmically at an ultra-slow
      rate. Our results indicate that these two distinct brain states represent
      externally versus internally oriented computational resources engaged by
      large-scale task-positive and task-negative functional networks.

TI  - L1-associated genomic regions are deleted in somatic cells of the healthy human
      brain.
PG  - 1583-1591
LID - 10.1038/nn.4388 [doi]
AB  - The healthy human brain is a mosaic of varied genomes. Long interspersed
      element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition is known to create mosaicism by
      inserting L1 sequences into new locations of somatic cell genomes. Using a
      machine learning-based, single-cell sequencing approach, we discovered that
      somatic L1-associated variants (SLAVs) are composed of two classes: L1
      retrotransposition insertions and retrotransposition-independent L1-associated
      variants. We demonstrate that a subset of SLAVs comprises somatic deletions
      generated by L1 endonuclease cutting activity. Retrotransposition-independent
      rearrangements in inherited L1s resulted in the deletion of proximal genomic
      regions. These rearrangements were resolved by microhomology-mediated repair,
      which suggests that L1-associated genomic regions are hotspots for somatic copy
      number variants in the brain and therefore a heritable genetic contributor to
      somatic mosaicism. We demonstrate that SLAVs are present in crucial neural genes,
      such as DLG2 (also called PSD93), and affect 44-63% of cells of the cells in the 
      healthy brain.

PG  - 1658-1664
LID - 10.1038/nn.4385 [doi]
AB  - In generative models of brain function, internal representations are used to
      generate predictions of sensory input, yet little is known about how internal
      models influence sensory processing. Here we show that, with experience in a
      virtual environment, the activity of neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual
      cortex (V1) becomes increasingly informative of spatial location. We found that a
      subset of V1 neurons exhibited responses that were predictive of the upcoming
      visual stimulus in a spatially dependent manner and that the omission of an
      expected stimulus drove strong responses in V1. Stimulus-predictive responses
      also emerged in V1-projecting anterior cingulate cortex axons, suggesting that
      anterior cingulate cortex serves as a source of predictions of visual input to
      V1. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that visual cortex forms an
      internal representation of the visual scene based on spatial location and
      compares this representation with feed-forward visual input.

TI  - Chd8 mediates cortical neurogenesis via transcriptional regulation of cell cycle 
      and Wnt signaling.
PG  - 1477-1488
LID - 10.1038/nn.4400 [doi]
AB  - De novo mutations in CHD8 are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder, 
      but the basic biology of CHD8 remains poorly understood. Here we report that Chd8
      knockdown during cortical development results in defective neural progenitor
      proliferation and differentiation that ultimately manifests in abnormal neuronal 
      morphology and behaviors in adult mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that
      while Chd8 stimulates the transcription of cell cycle genes, it also precludes
      the induction of neural-specific genes by regulating the expression of PRC2
      complex components. Furthermore, knockdown of Chd8 disrupts the expression of key
      transducers of Wnt signaling, and enhancing Wnt signaling rescues the
      transcriptional and behavioral deficits caused by Chd8 knockdown. We propose that
      these roles of Chd8 and the dynamics of Chd8 expression during development help
      negotiate the fine balance between neural progenitor proliferation and
      differentiation. Together, these observations provide new insights into the
      neurodevelopmental role of Chd8.

TI  - Increased burden of ultra-rare protein-altering variants among 4,877 individuals 
      with schizophrenia.
PG  - 1433-1441
LID - 10.1038/nn.4402 [doi]
AB  - By analyzing the exomes of 12,332 unrelated Swedish individuals, including 4,877 
      individuals affected with schizophrenia, in ways informed by exome sequences from
      45,376 other individuals, we identified 244,246 coding-sequence and splice-site
      ultra-rare variants (URVs) that were unique to individual Swedes. We found that
      gene-disruptive and putatively protein-damaging URVs (but not synonymous URVs)
      were more abundant among individuals with schizophrenia than among controls (P = 
      1.3 x 10(-10)). This elevation of protein-compromising URVs was several times
      larger than an analogously elevated rate for de novo mutations, suggesting that
      most rare-variant effects on schizophrenia risk are inherited. Among individuals 
      with schizophrenia, the elevated frequency of protein-compromising URVs was
      concentrated in brain-expressed genes, particularly in neuronally expressed
      genes; most of this elevation arose from large sets of genes whose RNAs have been
      found to interact with synaptically localized proteins. Our results suggest that 
      synaptic dysfunction may mediate a large fraction of strong, individually rare
      genetic influences on schizophrenia risk.

PG  - 1506-1512

AB  - Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) Hdac1 and Hdac2 can associate together in
      protein complexes with transcriptional factors such as methyl-CpG-binding protein
      2 (MeCP2). Given their high degree of sequence identity, we examined whether
      Hdac1 and Hdac2 were functionally redundant in mature mouse brain. We demonstrate
      that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 in mice
      impacts neuronal survival and results in an excessive grooming phenotype caused
      by dysregulation of Sap90/Psd95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3; also known as
      Dlgap3) in striatum. Moreover, Hdac1- and Hdac2-dependent regulation of Sapap3
      expression requires MECP2, the gene involved in the pathophysiology of Rett
      syndrome. We show that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of Mecp2 causes
      excessive grooming, which is rescued by restoring striatal Sapap3 expression. Our
      results provide new insight into the upstream regulation of Sapap3 and establish 
      the essential role of striatal Hdac1, Hdac2 and MeCP2 for suppression of
      repetitive behaviors.

AB  - Over 100 genetic loci harbor schizophrenia-associated variants, yet how these
      variants confer liability is uncertain. The CommonMind Consortium sequenced RNA
      from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia (N = 258) and
      control subjects (N = 279), creating a resource of gene expression and its
      genetic regulation. Using this resource, approximately 20% of schizophrenia loci 
      have variants that could contribute to altered gene expression and liability. In 
      five loci, only a single gene was involved: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or
      SNAP91. Altering expression of FURIN, TSNARE1 or CNTN4 changed neurodevelopment
      in zebrafish; knockdown of FURIN in human neural progenitor cells yielded
      abnormal migration. Of 693 genes showing significant case-versus-control
      differential expression, their fold changes were </= 1.33, and an independent
      cohort yielded similar results. Gene co-expression implicates a network relevant

AB  - Medical imaging has enormous potential for early disease prediction, but is
      impeded by the difficulty and expense of acquiring data sets before symptom
      onset. UK Biobank aims to address this problem directly by acquiring
      high-quality, consistently acquired imaging data from 100,000 predominantly
      healthy participants, with health outcomes being tracked over the coming decades.
      The brain imaging includes structural, diffusion and functional modalities. Along
      with body and cardiac imaging, genetics, lifestyle measures, biological
      phenotyping and health records, this imaging is expected to enable discovery of
      imaging markers of a broad range of diseases at their earliest stages, as well as
      provide unique insight into disease mechanisms. We describe UK Biobank brain
      imaging and present results derived from the first 5,000 participants' data
      release. Although this covers just 5% of the ultimate cohort, it has already
      yielded a rich range of associations between brain imaging and other measures
      collected by UK Biobank.

TI  - Foxp2 controls synaptic wiring of corticostriatal circuits and vocal
      communication by opposing Mef2c.
PG  - 1513-1522
LID - 10.1038/nn.4380 [doi]
AB  - Cortico-basal ganglia circuits are critical for speech and language and are
      implicated in autism spectrum disorder, in which language function can be
      severely affected. We demonstrate that in the mouse striatum, the gene Foxp2
      negatively interacts with the synapse suppressor gene Mef2c. We present causal
      evidence that Mef2c inhibition by Foxp2 in neonatal mouse striatum controls
      synaptogenesis of corticostriatal inputs and vocalization in neonates. Mef2c
      suppresses corticostriatal synapse formation and striatal spinogenesis, but can
      itself be repressed by Foxp2 through direct DNA binding. Foxp2 deletion
      de-represses Mef2c, and both intrastriatal and global decrease of Mef2c rescue
      vocalization and striatal spinogenesis defects of Foxp2-deletion mutants. These
      findings suggest that Foxp2-Mef2C signaling is critical to corticostriatal
      circuit formation. If found in humans, such signaling defects could contribute to
      a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Genetic variants conferring risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been
      identified, but the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in ASD is not well
      understood. We performed genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling in
      post-mortem brains from individuals with ASD and controls and identified miRNAs
      and co-regulated modules that were perturbed in ASD. Putative targets of these
      ASD-affected miRNAs were enriched for genes that have been implicated in ASD
      risk. We confirmed regulatory relationships between several miRNAs and their
      putative target mRNAs in primary human neural progenitors. These include
      hsa-miR-21-3p, a miRNA of unknown CNS function that is upregulated in ASD and
      that targets neuronal genes downregulated in ASD, and hsa_can_1002-m, a
      previously unknown, primate-specific miRNA that is downregulated in ASD and that 
      regulates the epidermal growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth factor
      receptor signaling pathways involved in neural development and immune function.
      Our findings support a role for miRNA dysregulation in ASD pathophysiology and
      provide a rich data set and framework for future analyses of miRNAs in
      neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a
      strong genetic basis. Yet, only a small fraction of potentially causal
      genes-about 65 genes out of an estimated several hundred-are known with strong
      genetic evidence from sequencing studies. We developed a complementary
      machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific gene network to present
      a genome-wide prediction of autism risk genes, including hundreds of candidates
      for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach was
      validated in a large independent case-control sequencing study. Leveraging these 
      genome-wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrated that the 
      large set of ASD genes converges on a smaller number of key pathways and
      developmental stages of the brain. Finally, we identified likely pathogenic genes
      within frequent autism-associated copy-number variants and proposed genes and
      pathways that are likely mediators of ASD across multiple copy-number variants.
      All predictions and functional insights are available at

TI  - Ucn3 and CRF-R2 in the medial amygdala regulate complex social dynamics.
PG  - 1489-1496
LID - 10.1038/nn.4346 [doi]
AB  - Social encounters are associated with varying degrees of emotional arousal and
      stress. The mechanisms underlying adequate socioemotional balance are unknown.
      The medial amygdala (MeA) is a brain region associated with social behavior in
      mice. Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type-2 (CRF-R2) and its specific
      ligand urocortin-3 (Ucn3), known components of the behavioral stress response
      system, are highly expressed in the MeA. Here we show that mice deficient in
      CRF-R2 or Ucn3 exhibit abnormally low preference for novel conspecifics.
      MeA-specific knockdown of Crfr2 (Crhr2) in adulthood recapitulated this
      phenotype. In contrast, pharmacological activation of MeA CRF-R2 or optogenetic
      activation of MeA Ucn3 neurons increased preference for novel mice. Furthermore, 
      chemogenetic inhibition of MeA Ucn3 neurons elicited pro-social behavior in
      freely behaving groups of mice without affecting their hierarchal structure.
      These findings collectively suggest that the MeA Ucn3-CRF-R2 system modulates the
      ability of mice to cope with social challenges.

TI  - Histone deacetylase 3 associates with MeCP2 to regulate FOXO and social behavior.
PG  - 1497-1505
LID - 10.1038/nn.4347 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in MECP2 cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). The
      RTT missense MECP2(R306C) mutation prevents MeCP2 from interacting with the
      NCoR/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex; however, the neuronal function of
      HDAC3 is incompletely understood. We found that neuronal deletion of Hdac3 in
      mice elicited abnormal locomotor coordination, sociability and cognition.
      Transcriptional and chromatin profiling revealed that HDAC3 positively regulated 
      a subset of genes and was recruited to active gene promoters via MeCP2.
      HDAC3-associated promoters were enriched for the FOXO transcription factors, and 
      FOXO acetylation was elevated in Hdac3 knockout (KO) and Mecp2 KO neurons. Human 
      RTT-patient-derived MECP2(R306C) neural progenitor cells had deficits in HDAC3
      and FOXO recruitment and gene expression. Gene editing of MECP2(R306C) cells to
      generate isogenic controls rescued HDAC3-FOXO-mediated impairments in gene
      expression. Our data suggest that HDAC3 interaction with MeCP2 positively
      regulates a subset of neuronal genes through FOXO deacetylation, and disruption
      of HDAC3 contributes to cognitive and social impairment.

TI  - Translating genome-wide association findings into new therapeutics for
      psychiatry.
PG  - 1392-1396
LID - 10.1038/nn.4411 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in psychiatry, once they reach sufficient 
      sample size and power, have been enormously successful. The Psychiatric Genomics 
      Consortium (PGC) aims for mega-analyses with sample sizes that will grow to >1
      million individuals in the next 5 years. This should lead to hundreds of new
      findings for common genetic variants across nine psychiatric disorders studied by
      the PGC. The new targets discovered by GWAS have the potential to restart largely
      stalled psychiatric drug development pipelines, and the translation of GWAS
      findings into the clinic is a key aim of the recently funded phase 3 of the PGC. 
      This is not without considerable technical challenges. These approaches
      complement the other main aim of GWAS studies, risk prediction approaches for
      improving detection, differential diagnosis, and clinical trial design. This
      paper outlines the motivations, technical and analytical issues, and the plans
      for translating PGC phase 3 findings into new therapeutics.

AB  - The realm of human uniqueness steadily shrinks; reflecting this, other primates
      suffer from states closer to depression or anxiety than 'depressive-like' or
      'anxiety-like behavior'. Nonetheless, there remain psychiatric domains unique to 
      humans. Appreciating these continuities and discontinuities must inform the
      choice of neurobiological approach used in studying any animal model of
      psychiatric disorders. More fundamentally, the continuities reveal how aspects of
      psychiatric malaise run deeper than our species' history.

TI  - Lessons learned from studying syndromic autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 1408-1417
LID - 10.1038/nn.4420 [doi]
AB  - Syndromic autism spectrum disorders represent a group of childhood neurological
      conditions, typically associated with chromosomal abnormalities or mutations in a
      single gene. The discovery of their genetic causes has increased our
      understanding of the molecular pathways critical for normal cognitive and social 
      development. Human studies have revealed that the brain is particularly sensitive
      to changes in dosage of various proteins from transcriptional and translational
      regulators to synaptic proteins. Investigations of these disorders in animals
      have shed light on previously unknown pathogenic mechanisms leading to the
      identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The
      demonstration of reversibility of several phenotypes in adult mice is
      encouraging, and brings hope that with novel therapies, skills and functionality 
      might improve in affected children and young adults. As new research reveals
      points of convergence between syndromic and nonsyndromic autism spectrum
      disorders, we believe there will be opportunities for shared therapeutics for
      this class of conditions.

AB  - In vivo model systems are a critical tool for gaining insight into the pathology 
      underlying psychiatric disorders. Although modern functional imaging tools allow 
      study of brain correlates of behavior in clinical groups and genome-wide
      association studies are beginning to uncover the complex genetic architecture of 
      psychiatric disorders, there is less understanding of pathology at intervening
      levels of organization. Several psychiatric disorders derive from pathological
      neural plasticity, and studying the mechanisms that underlie these processes,
      including reinforcement learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, requires 
      the use of animals. It will be particularly important to understand how
      individual differences in plasticity mechanisms at a cellular level confer
      resilience on some but lead to disease in others.

PG  - 1397-1407

AB  - Hundreds of genetic loci increasing risk for neuropsychiatric disorders have
      recently been identified. This success, perhaps paradoxically, has posed
      challenges for therapeutic development, which are amplified by the highly
      polygenic and pleiotropic nature of these genetic contributions. Success requires
      understanding the biological impact of single genetic variants and predicting
      their effects within an individual. Comprehensive functional genomic annotation
      of risk loci provides a framework for interpretation of neurobiological impact,
      requiring experimental validation with in vivo or in vitro model systems.
      Systems-level, integrative pathway analyses are beginning to elucidate the
      additive, polygenic contributions of risk variants on specific cellular,
      molecular, developmental, or circuit-level processes. Although most
      neuropsychiatric disease modeling has focused on genes disrupted by rare,
      large-effect-size mutations, common smaller-effect-size variants may also provide
      solid therapeutic targets to inform precision medicine approaches. Here we
      enumerate the promise and challenges of a genomics-driven approach to uncovering 
      neuropsychiatric disease mechanisms and facilitating therapeutic development.

PG  - 1356-66
LID - 10.1038/nn.4377 [doi]
AB  - Dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons are critically involved in a
      variety of behaviors that rely on heightened arousal, but whether they directly
      and causally control the generation and maintenance of wakefulness is unknown. We
      recorded calcium activity using fiber photometry in freely behaving mice and
      found arousal-state-dependent alterations in VTA dopaminergic neurons. We used
      chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations together with polysomnographic
      recordings to demonstrate that VTA dopaminergic neurons are necessary for arousal
      and that their inhibition suppresses wakefulness, even in the face of
      ethologically relevant salient stimuli. Nevertheless, before inducing sleep,
      inhibition of VTA dopaminergic neurons promoted goal-directed and sleep-related
      nesting behavior. Optogenetic stimulation, in contrast, initiated and maintained 
      wakefulness and suppressed sleep and sleep-related nesting behavior. We further
      found that different projections of VTA dopaminergic neurons differentially
      modulate arousal. Collectively, our findings uncover a fundamental role for VTA
      dopaminergic circuitry in the maintenance of the awake state and ethologically
      relevant sleep-related behaviors.

      fear memory.
PG  - 1348-55
LID - 10.1038/nn.4370 [doi]
AB  - Neural circuits underlying auditory fear conditioning have been extensively
      studied. Here we identified a previously unexplored pathway from the lateral
      amygdala (LA) to the auditory cortex (ACx) and found that selective silencing of 
      this pathway using chemo- and optogenetic approaches impaired fear memory
      retrieval. Dual-color in vivo two-photon imaging of mouse ACx showed
      pathway-specific increases in the formation of LA axon boutons, dendritic spines 
      of ACx layer 5 pyramidal cells, and putative LA-ACx synaptic pairs after auditory
      fear conditioning. Furthermore, joint imaging of pre- and postsynaptic structures
      showed that essentially all new synaptic contacts were made by adding new
      partners to existing synaptic elements. Together, these findings identify an
      amygdalocortical projection that is important to fear memory expression and is
      selectively modified by associative fear learning, and unravel a distinct
      architectural rule for synapse formation in the adult brain.

TI  - Episodic sequence memory is supported by a theta-gamma phase code.
PG  - 1374-80
LID - 10.1038/nn.4374 [doi]
AB  - The meaning we derive from our experiences is not a simple static extraction of
      the elements but is largely based on the order in which those elements occur.
      Models propose that sequence encoding is supported by interactions between high- 
      and low-frequency oscillations, such that elements within an experience are
      represented by neural cell assemblies firing at higher frequencies (gamma) and
      sequential order is encoded by the specific timing of firing with respect to a
      lower frequency oscillation (theta). During episodic sequence memory formation in
      humans, we provide evidence that items in different sequence positions exhibit
      greater gamma power along distinct phases of a theta oscillation. Furthermore,
      this segregation is related to successful temporal order memory. Our results
      provide compelling evidence that memory for order, a core component of an
      episodic memory, capitalizes on the ubiquitous physiological mechanism of
      theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling.

AB  - Despite the variety of physiological and target-related functions, little is
      known regarding the cellular complexity in the sympathetic ganglion. We explored 
      the heterogeneity of mouse stellate and thoracic ganglia and found an unexpected 
      variety of cell types. We identified specialized populations of nipple- and
      pilo-erector muscle neurons. These neurons extended axonal projections and were
      born among other neurons during embryogenesis, but remained unspecialized until
      target organogenesis occurred postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type
      specification was coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations 
      of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant
      ligands by the nascent erector muscles. Overall, our results provide compelling
      evidence for a highly sophisticated organization of the sympathetic nervous
      system into discrete outflow channels that project to well-defined target tissues
      and offer mechanistic insight into how diversity and connectivity are established
      during development.

PG  - 1341-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4372 [doi]
AB  - Energy homeostasis, food intake, and body weight are regulated by specific brain 
      circuits. Here we introduce an unexpected neuron, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)
      neuron of the arcuate nucleus (ARC), that we show makes an orexigenic
      contribution. Optogenetic stimulation of mouse ARC TH neurons increased food
      intake; attenuating transmitter release reduced body weight. Optogenetic
      stimulation of ARC TH cells inhibited pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons through
      synaptic mechanisms. ARC TH cells project to the hypothalamic paraventricular
      nucleus; optogenetic stimulation of ARC TH axons inhibited paraventricular
      nucleus neurons by dopamine and GABA co-release. Dopamine excited orexigenic
      neurons that synthesize agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y but inhibited
      anorexigenic neurons that synthesize POMC, as determined by whole cell recording.
      Food deprivation increased c-fos expression and spike frequency in ARC TH
      neurons. The gut peptide ghrelin evoked direct excitatory effects, suggesting
      these neurons monitor metabolic cues. Together these data support the view that
      ARC TH cells play an unrecognized and influential positive role in energy
      homeostasis.

TI  - Active zone scaffolds differentially accumulate Unc13 isoforms to tune Ca(2+)
      channel-vesicle coupling.
PG  - 1311-20
LID - 10.1038/nn.4364 [doi]
AB  - Brain function relies on fast and precisely timed synaptic vesicle (SV) release
      at active zones (AZs). Efficacy of SV release depends on distance from SV to
      Ca(2+) channel, but molecular mechanisms controlling this are unknown. Here we
      found that distances can be defined by targeting two unc-13 (Unc13) isoforms to
      presynaptic AZ subdomains. Super-resolution and intravital imaging of developing 
      Drosophila melanogaster glutamatergic synapses revealed that the Unc13B isoform
      was recruited to nascent AZs by the scaffolding proteins Syd-1 and Liprin-alpha, 
      and Unc13A was positioned by Bruchpilot and Rim-binding protein complexes at
      maturing AZs. Unc13B localized 120 nm away from Ca(2+) channels, whereas Unc13A
      localized only 70 nm away and was responsible for docking SVs at this distance.
      Unc13A(null) mutants suffered from inefficient, delayed and EGTA-supersensitive
      release. Mathematical modeling suggested that synapses normally operate via two
      independent release pathways differentially positioned by either isoform. We
      identified isoform-specific Unc13-AZ scaffold interactions regulating
      SV-Ca(2+)-channel topology whose developmental tightening optimizes synaptic
      transmission.

AB  - The whisker trident, a three-whisker array on the rat's chin, has been implicated
      in egomotion sensing and might function as a tactile speedometer. Here we study
      the cortical representation of trident whiskers and E-row whiskers in barrel
      cortex. Neurons identified in trident cortex of anesthetized animals showed
      sustained velocity-sensitive responses to ground motion. In freely moving
      animals, about two-thirds of the units in the trident and E-row whisker cortices 
      were tuned to locomotion speed, a larger fraction of speed-tuned cells than in
      the somatosensory dysgranular zone. Similarly, more units were tuned to
      acceleration and showed sensitivity to turning in trident and E-row whisker
      cortices than in the dysgranular zone. Microstimulation in locomoting animals
      evoked small but significant speed changes, and such changes were larger in the
      trident and E-row whisker representations than in the dysgranular zone. Thus,
      activity in trident and E-row cortices represents egomotion information and
      influences locomotion behavior.

      neurodegeneration.
PG  - 1321-30
LID - 10.1038/nn.4360 [doi]
AB  - Normal brain function depends on the interaction between highly specialized
      neurons that operate within anatomically and functionally distinct brain regions.
      Neuronal specification is driven by transcriptional programs that are established
      during early neuronal development and remain in place in the adult brain. The
      fidelity of neuronal specification depends on the robustness of the
      transcriptional program that supports the neuron type-specific gene expression
      patterns. Here we show that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which supports 
      neuron specification during differentiation, contributes to the suppression of a 
      transcriptional program that is detrimental to adult neuron function and
      survival. We show that PRC2 deficiency in striatal neurons leads to the
      de-repression of selected, predominantly bivalent PRC2 target genes that are
      dominated by self-regulating transcription factors normally suppressed in these
      neurons. The transcriptional changes in PRC2-deficient neurons lead to
      progressive and fatal neurodegeneration in mice. Our results point to a key role 
      of PRC2 in protecting neurons against degeneration.

AB  - In long-term depression (LTD) at synapses in the adult brain, synaptic strength
      is reduced in an experience-dependent manner. LTD thus provides a cellular
      mechanism for information storage in some forms of learning. A similar
      activity-dependent reduction in synaptic strength also occurs in the developing
      brain and there provides an essential step in synaptic pruning and the postnatal 
      development of neural circuits. Here we review evidence suggesting that LTD and
      synaptic pruning share components of their underlying molecular machinery and may
      thus represent two developmental stages of the same type of synaptic modulation
      that serve different, but related, functions in neural circuit plasticity. We
      also assess the relationship between LTD and synaptic pruning in the context of
      recent findings of LTD dysregulation in several mouse models of autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD) and discuss whether LTD deficits can indicate impaired pruning
      processes that are required for proper brain development.

AB  - In this Perspective, we expand the notion of temporal regulation of RNA in the
      brain and propose that the qualitative nature of RNA and its metabolism, together
      with RNA abundance, are essential for the molecular mechanisms underlying
      experience-dependent plasticity. We discuss emerging concepts in the newly
      burgeoning field of epitranscriptomics, which are predicted to be heavily
      involved in cognitive function. These include activity-induced RNA modifications,
      RNA editing, dynamic changes in the secondary structure of RNA, and RNA
      localization. Each is described with an emphasis on its role in regulating the
      function of both protein-coding genes, as well as various noncoding regulatory
      RNAs, and how each might influence learning and memory.

TI  - Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the value of control.
PG  - 1286-91
LID - 10.1038/nn.4384 [doi]
AB  - Debates over the function(s) of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) have
      persisted for decades. So too have demonstrations of the region's association
      with cognitive control. Researchers have struggled to account for this
      association and, simultaneously, dACC's involvement in phenomena related to
      evaluation and motivation. We describe a recent integrative theory that achieves 
      this goal. It proposes that dACC serves to specify the currently optimal
      allocation of control by determining the overall expected value of control (EVC),
      thereby licensing the associated cognitive effort. The EVC theory accounts for
      dACC's sensitivity to a wide array of experimental variables, and their
      relationship to subsequent control adjustments. Finally, we contrast our theory
      with a recent theory proposing a primary role for dACC in foraging-like
      decisions. We describe why the EVC theory offers a more comprehensive and
      coherent account of dACC function, including dACC's particular involvement in
      decisions regarding foraging or otherwise altering one's behavior.

PG  - 1280-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.4382 [doi]
AB  - Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) carries a wealth of value-related
      information necessary for regulating behavioral flexibility and persistence. It
      signals error and reward events informing decisions about switching or staying
      with current behavior. During decision-making, it encodes the average value of
      exploring alternative choices (search value), even after controlling for response
      selection difficulty, and during learning, it encodes the degree to which
      internal models of the environment and current task must be updated. dACC value
      signals are derived in part from the history of recent reward integrated
      simultaneously over multiple time scales, thereby enabling comparison of
      experience over the recent and extended past. Such ACC signals may instigate
      attentionally demanding and difficult processes such as behavioral change via
      interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, the signal in dACC that instigates 
      behavioral change need not itself be a conflict or difficulty signal.

TI  - Connectivity precedes function in the development of the visual word form area.
PG  - 1250-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.4354 [doi]
AB  - What determines the cortical location at which a given functionally specific
      region will arise in development? We tested the hypothesis that functionally
      specific regions develop in their characteristic locations because of
      pre-existing differences in the extrinsic connectivity of that region to the rest
      of the brain. We exploited the visual word form area (VWFA) as a test case,
      scanning children with diffusion and functional imaging at age 5, before they
      learned to read, and at age 8, after they learned to read. We found the VWFA
      developed functionally in this interval and that its location in a particular
      child at age 8 could be predicted from that child's connectivity fingerprints
      (but not functional responses) at age 5. These results suggest that early
      connectivity instructs the functional development of the VWFA, possibly
      reflecting a general mechanism of cortical development.

TI  - Diminished KCC2 confounds synapse specificity of LTP during senescence.
PG  - 1197-200
LID - 10.1038/nn.4357 [doi]
AB  - The synapse specificity of long-term potentiation (LTP) ensures that no
      interference arises from inputs irrelevant to the memory to be encoded. In
      hippocampi of aged (21-28 months) mice, LTP was relayed to unstimulated synapses,
      blemishing its synapse specificity. Diminished levels of the K(+)/Cl(-)
      cotransporter KCC2 and a depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic component 
      following LTP were the most likely causes for the spreading of potentiation,
      unveiling mechanisms hindering information storage in the aged brain and
      identifying KCC2 as a potential target for intervention.

      disability.
PG  - 1194-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4352 [doi]
AB  - To identify candidate genes for intellectual disability, we performed a
      meta-analysis on 2,637 de novo mutations, identified from the exomes of 2,104
      patient-parent trios. Statistical analyses identified 10 new candidate ID genes: 
      DLG4, PPM1D, RAC1, SMAD6, SON, SOX5, SYNCRIP, TCF20, TLK2 and TRIP12. In
      addition, we show that these genes are intolerant to nonsynonymous variation and 
      that mutations in these genes are associated with specific clinical ID
      phenotypes.

PG  - 1201-9

AB  - The spinal cord is the initial stage that integrates temperature information from
      peripheral inputs. Here we used molecular genetics and in vivo calcium imaging to
      investigate the coding of cutaneous temperature in the spinal cord in mice. We
      found that heating or cooling the skin evoked robust calcium responses in spinal 
      neurons, and their activation threshold temperatures distributed smoothly over
      the entire range of stimulation temperatures. Once activated, heat-responding
      neurons encoded the absolute skin temperature without adaptation and received
      major inputs from transient receptor potential (TRP) channel V1 (TRPV1)-positive 
      dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. By contrast, cold-responding neurons rapidly 
      adapted to ambient temperature and selectively encoded temperature changes. These
      neurons received TRP channel M8 (TRPM8)-positive DRG inputs as well as novel
      TRPV1(+) DRG inputs that were selectively activated by intense cooling. Our
      results provide a comprehensive examination of the temperature representation in 
      the spinal cord and reveal fundamental differences in the coding of heat and
      cold.

AB  - We identified mRNA encoding the ecto-enzyme Enpp6 as a marker of newly forming
      oligodendrocytes, and used Enpp6 in situ hybridization to track oligodendrocyte
      differentiation in adult mice as they learned a motor skill (running on a wheel
      with unevenly spaced rungs). Within just 2.5 h of exposure to the complex wheel, 
      production of Enpp6-expressing immature oligodendrocytes was accelerated in
      subcortical white matter; within 4 h, it was accelerated in motor cortex.
      Conditional deletion of myelin regulatory factor (Myrf) in oligodendrocyte
      precursors blocked formation of new Enpp6(+) oligodendrocytes and impaired
      learning within the same approximately 2-3 h time frame. This very early
      requirement for oligodendrocytes suggests a direct and active role in learning,
      closely linked to synaptic strengthening. Running performance of normal mice
      continued to improve over the following week accompanied by secondary waves of
      oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation. We concluded that
      new oligodendrocytes contribute to both early and late stages of motor skill
      learning.

AB  - The brain transforms physical sensory stimuli into meaningful perceptions. In
      animals making choices about sensory stimuli, neuronal activity in successive
      cortical stages reflects a progression from sensation to decision. Feedforward
      and feedback pathways connecting cortical areas are critical for this
      transformation. However, the computational functions of these pathways are poorly
      understood because pathway-specific activity has rarely been monitored during a
      perceptual task. Using cellular-resolution, pathway-specific imaging, we measured
      neuronal activity across primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices
      of mice performing a tactile detection task. S1 encoded the stimulus better than 
      S2, while S2 activity more strongly reflected perceptual choice. S1 neurons
      projecting to S2 fed forward activity that predicted choice. Activity encoding
      touch and choice propagated in an S1-S2 loop along feedforward and feedback
      axons. Our results suggest that sensory inputs converge into a perceptual outcome
      as feedforward computations are reinforced in a feedback loop.

PG  - 1256-67
LID - 10.1038/nn.4345 [doi]
AB  - Modeling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with human induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSCs) aims to reenact embryogenesis, maturation and aging of spinal motor
      neurons (spMNs) in vitro. As the maturity of spMNs grown in vitro compared to
      spMNs in vivo remains largely unaddressed, it is unclear to what extent this in
      vitro system captures critical aspects of spMN development and molecular
      signatures associated with ALS. Here, we compared transcriptomes among
      iPSC-derived spMNs, fetal spinal tissues and adult spinal tissues. This approach 
      produced a maturation scale revealing that iPSC-derived spMNs were more similar
      to fetal spinal tissue than to adult spMNs. Additionally, we resolved gene
      networks and pathways associated with spMN maturation and aging. These networks
      enriched for pathogenic familial ALS genetic variants and were disrupted in
      sporadic ALS spMNs. Altogether, our findings suggest that developing strategies
      to further mature and age iPSC-derived spMNs will provide more effective iPSC
      models of ALS pathology.

TI  - Infantile amnesia reflects a developmental critical period for hippocampal
      learning.
PG  - 1225-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4348 [doi]
AB  - Episodic memories formed during the first postnatal period are rapidly forgotten,
      a phenomenon known as 'infantile amnesia'. In spite of this memory loss, early
      experiences influence adult behavior, raising the question of which mechanisms
      underlie infantile memories and amnesia. Here we show that in rats an experience 
      learned during the infantile amnesia period is stored as a latent memory trace
      for a long time; indeed, a later reminder reinstates a robust, context-specific
      and long-lasting memory. The formation and storage of this latent memory requires
      the hippocampus, follows a sharp temporal boundary and occurs through mechanisms 
      typical of developmental critical periods, including the expression switch of the
      NMDA receptor subunits from 2B to 2A, which is dependent on brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5).
      Activating BDNF or mGluR5 after training rescues the infantile amnesia. Thus,
      early episodic memories are not lost but remain stored long term. These data
      suggest that the hippocampus undergoes a developmental critical period to become 
      functionally competent.

TI  - Fast and slow transitions in frontal ensemble activity during flexible
      sensorimotor behavior.
PG  - 1234-42
LID - 10.1038/nn.4342 [doi]
AB  - The ability to shift between repetitive and goal-directed actions is a hallmark
      of cognitive control. Previous studies have reported that adaptive shifts in
      behavior are accompanied by changes of neural activity in frontal cortex.
      However, neural and behavioral adaptations can occur at multiple time scales, and
      their relationship remains poorly defined. Here we developed an adaptive
      sensorimotor decision-making task for head-fixed mice, requiring them to shift
      flexibly between multiple auditory-motor mappings. Two-photon calcium imaging of 
      secondary motor cortex (M2) revealed different ensemble activity states for each 
      mapping. When adapting to a conditional mapping, transitions in ensemble activity
      were abrupt and occurred before the recovery of behavioral performance. By
      contrast, gradual and delayed transitions accompanied shifts toward repetitive
      responding. These results demonstrate distinct ensemble signatures associated
      with the start versus end of sensory-guided behavior and suggest that M2 leads in
      engaging goal-directed response strategies that require sensorimotor
      associations.

PG  - 1218-24
LID - 10.1038/nn.4343 [doi]
AB  - Long-term depression (LTD) between cortical layer 4 spiny stellate cells and
      layer 2/3 pyramidal cells requires the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In 
      young rodents, this form of LTD has been repeatedly reported to require
      presynaptic NMDARs for its induction. Here we show that at this synapse in the
      somatosensory cortex of 2- to 3-week-old rats and mice, postsynaptic, not
      presynaptic NMDARs are required for LTD induction. First, we find no evidence for
      functional NMDARs in L4 neuron axons using two-photon laser scanning microscopy
      and two-photon glutamate uncaging. Second, we find that genetic deletion of
      postsynaptic, but not presynaptic NMDARs prevents LTD induction. Finally, the
      pharmacology of the NMDAR requirement is consistent with a nonionic signaling
      mechanism.

PG  - 1175-87
LID - 10.1038/nn.4361 [doi]
AB  - Noninvasive human neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain.
      Numerous methodological advances have also occurred, though inertia has slowed
      their adoption. This paper presents an integrated approach to data acquisition,
      analysis and sharing that builds upon recent advances, particularly from the
      Human Connectome Project (HCP). The 'HCP-style' paradigm has seven core tenets:
      (i) collect multimodal imaging data from many subjects; (ii) acquire data at high
      spatial and temporal resolution; (iii) preprocess data to minimize distortions,
      blurring and temporal artifacts; (iv) represent data using the natural geometry
      of cortical and subcortical structures; (v) accurately align corresponding brain 
      areas across subjects and studies; (vi) analyze data using neurobiologically
      accurate brain parcellations; and (vii) share published data via user-friendly
      databases. We illustrate the HCP-style paradigm using existing HCP data sets and 
      provide guidance for future research. Widespread adoption of this paradigm should
      accelerate progress in understanding the brain in health and disease.

AB  - Understanding how the brain operates requires understanding how large sets of
      neurons function together. Modern recording technology makes it possible to
      simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of neurons, and technological
      developments will soon allow recording of thousands or tens of thousands. As with
      all experimental techniques, these methods are subject to confounds that
      complicate the interpretation of such recordings, and could lead to erroneous
      scientific conclusions. Here we discuss methods for assessing and improving the
      quality of data from these techniques and outline likely future directions in
      this field.

PG  - 1154-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.4358 [doi]
AB  - Neural circuitry has evolved to form distributed networks that act dynamically
      across large volumes. Conventional microscopy collects data from individual
      planes and cannot sample circuitry across large volumes at the temporal
      resolution relevant to neural circuit function and behaviors. Here we review
      emerging technologies for rapid volume imaging of neural circuitry. We focus on
      two critical challenges: the inertia of optical systems, which limits image
      speed, and aberrations, which restrict the image volume. Optical sampling time
      must be long enough to ensure high-fidelity measurements, but optimized sampling 
      strategies and point-spread function engineering can facilitate rapid volume
      imaging of neural activity within this constraint. We also discuss new
      computational strategies for processing and analyzing volume imaging data of
      increasing size and complexity. Together, optical and computational advances are 
      providing a broader view of neural circuit dynamics and helping elucidate how
      brain regions work in concert to support behavior.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4359 [doi]
AB  - Experimental efforts to understand how the brain represents, stores and processes
      information require high-fidelity recordings of multiple different forms of
      neural activity within functional circuits. Thus, creating improved technologies 
      for large-scale recordings of neural activity in the live brain is a crucial goal
      in neuroscience. Over the past two decades, the combination of optical microscopy
      and genetically encoded fluorescent indicators has become a widespread means of
      recording neural activity in nonmammalian and mammalian nervous systems,
      transforming brain research in the process. In this review, we describe and
      assess different classes of fluorescent protein indicators of neural activity. We
      first discuss general considerations in optical imaging and then present salient 
      characteristics of representative indicators. Our focus is on how indicator
      characteristics relate to their use in living animals and on likely areas of
      future progress.

AB  - Cellular specialization is particularly prominent in mammalian nervous systems,
      which are composed of millions to billions of neurons that appear in thousands of
      different 'flavors' and contribute to a variety of functions. Even in a single
      brain region, individual neurons differ greatly in their morphology, connectivity
      and electrophysiological properties. Systematic classification of all mammalian
      neurons is a key goal towards deconstructing the nervous system into its basic
      components. With the recent advances in single-cell gene expression profiling
      technologies, it is now possible to undertake the enormous task of disentangling 
      neuronal heterogeneity. High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and
      multiplexed quantitative RT-PCR have become more accessible, and these
      technologies enable systematic categorization of individual neurons into groups
      with similar molecular properties. Here we provide a conceptual and practical
      guide to classification of neural cell types using single-cell gene expression
      profiling technologies.

AB  - Molecular genetic tools have had a profound impact on neuroscience, but until
      recently their application has largely been confined to a few model species, most
      notably mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.
      With the development of new genome engineering technologies such as CRISPR, it is
      becoming increasingly feasible to apply these molecular tools in a wider range of
      species, including nonhuman primates. This will lead to many opportunities for
      brain research, but it will also pose challenges. Here we identify some of these 
      opportunities and challenges in light of recent and foreseeable technological
      advances and offer some suggestions. Our main focus is on the creation of new
      primate disease models for understanding the pathological mechanisms of brain
      disorders and for developing new approaches to effective treatment. However, we
      also emphasize that primate genetic models have great potential to address many
      fundamental questions about brain function, providing an essential foundation for
      future progress in disease research.

TI  - Neural activity promotes long-distance, target-specific regeneration of adult
      retinal axons.
PG  - 1073-84
LID - 10.1038/nn.4340 [doi]
AB  - Axons in the mammalian CNS fail to regenerate after injury. Here we show that if 
      the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is increased by visual
      stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if 
      enhancement of neural activity is combined with elevation of the
      cell-growth-promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RGC
      axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of
      genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC 
      axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets
      incorrect for their function. Moreover, these regenerated connections were
      successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors. Our findings
      indicate that combining neural activity with activation of mTOR can serve as
      powerful tool for enhancing axon regeneration, and they highlight the remarkable 
      capacity of CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in
      adulthood.

PG  - 1034-40
LID - 10.1038/nn.4339 [doi]
AB  - Neurons in the thalamorecipient layers of sensory cortices integrate thalamic and
      recurrent cortical input. Cortical neurons form fine-scale, functionally cotuned 
      networks, but whether interconnected cortical neurons within a column process
      common thalamocortical inputs is unknown. We tested how local and thalamocortical
      connectivity relate to each other by analyzing cofluctuations of evoked responses
      in cortical neurons after photostimulation of thalamocortical axons. We found
      that connected pairs of pyramidal neurons in layer (L) 4 of mouse visual cortex
      share more inputs from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus than nonconnected
      pairs. Vertically aligned connected pairs of L4 and L2/3 neurons were also
      preferentially contacted by the same thalamocortical axons. Our results provide a
      circuit mechanism for the observed amplification of sensory responses by L4
      circuits. They also show that sensory information is concurrently processed in L4
      and L2/3 by columnar networks of interconnected neurons contacted by the same
      thalamocortical axons.

TI  - Dynamic regulation of RNA editing in human brain development and disease.
PG  - 1093-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4337 [doi]
AB  - RNA editing is increasingly recognized as a molecular mechanism regulating RNA
      activity and recoding proteins. Here we surveyed the global landscape of RNA
      editing in human brain tissues and identified three unique patterns of A-to-I RNA
      editing rates during cortical development: stable high, stable low and
      increasing. RNA secondary structure and the temporal expression of adenosine
      deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) contribute to cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms
      of these RNA editing patterns, respectively. Interestingly, the increasing
      pattern was associated with neuronal maturation, correlated with mRNA abundance
      and potentially influenced miRNA binding energy. Gene ontology analyses
      implicated the increasing pattern in vesicle or organelle membrane-related genes 
      and glutamate signaling pathways. We also found that the increasing pattern was
      selectively perturbed in spinal cord injury and glioblastoma. Our findings reveal
      global and dynamic aspects of RNA editing in brain, providing new insight into
      epitranscriptional regulation of sequence diversity.

AB  - Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) receive cholinergic
      innervation from brainstem structures that are associated with either movement or
      reward. Whereas cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) carry
      an associative/motor signal, those of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT)
      convey limbic information. We used optogenetics and in vivo juxtacellular
      recording and labeling to examine the influence of brainstem cholinergic
      innervation of distinct neuronal subpopulations in the VTA. We found that LDT
      cholinergic axons selectively enhanced the bursting activity of mesolimbic
      dopamine neurons that were excited by aversive stimulation. In contrast, PPN
      cholinergic axons activated and changed the discharge properties of VTA neurons
      that were integrated in distinct functional circuits and were inhibited by
      aversive stimulation. Although both structures conveyed a reinforcing signal,
      they had opposite roles in locomotion. Our results demonstrate that two modes of 
      cholinergic transmission operate in the VTA and segregate the neurons involved in
      different reward circuits.

TI  - Shifted pallidal co-release of GABA and glutamate in habenula drives cocaine
      withdrawal and relapse.
PG  - 1019-24
LID - 10.1038/nn.4334 [doi]
AB  - Cocaine withdrawal produces aversive states and vulnerability to relapse,
      hallmarks of addiction. The lateral habenula (LHb) encodes negative stimuli and
      contributes to aversive withdrawal symptoms. However, it remains unclear which
      inputs to LHb promote this and what the consequences are for relapse
      susceptibility. We report, using rabies-based retrolabeling and optogenetic
      mapping, that the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, the mouse equivalent of the globus
      pallidus interna) projects to an LHb neuronal subset innervating
      aversion-encoding midbrain GABA neurons. EPN-to-LHb excitatory signaling is
      limited by GABAergic cotransmission. This inhibitory component decreases during
      cocaine withdrawal as a result of reduced presynaptic vesicular GABA transporter 
      (VGAT). This shifts the EPN-to-LHb GABA/glutamate balance, disinhibiting
      EPN-driven LHb activity. Selective virally mediated VGAT overexpression at
      EPN-to-LHb terminals during withdrawal normalizes GABAergic neurotransmission.
      This intervention rescues cocaine-evoked aversive states and prevents
      stress-induced reinstatement, used to model relapse. This identifies diminished
      inhibitory transmission at EPN-to-LHb GABA/glutamate synapses as a mechanism
      contributing to the relapsing feature of addictive behavior.

TI  - Neuronal activity enhances tau propagation and tau pathology in vivo.
PG  - 1085-92
LID - 10.1038/nn.4328 [doi]
AB  - Tau protein can transfer between neurons transneuronally and trans-synaptically, 
      which is thought to explain the progressive spread of tauopathy observed in the
      brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that physiological tau
      released from donor cells can transfer to recipient cells via the medium,
      suggesting that at least one mechanism by which tau can transfer is via the
      extracellular space. Neuronal activity has been shown to regulate tau secretion, 
      but its effect on tau pathology is unknown. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic
      approaches, we found that increased neuronal activity stimulates the release of
      tau in vitro and enhances tau pathology in vivo. These data have implications for
      disease pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease and other
      tauopathies.

AB  - Different cortical areas are organized into distinct intracortical subnetworks.
      The manner in which descending pathways from the entire cortex interact
      subcortically as a network remains unclear. We developed an open-access
      comprehensive mesoscale mouse cortico-striatal projectome: a detailed
      connectivity projection map from the entire cerebral cortex to the dorsal
      striatum or caudoputamen (CP) in rodents. On the basis of these projections, we
      used new computational neuroanatomical tools to identify 29 distinct functional
      striatal domains. Furthermore, we characterized different cortico-striatal
      networks and how they reconfigure across the rostral-caudal extent of the CP. The
      workflow was also applied to select cortico-striatal connections in two different
      mouse models of disconnection syndromes to demonstrate its utility for
      characterizing circuitry-specific connectopathies. Together, our results provide 
      the structural basis for studying the functional diversity of the dorsal striatum
      and disruptions of cortico-basal ganglia networks across a broad range of
      disorders.

AB  - Feeding behavior is governed by homeostatic needs and motivational drive to
      obtain palatable foods. Here, we identify a population of glutamatergic neurons
      in the paraventricular thalamus of mice that express the glucose transporter
      Glut2 (encoded by Slc2a2) and project to the nucleus accumbens. These neurons are
      activated by hypoglycemia and, in freely moving mice, their activation by
      optogenetics or Slc2a2 inactivation increases motivated sucrose-seeking but not
      saccharin-seeking behavior. These neurons may control sugar overconsumption in
      obesity and diabetes.

PG  - 992-4
LID - 10.1038/nn.4327 [doi]
AB  - We compared the dynamics of hippocampal and prefrontal interactions in rats as
      they used spatial contexts to guide the retrieval of object memories. Functional 
      connectivity analysis indicated a flow of contextual information from the
      hippocampus to prefrontal cortex upon the rat's entry into the spatial context.
      Conversely, upon the onset of object sampling, the direction of information flow 
      reversed, consistent with prefrontal control over the retrieval of
      context-appropriate hippocampal memory representations.

TI  - Lrp4 in astrocytes modulates glutamatergic transmission.
PG  - 1010-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4326 [doi]
AB  - Neurotransmission requires precise control of neurotransmitter release from axon 
      terminals. This process is regulated by glial cells; however, the underlying
      mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that glutamate release in the brain
      was impaired in mice lacking low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4
      (Lrp4), a protein that is critical for neuromuscular junction formation.
      Electrophysiological studies revealed compromised release probability in
      astrocyte-specific Lrp4 knockout mice. Lrp4 mutant astrocytes suppressed
      glutamatergic transmission by enhancing the release of ATP, whose level was
      elevated in the hippocampus of Lrp4 mutant mice. Consequently, the mutant mice
      were impaired in locomotor activity and spatial memory and were resistant to
      seizure induction. These impairments could be ameliorated by blocking the
      adenosine A1 receptor. The results reveal a critical role for Lrp4, in response
      to agrin, in modulating astrocytic ATP release and synaptic transmission. Our
      findings provide insight into the interaction between neurons and astrocytes for 
      synaptic homeostasis and/or plasticity.

TI  - Zeb2 is essential for Schwann cell differentiation, myelination and nerve repair.
PG  - 1050-1059
LID - 10.1038/nn.4321 [doi]
AB  - Schwann cell development and peripheral nerve myelination require the serial
      expression of transcriptional activators, such as Sox10, Oct6 (also called Scip
      or Pou3f1) and Krox20 (also called Egr2). Here we show that transcriptional
      repression, mediated by the zinc-finger protein Zeb2 (also known as Sip1), is
      essential for differentiation and myelination. Mice lacking Zeb2 in Schwann cells
      develop a severe peripheral neuropathy, caused by failure of axonal sorting and
      virtual absence of myelin membranes. Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells continuously
      express repressors of lineage progression. Moreover, genes for negative
      regulators of maturation such as Sox2 and Ednrb emerge as Zeb2 target genes,
      supporting its function as an 'inhibitor of inhibitors' in myelination control.
      When Zeb2 is deleted in adult mice, Schwann cells readily dedifferentiate
      following peripheral nerve injury and become repair cells. However, nerve
      regeneration and remyelination are both perturbed, demonstrating that Zeb2,
      although undetectable in adult Schwann cells, has a latent function throughout
      life.

AB  - Myelin is synthesized as a multilamellar membrane, but the mechanisms of membrane
      turnover are unknown. We found that myelin pieces were gradually released from
      aging myelin sheaths and were subsequently cleared by microglia. Myelin
      fragmentation increased with age and led to the formation of insoluble,
      lipofuscin-like lysosomal inclusions in microglia. Thus, age-related myelin
      fragmentation is substantial, leading to lysosomal storage and contributing to
      microglial senescence and immune dysfunction in aging.

AB  - The majority of neurons in primary visual cortex are tuned for stimulus
      orientation, but the factors that account for the range of orientation
      selectivities exhibited by cortical neurons remain unclear. To address this
      issue, we used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to characterize the orientation
      tuning and spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs to the dendritic spines of
      individual pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of ferret visual cortex. The summed
      synaptic input to individual neurons reliably predicted the neuron's orientation 
      preference, but did not account for differences in orientation selectivity among 
      neurons. These differences reflected a robust input-output nonlinearity that
      could not be explained by spike threshold alone and was strongly correlated with 
      the spatial clustering of co-tuned synaptic inputs within the dendritic field.
      Dendritic branches with more co-tuned synaptic clusters exhibited greater rates
      of local dendritic calcium events, supporting a prominent role for functional
      clustering of synaptic inputs in dendritic nonlinearities that shape orientation 
      selectivity.

TI  - Zeb2 recruits HDAC-NuRD to inhibit Notch and controls Schwann cell
      differentiation and remyelination.
PG  - 1060-72
LID - 10.1038/nn.4322 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms that coordinate and balance a complex network of opposing
      regulators to control Schwann cell (SC) differentiation remain elusive. Here we
      demonstrate that zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2, also called Sip1)
      transcription factor is a critical intrinsic timer that controls the onset of SC 
      differentiation by recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) and
      nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) co-repressor complexes in
      mice. Zeb2 deletion arrests SCs at an undifferentiated state during peripheral
      nerve development and inhibits remyelination after injury. Zeb2 antagonizes
      inhibitory effectors including Notch and Sox2. Importantly, genome-wide
      transcriptome analysis reveals a Zeb2 target gene encoding the Notch effector
      Hey2 as a potent inhibitor for Schwann cell differentiation. Strikingly, a
      genetic Zeb2 variant associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome disrupts the
      interaction with HDAC1/2-NuRD and abolishes Zeb2 activity for SC differentiation.
      Therefore, Zeb2 controls SC maturation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes and
      inhibiting a Notch-Hey2 signaling axis, pointing to the critical role of
      HDAC1/2-NuRD activity in peripheral neuropathies caused by ZEB2 mutations.

TI  - A fast pathway for fear in human amygdala.
PG  - 1041-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4324 [doi]
AB  - A fast, subcortical pathway to the amygdala is thought to have evolved to enable 
      rapid detection of threat. This pathway's existence is fundamental for
      understanding nonconscious emotional responses, but has been challenged as a
      result of a lack of evidence for short-latency fear-related responses in primate 
      amygdala, including humans. We recorded human intracranial electrophysiological
      data and found fast amygdala responses, beginning 74-ms post-stimulus onset, to
      fearful, but not neutral or happy, facial expressions. These responses had
      considerably shorter latency than fear responses that we observed in visual
      cortex. Notably, fast amygdala responses were limited to low spatial frequency
      components of fearful faces, as predicted by magnocellular inputs to amygdala.
      Furthermore, fast amygdala responses were not evoked by photographs of arousing
      scenes, which is indicative of selective early reactivity to socially relevant
      visual information conveyed by fearful faces. These data therefore support the
      existence of a phylogenetically old subcortical pathway providing fast, but
      coarse, threat-related signals to human amygdala.

PG  - 987-91
LID - 10.1038/nn.4338 [doi]
AB  - Microglial research has entered a fertile, dynamic phase characterized by novel
      technologies including two-photon imaging, whole-genome transcriptomic and
      epigenomic analysis with complementary bioinformatics, unbiased proteomics,
      cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF; Fluidigm) cytometry, and complex high-content
      experimental models including slice culture and zebrafish. Against this vivid
      background of newly emerging data, investigators will encounter in the microglial
      research literature a body of published work using the terminology of macrophage 
      polarization, most commonly into the M1 and M2 phenotypes. It is the assertion of
      this opinion piece that microglial polarization has not been established by
      research findings. Rather, the adoption of this schema was undertaken in an
      attempt to simplify data interpretation at a time when the ontogeny and
      functional significance of microglia had not yet been characterized. Now,
      terminology suggesting established meaningful pathways of microglial polarization
      hinders rather than aids research progress and should be discarded.

TI  - SHANK3 controls maturation of social reward circuits in the VTA.
PG  - 926-934
LID - 10.1038/nn.4319 [doi]
AB  - Haploinsufficiency of SHANK3, encoding the synapse scaffolding protein SHANK3,
      leads to a highly penetrant form of autism spectrum disorder. How SHANK3
      insufficiency affects specific neural circuits and how this is related to
      specific symptoms remains elusive. Here we used shRNA to model Shank3
      insufficiency in the ventral tegmental area of mice. We identified dopamine (DA) 
      and GABA cell-type-specific changes in excitatory synapse transmission that
      converge to reduce DA neuron activity and generate behavioral deficits, including
      impaired social preference. Administration of a positive allosteric modulator of 
      the type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 during the first postnatal
      week restored DA neuron excitatory synapse transmission and partially rescued the
      social preference defects, while optogenetic DA neuron stimulation was sufficient
      to enhance social preference. Collectively, these data reveal the contribution of
      impaired ventral tegmental area function to social behaviors and identify mGluR1 
      modulation during postnatal development as a potential treatment strategy.

TI  - Decoding subjective decisions from orbitofrontal cortex.
PG  - 973-80
LID - 10.1038/nn.4320 [doi]
AB  - When making a subjective choice, the brain must compute a value for each option
      and compare those values to make a decision. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is
      critically involved in this process, but the neural mechanisms remain obscure, in
      part due to limitations in our ability to measure and control the internal
      deliberations that can alter the dynamics of the decision process. Here we
      tracked these dynamics by recovering temporally precise neural states from
      multidimensional data in OFC. During individual choices, OFC alternated between
      states associated with the value of two available options, with dynamics that
      predicted whether a subject would decide quickly or vacillate between the two
      alternatives. Ensembles of value-encoding neurons contributed to these states,
      with individual neurons shifting activity patterns as the network evaluated each 
      option. Thus, the mechanism of subjective decision-making involves the dynamic
      activation of OFC states associated with each choice alternative.

TI  - Topographical representation of odor hedonics in the olfactory bulb.
PG  - 876-8

AB  - Hedonic value is a dominant aspect of olfactory perception. Using optogenetic
      manipulation in freely behaving mice paired with immediate early gene mapping, we
      demonstrate that hedonic information is represented along the antero-posterior
      axis of the ventral olfactory bulb. Using this representation, we show that the
      degree of attractiveness of odors can be bidirectionally modulated by local
      manipulation of the olfactory bulb's neural networks in freely behaving mice.

TI  - YAP and TAZ control peripheral myelination and the expression of laminin
      receptors in Schwann cells.
PG  - 879-87
LID - 10.1038/nn.4316 [doi]
AB  - Myelination is essential for nervous system function. Schwann cells interact with
      neurons and the basal lamina to myelinate axons using known receptors, signals
      and transcription factors. In contrast, the transcriptional control of axonal
      sorting and the role of mechanotransduction in myelination are largely unknown.
      Yap and Taz are effectors of the Hippo pathway that integrate chemical and
      mechanical signals in cells. We describe a previously unknown role for the Hippo 
      pathway in myelination. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice, we show that Taz
      is required in Schwann cells for radial sorting and myelination and that Yap is
      redundant with Taz. Yap and Taz are activated in Schwann cells by mechanical
      stimuli and regulate Schwann cell proliferation and transcription of basal lamina
      receptor genes, both necessary for radial sorting of axons and subsequent
      myelination. These data link transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway and
      of mechanotransduction to myelin formation in Schwann cells.

AB  - Exposures to cocaine and morphine produce similar adaptations in nucleus
      accumbens (NAc)-based behaviors, yet produce very different adaptations at NAc
      excitatory synapses. In an effort to explain this paradox, we found that both
      drugs induced NMDA receptor-containing, AMPA receptor-silent excitatory synapses,
      albeit in distinct cell types through opposing cellular mechanisms. Cocaine
      selectively induced silent synapses in D1-type neurons, likely via a
      synaptogenesis process, whereas morphine induced silent synapses in D2-type
      neurons via internalization of AMPA receptors from pre-existing synapses. After
      drug withdrawal, cocaine-generated silent synapses became 'unsilenced' by
      recruiting AMPA receptors to strengthen excitatory inputs to D1-type neurons,
      whereas morphine-generated silent synapses were likely eliminated to weaken
      excitatory inputs to D2-type neurons. Thus, these cell type-specific, opposing
      mechanisms produced the same net shift of the balance between excitatory inputs
      to D1- and D2-type NAc neurons, which may underlie certain common alterations in 
      NAc-based behaviors induced by both classes of drugs.

TI  - Olfactory receptor for prostaglandin F2alpha mediates male fish courtship
      behavior.
PG  - 897-904
LID - 10.1038/nn.4314 [doi]
AB  - Pheromones play vital roles for survival and reproduction in various organisms.
      In many fishes, prostaglandin F2alpha acts not only as a female reproductive
      hormone, facilitating ovulation and spawning, but also as a sex pheromone
      inducing male reproductive behaviors. Here, we unravel the molecular and neural
      circuit mechanisms underlying the pheromonal action of prostaglandin F2alpha in
      zebrafish. Prostaglandin F2alpha specifically activates two olfactory receptors
      with different sensitivities and expression in distinct populations of ciliated
      olfactory sensory neurons. Pheromone information is then transmitted to two
      ventromedial glomeruli in the olfactory bulb and further to four regions in
      higher olfactory centers. Mutant male zebrafish deficient in the high-affinity
      receptor exhibit loss of attractive response to prostaglandin F2alpha and
      impairment of courtship behaviors toward female fish. These findings demonstrate 
      the functional significance and activation of selective neural circuitry for the 
      sex pheromone prostaglandin F2alpha and its cognate olfactory receptor in fish
      reproductive behavior.

TI  - An epigenetic mechanism mediates developmental nicotine effects on neuronal
      structure and behavior.
PG  - 905-14
LID - 10.1038/nn.4315 [doi]
AB  - Developmental nicotine exposure causes persistent changes in cortical neuron
      morphology and in behavior. We used microarray screening to identify master
      transcriptional or epigenetic regulators mediating these effects of nicotine and 
      discovered increases in Ash2l mRNA, encoding a component of a histone
      methyltransferase complex. We therefore examined genome-wide changes in
      trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys4 (H3K4me3), a mark induced by the Ash2l
      complex associated with increased gene transcription. A large proportion of
      regulated promoter sites were involved in synapse maintenance. We found that
      Mef2c interacts with Ash2l and mediates changes in H3K4me3. Knockdown of Ash2l or
      Mef2c abolished nicotine-mediated alterations of dendritic complexity in vitro
      and in vivo, and attenuated nicotine-dependent changes in passive avoidance
      behavior. In contrast, overexpression mimicked nicotine-mediated alterations of
      neuronal structure and passive avoidance behavior. These studies identify Ash2l
      as a target induced by nicotinic stimulation that couples developmental nicotine 
      exposure to changes in brain epigenetic marks, neuronal structure and behavior.

TI  - Silencing CA3 disrupts temporal coding in the CA1 ensemble.
PG  - 945-51
LID - 10.1038/nn.4311 [doi]
AB  - In addition to the place-cell rate code, hippocampal area CA1 employs a temporal 
      code, both on the single-cell and ensemble level, to accurately represent space. 
      Although there is clear evidence that this precise spike timing is organized by
      theta and gamma oscillations that are present in hippocampus, the circuit
      mechanisms underlying these temporal codes remain poorly understood. We found
      that the loss of CA3 input abolished temporal coding at the ensemble level in CA1
      despite the persistence of both rate and temporal coding in individual neurons.
      Moreover, low gamma oscillations were present in CA1 despite the absence of CA3
      input, but spikes associated with these periods carried significantly reduced
      spatial information. Our findings dissociate temporal coding at the single-cell
      (phase precession) and population (theta sequences) levels and suggest that CA3
      input is crucial for temporal coordination of the CA1 ensemble code for space.

TI  - Hippocampal global remapping for different sensory modalities in flying bats.
PG  - 952-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4310 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal place cells encode the animal's spatial position. However, it is
      unknown how different long-range sensory systems affect spatial representations. 
      Here we alternated usage of vision and echolocation in Egyptian fruit bats while 
      recording from single neurons in hippocampal areas CA1 and subiculum. Bats flew
      back and forth along a linear flight track, employing echolocation in darkness or
      vision in light. Hippocampal representations remapped between vision and
      echolocation via two kinds of remapping: subiculum neurons turned on or off,
      while CA1 neurons shifted their place fields. Interneurons also exhibited strong 
      remapping. Finally, hippocampal place fields were sharper under vision than
      echolocation, matching the superior sensory resolution of vision over
      echolocation. Simulating several theoretical models of place-cells suggested that
      combining sensory information and path integration best explains the experimental
      sharpening data. In summary, here we show sensory-based global remapping in a
      mammal, suggesting that the hippocampus does not contain an abstract spatial map 
      but rather a 'cognitive atlas', with multiple maps for different sensory
      modalities.

TI  - Evaluation of ambiguous associations in the amygdala by learning the structure of
      the environment.
PG  - 965-72
LID - 10.1038/nn.4308 [doi]
AB  - Recognizing predictive relationships is critical for survival, but an
      understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms remains elusive. In particular,
      it is unclear how the brain distinguishes predictive relationships from spurious 
      ones when evidence about a relationship is ambiguous, or how it computes
      predictions given such uncertainty. To better understand this process, we
      introduced ambiguity into an associative learning task by presenting aversive
      outcomes both in the presence and in the absence of a predictive cue.
      Electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches revealed that amygdala neurons
      directly regulated and tracked the effects of ambiguity on learning. Contrary to 
      established accounts of associative learning, however, interference from
      competing associations was not required to assess an ambiguous cue-outcome
      contingency. Instead, animals' behavior was explained by a normative account that
      evaluates different models of the environment's statistical structure. These
      findings suggest an alternative view of amygdala circuits in resolving ambiguity 
      during aversive learning.

TI  - Hedgehog signaling promotes basal progenitor expansion and the growth and folding
      of the neocortex.
PG  - 888-96
LID - 10.1038/nn.4307 [doi]
AB  - The unique mental abilities of humans are rooted in the immensely expanded and
      folded neocortex, which reflects the expansion of neural progenitors, especially 
      basal progenitors including basal radial glia (bRGs) and intermediate progenitor 
      cells (IPCs). We found that constitutively active Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling 
      expanded bRGs and IPCs and induced folding in the otherwise smooth mouse
      neocortex, whereas the loss of Shh signaling decreased the number of bRGs and
      IPCs and the size of the neocortex. SHH signaling was strongly active in the
      human fetal neocortex but Shh signaling was not strongly active in the mouse
      embryonic neocortex, and blocking SHH signaling in human cerebral organoids
      decreased the number of bRGs. Mechanistically, Shh signaling increased the
      initial generation and self-renewal of bRGs and IPC proliferation in mice and the
      initial generation of bRGs in human cerebral organoids. Thus, robust SHH
      signaling in the human fetal neocortex may contribute to bRG and IPC expansion
      and neocortical growth and folding.

TI  - Hippocampo-cortical coupling mediates memory consolidation during sleep.
PG  - 959-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.4304 [doi]
AB  - Memory consolidation is thought to involve a hippocampo-cortical dialog during
      sleep to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, direct
      evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. We dynamically manipulated the
      temporal coordination between the two structures during sleep following training 
      on a spatial memory task specifically designed to trigger encoding, but not
      memory consolidation. Reinforcing the endogenous coordination between hippocampal
      sharp wave-ripples, cortical delta waves and spindles by timed electrical
      stimulation resulted in a reorganization of prefrontal cortical networks, along
      with subsequent increased prefrontal responsivity to the task and high recall
      performance on the next day, contrary to control rats, which performed at chance 
      levels. Our results provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct
      evidence for a causal role of a hippocampo-cortical dialog during sleep in memory
      consolidation, and indicate that the underlying mechanism involves a fine-tuned
      coordination between sharp wave-ripples, delta waves and spindles.

TI  - Spatially segregated feedforward and feedback neurons support differential odor
      processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex.
PG  - 935-44
LID - 10.1038/nn.4303 [doi]
AB  - The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) computes and transfers olfactory information 
      from the olfactory bulb to the hippocampus. Here we established LEC connectivity 
      to upstream and downstream brain regions to understand how the LEC processes
      olfactory information. We report that, in layer II (LII), reelin- and
      calbindin-positive (RE(+) and CB(+)) neurons constitute two major excitatory cell
      types that are electrophysiologically distinct and differentially connected.
      RE(+) neurons convey information to the hippocampus, while CB(+) neurons project 
      to the olfactory cortex and the olfactory bulb. In vivo calcium imaging revealed 
      that RE(+) neurons responded with higher selectivity to specific odors than CB(+)
      neurons and GABAergic neurons. At the population level, odor discrimination was
      significantly better for RE(+) than CB(+) neurons, and was lowest for GABAergic
      neurons. Thus, we identified in LII of the LEC anatomically and functionally
      distinct neuronal subpopulations that engage differentially in feedforward and
      feedback signaling during odor processing.

PG  - 868-75
LID - 10.1038/nn.4306 [doi]
AB  - Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that hyperkinetic disorders
      such as Huntington's disease, dystonia and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in
      Parkinson's disease are all characterized by loss of the ability to reverse
      synaptic plasticity and an associated increase in the excitability of excitatory 
      neuronal inputs to a range of cortical and subcortical brain areas. Moreover,
      these changes have been detected in humans with hyperkinetic disorders either via
      direct recordings from implanted deep brain electrodes or noninvasively using
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we discuss the mechanisms underlying the 
      loss of bidirectional plasticity and the possibility that future interventions
      could be devised to reverse these changes in patients with hyperkinetic movement 
      disorders.

TI  - Neuronal remapping and circuit persistence in economic decisions.
PG  - 855-61
LID - 10.1038/nn.4300 [doi]
AB  - The orbitofrontal cortex plays a central role in good-based economic decisions.
      When subjects make choices, neurons in this region represent the identities and
      values of offered and chosen goods. Notably, choices in different behavioral
      contexts may involve a potentially infinite variety of goods. Thus a fundamental 
      question concerns the stability versus flexibility of the decision circuit. Here 
      we show in rhesus monkeys that neurons encoding the identity or the subjective
      value of particular goods in a given context 'remap' and become associated with
      different goods when the context changes. At the same time, the overall
      organization of the decision circuit and the function of individual cells remain 
      stable across contexts. In particular, two neurons supporting the same decision
      in one context also support the same decision in different contexts. These
      results demonstrate how the same neural circuit can underlie economic decisions
      involving a large variety of goods.

TI  - In vivo imaging of dendritic pruning in dentate granule cells.
PG  - 788-91
LID - 10.1038/nn.4301 [doi]
AB  - We longitudinally imaged the developing dendrites of adult-born mouse dentate
      granule cells (DGCs) in vivo and found that they underwent over-branching and
      pruning. Exposure to an enriched environment and constraint of dendritic growth
      by disrupting Wnt signaling led to increased branch addition and accelerated
      growth, which were, however, counteracted by earlier and more extensive pruning. 
      Our results indicate that pruning is regulated in a homeostatic fashion to oppose
      excessive branching and promote a similar dendrite structure in DGCs.

TI  - Neural pattern similarity reveals the inherent intersection of social categories.
PG  - 795-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4296 [doi]
AB  - We provide evidence that neural representations of ostensibly unrelated social
      categories become bound together by their overlapping stereotype associations.
      While viewing faces, multi-voxel representations of gender, race, and emotion
      categories in the fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices were stereotypically biased
      and correlated with subjective perceptions. The findings suggest that
      social-conceptual knowledge can systematically alter the representational
      structure of social categories at multiple levels of cortical processing,
      reflecting bias in visual perceptions.

TI  - A microRNA switch regulates the rise in hypothalamic GnRH production before
      puberty.
PG  - 835-44
LID - 10.1038/nn.4298 [doi]
AB  - A sparse population of a few hundred primarily hypothalamic neurons forms the hub
      of a complex neuroglial network that controls reproduction in mammals by
      secreting the 'master molecule' gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Timely
      postnatal changes in GnRH expression are essential for puberty and adult
      fertility. Here we report that a multilayered microRNA-operated switch with
      built-in feedback governs increased GnRH expression during the
      infantile-to-juvenile transition and that impairing microRNA synthesis in GnRH
      neurons leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and infertility in mice. Two
      essential components of this switch, miR-200 and miR-155, respectively regulate
      Zeb1, a repressor of Gnrh transcriptional activators and Gnrh itself, and Cebpb, 
      a nitric oxide-mediated repressor of Gnrh that acts both directly and through
      Zeb1, in GnRH neurons. This alteration in the delicate balance between inductive 
      and repressive signals induces the normal GnRH-fuelled run-up to correct puberty 
      initiation, and interfering with this process disrupts the neuroendocrine control
      of reproduction.

TI  - Serotonin modulates spike probability in the axon initial segment through HCN
      channels.
PG  - 826-34
LID - 10.1038/nn.4293 [doi]
AB  - The axon initial segment (AIS) serves as the site of action potential initiation 
      in most neurons, but difficulties in isolating the effects of voltage-gated ion
      channels in the AIS from those of the soma and dendrites have hampered
      understanding how AIS properties influence neural coding. Here we have combined
      confocal microscopy, patch-clamp recordings and light-sensitive channel blockers 
      ('photoswitches') in binaural auditory gerbil neurons to show that
      hyperpolarization and cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are expressed in the
      AIS and decrease spike probability, in a manner distinct from that of HCN
      channels in the soma and dendrites. Furthermore, the control of spike threshold
      by HCN channels in the AIS can be altered through serotonergic modulation of
      5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors, which hyperpolarizes the activation
      range of HCN channels. As release of serotonin signals changes in motivation and 
      attention states, axonal HCN channels provide a mechanism to translate these
      signals into changes in the threshold for sensory stimuli.

AB  - EGFRvIII-STAT3 signaling is important in glioblastoma pathogenesis. Here, we
      identified the cytokine receptor OSMR as a direct target gene of the
      transcription factor STAT3 in mouse astrocytes and human brain tumor stem cells
      (BTSCs). We found that OSMR functioned as an essential co-receptor for EGFRvIII. 
      OSMR formed a physical complex with EGFRvIII, and depletion of OSMR impaired
      EGFRvIII-STAT3 signaling. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of EGFRvIII
      phosphorylation inhibited the EGFRvIII-OSMR interaction and activation of STAT3. 
      EGFRvIII-OSMR signaling in tumors operated constitutively, whereas EGFR-OSMR
      signaling in nontumor cells was synergistically activated by the ligands EGF and 
      OSM. Finally, knockdown of OSMR strongly suppressed cell proliferation and tumor 
      growth of mouse glioblastoma cells and human BTSC xenografts in mice, and
      prolonged the lifespan of these mice. Our findings identify OSMR as a critical
      regulator of glioblastoma tumor growth that orchestrates a feed-forward signaling
      mechanism with EGFRvIII and STAT3 to drive tumorigenesis.

TI  - Reward and choice encoding in terminals of midbrain dopamine neurons depends on
      striatal target.
PG  - 845-54
LID - 10.1038/nn.4287 [doi]
AB  - Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain provide rich topographic innervation of
      the striatum and are central to learning and to generating actions. Despite the
      importance of this DA innervation, it remains unclear whether and how DA neurons 
      are specialized on the basis of the location of their striatal target. Thus, we
      sought to compare the function of subpopulations of DA neurons that target
      distinct striatal subregions in the context of an instrumental reversal learning 
      task. We identified key differences in the encoding of reward and choice in
      dopamine terminals in dorsal versus ventral striatum: DA terminals in ventral
      striatum responded more strongly to reward consumption and reward-predicting
      cues, whereas DA terminals in dorsomedial striatum responded more strongly to
      contralateral choices. In both cases the terminals encoded a reward prediction
      error. Our results suggest that the DA modulation of the striatum is spatially
      organized to support the specialized function of the targeted subregion.

TI  - Sequential regulatory loops as key gatekeepers for neuronal reprogramming in
      human cells.
PG  - 807-15
LID - 10.1038/nn.4297 [doi]
AB  - Direct conversion of somatic cells into neurons holds great promise for
      regenerative medicine. However, neuronal conversion is relatively inefficient in 
      human cells compared to mouse cells. It has been unclear what might be the key
      barriers to reprogramming in human cells. We recently elucidated an RNA program
      mediated by the polypyrimidine tract binding protein PTB to convert mouse
      embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into functional neurons. In human adult fibroblasts 
      (HAFs), however, we unexpectedly found that invoking the documented
      PTB-REST-miR-124 loop generates only immature neurons. We now report that the
      functionality requires sequential inactivation of PTB and the PTB paralog nPTB in
      HAFs. Inactivation of nPTB triggers another self-enforcing loop essential for
      neuronal maturation, which comprises nPTB, the transcription factor BRN2, and
      miR-9. These findings suggest that two separate gatekeepers control neuronal
      conversion and maturation and consecutively overcoming these gatekeepers enables 
      deterministic reprogramming of HAFs into functional neurons.

AB  - Hippocampal replay has been hypothesized to underlie memory consolidation and
      navigational planning, yet the involvement of grid cells in replay is unknown.
      During replay we found grid cells to be spatially coherent with place cells,
      encoding locations 11 ms delayed relative to the hippocampus, with directionally 
      modulated grid cells and forward replay exhibiting the greatest coherence with
      the CA1 area of the hippocampus. This suggests grid cells are engaged during the 
      consolidation of spatial memories to the neocortex.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) at high spinal levels (e.g., above thoracic level 5)
      causes systemic immune suppression; however, the underlying mechanisms are
      unknown. Here we show that profound plasticity develops within spinal autonomic
      circuitry below the injury, creating a sympathetic anti-inflammatory reflex, and 
      that chemogenetic silencing of this reflex circuitry blocks post-SCI immune
      suppression. These data provide new insights and potential therapeutic options
      for limiting the devastating consequences of post-traumatic autonomic
      hyperreflexia and post-injury immune suppression.

      all neurons (>1,000) in the olfactory bulb of a zebrafish larva with high
      accuracy and annotated all synapses on subsets of neurons representing different 
      types. The organization of the larval olfactory bulb showed marked differences
      from that of the adult but similarities to that of the insect antennal lobe.
      Interneurons comprised multiple types but granule cells were rare.
      Interglomerular projections of interneurons were complex and bidirectional.
      Projections were not random but biased toward glomerular groups receiving input
      from common types of sensory neurons. Hence, the interneuron network in the
      olfactory bulb exhibits a specific topological organization that is governed by
      glomerular identity.

TI  - Pericytes of the neurovascular unit: key functions and signaling pathways.
PG  - 771-83
LID - 10.1038/nn.4288 [doi]
AB  - Pericytes are vascular mural cells embedded in the basement membrane of blood
      microvessels. They extend their processes along capillaries, pre-capillary
      arterioles and post-capillary venules. CNS pericytes are uniquely positioned in
      the neurovascular unit between endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. They
      integrate, coordinate and process signals from their neighboring cells to
      generate diverse functional responses that are critical for CNS functions in
      health and disease, including regulation of the blood-brain barrier permeability,
      angiogenesis, clearance of toxic metabolites, capillary hemodynamic responses,
      neuroinflammation and stem cell activity. Here we examine the key signaling
      pathways between pericytes and their neighboring endothelial cells, astrocytes
      and neurons that control neurovascular functions. We also review the role of
      pericytes in CNS disorders including rare monogenic diseases and complex
      neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and brain tumors. Finally, we 
      discuss directions for future studies.

PG  - 749-755
LID - 10.1038/nn.4286 [doi]
AB  - Cortical networks are thought to be shaped by experience-dependent synaptic
      plasticity. Theoretical studies have shown that synaptic plasticity allows a
      network to store a memory of patterns of activity such that they become
      attractors of the dynamics of the network. Here we study the properties of the
      excitatory synaptic connectivity in a network that maximizes the number of stored
      patterns of activity in a robust fashion. We show that the resulting synaptic
      connectivity matrix has the following properties: it is sparse, with a large
      fraction of zero synaptic weights ('potential' synapses); bidirectionally coupled
      pairs of neurons are over-represented in comparison to a random network; and
      bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on average than
      unidirectionally connected pairs. All these features reproduce quantitatively
      available data on connectivity in cortex. This suggests synaptic connectivity in 
      cortex is optimized to store a large number of attractor states in a robust
      fashion.

TI  - Ryk controls remapping of motor cortex during functional recovery after spinal
      cord injury.
PG  - 697-705
LID - 10.1038/nn.4282 [doi]
AB  - Limited functional recovery can be achieved through rehabilitation after
      incomplete spinal cord injury. Eliminating the function of a repulsive Wnt
      receptor, Ryk, in mice and rats by either conditional knockout in the motor
      cortex or monoclonal antibody infusion resulted in increased corticospinal axon
      collateral branches with presynaptic puncta in the spinal cord and enhanced
      recovery of forelimb reaching and grasping function following a cervical dorsal
      column lesion. Using optical stimulation, we observed that motor cortical output 
      maps underwent massive changes after injury and that hindlimb cortical areas were
      recruited to control the forelimb over time. Furthermore, a greater cortical area
      was dedicated to controlling the forelimb in Ryk conditional knockout mice than
      in controls (wild-type or heterozygotes). In the absence of weekly task-specific 
      training, recruitment of ectopic cortical areas was greatly reduced and there was
      no significant functional recovery even in Ryk conditional knockout mice. Our
      study provides evidence that maximal circuit reorganization and functional
      recovery can be achieved by combining molecular manipulation and targeted
      rehabilitation.

AB  - Models of predictive coding frame perception as a generative process in which
      expectations constrain sensory representations. These models account for
      expectations about how a stimulus will move or change from moment to moment, but 
      do not address expectations about what other, distinct stimuli are likely to
      appear based on prior experience. We show that such memory-based expectations in 
      human visual cortex are related to the hippocampal mechanism of pattern
      completion.

TI  - A GABAergic nigrotectal pathway for coordination of drinking behavior.
PG  - 742-748
LID - 10.1038/nn.4285 [doi]
AB  - The contribution of basal ganglia outputs to consummatory behavior remains poorly
      understood. We recorded from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), the
      major basal ganglia output nucleus, during self-initiated drinking in mice. The
      firing rates of many lateral SNR neurons were time-locked to individual licks.
      These neurons send GABAergic projections to the deep layers of the orofacial
      region of the lateral tectum (superior colliculus, SC). Many tectal neurons were 
      also time-locked to licking, but their activity was usually in antiphase with
      that of SNR neurons, suggesting inhibitory nigrotectal projections. We used
      optogenetics to selectively activate the GABAergic nigrotectal afferents in the
      deep layers of the SC. Photo-stimulation of the nigrotectal projections
      transiently inhibited the activity of the lick-related tectal neurons, disrupted 
      their licking-related oscillatory pattern and suppressed self-initiated drinking.
      These results demonstrate that GABAergic nigrotectal projections have a crucial
      role in coordinating drinking behavior.

TI  - Agouti-related peptide neural circuits mediate adaptive behaviors in the starved 
      state.
PG  - 734-741
LID - 10.1038/nn.4274 [doi]
AB  - In the face of starvation, animals will engage in high-risk behaviors that would 
      normally be considered maladaptive. Starving rodents, for example, will forage in
      areas that are more susceptible to predators and will also modulate aggressive
      behavior within a territory of limited or depleted nutrients. The neural basis of
      these adaptive behaviors likely involves circuits that link innate feeding,
      aggression and fear. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing
      neurons are critically important for driving feeding and project axons to brain
      regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in
      mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons
      that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed 
      nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and
      reduces contextual fear. We propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch
      capable of coordinating behavioral decisions relative to internal state and
      environmental cues.

TI  - VTA glutamatergic inputs to nucleus accumbens drive aversion by acting on
      GABAergic interneurons.
PG  - 725-733
LID - 10.1038/nn.4281 [doi]
AB  - The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is best known for its dopamine neurons, some of 
      which project to nucleus accumbens (nAcc). However, the VTA also has
      glutamatergic neurons that project to nAcc. The function of the mesoaccumbens
      glutamatergic pathway remains unknown. Here we report that nAcc photoactivation
      of mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers promotes aversion. Although we found that
      these mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers lack GABA, the aversion evoked by their 
      photoactivation depended on glutamate- and GABA-receptor signaling, and not on
      dopamine-receptor signaling. We found that mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers
      established multiple asymmetric synapses on single parvalbumin GABAergic
      interneurons and that nAcc photoactivation of these fibers drove AMPA-mediated
      cellular firing of parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons. These parvalbumin
      GABAergic interneurons in turn inhibited nAcc medium spiny output neurons,
      thereby controlling inhibitory neurotransmission in nAcc. To our knowledge, the
      mesoaccumbens glutamatergic pathway is the first glutamatergic input to nAcc
      shown to mediate aversion instead of reward, and the first pathway shown to
      establish excitatory synapses on nAcc parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons.

      viability.
PG  - 690-696
LID - 10.1038/nn.4280 [doi]
AB  - To achieve accurate spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression, RNA-binding
      proteins (RBPs) guide nuclear processing, intracellular trafficking and local
      translation of target mRNAs. In neurons, RBPs direct transport of target mRNAs to
      sites of translation in remote axons and dendrites. However, it is not known
      whether an individual RBP coordinately regulates multiple mRNAs within these
      morphologically complex cells. Here we identify SFPQ (splicing factor,
      poly-glutamine rich) as an RBP that binds and regulates multiple mRNAs in dorsal 
      root ganglion sensory neurons and thereby promotes neurotrophin-dependent axonal 
      viability. SFPQ acts in nuclei, cytoplasm and axons to regulate functionally
      related mRNAs essential for axon survival. Notably, SFPQ is required for
      coassembly of LaminB2 (Lmnb2) and Bclw (Bcl2l2) mRNAs in RNA granules and for
      axonal trafficking of these mRNAs. Together these data demonstrate that SFPQ
      orchestrates spatial gene expression of a newly identified RNA regulon essential 
      for axonal viability.

AB  - Neuronal inclusions of poly(GA), a protein unconventionally translated from G4C2 
      repeat expansions in C9ORF72, are abundant in patients with frontotemporal
      dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by this mutation.
      To investigate poly(GA) toxicity, we generated mice that exhibit poly(GA)
      pathology, neurodegeneration and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of FTD and 
      ALS. These phenotypes occurred in the absence of TDP-43 pathology and required
      poly(GA) aggregation. HR23 proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and
      proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were sequestered by poly(GA) in 
      these mice. HR23A and HR23B similarly colocalized to poly(GA) inclusions in
      C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Sequestration was accompanied by an accumulation of
      ubiquitinated proteins and decreased xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) levels in
      mice, indicative of HR23A and HR23B dysfunction. Restoring HR23B levels
      attenuated poly(GA) aggregation and rescued poly(GA)-induced toxicity in neuronal
      cultures. These data demonstrate that sequestration and impairment of nuclear
      HR23 and nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins is an outcome of, and a contributor
      to, poly(GA) pathology.

AB  - Optogenetic and chemogenetic actuators are critical for deconstructing the neural
      correlates of behavior. However, these tools have several limitations, including 
      invasive modes of stimulation or slow on/off kinetics. We have overcome these
      disadvantages by synthesizing a single-component, magnetically sensitive
      actuator, "Magneto," comprising the cation channel TRPV4 fused to the
      paramagnetic protein ferritin. We validated noninvasive magnetic control over
      neuronal activity by demonstrating remote stimulation of cells using in vitro
      calcium imaging assays, electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, in vivo 
      electrophysiological recordings in the brains of freely moving mice, and
      behavioral outputs in zebrafish and mice. As proof of concept, we used Magneto to
      delineate a causal role of striatal dopamine receptor 1 neurons in mediating
      reward behavior in mice. Together our results present Magneto as an actuator
      capable of remotely controlling circuits associated with complex animal
      behaviors.

TI  - Chd7 cooperates with Sox10 and regulates the onset of CNS myelination and
      remyelination.
PG  - 678-689
LID - 10.1038/nn.4258 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in CHD7, encoding ATP-dependent chromodomain helicase DNA-binding
      protein 7, in CHARGE syndrome lead to multiple congenital anomalies, including
      craniofacial malformations, neurological dysfunction and growth delay. Mechanisms
      underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. We found that Chd7 is a
      direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and
      Smarca4/Brg1 and is required for proper onset of CNS myelination and
      remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses in mice, coupled with transcriptome
      profiling, revealed that Chd7 interacted with Sox10 and targeted the enhancers of
      key myelinogenic genes. These analyses identified previously unknown Chd7
      targets, including bone formation regulators Osterix (also known as Sp7) and
      Creb3l2, which are also critical for oligodendrocyte maturation. Thus, Chd7
      coordinates with Sox10 to regulate the initiation of myelinogenesis and acts as a
      molecular nexus of regulatory networks that account for the development of a
      seemingly diverse array of lineages, including oligodendrocytes and osteoblasts, 
      pointing to previously uncharacterized Chd7 functions in white matter
      pathogenesis in CHARGE syndrome.

TI  - Early hyperactivity and precocious maturation of corticostriatal circuits in
      Shank3B(-/-) mice.

AB  - Some autistic individuals exhibit abnormal development of the caudate nucleus and
      associative cortical areas, suggesting potential dysfunction of cortico-basal
      ganglia (BG) circuits. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches in
      mice, we identified a narrow postnatal period that is characterized by extensive 
      glutamatergic synaptogenesis in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and a
      concomitant increase in corticostriatal circuit activity. SPNs during early
      development have high intrinsic excitability and respond strongly to cortical
      afferents despite sparse excitatory inputs. As a result, striatum and
      corticostriatal connectivity are highly sensitive to acute and chronic changes in
      cortical activity, suggesting that early imbalances in cortical function alter BG
      development. Indeed, a mouse model of autism with deletions in Shank3
      (Shank3B(-/-)) shows early cortical hyperactivity, which triggers increased SPN
      excitatory synapse and corticostriatal hyperconnectivity. These results indicate 
      that there is a tight functional coupling between cortex and striatum during
      early postnatal development and suggest a potential common circuit dysfunction
      that is caused by cortical hyperactivity.

TI  - Asymmetry of Drosophila ON and OFF motion detectors enhances real-world velocity 
      estimation.
PG  - 706-715
LID - 10.1038/nn.4262 [doi]
AB  - The reliable estimation of motion across varied surroundings represents a
      survival-critical task for sighted animals. How neural circuits have adapted to
      the particular demands of natural environments, however, is not well understood. 
      We explored this question in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, 
      as in many mammalian retinas, motion is computed in parallel streams for
      brightness increments (ON) and decrements (OFF). When genetically isolated, ON
      and OFF pathways proved equally capable of accurately matching walking responses 
      to realistic motion. To our surprise, detailed characterization of their
      functional tuning properties through in vivo calcium imaging and
      electrophysiology revealed stark differences in temporal tuning between ON and
      OFF channels. We trained an in silico motion estimation model on natural scenes
      and discovered that our optimized detector exhibited differences similar to those
      of the biological system. Thus, functional ON-OFF asymmetries in fly visual
      circuitry may reflect ON-OFF asymmetries in natural environments.

TI  - Neurobiology of social behavior abnormalities in autism and Williams syndrome.
PG  - 647-655
LID - 10.1038/nn.4276 [doi]
AB  - Social behavior is a basic behavior mediated by multiple brain regions and neural
      circuits, and is crucial for the survival and development of animals and humans. 
      Two neuropsychiatric disorders that have prominent social behavior abnormalities 
      are autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which is characterized mainly by
      hyposociability, and Williams syndrome (WS), whose subjects exhibit
      hypersociability. Here we review the unique properties of social behavior in ASD 
      and WS, and discuss the major theories in social behavior in the context of these
      disorders. We conclude with a discussion of the research questions needing
      further exploration to enhance our understanding of social behavior
      abnormalities.

TI  - Going and stopping: Dichotomies in behavioral control by the prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 656-664
LID - 10.1038/nn.4275 [doi]
AB  - The rodent dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), specifically the prelimbic
      cortex (PL), regulates the expression of conditioned fear and behaviors
      interpreted as reward-seeking. Meanwhile, the ventral medial PFC, namely the
      infralimbic cortex (IL), is essential to extinction conditioning in both
      appetitive and aversive domains. Here we review evidence that supports, or
      refutes, this "PL-go/IL-stop" dichotomy. We focus on the extinction of
      conditioned fear and the extinction and reinstatement of cocaine- or
      heroin-reinforced responding. We then synthesize evidence that the PL is
      essential for developing goal-directed response strategies, while the IL supports
      habit behavior. Finally, we propose that some functions of the orbital PFC
      parallel those of the medial PFC in the regulation of response selection.
      Integration of these discoveries may provide points of intervention for
      inhibiting untethered drug seeking in drug use disorders, failures in extinction 
      in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, or co-morbidities between the two.

TI  - Modeling ALS with motor neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem
      cells.
PG  - 542-53
LID - 10.1038/nn.4273 [doi]
AB  - Directing the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into motor
      neurons has allowed investigators to develop new models of amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). However, techniques vary between laboratories and the cells do
      not appear to mature into fully functional adult motor neurons. Here we discuss
      common developmental principles of both lower and upper motor neuron development 
      that have led to specific derivation techniques. We then suggest how these motor 
      neurons may be matured further either through direct expression or administration
      of specific factors or coculture approaches with other tissues. Ultimately,
      through a greater understanding of motor neuron biology, it will be possible to
      establish more reliable models of ALS. These in turn will have a greater chance
      of validating new drugs that may be effective for the disease.

TI  - Thalamus plays a central role in ongoing cortical functioning.
PG  - 533-41
LID - 10.1038/nn.4269 [doi]
AB  - Several challenges to current views of thalamocortical processing are offered
      here. Glutamatergic pathways in thalamus and cortex are divided into two distinct
      classes: driver and modulator. We suggest that driver inputs are the main
      conduits of information and that modulator inputs modify how driver inputs are
      processed. Different driver sources reveal two types of thalamic relays: first
      order relays receive subcortical driver input (for example, retinal input to the 
      lateral geniculate nucleus), whereas higher order relays (for example, pulvinar) 
      receive driver input from layer 5 of cortex and participate in
      cortico-thalamo-cortical (or transthalamic) circuits. These transthalamic
      circuits represent an unappreciated aspect of cortical functioning, which I
      discuss here. Direct corticocortical connections are often paralleled by
      transthalamic ones. Furthermore, driver inputs to thalamus, both first and higher
      order, typically arrive via branching axons, and the transthalamic branch often
      innervates subcortical motor centers, leading to the suggestion that these inputs
      to thalamus serve as efference copies.

TI  - Spike sorting for large, dense electrode arrays.
PG  - 634-641
LID - 10.1038/nn.4268 [doi]
AB  - Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of neural
      electrode arrays with hundreds of closely spaced recording sites, and electrodes 
      with thousands of sites are under development. These probes in principle allow
      the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons. However, use of this
      technology requires the development of techniques for decoding the spike times of
      the recorded neurons from the raw data captured from the probes. Here we present 
      a set of tools to solve this problem, implemented in a suite of practical,
      user-friendly, open-source software. We validate these methods on data from the
      cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of rat, mouse, macaque and marmoset,
      demonstrating error rates as low as 5%.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4267 [doi]
AB  - By analyzing the whole-exome sequences of 4,264 schizophrenia cases, 9,343
      controls and 1,077 trios, we identified a genome-wide significant association
      between rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SETD1A and risk for schizophrenia
      (P = 3.3 x 10(-9)). We found only two heterozygous LoF variants in 45,376 exomes 
      from individuals without a neuropsychiatric diagnosis, indicating that SETD1A is 
      substantially depleted of LoF variants in the general population. Seven of the
      ten individuals with schizophrenia carrying SETD1A LoF variants also had learning
      difficulties. We further identified four SETD1A LoF carriers among 4,281 children
      with severe developmental disorders and two more carriers in an independent
      sample of 5,720 Finnish exomes, both with notable neuropsychiatric phenotypes.
      Together, our observations indicate that LoF variants in SETD1A cause a range of 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. Combining these data with 
      previous common variant evidence, we suggest that epigenetic dysregulation,
      specifically in the histone H3K4 methylation pathway, is an important mechanism
      in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

AB  - In many vertebrate species, certain individuals will seek out opportunities for
      aggression, even in the absence of threat-provoking cues. Although several brain 
      areas have been implicated in the generation of attack in response to social
      threat, little is known about the neural mechanisms that promote self-initiated
      or 'voluntary' aggression-seeking when no threat is present. To explore this
      directly, we utilized an aggression-seeking task in which male mice
      self-initiated aggression trials to gain brief and repeated access to a weaker
      male that they could attack. In males that exhibited rapid task learning, we
      found that the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl), an
      area with a known role in attack, was essential for aggression-seeking. Using
      both single-unit electrophysiology and population optical recording, we found
      that VMHvl neurons became active during aggression-seeking and that their
      activity tracked changes in task learning and extinction. Inactivation of the
      VMHvl reduced aggression-seeking behavior, whereas optogenetic stimulation of the
      VMHvl accelerated moment-to-moment aggression-seeking and intensified future
      attack. These data demonstrate that the VMHvl can mediate both acute attack and
      flexible seeking actions that precede attack.

AB  - We investigated the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition at presynaptic terminals
      using halorhodopsin, archaerhodopsin and chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins.
      Precisely timed activation of both archaerhodopsin and halorhodpsin at
      presynaptic terminals attenuated evoked release. However, sustained
      archaerhodopsin activation was paradoxically associated with increased
      spontaneous release. Activation of chloride-conducting channelrhodopsins
      triggered neurotransmitter release upon light onset. Thus, the biophysical
      properties of presynaptic terminals dictate unique boundary conditions for
      optogenetic manipulation.

TI  - Circadian rhythms in neuronal activity propagate through output circuits.
PG  - 587-95
LID - 10.1038/nn.4263 [doi]
AB  - Twenty-four hour rhythms in behavior are organized by a network of circadian
      pacemaker neurons. Rhythmic activity in this network is generated by intrinsic
      rhythms in clock neuron physiology and communication between clock neurons.
      However, it is poorly understood how the activity of a small number of pacemaker 
      neurons is translated into rhythmic behavior of the whole animal. To understand
      this, we screened for signals that could identify circadian output circuits in
      Drosophila melanogaster. We found that leucokinin neuropeptide (LK) and its
      receptor (LK-R) were required for normal behavioral rhythms. This LK/LK-R circuit
      connects pacemaker neurons to brain areas that regulate locomotor activity and
      sleep. Our experiments revealed that pacemaker neurons impose rhythmic activity
      and excitability on LK- and LK-R-expressing neurons. We also found pacemaker
      neuron-dependent activity rhythms in a second circadian output pathway controlled
      by DH44 neuropeptide-expressing neurons. We conclude that rhythmic clock neuron
      activity propagates to multiple downstream circuits to orchestrate behavioral
      rhythms.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are
      overlapping neurodegenerative disorders whose pathogenesis remains largely
      unknown. Using TDP-43(A315T) mice, an ALS and FTD model with marked cortical
      pathology, we found that hyperactive somatostatin interneurons disinhibited layer
      5 pyramidal neurons (L5-PNs) and contributed to their excitotoxicity. Focal
      ablation of somatostatin interneurons efficiently restored normal excitability of
      L5-PNs and alleviated neurodegeneration, suggesting a new therapeutic target for 
      ALS and FTD.

TI  - Explicit information for category-orthogonal object properties increases along
      the ventral stream.
PG  - 613-22
LID - 10.1038/nn.4247 [doi]
AB  - Extensive research has revealed that the ventral visual stream hierarchically
      builds a robust representation for supporting visual object categorization tasks.
      We systematically explored the ability of multiple ventral visual areas to
      support a variety of 'category-orthogonal' object properties such as position,
      size and pose. For complex naturalistic stimuli, we found that the inferior
      temporal (IT) population encodes all measured category-orthogonal object
      properties, including those properties often considered to be low-level features 
      (for example, position), more explicitly than earlier ventral stream areas. We
      also found that the IT population better predicts human performance patterns
      across properties. A hierarchical neural network model based on simple
      computational principles generates these same cross-area patterns of information.
      Taken together, our empirical results support the hypothesis that all
      behaviorally relevant object properties are extracted in concert up the ventral
      visual hierarchy, and our computational model explains how that hierarchy might
      be built.

TI  - Fluorescent false neurotransmitter reveals functionally silent dopamine vesicle
      clusters in the striatum.
PG  - 578-86
LID - 10.1038/nn.4252 [doi]
AB  - Neurotransmission at dopaminergic synapses has been studied with techniques that 
      provide high temporal resolution, but cannot resolve individual synapses. To
      elucidate the spatial dynamics and heterogeneity of individual dopamine boutons, 
      we developed fluorescent false neurotransmitter 200 (FFN200), a vesicular
      monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) substrate that selectively traces monoamine
      exocytosis in both neuronal cell culture and brain tissue. By monitoring
      electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients with GCaMP3 and FFN200 release
      simultaneously, we found that only a small fraction of dopamine boutons that
      exhibited Ca(2+) influx engaged in exocytosis, a result confirmed with
      activity-dependent loading of the endocytic probe FM1-43. Thus, only a low
      fraction of striatal dopamine axonal sites with uptake-competent VMAT2 vesicles
      are capable of transmitter release. This is consistent with the presence of
      functionally 'silent' dopamine vesicle clusters and represents, to the best of
      our knowledge, the first report suggestive of presynaptically silent
      neuromodulatory synapses.

TI  - Recoding a cocaine-place memory engram to a neutral engram in the hippocampus.
PG  - 564-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4250 [doi]
AB  - The hippocampus provides the brain's memory system with a subset of neurons
      holding a map-like representation of each environment experienced. We found in
      mice that optogenetic silencing those neurons active in an environment unmasked a
      subset of quiet neurons, enabling the emergence of an alternative map. When
      applied in a cocaine-paired environment, this intervention neutralized an
      otherwise long-lasting drug-place preference, showing that recoding a spatial
      memory engram can alleviate associated maladaptive behavior.

      networks in mice.
PG  - 623-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4256 [doi]
AB  - To gain insight into how mutant huntingtin (mHtt) CAG repeat length modifies
      Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis, we profiled mRNA in over 600 brain and
      peripheral tissue samples from HD knock-in mice with increasing CAG repeat
      lengths. We found repeat length-dependent transcriptional signatures to be
      prominent in the striatum, less so in cortex, and minimal in the liver.
      Coexpression network analyses revealed 13 striatal and 5 cortical modules that
      correlated highly with CAG length and age, and that were preserved in HD models
      and sometimes in patients. Top striatal modules implicated mHtt CAG length and
      age in graded impairment in the expression of identity genes for striatal medium 
      spiny neurons and in dysregulation of cyclic AMP signaling, cell death and
      protocadherin genes. We used proteomics to confirm 790 genes and 5 striatal
      modules with CAG length-dependent dysregulation at the protein level, and
      validated 22 striatal module genes as modifiers of mHtt toxicities in vivo.

TI  - 4-Hz oscillations synchronize prefrontal-amygdala circuits during fear behavior.
PG  - 605-12
LID - 10.1038/nn.4251 [doi]
AB  - Fear expression relies on the coordinated activity of prefrontal and amygdala
      circuits, yet the mechanisms allowing long-range network synchronization during
      fear remain unknown. Using a combination of extracellular recordings,
      pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, we found that freezing, a
      behavioral expression of fear, temporally coincided with the development of
      sustained, internally generated 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal-amygdala
      circuits. 4-Hz oscillations predict freezing onset and offset and synchronize
      prefrontal-amygdala circuits. Optogenetic induction of prefrontal 4-Hz
      oscillations coordinates prefrontal-amygdala activity and elicits fear behavior. 
      These results unravel a sustained oscillatory mechanism mediating
      prefrontal-amygdala coupling during fear behavior.

TI  - Resilience to chronic stress is mediated by noradrenergic regulation of dopamine 
      neurons.
PG  - 560-3
LID - 10.1038/nn.4245 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) help mediate stress
      susceptibility and resilience. However, upstream mechanisms controlling these
      neurons remain unknown. Noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus,
      implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, have direct connections within
      the VTA. Here we demonstrate that NE neurons regulate vulnerability to social
      defeat through inhibitory control of VTA DA neurons.

TI  - An excitatory basis for divisive normalization in visual cortex.
PG  - 568-70
LID - 10.1038/nn.4249 [doi]
AB  - Neurons in visual cortex are connected not only locally, but also through
      networks of distal connectivity. These distal networks recruit both excitatory
      and inhibitory synapses and result in divisive normalization. Normalization is
      traditionally thought to result from increases in synaptic inhibition. By
      combining optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings in mouse visual
      cortex, we found that, on the contrary, normalization is a result of a decrease
      in synaptic excitation.

TI  - Computational psychiatry as a bridge from neuroscience to clinical applications.
PG  - 404-13
LID - 10.1038/nn.4238 [doi]
AB  - Translating advances in neuroscience into benefits for patients with mental
      illness presents enormous challenges because it involves both the most complex
      organ, the brain, and its interaction with a similarly complex environment.
      Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational
      psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types 
      of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental
      illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary
      approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply
      machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of
      disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These
      approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven 
      approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or
      explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of
      analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches, with an
      emphasis on clinical applications, and highlight the utility of combining them.

AB  - The ability to store and later use information is essential for a variety of
      adaptive behaviors, including integration, learning, generalization, prediction
      and inference. In this Review, we survey theoretical principles that can allow
      the brain to construct persistent states for memory. We identify requirements
      that a memory system must satisfy and analyze existing models and hypothesized
      biological substrates in light of these requirements. We also highlight open
      questions, theoretical puzzles and problems shared with computer science and
      information theory.

TI  - The mechanics of state-dependent neural correlations.
PG  - 383-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4242 [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous recordings from large neural populations are becoming increasingly
      common. An important feature of population activity is the trial-to-trial
      correlated fluctuation of spike train outputs from recorded neuron pairs. Similar
      to the firing rate of single neurons, correlated activity can be modulated by a
      number of factors, from changes in arousal and attentional state to learning and 
      task engagement. However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these
      changes are not fully understood. We review recent theoretical results that
      identify three separate mechanisms that modulate spike train correlations:
      changes in input correlations, internal fluctuations and the transfer function of
      single neurons. We first examine these mechanisms in feedforward pathways and
      then show how the same approach can explain the modulation of correlations in
      recurrent networks. Such mechanistic constraints on the modulation of population 
      activity will be important in statistical analyses of high-dimensional neural
      data.

PG  - 375-82

AB  - Recent years have seen a growing interest in inhibitory interneurons and their
      circuits. A striking property of cortical inhibition is how tightly it balances
      excitation. Inhibitory currents not only match excitatory currents on average,
      but track them on a millisecond time scale, whether they are caused by external
      stimuli or spontaneous fluctuations. We review, together with experimental
      evidence, recent theoretical approaches that investigate the advantages of such
      tight balance for coding and computation. These studies suggest a possible
      revision of the dominant view that neurons represent information with firing
      rates corrupted by Poisson noise. Instead, tight excitatory/inhibitory balance
      may be a signature of a highly cooperative code, orders of magnitude more precise
      than a Poisson rate code. Moreover, tight balance may provide a template that
      allows cortical neurons to construct high-dimensional population codes and learn 
      complex functions of their inputs.

TI  - Confidence and certainty: distinct probabilistic quantities for different goals.
PG  - 366-74
LID - 10.1038/nn.4240 [doi]
AB  - When facing uncertainty, adaptive behavioral strategies demand that the brain
      performs probabilistic computations. In this probabilistic framework, the notion 
      of certainty and confidence would appear to be closely related, so much so that
      it is tempting to conclude that these two concepts are one and the same. We argue
      that there are computational reasons to distinguish between these two concepts.
      Specifically, we propose that confidence should be defined as the probability
      that a decision or a proposition, overt or covert, is correct given the evidence,
      a critical quantity in complex sequential decisions. We suggest that the term
      certainty should be reserved to refer to the encoding of all other probability
      distributions over sensory and cognitive variables. We also discuss strategies
      for studying the neural codes for confidence and certainty and argue that clear
      definitions of neural codes are essential to understanding the relative
      contributions of various cortical areas to decision making.

AB  - Fueled by innovation in the computer vision and artificial intelligence
      communities, recent developments in computational neuroscience have used
      goal-driven hierarchical convolutional neural networks (HCNNs) to make strides in
      modeling neural single-unit and population responses in higher visual cortical
      areas. In this Perspective, we review the recent progress in a broader modeling
      context and describe some of the key technical innovations that have supported
      it. We then outline how the goal-driven HCNN approach can be used to delve even
      more deeply into understanding the development and organization of sensory
      cortical processing.

TI  - Genetic influences on schizophrenia and subcortical brain volumes: large-scale
      proof of concept.
PG  - 420-431
LID - 10.1038/nn.4228 [doi]
AB  - Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric illness with high heritability. Brain 
      structure and function differ, on average, between people with schizophrenia and 
      healthy individuals. As common genetic associations are emerging for both
      schizophrenia and brain imaging phenotypes, we can now use genome-wide data to
      investigate genetic overlap. Here we integrated results from common variant
      studies of schizophrenia (33,636 cases, 43,008 controls) and volumes of several
      (mainly subcortical) brain structures (11,840 subjects). We did not find evidence
      of genetic overlap between schizophrenia risk and subcortical volume measures
      either at the level of common variant genetic architecture or for single genetic 
      markers. These results provide a proof of concept (albeit based on a limited set 
      of structural brain measures) and define a roadmap for future studies
      investigating the genetic covariance between structural or functional brain
      phenotypes and risk for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Overactivation of neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) causes
      excitotoxicity and is necessary for neuronal death. In the classical view, these 
      ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable ionotropic receptors require co-agonists and
      membrane depolarization for activation. We report that NMDARs signal during
      ligand binding without activation of their ion conduction pore. Pharmacological
      pore block with MK-801, physiological pore block with Mg(2+) or a
      Ca(2+)-impermeable NMDAR variant prevented NMDAR currents, but did not block
      excitotoxic dendritic blebbing and secondary currents induced by exogenous NMDA. 
      NMDARs, Src kinase and Panx1 form a signaling complex, and activation of Panx1
      required phosphorylation at Y308. Disruption of this NMDAR-Src-Panx1 signaling
      complex in vitro or in vivo by administration of an interfering peptide either
      before or 2 h after ischemia or stroke was neuroprotective. Our observations
      provide insights into a new signaling modality of NMDARs that has broad-reaching 
      implications for brain physiology and pathology.

TI  - Dopamine neurons share common response function for reward prediction error.
PG  - 479-86
LID - 10.1038/nn.4239 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction error, or the difference
      between actual and predicted reward. How dopamine neurons jointly encode this
      information, however, remains unclear. One possibility is that different neurons 
      specialize in different aspects of prediction error; another is that each neuron 
      calculates prediction error in the same way. We recorded from optogenetically
      identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area (VTA) while
      mice performed classical conditioning tasks. Our tasks allowed us to determine
      the full prediction error functions of dopamine neurons and compare them to each 
      other. We found marked homogeneity among individual dopamine neurons: their
      responses to both unexpected and expected rewards followed the same function,
      just scaled up or down. As a result, we were able to describe both individual and
      population responses using just two parameters. Such uniformity ensures robust
      information coding, allowing each dopamine neuron to contribute fully to the
      prediction error signal.

PG  - 517-22
LID - 10.1038/nn.4235 [doi]
AB  - Recurrent, reciprocal genomic disorders resulting from non-allelic homologous
      recombination (NAHR) between near-identical segmental duplications (SDs) are a
      major cause of human disease, often producing phenotypically distinct syndromes. 
      The genomic architecture of flanking SDs presents a challenge for modeling these 
      syndromes; however, the capability to efficiently generate reciprocal copy number
      variants (CNVs) that mimic NAHR would represent a valuable modeling tool. We
      describe here a CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering method, single-guide CRISPR/Cas
      targeting of repetitive elements (SCORE), to model reciprocal genomic disorders
      and demonstrate its capabilities by generating reciprocal CNVs of 16p11.2 and
      15q13.3, including alteration of one copy-equivalent of the SDs that mediate NAHR
      in vivo. The method is reproducible, and RNA sequencing reliably clusters
      transcriptional signatures from human subjects with in vivo CNVs and their
      corresponding in vitro models. This new approach will provide broad applicability
      for the study of genomic disorders and, with further development, may also permit
      efficient correction of these defects.

TI  - PV plasticity sustained through D1/5 dopamine signaling required for long-term
      memory consolidation.
PG  - 454-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.4231 [doi]
AB  - Long-term consolidation of memories depends on processes occurring many hours
      after acquisition. Whether this involves plasticity that is specifically required
      for long-term consolidation remains unclear. We found that learning-induced
      plasticity of local parvalbumin (PV) basket cells was specifically required for
      long-term, but not short/intermediate-term, memory consolidation in mice. PV
      plasticity, which involves changes in PV and GAD67 expression and connectivity
      onto PV neurons, was regulated by cAMP signaling in PV neurons. Following
      induction, PV plasticity depended on local D1/5 dopamine receptor signaling at
      0-5 h to regulate its magnitude, and at 12-14 h for its continuance, ensuring
      memory consolidation. D1/5 dopamine receptor activation selectively induced
      DARPP-32 and ERK phosphorylation in PV neurons. At 12-14 h, PV plasticity was
      required for enhanced sharp-wave ripple densities and c-Fos expression in
      pyramidal neurons. Our results reveal general network mechanisms of long-term
      memory consolidation that requires plasticity of PV basket cells induced after
      acquisition and sustained subsequently through D1/5 receptor signaling.

PG  - 494-503

AB  - Although genome sequencing has identified numerous noncoding alterations between 
      primate species, which of those are regulatory and potentially relevant to the
      evolution of the human brain is unclear. Here we annotated cis-regulatory
      elements (CREs) in the human, rhesus macaque and chimpanzee genomes using
      chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) in different
      anatomical regions of the adult brain. We found high similarity in the genomic
      positioning of rhesus macaque and human CREs, suggesting that the majority of
      these elements were already present in a common ancestor 25 million years ago.
      Most of the observed regulatory changes between humans and rhesus macaques
      occurred before the ancestral separation of humans and chimpanzees, leaving a
      modest set of regulatory elements with predicted human specificity. Our data
      refine previous predictions and hypotheses on the consequences of genomic changes
      between primate species and allow the identification of regulatory alterations
      relevant to the evolution of the brain.

TI  - Separate circuitries encode the hedonic and nutritional values of sugar.
PG  - 465-70
LID - 10.1038/nn.4224 [doi]
AB  - Sugar exerts its potent reinforcing effects via both gustatory and post-ingestive
      pathways. It is, however, unknown whether sweetness and nutritional signals
      engage segregated brain networks to motivate ingestion. We found in mice that
      separate basal ganglia circuitries mediated the hedonic and nutritional actions
      of sugar. During sugar intake, suppressing hedonic value inhibited dopamine
      release in ventral, but not dorsal, striatum, whereas suppressing nutritional
      value inhibited dopamine release in dorsal, but not ventral, striatum.
      Consistently, cell-specific ablation of dopamine-excitable cells in dorsal, but
      not ventral, striatum inhibited sugar's ability to drive the ingestion of
      unpalatable solutions. Conversely, optogenetic stimulation of dopamine-excitable 
      cells in dorsal, but not ventral, striatum substituted for sugar in its ability
      to drive the ingestion of unpalatable solutions. Our data indicate that sugar
      recruits a distributed dopamine-excitable striatal circuitry that acts to
      prioritize energy-seeking over taste quality.

TI  - PTEN recruitment controls synaptic and cognitive function in Alzheimer's models.
PG  - 443-53
LID - 10.1038/nn.4225 [doi]
AB  - Dyshomeostasis of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is responsible for synaptic
      malfunctions leading to cognitive deficits ranging from mild impairment to
      full-blown dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta appears to skew synaptic
      plasticity events toward depression. We found that inhibition of PTEN, a lipid
      phosphatase that is essential to long-term depression, rescued normal synaptic
      function and cognition in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease.
      Conversely, transgenic mice that overexpressed PTEN displayed synaptic depression
      that mimicked and occluded Abeta-induced depression. Mechanistically, Abeta
      triggers a PDZ-dependent recruitment of PTEN into the postsynaptic compartment.
      Using a PTEN knock-in mouse lacking the PDZ motif, and a cell-permeable
      interfering peptide, we found that this mechanism is crucial for Abeta-induced
      synaptic toxicity and cognitive dysfunction. Our results provide fundamental
      information on the molecular mechanisms of Abeta-induced synaptic malfunction and
      may offer new mechanism-based therapeutic targets to counteract downstream Abeta 
      signaling.

AB  - Microglia have critical roles in neural development, homeostasis and
      neuroinflammation and are increasingly implicated in age-related neurological
      dysfunction. Neurodegeneration often occurs in disease-specific, spatially
      restricted patterns, the origins of which are unknown. We performed to our
      knowledge the first genome-wide analysis of microglia from discrete brain regions
      across the adult lifespan of the mouse, and found that microglia have distinct
      region-dependent transcriptional identities and age in a regionally variable
      manner. In the young adult brain, differences in bioenergetic and
      immunoregulatory pathways were the major sources of heterogeneity and suggested
      that cerebellar and hippocampal microglia exist in a more immune-vigilant state. 
      Immune function correlated with regional transcriptional patterns. Augmentation
      of the distinct cerebellar immunophenotype and a contrasting loss in distinction 
      of the hippocampal phenotype among forebrain regions were key features during
      aging. Microglial diversity may enable regionally localized homeostatic functions
      but could also underlie region-specific sensitivities to microglial dysregulation
      and involvement in age-related neurodegeneration.

TI  - Nicotinic receptors in the ventral tegmental area promote uncertainty-seeking.
PG  - 471-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4223 [doi]
AB  - Cholinergic neurotransmission affects decision-making, notably through the
      modulation of perceptual processing in the cortex. In addition, acetylcholine
      acts on value-based decisions through as yet unknown mechanisms. We found that
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the ventral tegmental
      area (VTA) are involved in the translation of expected uncertainty into
      motivational value. We developed a multi-armed bandit task for mice with three
      locations, each associated with a different reward probability. We found that
      mice lacking the nAChR beta2 subunit showed less uncertainty-seeking than their
      wild-type counterparts. Using model-based analysis, we found that reward
      uncertainty motivated wild-type mice, but not mice lacking the nAChR beta2
      subunit. Selective re-expression of the beta2 subunit in the VTA was sufficient
      to restore spontaneous bursting activity in dopamine neurons and
      uncertainty-seeking. Our results reveal an unanticipated role for subcortical
      nAChRs in motivation induced by expected uncertainty and provide a parsimonious
      account for a wealth of behaviors related to nAChRs in the VTA expressing the
      beta2 subunit.

TI  - On-going computation of whisking phase by mechanoreceptors.
PG  - 487-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4221 [doi]
AB  - To attribute spatial meaning to sensory information, the state of the sensory
      organ must be represented in the nervous system. In the rodent's vibrissal
      system, the whisking-cycle phase has been identified as a key coordinate, and
      phase-based representation of touch has been reported in the somatosensory
      cortex. Where and how phase is extracted in the ascending afferent pathways
      remains unknown. Using a closed-loop interface in anesthetized rats, we found
      that whisking phase is already encoded in a frequency- and amplitude-invariant
      manner by primary vibrissal afferents. We found that, for naturally constrained
      whisking dynamics, such invariant phase coding could be obtained by tuning each
      receptor to a restricted kinematic subspace. Invariant phase coding was preserved
      in the brainstem, where paralemniscal neurons filtered out the slowly evolving
      offset, whereas lemniscal neurons preserved it. These results demonstrate
      accurate, perceptually relevant, mechanically based processing at the sensor
      level.

TI  - Melanocortin-4 receptor-regulated energy homeostasis.
PG  - 206-19
LID - 10.1038/nn.4202 [doi]
AB  - The melanocortin system provides a conceptual blueprint for the central control
      of energetic state. Defined by four principal molecular components--two
      antagonistically acting ligands and two cognate receptors--this phylogenetically 
      conserved system serves as a prototype for hierarchical energy balance
      regulation. Over the last decade the application of conditional genetic
      techniques has facilitated the neuroanatomical dissection of the
      melanocortinergic network and identified the specific neural substrates and
      circuits that underscore the regulation of feeding behavior, energy expenditure, 
      glucose homeostasis and autonomic outflow. In this regard, the melanocortin-4
      receptor is a critical coordinator of mammalian energy homeostasis and body
      weight. Drawing on recent advances in neuroscience and genetic technologies, we
      consider the structure and function of the melanocortin-4 receptor circuitry and 
      its role in energy homeostasis.

TI  - Lateral hypothalamic circuits for feeding and reward.
PG  - 198-205
LID - 10.1038/nn.4220 [doi]
AB  - In experiments conducted over 60 years ago, the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)
      was identified as a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motivated behavior.
      Electrical stimulation of the LHA induces voracious feeding even in well-fed
      animals. In the absence of food, animals will work tirelessly, often
      lever-pressing thousands of times per hour, for electrical stimulation at the
      same site that provokes feeding, drinking and other species-typical motivated
      behaviors. Here we review the classic findings from electrical stimulation
      studies and integrate them with more recent work that has used contemporary
      circuit-based approaches to study the LHA. We identify specific anatomically and 
      molecularly defined LHA elements that integrate diverse information arising from 
      cortical, extended amygdala and basal forebrain networks to ultimately generate a
      highly specified and invigorated behavioral state conveyed via LHA projections to
      downstream reward and feeding-specific circuits.

TI  - Remodeling myelination: implications for mechanisms of neural plasticity.
PG  - 190-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4200 [doi]
AB  - One of the most significant paradigm shifts in membrane remodeling is the
      emerging view that membrane transformation is not exclusively controlled by
      cytoskeletal rearrangement, but also by biophysical constraints, adhesive forces,
      membrane curvature and compaction. One of the most exquisite examples of membrane
      remodeling is myelination. The advent of myelin was instrumental in advancing the
      nervous system during vertebrate evolution. With more rapid and efficient
      communication between neurons, faster and more complex computations could be
      performed in a given time and space. Our knowledge of how myelin-forming
      oligodendrocytes select and wrap axons has been limited by insufficient spatial
      and temporal resolution. By virtue of recent technological advances, progress has
      clarified longstanding controversies in the field. Here we review insights into
      myelination, from target selection to axon wrapping and membrane compaction, and 
      discuss how understanding these processes has unexpectedly opened new avenues of 
      insight into myelination-centered mechanisms of neural plasticity.

TI  - Astrocyte calcium signaling: the third wave.
PG  - 182-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4201 [doi]
AB  - The discovery that transient elevations of calcium concentration occur in
      astrocytes, and release 'gliotransmitters' which act on neurons and vascular
      smooth muscle, led to the idea that astrocytes are powerful regulators of
      neuronal spiking, synaptic plasticity and brain blood flow. These findings were
      challenged by a second wave of reports that astrocyte calcium transients did not 
      mediate functions attributed to gliotransmitters and were too slow to generate
      blood flow increases. Remarkably, the tide has now turned again: the most
      important calcium transients occur in fine astrocyte processes not resolved in
      earlier studies, and new mechanisms have been discovered by which astrocyte
      [Ca(2+)]i is raised and exerts its effects. Here we review how this third wave of
      discoveries has changed our understanding of astrocyte calcium signaling and its 
      consequences for neuronal function.

PG  - 263-70
LID - 10.1038/nn.4218 [doi]
AB  - Newly generated young neurons in the adult hippocampus receive GABAergic synaptic
      inputs, which are crucial for activity-dependent survival and functional
      maturation between 1-3 weeks after mitosis. We found synaptically driven action
      potential (AP) firing in these newborn young cells in adult mice. Although
      glutamatergic synaptic inputs remained subthreshold, activation of GABAergic
      synaptic inputs depolarized young neurons and reliably evoked APs. Furthermore,
      pairing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials or somatic current
      injection with brief bursts of GABAergic inputs revealed efficient GABAergic
      excitation at conductances of approximately 1.5 nS, corresponding to the activity
      of only three or four interneurons. Stronger GABAergic inputs (>4 nS) effectively
      blocked AP firing via shunting inhibition, which might be important to
      dynamically control spiking output in both directions. Taken together, GABAergic 
      interneurons differentially recruit newborn young granule cells by supporting
      either AP generation or shunting inhibition dependent on hippocampal network
      activity.

TI  - Activation of raphe nuclei triggers rapid and distinct effects on parallel
      olfactory bulb output channels.
PG  - 271-82
LID - 10.1038/nn.4219 [doi]
AB  - The serotonergic raphe nuclei are involved in regulating brain states over
      timescales of minutes and hours. We examined more rapid effects of raphe
      activation on two classes of principal neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb,
      mitral and tufted cells, which send olfactory information to distinct targets.
      Brief stimulation of the raphe nuclei led to excitation of tufted cells at rest
      and potentiation of their odor responses. While mitral cells at rest were also
      excited by raphe activation, their odor responses were bidirectionally modulated,
      leading to improved pattern separation of odors. In vitro whole-cell recordings
      revealed that specific optogenetic activation of raphe axons affected bulbar
      neurons through dual release of serotonin and glutamate. Therefore, the raphe
      nuclei, in addition to their role in neuromodulation of brain states, are also
      involved in fast, sub-second top-down modulation similar to cortical feedback.
      This modulation can selectively and differentially sensitize or decorrelate
      distinct output channels.

AB  - Brain neural stem cells (radial glial progenitors, RGPs) undergo a mysterious
      form of cell cycle-entrained interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) that is driven 
      apically by cytoplasmic dynein and basally by the kinesin KIF1A, which has
      recently been implicated in human brain developmental disease. To understand the 
      consequences of altered basal INM and the roles of KIF1A in disease, we performed
      constitutive and conditional RNAi and expressed mutant KIF1A in E16 to P7 rat
      RGPs and neurons. RGPs inhibited in basal INM still showed normal cell cycle
      progression, although neurogenic divisions were severely reduced. Postmitotic
      neuronal migration was independently disrupted at the multipolar stage and
      accompanied by premature ectopic expression of neuronal differentiation markers. 
      Similar effects were unexpectedly observed throughout the layer of surrounding
      control cells, mimicked by Bdnf (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) or Dcx RNAi, 
      and rescued by BDNF application. These results identify sequential and
      independent roles for KIF1A and provide an important new approach for reversing
      the effects of human disease.

PG  - 320-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4214 [doi]
AB  - Recent theory proposes that the brain, when confronted with several action
      possibilities, prepares multiple competing movements before deciding among them. 
      Psychophysical supporting evidence for this idea comes from the observation that 
      when reaching towards multiple potential targets, the initial movement is
      directed towards the average location of the targets, consistent with multiple
      prepared reaches being executed simultaneously. However, reach planning involves 
      far more than specifying movement direction; it requires the specification of a
      sensorimotor control policy that sets feedback gains shaping how the motor system
      responds to errors induced by noise or external perturbations. Here we found
      that, when a subject is reaching towards multiple potential targets, the feedback
      gain corresponds to an average of the gains specified when reaching to each
      target presented alone. Our findings provide evidence that the brain, when
      presented with multiple action options, computes multiple competing sensorimotor 
      control policies in parallel before implementing one of them.

      decision.
PG  - 327-34

AB  - Selecting and planning actions recruits neurons across many areas of the brain,
      but how ensembles of neurons work together to make decisions is unknown.
      Temporally coherent neural activity may provide a mechanism by which neurons
      coordinate their activity to make decisions. If so, neurons that are part of
      coherent ensembles may predict movement choices before other ensembles of
      neurons. We recorded neuronal activity in the lateral and medial banks of the
      intraparietal sulcus (IPS) of the posterior parietal cortex while monkeys made
      choices about where to look and reach. We decoded the activity to predict the
      choices. Ensembles of neurons that displayed coherent patterns of spiking
      activity extending across the IPS--'dual-coherent' ensembles--predicted movement 
      choices substantially earlier than other neuronal ensembles. We propose that
      dual-coherent spike timing reflects interactions between groups of neurons that
      are important to decisions.

      inflammation.
PG  - 243-52
LID - 10.1038/nn.4211 [doi]
AB  - Recovery from organ-specific autoimmune diseases largely relies on the
      mobilization of endogenous repair mechanisms and local factors that control them.
      Natural killer (NK) cells are swiftly mobilized to organs targeted by
      autoimmunity and typically undergo numerical contraction when inflammation wanes.
      We report the unexpected finding that NK cells are retained in the brain
      subventricular zone (SVZ) during the chronic phase of multiple sclerosis in
      humans and its animal model in mice. These NK cells were found preferentially in 
      close proximity to SVZ neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce interleukin-15 and
      sustain functionally competent NK cells. Moreover, NK cells limited the
      reparative capacity of NSCs following brain inflammation. These findings reveal
      that reciprocal interactions between NSCs and NK cells regulate neurorepair.

PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4208 [doi]
AB  - Innate fear has a critical role in survival of animals. Unlike conditioned fear, 
      the neuronal circuitry underlying innate fear is largely unknown. We found that
      the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and lateral habenula (LHb) are specifically
      activated by the mouse predator odorant trimethylthiazoline (TMT). Using
      optogenetics to selectively stimulate GABAergic neurons in the LDT immediately
      produced fear-like responses (freezing, accelerated heart rate and increased
      serum corticosterone), whereas prolonged stimulation caused anxiety-like
      behaviors. Notably, although selective stimulation of parvalbumin (PV)-positive
      interneurons similarly induced fear-like responses, stimulation of
      somatostatin-positive interneurons or inhibition of PV neurons in the LDT
      suppressed TMT-induced fear-like responses without affecting conditioned fear.
      Finally, activation of LHb glutamatergic inputs to LDT interneurons was
      sufficient to generate fear-like responses. Thus, the LHb-LDT pathway is
      important for regulating olfactory cue-induced innate fear. Our results provide a
      potential target for therapeutic intervention for anxiety disorder.

AB  - Nervous systems are composed of various cell types, but the extent of cell type
      diversity is poorly understood. We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one
      cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell
      RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23
      GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell
      type-specific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these
      transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of
      our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential
      electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the 
      single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular

AB  - We examined adaptations in nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons in mouse and rat
      peripheral nerve injury models of neuropathic pain. Injury selectively increased 
      excitability of NAc shell indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) and
      altered their synaptic connectivity. Moreover, injury-induced tactile allodynia
      was reversed by inhibiting and exacerbated by exciting iSPNs, indicating that
      they not only participated in the central representation of pain, but gated
      activity in ascending nociceptive pathways.

TI  - Hypothalamic feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical network controls arousal
      and consciousness.
PG  - 290-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4209 [doi]
AB  - During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, synchronous synaptic activity in the 
      thalamocortical network generates predominantly low-frequency oscillations (<4
      Hz) that are modulated by inhibitory inputs from the thalamic reticular nucleus
      (TRN). Whether TRN cells integrate sleep-wake signals from subcortical circuits
      remains unclear. We found that GABA neurons from the lateral hypothalamus
      (LHGABA) exert a strong inhibitory control over TRN GABA neurons (TRNGABA). We
      found that optogenetic activation of this circuit recapitulated state-dependent
      changes of TRN neuron activity in behaving mice and induced rapid arousal during 
      NREM, but not REM, sleep. During deep anesthesia, activation of this circuit
      induced sustained cortical arousal. In contrast, optogenetic silencing of
      LHGABA-TRNGABA transmission increased the duration of NREM sleep and amplitude of
      delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TRN
      cells integrate subcortical arousal inputs selectively during NREM sleep and may 
      participate in sleep intensity.

      neurodevelopmental disease.
PG  - 223-32
LID - 10.1038/nn.4205 [doi]
AB  - Genetic determinants of cognition are poorly characterized, and their
      relationship to genes that confer risk for neurodevelopmental disease is unclear.
      Here we performed a systems-level analysis of genome-wide gene expression data to
      infer gene-regulatory networks conserved across species and brain regions. Two of
      these networks, M1 and M3, showed replicable enrichment for common genetic
      variants underlying healthy human cognitive abilities, including memory. Using
      exome sequence data from 6,871 trios, we found that M3 genes were also enriched
      for mutations ascertained from patients with neurodevelopmental disease
      generally, and intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy in
      particular. M3 consists of 150 genes whose expression is tightly developmentally 
      regulated, but which are collectively poorly annotated for known functional
      pathways. These results illustrate how systems-level analyses can reveal
      previously unappreciated relationships between neurodevelopmental
      disease-associated genes in the developed human brain, and provide empirical
      support for a convergent gene-regulatory network influencing cognition and
      neurodevelopmental disease.

AB  - GABAB receptors, the most abundant inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors in the 
      mammalian brain, display pronounced diversity in functional properties, cellular 
      signaling and subcellular distribution. We used high-resolution functional
      proteomics to identify the building blocks of these receptors in the rodent
      brain. Our analyses revealed that native GABAB receptors are macromolecular
      complexes with defined architecture, but marked diversity in subunit composition:
      the receptor core is assembled from GABAB1a/b, GABAB2, four KCTD proteins and a
      distinct set of G-protein subunits, whereas the receptor's periphery is mostly
      formed by transmembrane proteins of different classes. In particular, the
      periphery-forming constituents include signaling effectors, such as Cav2 and HCN 
      channels, and the proteins AJAP1 and amyloid-beta A4, both of which tightly
      associate with the sushi domains of GABAB1a. Our results unravel the molecular
      diversity of GABAB receptors and their postnatal assembly dynamics and provide a 
      roadmap for studying the cellular signaling of this inhibitory neurotransmitter
      receptor.

TI  - Laminar differences in the orientation selectivity of geniculate afferents in
      mouse primary visual cortex.
PG  - 316-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4215 [doi]
AB  - It has been debated whether orientation selectivity in mouse primary visual
      cortex (V1) is derived from tuned lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) inputs or
      computed from untuned LGN inputs. However, few studies have measured orientation 
      tuning of LGN axons projecting to V1. We measured the response properties of
      mouse LGN axons terminating in V1 and found that LGN axons projecting to layer 4 
      were generally less tuned for orientation than axons projecting to more
      superficial layers of V1. We also found several differences in response
      properties between LGN axons and V1 neurons in layer 4. These results suggest
      that orientation selectivity of mouse V1 may not simply be inherited from LGN
      inputs, but could also depend on thalamocortical or V1 circuits.

TI  - Thalamus provides layer 4 of primary visual cortex with orientation- and
      direction-tuned inputs.
PG  - 308-15
LID - 10.1038/nn.4196 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the functions of a brain region requires knowing the neural
      representations of its myriad inputs, local neurons and outputs. Primary visual
      cortex (V1) has long been thought to compute visual orientation from untuned
      thalamic inputs, but very few thalamic inputs have been measured in any mammal.
      We determined the response properties of approximately 28,000 thalamic boutons
      and approximately 4,000 cortical neurons in layers 1-5 of awake mouse V1. Using
      adaptive optics that allows accurate measurement of bouton activity deep in
      cortex, we found that around half of the boutons in the main thalamorecipient L4 
      carried orientation-tuned information and that their orientation and direction
      biases were also dominant in the L4 neuron population, suggesting that these
      neurons may inherit their selectivity from tuned thalamic inputs. Cortical
      neurons in all layers exhibited sharper tuning than thalamic boutons and a
      greater diversity of preferred orientations. Our results provide data-rich
      constraints for refining mechanistic models of cortical computation.

TI  - Thalamic nuclei convey diverse contextual information to layer 1 of visual
      cortex.
PG  - 299-307
LID - 10.1038/nn.4197 [doi]
AB  - Sensory perception depends on the context in which a stimulus occurs. Prevailing 
      models emphasize cortical feedback as the source of contextual modulation.
      However, higher order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar, interconnect with
      many cortical and subcortical areas, suggesting a role for the thalamus in
      providing sensory and behavioral context. Yet the nature of the signals conveyed 
      to cortex by higher order thalamus remains poorly understood. Here we use axonal 
      calcium imaging to measure information provided to visual cortex by the pulvinar 
      equivalent in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), as well as the
      dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). We found that dLGN conveys
      retinotopically precise visual signals, while LP provides distributed information
      from the visual scene. Both LP and dLGN projections carry locomotion signals.
      However, while dLGN inputs often respond to positive combinations of running and 
      visual flow speed, LP signals discrepancies between self-generated and external
      visual motion. This higher order thalamic nucleus therefore conveys diverse
      contextual signals that inform visual cortex about visual scene changes not
      predicted by the animal's own actions.

TI  - Glia as drivers of abnormal neuronal activity.
PG  - 28-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4184 [doi]
AB  - Reactive astrocytes have been proposed to become incompetent bystanders in
      epilepsy as a result of cellular changes rendering them unable to perform
      important housekeeping functions. Indeed, successful surgical treatment of
      mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy hinges on the removal of the glial scar. New research
      now extends the role of astrocytes, suggesting that they may drive the disease
      process by impairing the inhibitory action of neuronal GABA receptors. Here we
      discuss studies that include hyperexcitability resulting from impaired supply of 
      astrocytic glutamine for neuronal GABA synthesis, and epilepsy resulting from
      genetically induced astrogliosis or malignant transformation, both of which
      render the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA excitatory. In these examples, glial 
      cells alter the expression or function of neuronal proteins involved in
      excitability. Although epilepsy has traditionally been thought of as a disease
      caused by changes in neuronal properties exclusively, these new findings
      challenge us to consider the contribution of glial cells as drivers of
      epileptogenesis in acquired epilepsies.

TI  - The role of microglia and macrophages in glioma maintenance and progression.
PG  - 20-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4185 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing recognition that gliomas are complex tumors composed of
      neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells, which each individually contribute to cancer
      formation, progression and response to treatment. The majority of the
      non-neoplastic cells are tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), either of
      peripheral origin or representing brain-intrinsic microglia, that create a
      supportive stroma for neoplastic cell expansion and invasion. TAMs are recruited 
      to the glioma environment, have immune functions, and can release a wide array of
      growth factors and cytokines in response to those factors produced by cancer
      cells. In this manner, TAMs facilitate tumor proliferation, survival and
      migration. Through such iterative interactions, a unique tumor ecosystem is
      established, which offers new opportunities for therapeutic targeting.

AB  - Precise targeting of genetic lesions alone has been insufficient to extend brain 
      tumor patient survival. Brain cancer cells are diverse in their genetic,
      metabolic and microenvironmental compositions, accounting for their phenotypic
      heterogeneity and disparate responses to therapy. These factors converge at the
      level of the epigenome, representing a unified node that can be disrupted by
      pharmacologic inhibition. Aberrant epigenomes define many childhood and adult
      brain cancers, as demonstrated by widespread changes to DNA methylation patterns,
      redistribution of histone marks and disruption of chromatin structure. In this
      Review, we describe the convergence of genetic, metabolic and microenvironmental 
      factors on mechanisms of epigenetic deregulation in brain cancer. We discuss how 
      aberrant epigenetic pathways identified in brain tumors affect cell identity,
      cell state and neoplastic transformation, as well as addressing the potential to 
      exploit these alterations as new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of
      brain cancer.

TI  - Oligodendrocyte death results in immune-mediated CNS demyelination.
PG  - 65-74
LID - 10.1038/nn.4193 [doi]
AB  - Although multiple sclerosis is a common neurological disorder, the origin of the 
      autoimmune response against myelin, which is the characteristic feature of the
      disease, remains unclear. To investigate whether oligodendrocyte death could
      cause this autoimmune response, we examined the oligodendrocyte ablation
      Plp1-CreER(T);ROSA26-eGFP-DTA (DTA) mouse model. Approximately 30 weeks after
      recovering from oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination, DTA mice develop a fatal 
      secondary disease characterized by extensive myelin and axonal loss. Strikingly, 
      late-onset disease was associated with increased numbers of T lymphocytes in the 
      CNS and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific T cells in lymphoid
      organs. Transfer of T cells derived from DTA mice to naive recipients resulted in
      neurological defects that correlated with CNS white matter inflammation.
      Furthermore, immune tolerization against MOG ameliorated symptoms. Overall, these
      data indicate that oligodendrocyte death is sufficient to trigger an adaptive
      autoimmune response against myelin, suggesting that a similar process can occur
      in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4192 [doi]
AB  - To study how the interaction between orbitofrontal (OFC) and rhinal (Rh) cortices
      influences the judgment of reward size, we reversibly disconnected these regions 
      using hM4Di-DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug).
      Repeated inactivation reduced sensitivity to differences in reward size in two
      monkeys. These results suggest that retrieval of relative stimulus values from
      memory depends on the interaction between Rh and OFC.

AB  - Auditory perceptual decisions are thought to be mediated by the ventral auditory 
      pathway. However, the specific and causal contributions of different brain
      regions in this pathway, including the middle-lateral (ML) and anterolateral (AL)
      belt regions of the auditory cortex, to auditory decisions have not been fully
      identified. To identify these contributions, we recorded from and microstimulated
      ML and AL sites while monkeys decided whether an auditory stimulus contained more
      low-frequency or high-frequency tone bursts. Both ML and AL neural activity was
      modulated by the frequency content of the stimulus. But, only the responses of
      the most stimulus-sensitive AL neurons were systematically modulated by the
      monkeys' choices. Consistent with this observation, microstimulation of AL, but
      not ML, systematically biased the monkeys' behavior toward the choice associated 
      with the preferred frequency of the stimulated site. Together, these findings
      suggest that AL directly and causally contributes sensory evidence to form this
      auditory decision.

TI  - DNA methylation changes in plasticity genes accompany the formation and
      maintenance of memory.
PG  - 102-10
LID - 10.1038/nn.4194 [doi]
AB  - The ability to form memories is a prerequisite for an organism's behavioral
      adaptation to environmental changes. At the molecular level, the acquisition and 
      maintenance of memory requires changes in chromatin modifications. In an effort
      to unravel the epigenetic network underlying both short- and long-term memory, we
      examined chromatin modification changes in two distinct mouse brain regions, two 
      cell types and three time points before and after contextual learning. We found
      that histone modifications predominantly changed during memory acquisition and
      correlated surprisingly little with changes in gene expression. Although
      long-lasting changes were almost exclusive to neurons, learning-related histone
      modification and DNA methylation changes also occurred in non-neuronal cell
      types, suggesting a functional role for non-neuronal cells in epigenetic
      learning. Finally, our data provide evidence for a molecular framework of memory 
      acquisition and maintenance, wherein DNA methylation could alter the expression
      and splicing of genes involved in functional plasticity and synaptic wiring.

TI  - Brief optogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons mimics endogenous negative
      reward prediction errors.
PG  - 111-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4191 [doi]
AB  - Correlative studies have strongly linked phasic changes in dopamine activity with
      reward prediction error signaling. But causal evidence that these brief changes
      in firing actually serve as error signals to drive associative learning is more
      tenuous. Although there is direct evidence that brief increases can substitute
      for positive prediction errors, there is no comparable evidence that similarly
      brief pauses can substitute for negative prediction errors. In the absence of
      such evidence, the effect of increases in firing could reflect novelty or
      salience, variables also correlated with dopamine activity. Here we provide
      evidence in support of the proposed linkage, showing in a modified Pavlovian
      over-expectation task that brief pauses in the firing of dopamine neurons in rat 
      ventral tegmental area at the time of reward are sufficient to mimic the effects 
      of endogenous negative prediction errors. These results support the proposal that
      brief changes in the firing of dopamine neurons serve as full-fledged
      bidirectional prediction error signals.

TI  - Injured sensory neuron-derived CSF1 induces microglial proliferation and
      DAP12-dependent pain.
PG  - 94-101
LID - 10.1038/nn.4189 [doi]
AB  - Although microglia have been implicated in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain,
      the manner by which injured sensory neurons engage microglia remains unclear. We 
      found that peripheral nerve injury induced de novo expression of
      colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in injured sensory neurons. CSF1 was
      transported to the spinal cord, where it targeted the microglial CSF1 receptor
      (CSF1R). Cre-mediated sensory neuron deletion of Csf1 completely prevented nerve 
      injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced microglial activation and 
      proliferation. In contrast, intrathecal injection of CSF1 induced mechanical
      hypersensitivity and microglial proliferation. Nerve injury also upregulated CSF1
      in motoneurons, where it was required for ventral horn microglial activation and 
      proliferation. Downstream of CSF1R, we found that the microglial membrane adaptor
      protein DAP12 was required for both nerve injury- and intrathecal CSF1-induced
      upregulation of pain-related microglial genes and the ensuing pain, but not for
      microglial proliferation. Thus, both CSF1 and DAP12 are potential targets for the
      pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain.

TI  - Cortical tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures in connected speech.
PG  - 158-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.4186 [doi]
AB  - The most critical attribute of human language is its unbounded combinatorial
      nature: smaller elements can be combined into larger structures on the basis of a
      grammatical system, resulting in a hierarchy of linguistic units, such as words, 
      phrases and sentences. Mentally parsing and representing such structures,
      however, poses challenges for speech comprehension. In speech, hierarchical
      linguistic structures do not have boundaries that are clearly defined by acoustic
      cues and must therefore be internally and incrementally constructed during
      comprehension. We found that, during listening to connected speech, cortical
      activity of different timescales concurrently tracked the time course of abstract
      linguistic structures at different hierarchical levels, such as words, phrases
      and sentences. Notably, the neural tracking of hierarchical linguistic structures
      was dissociated from the encoding of acoustic cues and from the predictability of
      incoming words. Our results indicate that a hierarchy of neural processing
      timescales underlies grammar-based internal construction of hierarchical
      linguistic structure.

AB  - Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE-1 (beta-site APP cleaving
      enzyme-1) is the rate-limiting step in amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and a
      neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease; thus, physical approximation of 
      this substrate-enzyme pair is a crucial event with broad biological and
      therapeutic implications. Despite much research, neuronal locales of APP and
      BACE-1 convergence and APP cleavage remain unclear. Here we report an optical
      assay, based on fluorescence complementation, for visualizing in cellulo
      APP-BACE-1 interactions as a simple on/off signal. Combining this with other
      assays tracking the fate of internalized APP in hippocampal neurons, we found
      that APP and BACE-1 interacted in both biosynthetic and endocytic compartments,
      particularly along recycling microdomains such as dendritic spines and
      presynaptic boutons. In axons, APP and BACE-1 were cotransported, and they also
      interacted during transit. Finally, our assay revealed that the Alzheimer's
      disease-protective 'Icelandic' mutation greatly attenuates APP-BACE-1
      interactions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for protection. Collectively, the
      data challenge canonical models and provide concrete insights into long-standing 
      controversies in the field.

TI  - Origins of choice-related activity in mouse somatosensory cortex.
PG  - 127-34
LID - 10.1038/nn.4183 [doi]
AB  - During perceptual decisions about faint or ambiguous sensory stimuli, even
      identical stimuli can produce different choices. Spike trains from sensory cortex
      neurons can predict trial-to-trial variability in choice. Choice-related spiking 
      is widely studied as a way to link cortical activity to perception, but its
      origins remain unclear. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we found that mouse 
      primary somatosensory cortex neurons showed robust choice-related activity during
      a tactile detection task. Spike trains from primary mechanoreceptive neurons did 
      not predict choices about identical stimuli. Spike trains from thalamic relay
      neurons showed highly transient, weak choice-related activity. Intracellular
      recordings in cortex revealed a prolonged choice-related depolarization in most
      neurons that was not accounted for by feed-forward thalamic input. Top-down axons
      projecting from secondary to primary somatosensory cortex signaled choice. An
      intracellular measure of stimulus sensitivity determined which neurons converted 
      choice-related depolarization into spiking. Our results reveal how choice-related
      spiking emerges across neural circuits and within single neurons.

TI  - Action initiation shapes mesolimbic dopamine encoding of future rewards.
PG  - 34-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4187 [doi]
AB  - It is widely held that dopamine signaling encodes predictions of future rewards
      and such predictions are regularly used to drive behavior, but the relationship
      between these two is poorly defined. We found in rats that nucleus accumbens
      dopamine following a reward-predicting cue was attenuated unless movement was
      correctly initiated. Our results indicate that dopamine release in this region is
      contingent on correct action initiation and not just reward prediction.

TI  - Mapping DNA methylation across development, genotype and schizophrenia in the
      human frontal cortex.
PG  - 40-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4181 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation (DNAm) is important in brain development and is potentially
      important in schizophrenia. We characterized DNAm in prefrontal cortex from 335
      non-psychiatric controls across the lifespan and 191 patients with schizophrenia 
      and identified widespread changes in the transition from prenatal to postnatal
      life. These DNAm changes manifest in the transcriptome, correlate strongly with a
      shifting cellular landscape and overlap regions of genetic risk for
      schizophrenia. A quarter of published genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS)-suggestive loci (4,208 of 15,930, P < 10(-100)) manifest as significant
      methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), including 59.6% of GWAS-positive
      schizophrenia loci. We identified 2,104 CpGs that differ between schizophrenia
      patients and controls that were enriched for genes related to development and
      neurodifferentiation. The schizophrenia-associated CpGs strongly correlate with
      changes related to the prenatal-postnatal transition and show slight enrichment
      for GWAS risk loci while not corresponding to CpGs differentiating adolescence
      from later adult life. These data implicate an epigenetic component to the
      developmental origins of this disorder.

AB  - We characterized DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in a large
      collection (n = 166) of human fetal brain samples spanning 56-166 d
      post-conception, identifying >16,000 fetal brain mQTLs. Fetal brain mQTLs were
      primarily cis-acting, enriched in regulatory chromatin domains and transcription 
      factor binding sites, and showed substantial overlap with genetic variants that
      were also associated with gene expression in the brain. Using tissue from three
      distinct regions of the adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum),
      we found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a
      subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were
      enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a
      hypothesized neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can be
      used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of discrete sites of variable
      fetal brain methylation associated with schizophrenia risk variants.

TI  - Stimulus-specific combinatorial functionality of neuronal c-fos enhancers.
PG  - 75-83
LID - 10.1038/nn.4170 [doi]
AB  - The c-fos gene (also known as Fos) is induced by a broad range of stimuli and is 
      a reliable marker for neural activity. Its induction mechanism and available
      reporter mouse lines are based exclusively on c-fos promoter activity. Here we
      demonstrate that multiple enhancers surrounding the c-fos gene are crucial for
      ensuring robust c-fos response to various stimuli. Membrane depolarization,
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and forskolin activate distinct subsets 
      of the enhancers to induce c-fos transcription in neurons, suggesting that
      stimulus-specific combinatorial activation of multiple enhancers underlies the
      broad inducibility of the c-fos gene. Accordingly, the functional requirement of 
      key transcription factors varies depending on the type of stimulation.
      Combinatorial enhancer activation also occurs in the brain. Providing a
      comprehensive picture of the c-fos induction mechanism beyond the minimal
      promoter, our study should help in understanding the physiological nature of
      c-fos induction in relation to neural activity and plasticity.

TI  - Synaptic adhesion molecule IgSF11 regulates synaptic transmission and plasticity.
PG  - 84-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4176 [doi]
AB  - Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and plasticity through
      mechanisms that include trans-synaptic adhesion and recruitment of diverse
      synaptic proteins. We found that the immunoglobulin superfamily member 11
      (IgSF11), a homophilic adhesion molecule that preferentially expressed in the
      brain, is a dual-binding partner of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95
      and AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs). IgSF11 required PSD-95 binding for its
      excitatory synaptic localization. In addition, IgSF11 stabilized synaptic AMPARs,
      as determined by IgSF11 knockdown-induced suppression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic 
      transmission and increased surface mobility of AMPARs, measured by
      high-throughput, single-molecule tracking. IgSF11 deletion in mice led to the
      suppression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus and
      long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. IgSF11 did not
      regulate the functional characteristics of AMPARs, including desensitization,
      deactivation or recovery. These results suggest that IgSF11 regulates excitatory 
      synaptic transmission and plasticity through its tripartite interactions with
      PSD-95 and AMPARs.

      and parietal areas.
PG  - 150-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4174 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have provided conflicting accounts regarding where in the human
      brain visual short-term memory (VSTM) content is stored, with strong univariate
      fMRI responses being reported in superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but robust 
      multivariate decoding being reported in occipital cortex. Given the continuous
      influx of information in everyday vision, VSTM storage under distraction is often
      required. We found that neither distractor presence nor predictability during the
      memory delay affected behavioral performance. Similarly, superior IPS exhibited
      consistent decoding of VSTM content across all distractor manipulations and had
      multivariate responses that closely tracked behavioral VSTM performance. However,
      occipital decoding of VSTM content was substantially modulated by distractor
      presence and predictability. Furthermore, we found no effect of target-distractor
      similarity on VSTM behavioral performance, further challenging the role of
      sensory regions in VSTM storage. Overall, consistent with previous univariate
      findings, our results indicate that superior IPS, but not occipital cortex, has a
      central role in VSTM storage.

PG  - 165-71
LID - 10.1038/nn.4179 [doi]
AB  - Although attention plays a ubiquitous role in perception and cognition,
      researchers lack a simple way to measure a person's overall attentional
      abilities. Because behavioral measures are diverse and difficult to standardize, 
      we pursued a neuromarker of an important aspect of attention, sustained
      attention, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, we
      identified functional brain networks whose strength during a sustained attention 
      task predicted individual differences in performance. Models based on these
      networks generalized to previously unseen individuals, even predicting
      performance from resting-state connectivity alone. Furthermore, these same models
      predicted a clinical measure of attention--symptoms of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder--from resting-state connectivity in an independent sample 
      of children and adolescents. These results demonstrate that whole-brain
      functional network strength provides a broadly applicable neuromarker of
      sustained attention.

AB  - Our ability to learn a wide range of behavioral tasks is essential for responding
      appropriately to sensory stimuli according to behavioral demands, but the
      underlying neural mechanism has been rarely examined by neurophysiological
      recordings in the same subjects across learning. To understand how learning new
      behavioral tasks affects neuronal representations, we recorded from posterior
      parietal cortex (PPC) before and after training on a visual motion categorization
      task. We found that categorization training influenced cognitive encoding in PPC,
      with a marked enhancement of memory-related delay-period encoding during the
      categorization task that was absent during a motion discrimination task before
      categorization training. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited
      strong delay-period encoding during both discrimination and categorization tasks.
      This reveals a dissociation between PFC's and PPC's roles in working memory, with
      general engagement of PFC across multiple tasks, in contrast with more
      task-specific mnemonic encoding in PPC.

AB  - Dopamine cell firing can encode errors in reward prediction, providing a learning
      signal to guide future behavior. Yet dopamine is also a key modulator of
      motivation, invigorating current behavior. Existing theories propose that fast
      (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support learning, whereas much slower (tonic)
      dopamine changes are involved in motivation. We examined dopamine release in the 
      nucleus accumbens across multiple time scales, using complementary microdialysis 
      and voltammetric methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that
      minute-by-minute dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational
      vigor. Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally
      discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine immediately
      altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action choices by encoding
      temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our results indicate that dopamine 
      conveys a single, rapidly evolving decision variable, the available reward for
      investment of effort, which is employed for both learning and motivational
      functions.

AB  - Understanding how individual neurons integrate the thousands of synaptic inputs
      they receive is critical to understanding how the brain works. Modeling studies
      in silico and experimental work in vitro, dating back more than half a century,
      have revealed that neurons can perform a variety of different passive and active 
      forms of synaptic integration on their inputs. But how are synaptic inputs
      integrated in the intact brain? With the development of new techniques, this
      question has recently received substantial attention, with new findings
      suggesting that many of the forms of synaptic integration observed in vitro also 
      occur in vivo, including in awake animals. Here we review six decades of
      progress, which collectively highlights the complex ways that single neurons
      integrate their inputs, emphasizing the critical role of dendrites in information
      processing in the brain.

TI  - Mutations in NONO lead to syndromic intellectual disability and inhibitory
      synaptic defects.
PG  - 1731-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4169 [doi]
AB  - The NONO protein has been characterized as an important transcriptional regulator
      in diverse cellular contexts. Here we show that loss of NONO function is a likely
      cause of human intellectual disability and that NONO-deficient mice have
      cognitive and affective deficits. Correspondingly, we find specific defects at
      inhibitory synapses, where NONO regulates synaptic transcription and gephyrin
      scaffold structure. Our data identify NONO as a possible neurodevelopmental
      disease gene and highlight the key role of the DBHS protein family in functional 
      organization of GABAergic synapses.

AB  - The structure and function of the human brain are highly stereotyped, implying a 
      conserved molecular program responsible for its development, cellular structure
      and function. We applied a correlation-based metric called differential stability
      to assess reproducibility of gene expression patterning across 132 structures in 
      six individual brains, revealing mesoscale genetic organization. The genes with
      the highest differential stability are highly biologically relevant, with
      enrichment for brain-related annotations, disease associations, drug targets and 
      literature citations. Using genes with high differential stability, we identified
      32 anatomically diverse and reproducible gene expression signatures, which
      represent distinct cell types, intracellular components and/or associations with 
      neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Genes in neuron-associated
      compared to non-neuronal networks showed higher preservation between human and
      mouse; however, many diversely patterned genes displayed marked shifts in
      regulation between species. Finally, highly consistent transcriptional
      architecture in neocortex is correlated with resting state functional
      connectivity, suggesting a link between conserved gene expression and
      functionally relevant circuitry.

TI  - The neuronal basis of fear generalization in humans.
PG  - 1811-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4166 [doi]
AB  - Organisms tend to respond similarly to stimuli that are perceptually close to an 
      event that predicts adversity, a phenomenon known as fear generalization. Greater
      dissimilarity yields weaker behavioral responses, forming a fear-tuning profile. 
      The perceptual model of fear generalization assumes that behavioral fear tuning
      results from perceptual similarities, suggesting that brain responses should also
      exhibit the same fear-tuning profile. Using fMRI and a circular
      fear-generalization procedure, we tested this prediction. In contrast with the
      perceptual model, insula responses showed less generalization than behavioral
      responses and encoded the aversive quality of the conditioned stimulus, as shown 
      by high pattern similarity between the conditioned stimulus and the shock. Also
      inconsistent with the perceptual model, object-sensitive visual areas responded
      to ambiguity-related outcome uncertainty. Together these results indicate that
      fear generalization is not passively driven by perception, but is an active
      process integrating threat identification and ambiguity-based uncertainty to
      orchestrate a flexible, adaptive fear response.

AB  - Among the most promising approaches for treating Alzheimer's disease is
      immunotherapy with amyloid-beta (Abeta)-targeting antibodies. Using in vivo
      two-photon imaging in mouse models, we found that two different antibodies to
      Abeta used for treatment were ineffective at repairing neuronal dysfunction and
      caused an increase in cortical hyperactivity. This unexpected finding provides a 
      possible cellular explanation for the lack of cognitive improvement by
      immunotherapy in human studies.

TI  - Parcellating cortical functional networks in individuals.
PG  - 1853-60
LID - 10.1038/nn.4164 [doi]
AB  - The capacity to identify the unique functional architecture of an individual's
      brain is a crucial step toward personalized medicine and understanding the neural
      basis of variation in human cognition and behavior. Here we developed a cortical 
      parcellation approach to accurately map functional organization at the individual
      level using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A
      population-based functional atlas and a map of inter-individual variability were 
      employed to guide the iterative search for functional networks in individual
      subjects. Functional networks mapped by this approach were highly reproducible
      within subjects and effectively captured the variability across subjects,
      including individual differences in brain lateralization. The algorithm performed
      well across different subject populations and data types, including task fMRI
      data. The approach was then validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping in
      surgical patients, suggesting potential for use in clinical applications.

TI  - Piezo2 is the principal mechanotransduction channel for proprioception.
PG  - 1756-62
LID - 10.1038/nn.4162 [doi]
AB  - Proprioception, the perception of body and limb position, is mediated by
      proprioceptors, specialized mechanosensory neurons that convey information about 
      the stretch and tension experienced by muscles, tendons, skin and joints. In
      mammals, the molecular identity of the stretch-sensitive channel that mediates
      proprioception is unknown. We found that the mechanically activated nonselective 
      cation channel Piezo2 was expressed in sensory endings of proprioceptors
      innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs in mice. Two independent
      mouse lines that lack Piezo2 in proprioceptive neurons showed severely
      uncoordinated body movements and abnormal limb positions. Moreover, the
      mechanosensitivity of parvalbumin-expressing neurons that predominantly mark
      proprioceptors was dependent on Piezo2 expression in vitro, and the
      stretch-induced firing of proprioceptors in muscle-nerve recordings was markedly 
      reduced in Piezo2-deficient mice. Together, our results indicate that Piezo2 is
      the major mechanotransducer of mammalian proprioceptors.

TI  - Optogenetic acidification of synaptic vesicles and lysosomes.
PG  - 1845-1852
LID - 10.1038/nn.4161 [doi]
AB  - Acidification is required for the function of many intracellular organelles, but 
      methods to acutely manipulate their intraluminal pH have not been available. Here
      we present a targeting strategy to selectively express the light-driven proton
      pump Arch3 on synaptic vesicles. Our new tool, pHoenix, can functionally replace 
      endogenous proton pumps, enabling optogenetic control of vesicular acidification 
      and neurotransmitter accumulation. Under physiological conditions, glutamatergic 
      vesicles are nearly full, as additional vesicle acidification with pHoenix only
      slightly increased the quantal size. By contrast, we found that incompletely
      filled vesicles exhibited a lower release probability than full vesicles,
      suggesting preferential exocytosis of vesicles with high transmitter content. Our
      subcellular targeting approach can be transferred to other organelles, as
      demonstrated for a pHoenix variant that allows light-activated acidification of
      lysosomes.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4165 [doi]
AB  - Neuropathic pain is a debilitating clinical problem and difficult to treat. Nerve
      injury causes a long-lasting reduction in K(+) channel expression in the dorsal
      root ganglion (DRG), but little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms
      involved. We found that nerve injury increased dimethylation of Lys9 on histone
      H3 (H3K9me2) at Kcna4, Kcnd2, Kcnq2 and Kcnma1 promoters but did not affect
      levels of DNA methylation on these genes in DRGs. Nerve injury increased activity
      of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (G9a), histone deacetylases
      and enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), but only G9a inhibition consistently
      restored K(+) channel expression. Selective knockout of the gene encoding G9a in 
      DRG neurons completely blocked K(+) channel silencing and chronic pain
      development after nerve injury. Remarkably, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that
      G9a inhibition not only reactivated 40 of 42 silenced genes associated with K(+) 
      channels but also normalized 638 genes down- or upregulated by nerve injury. Thus
      G9a has a dominant function in transcriptional repression of K(+) channels and in
      acute-to-chronic pain transition after nerve injury.

AB  - Climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells are thought to be involved in generating 
      the instructive signals that drive cerebellar learning. To investigate how these 
      instructive signals are encoded, we recorded the activity of individual climbing 
      fibers during cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice. We found that
      climbing fibers signaled both the unexpected delivery and the unexpected omission
      of the periocular airpuff that served as the instructive signal for eyeblink
      conditioning. In addition, we observed that climbing fibers activated by
      periocular airpuffs also responded to stimuli from other sensory modalities if
      those stimuli were novel or if they predicted that the periocular airpuff was
      about to be presented. This pattern of climbing fiber activity is markedly
      similar to the responses of dopamine neurons during reinforcement learning, which
      have been shown to encode a particular type of instructive signal known as a
      temporal difference prediction error.

AB  - Brain transcriptome and connectome maps are being generated, but an equivalent
      effort on the proteome is currently lacking. We performed high-resolution mass
      spectrometry-based proteomics for in-depth analysis of the mouse brain and its
      major brain regions and cell types. Comparisons of the 12,934 identified proteins
      in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia and cortical neurons with deep
      sequencing data of the transcriptome indicated deep coverage of the proteome.
      Cell type-specific proteins defined as tenfold more abundant than average
      expression represented about a tenth of the proteome, with an overrepresentation 
      of cell surface proteins. To demonstrate the utility of our resource, we focused 
      on this class of proteins and identified Lsamp, an adhesion molecule of the IgLON
      family, as a negative regulator of myelination. Our findings provide a framework 
      for a system-level understanding of cell-type diversity in the CNS and serves as 
      a rich resource for analyses of brain development and function.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4159 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult hippocampus are considered to be
      bi-potent, as they only produce neurons and astrocytes in vivo. In mouse, we
      found that inactivation of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1), a gene mutated in
      neurofibromatosis type 1, unlocked a latent oligodendrocyte lineage potential to 
      produce all three lineages from NSCs in vivo. Our results suggest an avenue for
      promoting stem cell plasticity by targeting barriers of latent lineage potential.

PG  - 1780-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4155 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal activity is important for the functional refinement of neuronal circuits
      in the early visual system. At the level of the cerebral cortex, however, it is
      still unknown whether the formation of fundamental functions such as orientation 
      selectivity depends on neuronal activity, as it has been difficult to suppress
      activity throughout development. Using genetic silencing of cortical activity
      starting before the formation of orientation selectivity, we found that the
      orientation selectivity of neurons in the mouse visual cortex formed and matured 
      normally despite a strong suppression of both spontaneous and visually evoked
      activity throughout development. After the orientation selectivity formed, the
      distribution of the preferred orientations of neurons was reorganized. We found
      that this process required spontaneous activity, but not visually evoked
      activity. Thus, the initial formation and maturation of orientation selectivity
      is largely independent of neuronal activity, and the initial selectivity is
      subsequently modified depending on neuronal activity.

TI  - Inferring learning rules from distributions of firing rates in cortical neurons.
PG  - 1804-10
LID - 10.1038/nn.4158 [doi]
AB  - Information about external stimuli is thought to be stored in cortical circuits
      through experience-dependent modifications of synaptic connectivity. These
      modifications of network connectivity should lead to changes in neuronal activity
      as a particular stimulus is repeatedly encountered. Here we ask what plasticity
      rules are consistent with the differences in the statistics of the visual
      response to novel and familiar stimuli in inferior temporal cortex, an area
      underlying visual object recognition. We introduce a method that allows one to
      infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing
      rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low
      postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating
      depression from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of
      the firing rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a
      rule extracted from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser
      representations of stimuli.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is required for hippocampal-dependent memory and long-term
      potentiation (LTP) at CA1 Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses. It is therefore
      surprising that exogenously applied DA has little effect on SC synapses, but
      suppresses CA1 perforant path (PP) inputs. To examine DA actions under more
      physiological conditions, we used optogenetics to release DA from ventral
      tegmental area inputs to hippocampus. Unlike exogenous DA application,
      optogenetic release of DA caused a bidirectional, activity-dependent modulation
      of SC synapses, with no effect on PP inputs. Low levels of DA release, simulating
      tonic DA neuron firing, depressed the SC response through a D4 receptor-dependent
      enhancement of feedforward inhibition mediated by parvalbumin-expressing
      interneurons. Higher levels of DA release, simulating phasic firing, increased SC
      responses through a D1 receptor-dependent enhancement of excitatory transmission.
      Thus, tonic-phasic transitions in DA neuron firing in response to motivational
      demands may cause a modulatory switch from inhibition to enhancement of
      hippocampal information flow.

TI  - Distinct recurrent versus afferent dynamics in cortical visual processing.
PG  - 1789-97
LID - 10.1038/nn.4153 [doi]
AB  - How intracortical recurrent circuits in mammalian sensory cortex influence
      dynamics of sensory representation is not understood. Previous methods could not 
      distinguish the relative contributions of recurrent circuits and thalamic
      afferents to cortical dynamics. We accomplish this by optogenetically
      manipulating thalamus and cortex. Over the initial 40 ms of visual stimulation,
      excitation from recurrent circuits in visual cortex progressively increased to
      exceed direct thalamocortical excitation. Even when recurrent excitation exceeded
      thalamic excitation, upon silencing thalamus, sensory-evoked activity in cortex
      decayed rapidly, with a time constant of 10 ms, which is similar to a neuron's
      integration time window. In awake mice, this cortical decay function predicted
      the time-locking of cortical activity to thalamic input at frequencies <15 Hz and
      attenuation of the cortical response to higher frequencies. Under anesthesia,
      depression at thalamocortical synapses disrupted the fidelity of sensory
      transmission. Thus, we determine dynamics intrinsic to cortical recurrent
      circuits that transform afferent input in time.

AB  - Bayesian theories of neural coding propose that sensory uncertainty is
      represented by a probability distribution encoded in neural population activity, 
      but direct neural evidence supporting this hypothesis is currently lacking. Using
      fMRI in combination with a generative model-based analysis, we found that
      probability distributions reflecting sensory uncertainty could reliably be

TI  - GDF10 is a signal for axonal sprouting and functional recovery after stroke.
PG  - 1737-45
LID - 10.1038/nn.4146 [doi]
AB  - Stroke produces a limited process of neural repair. Axonal sprouting in cortex
      adjacent to the infarct is part of this recovery process, but the signal that
      initiates axonal sprouting is not known. Growth and differentiation factor 10
      (GDF10) is induced in peri-infarct neurons in mice, non-human primates and
      humans. GDF10 promotes axonal outgrowth in vitro in mouse, rat and human neurons 
      through TGFbetaRI and TGFbetaRII signaling. Using pharmacogenetic gain- and
      loss-of-function studies, we found that GDF10 produced axonal sprouting and
      enhanced functional recovery after stroke; knocking down GDF10 blocked axonal
      sprouting and reduced recovery. RNA sequencing from peri-infarct cortical neurons
      revealed that GDF10 downregulated PTEN, upregulated PI3 kinase signaling and
      induced specific axonal guidance molecules. Using unsupervised genome-wide
      association analysis of the GDF10 transcriptome, we found that it was not related
      to neurodevelopment, but may partially overlap with other CNS injury patterns.
      Thus, GDF10 is a stroke-induced signal for axonal sprouting and functional
      recovery.

TI  - Trajectory events across hippocampal place cells require previous experience.
PG  - 1772-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4151 [doi]
AB  - Replay of hippocampal place cell sequences has been proposed as a fundamental
      mechanism of learning and memory. However, the standard interpretation of replay 
      has been challenged by reports that similar activity is observed before
      experience ('preplay'). By the preplay account, pre-existing temporal sequences
      are mapped onto new experiences without learning sequential structure. Here we
      employed high density recording methods to monitor hundreds of place cells
      simultaneously while rats explored multiple novel environments. While we observed
      large numbers of synchronous spiking events before experience, they were not
      temporally correlated with subsequent experience. Multiple measures
      differentiated pre-experience and postexperience events that, taken together,
      defined the latter but not the former as trajectory-depicting. The formation of
      events with these properties was prevented by administration of an NMDA-receptor 
      antagonist during experience. These results suggest that the sequential structure
      of behavioral episodes is encoded during experience and reexpressed as trajectory
      events.

AB  - Decades of detailed anatomical tracer studies in non-human animals point to a
      rich and complex organization of long-range white matter connections in the
      brain. State-of-the art in vivo imaging techniques are striving to achieve a
      similar level of detail in humans, but multiple technical factors can limit their
      sensitivity and fidelity. In this review, we mostly focus on magnetic resonance
      imaging of the brain. We highlight some of the key challenges in analyzing and
      interpreting in vivo connectomics data, particularly in relation to what is known
      from classical neuroanatomy in laboratory animals. We further illustrate that,
      despite the challenges, in vivo imaging methods can be very powerful and provide 
      information on connections that is not available by any other means.

TI  - Do glia drive synaptic and cognitive impairment in disease?
PG  - 1539-1545
LID - 10.1038/nn.4142 [doi]
AB  - Synaptic dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric
      brain disorders, yet we know little about the mechanisms that underlie synaptic
      vulnerability. Although neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis are prominent in
      virtually every CNS disease, glia are largely viewed as passive responders to
      neuronal damage rather than drivers of synaptic dysfunction. This perspective is 
      changing with the growing realization that glia actively signal with neurons and 
      influence synaptic development, transmission and plasticity through an array of
      secreted and contact-dependent signals. We propose that disruptions in
      neuron-glia signaling contribute to synaptic and cognitive impairment in disease.
      Illuminating the mechanisms by which glia influence synapse function may lead to 
      the development of new therapies and biomarkers for synaptic dysfunction.

TI  - Reward expectation differentially modulates attentional behavior and activity in 
      visual area V4.
PG  - 1656-63
LID - 10.1038/nn.4141 [doi]
AB  - Neural activity in visual area V4 is enhanced when attention is directed into
      neuronal receptive fields. However, the source of this enhancement is unclear, as
      most physiological studies have manipulated attention by changing the absolute
      reward associated with a particular location as well as its value relative to
      other locations. We trained monkeys to discriminate the orientation of two
      stimuli presented simultaneously in different hemifields while we independently
      varied the reward magnitude associated with correct discrimination at each
      location. Behavioral measures of attention were controlled by the relative value 
      of each location. By contrast, neurons in V4 were consistently modulated by
      absolute reward value, exhibiting increased activity, increased gamma-band power 
      and decreased trial-to-trial variability whenever receptive field locations were 
      associated with large rewards. These data challenge the notion that the
      perceptual benefits of spatial attention rely on increased signal-to-noise in V4.
      Instead, these benefits likely derive from downstream selection mechanisms.

PG  - 1568-70
LID - 10.1038/nn.4139 [doi]
AB  - The amygdala is important for face processing, and direction of eye gaze is one
      of the most socially salient facial signals. Recording from over 200 neurons in
      the amygdala of neurosurgical patients, we found robust encoding of the identity 
      of neutral-expression faces, but not of their direction of gaze. Processing of
      gaze direction may rely on a predominantly cortical network rather than the
      amygdala.

TI  - Anchoring and synaptic stability of PSD-95 is driven by ephrin-B3.

AB  - Organization of signaling complexes at excitatory synapses by membrane-associated
      guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins regulates synapse development, plasticity,
      senescence and disease. Post-translational modification of MAGUK family proteins 
      can drive their membrane localization, yet it is unclear how these intracellular 
      proteins are targeted to sites of synaptic contact. Here we show using
      super-resolution imaging, biochemical approaches and in vivo models that the
      trans-synaptic organizing protein ephrin-B3 controls the synaptic localization
      and stability of PSD-95 and links these events to changes in neuronal activity
      via negative regulation of a newly identified mitogen-associated protein kinase
      (MAPK)-dependent phosphorylation site on ephrin-B3, Ser332. Unphosphorylated
      ephrin-B3 was enriched at synapses, and interacted directly with and stabilized
      PSD-95 at synapses. Activity-induced phosphorylation of Ser332 dispersed
      ephrin-B3 from synapses, prevented the interaction with PSD-95 and enhanced the
      turnover of PSD-95. Thus, ephrin-B3 specifies the synaptic localization of PSD-95
      and likely links the synaptic stability of PSD-95 to changes in neuronal
      activity.

TI  - Memory hierarchies map onto the hippocampal long axis in humans.
PG  - 1562-4
LID - 10.1038/nn.4138 [doi]
AB  - Memories, similar to the internal representation of space, can be recalled at
      different resolutions ranging from detailed events to more comprehensive,
      multi-event narratives. Single-cell recordings in rodents have suggested that
      different spatial scales are represented as a gradient along the hippocampal
      axis. We found that a similar organization holds for human episodic memory:
      memory representations systematically vary in scale along the hippocampal long
      axis, which may enable the formation of mnemonic hierarchies.

      The authors found that individuals with anorexia nervosa, who make maladaptive
      food choices to the point of starvation, engaged the dorsal striatum more than
      healthy controls when making choices about what to eat, and that activity in
      fronto-striatal circuits was correlated with their actual food consumption in a

TI  - Rescue of long-range circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease models.
PG  - 1623-30
LID - 10.1038/nn.4137 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with defects of synaptic connectivity.
      Such defects may not be restricted to local neuronal interactions but may extend 
      to long-range brain activities, such as slow-wave oscillations that are
      particularly prominent during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and are
      important for integration of information across distant brain regions involved in
      memory consolidation. There is increasing evidence that sleep is often impaired
      in AD, but it is unclear whether this impairment is directly related to
      amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology. Here we demonstrate that slow-wave activity is
      severely altered in the neocortex, thalamus and hippocampus in mouse models of AD
      amyloidosis. Most notably, our results reveal an Abeta-dependent impairment of
      slow-wave propagation, which causes a breakdown of the characteristic long-range 
      coherence of slow-wave activity. The finding that the impairment can be rescued
      by enhancing GABAAergic inhibition identifies a synaptic mechanism underlying
      Abeta-dependent large-scale circuit dysfunction.

AB  - Information processing in neocortical circuits requires integrating inputs over a
      wide range of spatial scales, from local microcircuits to long-range cortical and
      subcortical connections. We used rabies virus-based trans-synaptic tracing to
      analyze the laminar distribution of local and long-range inputs to pyramidal
      neurons in the mouse barrel cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In barrel
      cortex, we found substantial inputs from layer 3 (L3) to L6, prevalent
      translaminar inhibitory inputs, and long-range inputs to L2/3 or L5/6
      preferentially from L2/3 or L5/6 of input cortical areas, respectively. These
      layer-specific input patterns were largely independent of NMDA receptor function 
      in the recipient neurons. mPFC L5 received proportionally more long-range inputs 
      and more local inhibitory inputs than barrel cortex L5. Our results provide new
      insight into the organization and development of neocortical networks and
      identify important differences in the circuit organization in sensory and
      association cortices.

TI  - Basal forebrain circuit for sleep-wake control.
PG  - 1641-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4143 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian basal forebrain (BF) has important roles in controlling sleep and
      wakefulness, but the underlying neural circuit remains poorly understood. We
      examined the BF circuit by recording and optogenetically perturbing the activity 
      of four genetically defined cell types across sleep-wake cycles and by
      comprehensively mapping their synaptic connections. Recordings from
      channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-tagged neurons revealed that three BF cell types,
      cholinergic, glutamatergic and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic neurons, were
      more active during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (wake/REM
      active) than during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and activation of each cell type
      rapidly induced wakefulness. By contrast, activation of somatostatin-positive
      (SOM+) GABAergic neurons promoted NREM sleep, although only some of them were
      NREM active. Synaptically, the wake-promoting neurons were organized
      hierarchically by glutamatergic-->cholinergic-->PV+ neuron excitatory
      connections, and they all received inhibition from SOM+ neurons. Together, these 
      findings reveal the basic organization of the BF circuit for sleep-wake control.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically collapse data from
      many subjects, but brain functional organization varies between individuals. Here
      we establish that this individual variability is both robust and reliable, using 
      data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that functional
      connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately identify
      subjects from a large group. Identification was successful across scan sessions
      and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's
      connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that individual
      regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. Characteristic
      connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the
      frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show that
      connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same networks
      that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive of
      cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about
      single subjects on the basis of functional connectivity fMRI.

TI  - Depletion of microglia and inhibition of exosome synthesis halt tau propagation.
PG  - 1584-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4132 [doi]
AB  - Accumulation of pathological tau protein is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's
      disease. Tau protein spreads from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal region
      early in the disease. Microglia, the primary phagocytes in the brain, are
      positively correlated with tau pathology, but their involvement in tau
      propagation is unknown. We developed an adeno-associated virus-based model
      exhibiting rapid tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus 
      in 4 weeks. We found that depleting microglia dramatically suppressed the
      propagation of tau and reduced excitability in the dentate gyrus in this mouse
      model. Moreover, we demonstrate that microglia spread tau via exosome secretion, 
      and inhibiting exosome synthesis significantly reduced tau propagation in vitro
      and in vivo. These data suggest that microglia and exosomes contribute to the
      progression of tauopathy and that the exosome secretion pathway may be a
      therapeutic target.

TI  - Perceptual learning in autism: over-specificity and possible remedies.
PG  - 1574-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4129 [doi]
AB  - Inflexible behavior is a core characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
      but its underlying cause is unknown. Using a perceptual learning protocol, we
      observed initially efficient learning in ASD that was followed by anomalously
      poor learning when the location of the target was changed (over-specificity).
      Reducing stimulus repetition eliminated over-specificity. Our results indicate
      that inflexible behavior may be evident ubiquitously in ASD, even in sensory
      learning, but can be circumvented by specifically designed stimulation protocols.

PG  - 1648-55
LID - 10.1038/nn.4128 [doi]
AB  - Identical sensory inputs can be perceived as markedly different when embedded in 
      distinct contexts. Neural responses to simple stimuli are also modulated by
      context, but the contribution of this modulation to the processing of natural
      sensory input is unclear. We measured surround suppression, a quintessential
      contextual influence, in macaque primary visual cortex with natural images. We
      found that suppression strength varied substantially for different images. This
      variability was not well explained by existing descriptions of surround
      suppression, but it was predicted by Bayesian inference about statistical
      dependencies in images. In this framework, surround suppression was flexible: it 
      was recruited when the image was inferred to contain redundancies and
      substantially reduced in strength otherwise. Thus, our results reveal a gating of
      a basic, widespread cortical computation by inference about the statistics of
      natural input.

PG  - 1672-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4130 [doi]
AB  - The human brain's executive systems have a vital role in deciding and selecting
      among actions. Selection among alternatives also occurs in the perceptual domain;
      for instance, when perception switches between interpretations during perceptual 
      bistability. Whether executive systems also underlie this functionality remains
      debated, with known fronto-parietal concomitants of perceptual switches being
      variously interpreted as reflecting the switches' cause or as reflecting their
      consequences. We developed a procedure in which the two eyes receive different
      inputs and perception demonstrably switches between these inputs, yet the
      switches themselves are so inconspicuous as to become unreportable, minimizing
      their executive consequences. Fronto-parietal fMRI BOLD responses that
      accompanied perceptual switches were similarly minimized in this procedure,
      indicating that these reflect the switches' consequences rather than their cause.
      We conclude that perceptual switches do not always rely on executive brain areas 
      and that processes responsible for selection among alternatives may operate
      outside the brain's executive systems.

TI  - Human mutant huntingtin disrupts vocal learning in transgenic songbirds.
PG  - 1617-22
LID - 10.1038/nn.4133 [doi]
AB  - Speech and vocal impairments characterize many neurological disorders. However,
      the neurogenetic mechanisms of these disorders are not well understood, and
      current animal models do not have the necessary circuitry to recapitulate vocal
      learning deficits. We developed germline transgenic songbirds, zebra finches
      (Taneiopygia guttata) expressing human mutant huntingtin (mHTT), a protein
      responsible for the progressive deterioration of motor and cognitive function in 
      Huntington's disease (HD). Although generally healthy, the mutant songbirds had
      severe vocal disorders, including poor vocal imitation, stuttering, and
      progressive syntax and syllable degradation. Their song abnormalities were
      associated with HD-related neuropathology and dysfunction of the cortical-basal
      ganglia (CBG) song circuit. These transgenics are, to the best of our knowledge, 
      the first experimentally created, functional mutant songbirds. Their progressive 
      and quantifiable vocal disorder, combined with circuit dysfunction in the CBG
      song system, offers a model for genetic manipulation and the development of
      therapeutic strategies for CBG-related vocal and motor disorders.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between individual subjects' functional
      connectomes and 280 behavioral and demographic measures in a single holistic
      multivariate analysis relating imaging to non-imaging data from 461 subjects in
      the Human Connectome Project. We identified one strong mode of population
      co-variation: subjects were predominantly spread along a single
      'positive-negative' axis linking lifestyle, demographic and psychometric measures
      to each other and to a specific pattern of brain connectivity.

TI  - A direct translaminar inhibitory circuit tunes cortical output.
PG  - 1631-40
LID - 10.1038/nn.4123 [doi]
AB  - Anatomical and physiological experiments have outlined a blueprint for the
      feedforward flow of activity in cortical circuits: signals are thought to
      propagate primarily from the middle cortical layer (layer 4, L4) up to L2/3 and
      down to the major cortical output layer (L5). Pharmacological manipulations,
      however, have contested this model and have suggested that L4 may not be critical
      for sensory responses of neurons in either superficial or deep layers. To address
      these conflicting models, we reversibly manipulated L4 activity in awake,
      behaving mice using cell type-specific optogenetics. In contrast with both
      prevailing models, we found that activity in L4 directly suppressed L5, in part
      by activating deep, fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Our data suggest that the
      net effect of L4 activity is to sharpen the spatial representations of L5
      neurons. Thus, we establish a previously unknown translaminar inhibitory circuit 
      in the sensory cortex that acts to enhance the feature selectivity of cortical
      output.

AB  - We used a protein quantitative trait analysis in monocytes from 226 individuals
      to evaluate cross-talk between Alzheimer loci. The NME8 locus influenced PTK2B
      and the CD33 risk allele led to greater TREM2 expression. There was also a
      decreased TREM1/TREM2 ratio with a TREM1 risk allele, decreased TREM2 expression 
      with CD33 suppression and elevated cortical TREM2 mRNA expression with amyloid
      pathology.

TI  - Hierarchical nesting of slow oscillations, spindles and ripples in the human
      hippocampus during sleep.
PG  - 1679-1686
LID - 10.1038/nn.4119 [doi]
AB  - During systems-level consolidation, mnemonic representations initially reliant on
      the hippocampus are thought to migrate to neocortical sites for more permanent
      storage, with an eminent role of sleep for facilitating this information
      transfer. Mechanistically, consolidation processes have been hypothesized to rely
      on systematic interactions between the three cardinal neuronal oscillations
      characterizing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Under global control of de-
      and hyperpolarizing slow oscillations (SOs), sleep spindles may cluster
      hippocampal ripples for a precisely timed transfer of local information to the
      neocortex. We used direct intracranial electroencephalogram recordings from human
      epilepsy patients during natural sleep to test the assumption that SOs, spindles 
      and ripples are functionally coupled in the hippocampus. Employing
      cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that spindles were
      modulated by the up-state of SOs. Notably, spindles were found to in turn cluster
      ripples in their troughs, providing fine-tuned temporal frames for the
      hypothesized transfer of hippocampal memory traces.

TI  - Physical basis of apparent pore dilation of ATP-activated P2X receptor channels.
PG  - 1577-83
LID - 10.1038/nn.4120 [doi]
AB  - The selectivity of ion channels is fundamental for their roles in electrical and 
      chemical signaling and in ion homeostasis. Although most ion channels exhibit
      stable ion selectivity, the prevailing view of purinergic P2X receptor channels, 
      transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) channels and acid-sensing ion channels
      (ASICs) is that their ion conduction pores dilate upon prolonged activation. We
      investigated this mechanism in P2X receptors and found that the hallmark shift in
      equilibrium potential observed with prolonged channel activation does not result 
      from pore dilation, but from time-dependent alterations in the concentration of
      intracellular ions. We derived a physical model to calculate ion concentration
      changes during patch-clamp recordings, which validated our experimental findings 
      and provides a quantitative guideline for effectively controlling ion
      concentration. Our results have fundamental implications for understanding ion
      permeation and gating in P2X receptor channels, as well as more broadly for using
      patch-clamp techniques to study ion channels and neuronal excitability.

TI  - 5-HT1A receptors on mature dentate gyrus granule cells are critical for the
      antidepressant response.
PG  - 1606-16
LID - 10.1038/nn.4116 [doi]
AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used antidepressants, 
      but the mechanisms by which they influence behavior are only partially resolved. 
      Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for some of the responses to SSRIs,
      but it is not known whether mature dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) also
      contribute. We deleted the serotonin 1A receptor (5HT1AR, a receptor required for
      the SSRI response) specifically from DG GCs and found that the effects of the
      SSRI fluoxetine on behavior and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
      were abolished. By contrast, mice lacking 5HT1ARs only in young adult-born GCs
      (abGCs) showed normal fluoxetine responses. Notably, 5HT1AR-deficient mice
      engineered to express functional 5HT1ARs only in DG GCs responded to fluoxetine, 
      indicating that 5HT1ARs in DG GCs are sufficient to mediate an antidepressant
      response. Taken together, these data indicate that both mature DG GCs and young
      abGCs must be engaged for an antidepressant response.

TI  - Persistence of Abeta seeds in APP null mouse brain.
PG  - 1559-61
LID - 10.1038/nn.4117 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral beta-amyloidosis is induced by inoculation of Abeta seeds into APP
      transgenic mice, but not into App(-/-) (APP null) mice. We found that brain
      extracts from APP null mice that had been inoculated with Abeta seeds up to 6
      months previously still induced beta-amyloidosis in APP transgenic hosts
      following secondary transmission. Thus, Abeta seeds can persist in the brain for 
      months, and they regain propagative and pathogenic activity in the presence of
      host Abeta.

AB  - The developing human brain is shaped by environmental exposures--for better or
      worse. Many exposures relevant to mental health are genuinely social in nature or
      believed to have social subcomponents, even those related to more complex
      societal or area-level influences. The nature of how these social experiences are
      embedded into the environment may be crucial. Here we review select neuroscience 
      evidence on the neural correlates of adverse and protective social exposures in
      their environmental context, focusing on human neuroimaging data and supporting
      cellular and molecular studies in laboratory animals. We also propose the
      inclusion of innovative methods in social neuroscience research that may provide 
      new and ecologically more valid insight into the social-environmental risk
      architecture of the human brain.

PG  - 1413-20

AB  - Sex differences in stress responses can be found at all stages of life and are
      related to both the organizational and activational effects of gonadal hormones
      and to genes on the sex chromosomes. As stress dysregulation is the most common
      feature across neuropsychiatric diseases, sex differences in how these pathways
      develop and mature may predict sex-specific periods of vulnerability to
      disruption and increased disease risk or resilience across the lifespan. The
      aging brain is also at risk to the effects of stress, where the rapid decline of 
      gonadal hormones in women combined with cellular aging processes promote sex
      biases in stress dysregulation. In this Review, we discuss potential underlying
      mechanisms driving sex differences in stress responses and their relevance to
      disease. Although stress is involved in a much broader range of diseases than
      neuropsychiatric ones, we highlight here this area and its examples across the
      lifespan.

TI  - Stress effects on the neural substrates of motivated behavior.
PG  - 1405-12
LID - 10.1038/nn.4114 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to stress has profound, but complex, actions on motivated behavior and
      decision-making. These effects are central to core symptoms of a number of
      psychiatric disorders that are precipitated or augmented by stress, such as
      depressive disorders and substance use disorders. Studying the neural substrates 
      of stress's effects on motivation has revealed that stress affects multiple
      targets on circuits throughout the brain using diverse molecular signaling
      processes. Moreover, stress does not have unitary effects on motivated behavior, 
      but differences in the intensity, duration, intermittency, controllability and
      nature of the stressor produce qualitatively and quantitatively different
      behavioral endpoints. Unsurprisingly, the results of neuroscientific
      investigations into stress and motivation often open more questions than they
      resolve. Here we discuss contemporary results pertaining to the neural mechanisms
      by which stress alters motivation, identify points of contention and highlight
      integrative areas for continuing research into these multifaceted complexities.

TI  - Resolving the neural circuits of anxiety.
PG  - 1394-404
LID - 10.1038/nn.4101 [doi]
AB  - Although anxiety disorders represent a major societal problem demanding new
      therapeutic targets, these efforts have languished in the absence of a
      mechanistic understanding of this subjective emotional state. While it is
      impossible to know with certainty the subjective experience of a rodent, rodent
      models hold promise in dissecting well-conserved limbic circuits. The application
      of modern approaches in neuroscience has already begun to unmask the neural
      circuit intricacies underlying anxiety by allowing direct examination of
      hypotheses drawn from existing psychological concepts. This information points
      toward an updated conceptual model for what neural circuit perturbations could
      give rise to pathological anxiety and thereby provides a roadmap for future
      therapeutic development.

TI  - Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression.
PG  - 1386-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4113 [doi]
AB  - Current diagnosis of depression is based solely on behavioral symptomatology. The
      available US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for depression have
      come from serendipitous discovery and are ineffective in nearly 30-50% of
      patients, which is thought to reflect a lack of specificity in targeting
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence has identified
      depression-related disruptions in a neuroimmune axis that interfaces the immune
      system and CNS to control behavior. This Review examines the evidence in patients
      and in animal models of depression that demonstrates how the peripheral immune
      system acts on the brain to alter an individual's response to stress, ultimately 
      contributing to their vulnerability to mood disorders.

TI  - Stress weakens prefrontal networks: molecular insults to higher cognition.
PG  - 1376-85
LID - 10.1038/nn.4087 [doi]
AB  - A variety of cognitive disorders are worsened by stress exposure and involve
      dysfunction of the newly evolved prefrontal cortex (PFC). Exposure to acute,
      uncontrollable stress increases catecholamine release in PFC, reducing neuronal
      firing and impairing cognitive abilities. High levels of noradrenergic
      alpha1-adrenoceptor and dopaminergic D1 receptor stimulation activate feedforward
      calcium-protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling, which open
      potassium channels to weaken synaptic efficacy in spines. In contrast, high
      levels of catecholamines strengthen the primary sensory cortices, amygdala and
      striatum, rapidly flipping the brain from reflective to reflexive control of
      behavior. These mechanisms are exaggerated by chronic stress exposure, where
      architectural changes lead to persistent loss of PFC function. Understanding
      these mechanisms has led to the successful translation of prazosin and guanfacine
      for treating stress-related disorders. Dysregulation of stress signaling pathways
      by genetic insults likely contributes to PFC deficits in schizophrenia, while
      age-related insults initiate interacting vicious cycles that increase
      vulnerability to Alzheimer's degeneration.

PG  - 1364-75
LID - 10.1038/nn.4115 [doi]
AB  - The fact that exposure to severe stress leads to the development of psychiatric
      disorders serves as the basic rationale for animal models of stress disorders.
      Clinical and neuroimaging studies have shown that three brain areas involved in
      learning and memory--the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex--undergo
      distinct structural and functional changes in individuals with stress disorders. 
      These findings from patient studies pose several challenges for animal models of 
      stress disorders. For instance, why does stress impair cognitive function, yet
      enhance fear and anxiety? Can the same stressful experience elicit contrasting
      patterns of plasticity in the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex? How
      does even a brief exposure to traumatic stress lead to long-lasting behavioral
      abnormalities? Thus, animal models of stress disorders must not only capture the 
      unique spatio-temporal features of structural and functional alterations in these
      brain areas, but must also provide insights into the underlying neuronal
      plasticity mechanisms. This Review will address some of these key questions by
      describing findings from animal models on how stress-induced plasticity varies
      across different brain regions and thereby gives rise to the debilitating
      emotional and cognitive symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders.

AB  - The brain is the central organ involved in perceiving and adapting to social and 
      physical stressors via multiple interacting mediators, from the cell surface to
      the cytoskeleton to epigenetic regulation and nongenomic mechanisms. A key result
      of stress is structural remodeling of neural architecture, which may be a sign of
      successful adaptation, whereas persistence of these changes when stress ends
      indicates failed resilience. Excitatory amino acids and glucocorticoids have key 
      roles in these processes, along with a growing list of extra- and intracellular
      mediators that includes endocannabinoids and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF). The result is a continually changing pattern of gene expression mediated 
      by epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications and CpG methylation and 
      hydroxymethylation as well as by the activity of retrotransposons that may alter 
      genomic stability. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and
      vulnerability of the brain provides a basis for understanding the efficacy of
      interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders as well as age-related
      cognitive decline.

AB  - In our ongoing efforts to advance understanding of human diseases, translational 
      research across rodents and humans on stress-related mental disorders stands out 
      as a field that is producing discoveries that illuminate mechanisms of risk and
      pathophysiology at a brisk rate. Here we offer a Perspective on how a productive 
      translational research dialog between preclinical models and clinical studies of 
      these disorders is being powered by an ever-developing appreciation of the shared
      neural circuits and genetic architecture that moderate the response to stress
      across species. Working from these deep foundations, we discuss the approaches,
      both traditional and innovative, that have the potential to deliver a new
      generation of risk biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for stress-related
      disorders.

TI  - ScaleS: an optical clearing palette for biological imaging.
PG  - 1518-29
LID - 10.1038/nn.4107 [doi]
AB  - Optical clearing methods facilitate deep biological imaging by mitigating light
      scattering in situ. Multi-scale high-resolution imaging requires preservation of 
      tissue integrity for accurate signal reconstruction. However, existing clearing
      reagents contain chemical components that could compromise tissue structure,
      preventing reproducible anatomical and fluorescence signal stability. We
      developed ScaleS, a sorbitol-based optical clearing method that provides stable
      tissue preservation for immunochemical labeling and three-dimensional (3D) signal
      rendering. ScaleS permitted optical reconstructions of aged and diseased brain in
      Alzheimer's disease models, including mapping of 3D networks of amyloid plaques, 
      neurons and microglia, and multi-scale tracking of single plaques by successive
      fluorescence and electron microscopy. Human clinical samples from Alzheimer's
      disease patients analyzed via reversible optical re-sectioning illuminated plaque
      pathogenesis in the z axis. Comparative benchmarking of contemporary clearing
      agents showed superior signal and structure preservation by ScaleS. These
      findings suggest that ScaleS is a simple and reproducible method for accurate
      visualization of biological tissue.

TI  - Basal forebrain neuronal inhibition enables rapid behavioral stopping.
PG  - 1501-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4110 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive inhibitory control, the ability to rapidly suppress responses
      inappropriate for the context, is essential for flexible and adaptive behavior.
      Although most studies on inhibitory control have focused on the
      fronto-basal-ganglia circuit, we found that rapid behavioral stopping is enabled 
      by neuronal inhibition in the basal forebrain (BF). In rats performing the stop
      signal task, putative noncholinergic BF neurons with phasic bursting responses to
      the go signal were nearly completely inhibited by the stop signal. The onset of
      BF neuronal inhibition was tightly coupled with and temporally preceded the
      latency to stop, the stop signal reaction time. Artificial inhibition of BF
      activity in the absence of the stop signal was sufficient to reproduce rapid
      behavioral stopping. These results reveal a previously unknown subcortical
      mechanism of rapid inhibitory control by the BF, which provides bidirectional
      control over the speed of response generation and inhibition.

TI  - A Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding can explain
      'anti-Bayesian' percepts.
PG  - 1509-17
LID - 10.1038/nn.4105 [doi]
AB  - Bayesian observer models provide a principled account of the fact that our
      perception of the world rarely matches physical reality. The standard explanation
      is that our percepts are biased toward our prior beliefs. However, reported
      psychophysical data suggest that this view may be simplistic. We propose a new
      model formulation based on efficient coding that is fully specified for any given
      natural stimulus distribution. The model makes two new and seemingly
      anti-Bayesian predictions. First, it predicts that perception is often biased
      away from an observer's prior beliefs. Second, it predicts that stimulus
      uncertainty differentially affects perceptual bias depending on whether the
      uncertainty is induced by internal or external noise. We found that both model
      predictions match reported perceptual biases in perceived visual orientation and 
      spatial frequency, and were able to explain data that have not been explained
      before. The model is general and should prove applicable to other perceptual
      variables and tasks.

      increased levels of anxiety and fear generalization. The neuronal mechanisms
      underlying such maladaptive behavioral changes, however, are poorly understood.
      Here, using a combination of behavioral, physiological and optogenetic approaches
      in mouse, we identify a specific subpopulation of central amygdala neurons
      expressing protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) as key elements of the neuronal
      circuitry controlling anxiety. Moreover, we show that aversive experiences induce
      anxiety and fear generalization by regulating the activity of PKCdelta(+) neurons
      via extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by alpha5 subunit-containing GABAA
      receptors. Our findings reveal that the neuronal circuits that mediate fear and
      anxiety overlap at the level of defined subpopulations of central amygdala
      neurons and demonstrate that persistent changes in the excitability of a single
      cell type can orchestrate complex behavioral changes.

AB  - The mammalian olfactory system uses a large family of odorant receptors (ORs) to 
      detect and discriminate amongst a myriad of volatile odor molecules.
      Understanding odor coding requires comprehensive mapping between ORs and
      corresponding odors. We developed a means of high-throughput in vivo
      identification of OR repertoires responding to odorants using phosphorylated
      ribosome immunoprecipitation of mRNA from olfactory epithelium of odor-stimulated
      mice followed by RNA-Seq. This approach screened the endogenously expressed ORs
      against an odor in one set of experiments using awake and freely behaving mice.
      In combination with validations in a heterologous system, we identified sets of
      ORs for two odorants, acetophenone and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline
      (TMT), encompassing 69 OR-odorant pairs. We also identified shared amino acid
      residues specific to the acetophenone or TMT receptors and developed models to
      predict receptor activation by acetophenone. Our results provide a method for
      understanding the combinatorial coding of odors in vivo.

AB  - In mammals, olfactory perception is based on the combinatorial activation of G
      protein-coupled receptors. Identifying the full repertoire of receptors activated
      by a given odorant in vivo, a quest that has been hampered for over 20 years by
      technical difficulties, would represent an important step in deciphering the
      rules governing chemoperception. We found that odorants induced a fast and
      reversible concentration-dependent decrease in the transcription of genes
      corresponding to activated receptors in intact mice. On the basis of this
      finding, we developed a large-scale transcriptomic approach to uncover
      receptor-ligand pairs in vivo. We identified the mouse and rat odorant receptor
      signatures corresponding to specific odorants. Finally, we found that this
      approach, which can be used for species for which no genomic sequence is
      available, is also applicable to non-vertebrate species such as Drosophila.

TI  - Centrosomin represses dendrite branching by orienting microtubule nucleation.
PG  - 1437-45
LID - 10.1038/nn.4099 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal dendrite branching is fundamental for building nervous systems. Branch
      formation is genetically encoded by transcriptional programs to create dendrite
      arbor morphological diversity for complex neuronal functions. In Drosophila
      sensory neurons, the transcription factor Abrupt represses branching via an
      unknown effector pathway. Targeted screening for branching-control effectors
      identified Centrosomin, the primary centrosome-associated protein for mitotic
      spindle maturation. Centrosomin repressed dendrite branch formation and was used 
      by Abrupt to simplify arbor branching. Live imaging revealed that Centrosomin
      localized to the Golgi cis face and that it recruited microtubule nucleation to
      Golgi outposts for net retrograde microtubule polymerization away from nascent
      dendrite branches. Removal of Centrosomin enabled the engagement of wee Augmin
      activity to promote anterograde microtubule growth into the nascent branches,
      leading to increased branching. The findings reveal that polarized targeting of
      Centrosomin to Golgi outposts during elaboration of the dendrite arbor creates a 
      local system for guiding microtubule polymerization.

TI  - BET protein Brd4 activates transcription in neurons and BET inhibitor Jq1 blocks 
      memory in mice.
PG  - 1464-73
LID - 10.1038/nn.4095 [doi]
AB  - Precise regulation of transcription is crucial for the cellular mechanisms
      underlying memory formation. However, the link between neuronal stimulation and
      the proteins that directly interact with histone modifications to activate
      transcription in neurons remains unclear. Brd4 is a member of the bromodomain and
      extra-terminal domain (BET) protein family, which binds acetylated histones and
      is a critical regulator of transcription in many cell types, including
      transcription in response to external cues. Small molecule BET inhibitors are in 
      clinical trials, yet almost nothing is known about Brd4 function in the brain.
      Here we show that Brd4 mediates the transcriptional regulation underlying
      learning and memory. The loss of Brd4 function affects critical synaptic
      proteins, which results in memory deficits in mice but also decreases seizure
      susceptibility. Thus Brd4 provides a critical link between neuronal activation
      and the transcriptional responses that occur during memory formation.

TI  - Coordinated forms of noradrenergic plasticity in the locus coeruleus and primary 
      auditory cortex.
PG  - 1483-92

AB  - The cerebral cortex is plastic and represents the world according to the
      significance of sensory stimuli. However, cortical networks are embodied in
      complex circuits, including neuromodulatory systems such as the noradrenergic
      locus coeruleus, providing information about internal state and behavioral
      relevance. Although norepinephrine is important for cortical plasticity, it is
      unknown how modulatory neurons themselves respond to changes of sensory input. We
      examined how locus coeruleus neurons are modified by experience and the
      consequences of locus coeruleus plasticity for cortical representations and
      sensory perception. We made whole-cell recordings from rat locus coeruleus and
      primary auditory cortex (A1), pairing sounds with locus coeruleus activation.
      Although initially unresponsive, locus coeruleus neurons developed and maintained
      auditory responses afterwards. Locus coeruleus plasticity induced changes in A1
      responses lasting at least hours and improved auditory perception for days to
      weeks. Our results demonstrate that locus coeruleus is highly plastic, leading to
      substantial changes in regulation of brain state by norepinephrine.

TI  - Neuronal pattern separation in the olfactory bulb improves odor discrimination
      learning.
PG  - 1474-1482
LID - 10.1038/nn.4089 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal pattern separation is thought to enable the brain to disambiguate
      sensory stimuli with overlapping features, thereby extracting valuable
      information. In the olfactory system, it remains unknown whether pattern
      separation acts as a driving force for sensory discrimination and the learning
      thereof. We found that overlapping odor-evoked input patterns to the mouse
      olfactory bulb (OB) were dynamically reformatted in the network on the timescale 
      of a single breath, giving rise to separated patterns of activity in an ensemble 
      of output neurons, mitral/tufted (M/T) cells. Notably, the extent of pattern
      separation in M/T assemblies predicted behavioral discrimination performance
      during the learning phase. Furthermore, exciting or inhibiting GABAergic OB
      interneurons, using optogenetics or pharmacogenetics, altered pattern separation 
      and thereby odor discrimination learning in a bidirectional way. In conclusion,
      we propose that the OB network can act as a pattern separator facilitating
      olfactory stimulus distinction, a process that is sculpted by synaptic
      inhibition.

      transport defects to FTD/ALS.
PG  - 1226-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.4085 [doi]
AB  - C9orf72 mutations are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs)
      produced by unconventional translation of the C9orf72 repeat expansions cause
      neurodegeneration in cell culture and in animal models. We performed two unbiased
      screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified potent modifiers of DPR
      toxicity, including karyopherins and effectors of Ran-mediated nucleocytoplasmic 
      transport, providing insight into potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic
      targets.

TI  - Optogenetics: 10 years of microbial opsins in neuroscience.
PG  - 1213-25
LID - 10.1038/nn.4091 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 10 years, the development and convergence of microbial opsin
      engineering, modular genetic methods for cell-type targeting and optical
      strategies for guiding light through tissue have enabled versatile optical
      control of defined cells in living systems, defining modern optogenetics. Despite
      widespread recognition of the importance of spatiotemporally precise causal
      control over cellular signaling, for nearly the first half (2005-2009) of this
      10-year period, as optogenetics was being created, there were difficulties in
      implementation, few publications and limited biological findings. In contrast,
      the ensuing years have witnessed a substantial acceleration in the application
      domain, with the publication of thousands of discoveries and insights into the
      function of nervous systems and beyond. This Historical Commentary reflects on
      the scientific landscape of this decade-long transition.

AB  - Over the last 10 years, optogenetics has become widespread in neuroscience for
      the study of how specific cell types contribute to brain functions and brain
      disorder states. The full impact of optogenetics will emerge only when other
      toolsets mature, including neural connectivity and cell phenotyping tools and
      neural recording and imaging tools. The latter tools are rapidly improving, in
      part because optogenetics has helped galvanize broad interest in neurotechnology 
      development.

TI  - GABAergic mechanisms regulated by miR-33 encode state-dependent fear.
PG  - 1265-71
LID - 10.1038/nn.4084 [doi]
AB  - Fear-inducing memories can be state dependent, meaning that they can best be
      retrieved if the brain states at encoding and retrieval are similar. Restricted
      access to such memories can present a risk for psychiatric disorders and hamper
      their treatment. To better understand the mechanisms underlying state-dependent
      fear, we used a mouse model of contextual fear conditioning. We found that
      heightened activity of hippocampal extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, believed to
      impair fear and memory, actually enabled their state-dependent encoding and
      retrieval. This effect required protein kinase C-betaII and was influenced by
      miR-33, a microRNA that regulates several GABA-related proteins. In the extended 
      hippocampal circuit, extrasynaptic GABAA receptors promoted subcortical, but
      impaired cortical, activation during memory encoding of context fear. Moreover,
      suppression of retrosplenial cortical activity, which normally impairs retrieval,
      had an enhancing effect on the retrieval of state-dependent fear. These
      mechanisms can serve as treatment targets for managing access to state-dependent 
      memories of stressful experiences.

TI  - EAG2 potassium channel with evolutionarily conserved function as a brain tumor
      target.
PG  - 1236-46
LID - 10.1038/nn.4088 [doi]
AB  - Over 20% of the drugs for treating human diseases target ion channels, but no
      cancer drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is intended to 
      target an ion channel. We found that the EAG2 (Ether-a-go-go 2) potassium channel
      has an evolutionarily conserved function for promoting brain tumor growth and
      metastasis, delineate downstream pathways, and uncover a mechanism for different 
      potassium channels to functionally cooperate and regulate mitotic cell volume and
      tumor progression. EAG2 potassium channel was enriched at the trailing edge of
      migrating medulloblastoma (MB) cells to regulate local cell volume dynamics,
      thereby facilitating cell motility. We identified the FDA-approved antipsychotic 
      drug thioridazine as an EAG2 channel blocker that reduces xenografted MB growth
      and metastasis, and present a case report of repurposing thioridazine for
      treating a human patient. Our findings illustrate the potential of targeting ion 
      channels in cancer treatment.

TI  - Cell type-specific manipulation with GFP-dependent Cre recombinase.
PG  - 1334-41
LID - 10.1038/nn.4081 [doi]
AB  - There are many transgenic GFP reporter lines that allow the visualization of
      specific populations of cells. Using such lines for functional studies requires a
      method that transforms GFP into a molecule that enables genetic manipulation. We 
      developed a method that exploits GFP for gene manipulation, Cre recombinase
      dependent on GFP (CRE-DOG), a split component system that uses GFP and its
      derivatives to directly induce Cre/loxP recombination. Using plasmid
      electroporation and AAV viral vectors, we delivered CRE-DOG to multiple GFP mouse
      lines, which led to effective recombination selectively in GFP-labeled cells.
      Furthermore, CRE-DOG enabled optogenetic control of these neurons. Beyond
      providing a new set of tools for manipulation of gene expression selectively in
      GFP(+) cells, we found that GFP can be used to reconstitute the activity of a
      protein not known to have a modular structure, suggesting that this strategy
      might be applicable to a wide range of proteins.

TI  - Hippocampal circuit dysfunction in the Tc1 mouse model of Down syndrome.
PG  - 1291-1298
LID - 10.1038/nn.4072 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal pathology is likely to contribute to cognitive disability in Down
      syndrome, yet the neural network basis of this pathology and its contributions to
      different facets of cognitive impairment remain unclear. Here we report
      dysfunctional connectivity between dentate gyrus and CA3 networks in the
      transchromosomic Tc1 mouse model of Down syndrome, demonstrating that
      ultrastructural abnormalities and impaired short-term plasticity at dentate
      gyrus-CA3 excitatory synapses culminate in impaired coding of new spatial
      information in CA3 and CA1 and disrupted behavior in vivo. These results
      highlight the vulnerability of dentate gyrus-CA3 networks to aberrant human
      chromosome 21 gene expression and delineate hippocampal circuit abnormalities
      likely to contribute to distinct cognitive phenotypes in Down syndrome.

TI  - Learning to expect the unexpected: rapid updating in primate cerebellum during
      voluntary self-motion.
PG  - 1310-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4077 [doi]
AB  - There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum has a vital role in motor
      learning by constructing an estimate of the sensory consequences of movement.
      Theory suggests that this estimate is compared with the actual feedback to
      compute the sensory prediction error. However, direct proof for the existence of 
      this comparison is lacking. We carried out a trial-by-trial analysis of
      cerebellar neurons during the execution and adaptation of voluntary head
      movements and found that neuronal sensitivities dynamically tracked the
      comparison of predictive and feedback signals. When the relationship between the 
      motor command and resultant movement was altered, neurons robustly responded to
      sensory input as if the movement was externally generated. Neuronal sensitivities
      then declined with the same time course as the concurrent behavioral learning.
      These findings demonstrate the output of an elegant computation in which rapid
      updating of an internal model enables the motor system to learn to expect
      unexpected sensory inputs.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4082 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic adaptations in synaptic plasticity are critical for learning new motor
      skills and maintaining memory throughout life, which rapidly decline with
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Plasticity in the motor cortex is important for
      acquisition and maintenance of motor skills, but how the loss of dopamine in PD
      leads to disrupted structural and functional plasticity in the motor cortex is
      not well understood. Here we used mouse models of PD and two-photon imaging to
      show that dopamine depletion resulted in structural changes in the motor cortex. 
      We further discovered that dopamine D1 and D2 receptor signaling selectively and 
      distinctly regulated these aberrant changes in structural and functional
      plasticity. Our findings suggest that both D1 and D2 receptor signaling regulate 
      motor cortex plasticity, and loss of dopamine results in atypical synaptic
      adaptations that may contribute to the impairment of motor performance and motor 
      memory observed in PD.

LID - 10.1038/nn.4078 [doi]
AB  - Songbirds learn precisely sequenced motor skills (songs) subserved by distinct
      brain areas, including the premotor cortical analog HVC, which is essential for
      producing learned song, and a 'cortical'-basal ganglia loop required for song
      plasticity. Inputs from these nuclei converge in RA (robust nucleus of the
      arcopallium), making it a likely locus for song learning. However,
      activity-dependent synaptic plasticity has never been described in either input. 
      Using a slice preparation, we found that stimulation patterns based on
      singing-related activity were able to drive opposing changes in the strength of
      RA's inputs: when one input was potentiated, the other was depressed, with the
      direction and magnitude of changes depending on the relative timing of
      stimulation of the inputs. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations that blocked
      synaptic plasticity in vitro also prevented reinforcement-driven changes to song 
      in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the importance of precise timing in
      the basal ganglia-motor cortical interactions subserving adaptive motor skills.

AB  - Humans learn about people and objects through positive and negative experiences, 
      yet they can also look beyond the immediate reward of an interaction to encode
      trait-level attributes. We found that perceivers encoded both reward and
      trait-level information through feedback in an instrumental learning task, but
      relied more heavily on trait representations in cross-context decisions. Both
      learning types implicated ventral striatum, but trait learning also recruited a

TI  - Cellular evidence for efference copy in Drosophila visuomotor processing.
PG  - 1247-55
LID - 10.1038/nn.4083 [doi]
AB  - Each time a locomoting fly turns, the visual image sweeps over the retina and
      generates a motion stimulus. Classic behavioral experiments suggested that flies 
      use active neural-circuit mechanisms to suppress the perception of self-generated
      visual motion during intended turns. Direct electrophysiological evidence,
      however, has been lacking. We found that visual neurons in Drosophila receive
      motor-related inputs during rapid flight turns. These inputs arrived with a sign 
      and latency appropriate for suppressing each targeted cell's visual response to
      the turn. Precise measurements of behavioral and neuronal response latencies
      supported the idea that motor-related inputs to optic flow-processing cells
      represent internal predictions of the expected visual drive induced by voluntary 
      turns. Motor-related inputs to small object-selective visual neurons could
      reflect either proprioceptive feedback from the turn or internally generated
      signals. Our results in Drosophila echo the suppression of visual perception
      during rapid eye movements in primates, demonstrating common functional
      principles of sensorimotor processing across phyla.

      analysis.
PG  - 1325-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4070 [doi]
AB  - For degenerative disorders of the CNS, the main obstacle to therapeutic
      advancement has been the challenge of identifying the key molecular mechanisms
      underlying neuronal loss. We developed a combinatorial approach including
      translational profiling and brain regulatory network analysis to search for key
      determinants of neuronal survival or death. Following the generation of
      transgenic mice for cell type-specific profiling of midbrain dopaminergic
      neurons, we established and compared translatome libraries reflecting the
      molecular signature of these cells at baseline or under degenerative stress.
      Analysis of these libraries by interrogating a context-specific brain regulatory 
      network led to the identification of a repertoire of intrinsic upstream
      regulators that drive the dopaminergic stress response. The altered activity of
      these regulators was not associated with changes in their expression levels. This
      strategy can be generalized for the identification of molecular determinants
      involved in the degeneration of other classes of neurons.

      sharp-wave ripples.
PG  - 1281-1290
LID - 10.1038/nn.4074 [doi]
AB  - Sharp-wave ripples represent a prominent synchronous activity pattern in the
      mammalian hippocampus during sleep and immobility. GABAergic interneuronal types 
      are silenced or fire during these events, but the mechanism of pyramidal cell
      (PC) participation remains elusive. We found opposite membrane polarization of
      deep (closer to stratum oriens) and superficial (closer to stratum radiatum) rat 
      CA1 PCs during sharp-wave ripples. Using sharp and multi-site recordings in
      combination with neurochemical profiling, we observed a predominant inhibitory
      drive of deep calbindin (CB)-immunonegative PCs that contrasts with a prominent
      depolarization of superficial CB-immunopositive PCs. Biased contribution of
      perisomatic GABAergic inputs, together with suppression of CA2 PCs, may explain
      the selection of CA1 PCs during sharp-wave ripples. A deep-superficial gradient
      interacted with behavioral and spatial effects to determine cell participation
      during sleep and awake sharp-wave ripples in freely moving rats. Thus, the firing
      dynamics of hippocampal PCs are exquisitely controlled at subcellular and
      microcircuit levels in a cell type-selective manner.

AB  - Humans have a capacity for hierarchical cognitive control-the ability to
      simultaneously control immediate actions while holding more abstract goals in
      mind. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence suggests that hierarchical
      cognitive control emerges from a frontal architecture whereby prefrontal cortex
      coordinates neural activity in the motor cortices when abstract rules are needed 
      to govern motor outcomes. We utilized the improved temporal resolution of human
      intracranial electrocorticography to investigate the mechanisms by which frontal 
      cortical oscillatory networks communicate in support of hierarchical cognitive
      control. Responding according to progressively more abstract rules resulted in
      greater frontal network theta phase encoding (4-8 Hz) and increased prefrontal
      local neuronal population activity (high gamma amplitude, 80-150 Hz), which
      predicts trial-by-trial response times. Theta phase encoding coupled with high
      gamma amplitude during inter-regional information encoding, suggesting that
      inter-regional phase encoding is a mechanism for the dynamic instantiation of
      complex cognitive functions by frontal cortical subnetworks.

TI  - Coding the direct/indirect pathways by D1 and D2 receptors is not valid for
      accumbens projections.
PG  - 1230-2
LID - 10.1038/nn.4068 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted that D1 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal neurons
      convey their information directly to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia,
      whereas D2-expressing neurons do so indirectly via pallidal neurons. Combining
      optogenetics and electrophysiology, we found that this architecture does not
      apply to mouse nucleus accumbens projections to the ventral pallidum. Thus,
      current thinking attributing D1 and D2 selectivity to accumbens projections akin 
      to dorsal striatal pathways needs to be reconsidered.

TI  - LSD1n is an H4K20 demethylase regulating memory formation via transcriptional
      elongation control.
PG  - 1256-64
LID - 10.1038/nn.4069 [doi]
AB  - We found that a neuron-specific isoform of LSD1, LSD1n, which results from an
      alternative splicing event, acquires a new substrate specificity, targeting
      histone H4 Lys20 methylation, both in vitro and in vivo. Selective genetic
      ablation of LSD1n led to deficits in spatial learning and memory, revealing the
      functional importance of LSD1n in neuronal activity-regulated transcription that 
      is necessary for long-term memory formation. LSD1n occupied neuronal gene
      enhancers, promoters and transcribed coding regions, and was required for
      transcription initiation and elongation steps in response to neuronal activity,
      indicating the crucial role of H4K20 methylation in coordinating gene
      transcription with neuronal function. Our results indicate that this alternative 
      splicing of LSD1 in neurons, which was associated with altered substrate
      specificity, serves as a mechanism acquired by neurons to achieve more precise
      control of gene expression in the complex processes underlying learning and
      memory.

TI  - Automatic integration of confidence in the brain valuation signal.
PG  - 1159-67
LID - 10.1038/nn.4064 [doi]
AB  - A key process in decision-making is estimating the value of possible outcomes.
      Growing evidence suggests that different types of values are automatically
      encoded in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Here we extend this idea
      by suggesting that any overt judgment is accompanied by a second-order valuation 
      (a confidence estimate), which is also automatically incorporated in VMPFC
      activity. In accordance with the predictions of our normative model of rating
      tasks, two behavioral experiments showed that confidence levels were
      quadratically related to first-order judgments (age, value or probability
      ratings). The analysis of three functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets
      using similar rating tasks confirmed that the quadratic extension of first-order 
      ratings (our proxy for confidence) was encoded in VMPFC activity, even if no
      confidence judgment was required of the participants. Such an automatic
      aggregation of value and confidence in a same brain region might provide insight 
      into many distortions of judgment and choice.

      protein transgenic mice.
PG  - 1183-9

AB  - The microtubule-associated protein tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Reducing tau
      levels ameliorates AD-related synaptic, network, and behavioral abnormalities in 
      transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). We used mass
      spectrometry to characterize the post-translational modification of endogenous
      tau isolated from wild-type and hAPP mice. We identified seven types of tau
      modifications at 63 sites in wild-type mice. Wild-type and hAPP mice had similar 
      modifications, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal dysfunction in hAPP mice
      is enabled by physiological forms of tau. Our findings provide clear evidence for
      acetylation and ubiquitination of the same lysine residues; some sites were also 
      targeted by lysine methylation. Our findings refute the hypothesis of extensive
      O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of endogenous tau. The
      complex post-translational modification of physiological tau suggests that tau is
      regulated by diverse mechanisms.

TI  - The role of ventral striatal cAMP signaling in stress-induced behaviors.
PG  - 1094-100
LID - 10.1038/nn.4066 [doi]
AB  - The cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade is a
      ubiquitous pathway acting downstream of multiple neuromodulators. We found that
      the phosphorylation of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) by cyclin-dependent protein
      kinase 5 (Cdk5) facilitated cAMP degradation and homeostasis of cAMP/PKA
      signaling. In mice, loss of Cdk5 throughout the forebrain elevated cAMP levels
      and increased PKA activity in striatal neurons, and altered behavioral responses 
      to acute or chronic stressors. Ventral striatum- or D1 dopamine receptor-specific
      conditional knockout of Cdk5, or ventral striatum infusion of a small interfering
      peptide that selectively targeted the regulation of PDE4 by Cdk5, produced
      analogous effects on stress-induced behavioral responses. Together, our results
      demonstrate that altering cAMP signaling in medium spiny neurons of the ventral
      striatum can effectively modulate stress-induced behavioral states. We propose
      that targeting the Cdk5 regulation of PDE4 could be a new therapeutic approach
      for clinical conditions associated with stress, such as depression.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that defective RNA processing contributes to the
      development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This may be especially true
      for ALS caused by a repeat expansion in C9orf72 (c9ALS), in which the
      accumulation of RNA foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins are expected to modify RNA
      metabolism. We report extensive alternative splicing (AS) and alternative
      polyadenylation (APA) defects in the cerebellum of c9ALS subjects (8,224 AS and
      1,437 APA), including changes in ALS-associated genes (for example, ATXN2 and
      FUS), and in subjects with sporadic ALS (sALS; 2,229 AS and 716 APA).
      Furthermore, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNPH) and other
      RNA-binding proteins are predicted to be potential regulators of cassette exon AS
      events in both c9ALS and sALS. Co-expression and gene-association network
      analyses of gene expression and AS data revealed divergent pathways associated
      with c9ALS and sALS.

AB  - Feature-selective firing allows networks to produce representations of the
      external and internal environments. Despite its importance, the mechanisms
      generating neuronal feature selectivity are incompletely understood. In many
      cortical microcircuits the integration of two functionally distinct inputs occurs
      nonlinearly through generation of active dendritic signals that drive burst
      firing and robust plasticity. To examine the role of this processing in feature
      selectivity, we recorded CA1 pyramidal neuron membrane potential and local field 
      potential in mice running on a linear treadmill. We found that dendritic plateau 
      potentials were produced by an interaction between properly timed input from
      entorhinal cortex and hippocampal CA3. These conjunctive signals positively
      modulated the firing of previously established place fields and rapidly induced
      new place field formation to produce feature selectivity in CA1 that is a
      function of both entorhinal cortex and CA3 input. Such selectivity could allow
      mixed network level representations that support context-dependent spatial maps.

AB  - Despite major progress in identifying enhancer regions on a genome-wide scale,
      the majority of available data are limited to model organisms and human
      transformed cell lines. We have identified a robust set of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) 
      expressed in the human brain and constructed networks assessing eRNA-gene
      coexpression interactions across human fetal brain and multiple adult brain
      regions. Our data identify brain region-specific eRNAs and show that enhancer
      regions expressing eRNAs are enriched for genetic variants associated with autism
      spectrum disorders.

TI  - Learning enhances the relative impact of top-down processing in the visual
      cortex.
PG  - 1116-22
LID - 10.1038/nn.4061 [doi]
AB  - Theories have proposed that, in sensory cortices, learning can enhance top-down
      modulation by higher brain areas while reducing bottom-up sensory drives. To
      address circuit mechanisms underlying this process, we examined the activity of
      layer 2/3 (L2/3) excitatory neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) as
      well as L4 excitatory neurons, the main bottom-up source, and long-range top-down
      projections from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during associative learning over 
      days using chronic two-photon calcium imaging. During learning, L4 responses
      gradually weakened, whereas RSC inputs became stronger. Furthermore, L2/3
      acquired a ramp-up response temporal profile, potentially encoding the timing of 
      the associated event, which coincided with a similar change in RSC inputs.
      Learning also reduced the activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons 
      (SOM-INs) in V1 that could potentially gate top-down inputs. Finally, RSC
      inactivation or SOM-IN activation was sufficient to partially reverse the
      learning-induced changes in L2/3. Together, these results reveal a
      learning-dependent dynamic shift in the balance between bottom-up and top-down
      information streams and uncover a role of SOM-INs in controlling this process.

TI  - Identification of a Vav2-dependent mechanism for GDNF/Ret control of mesolimbic
      DAT trafficking.
PG  - 1084-93
LID - 10.1038/nn.4060 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine (DA) homeostasis is essential for a variety of brain activities.
      Dopamine transporter (DAT)-mediated DA reuptake is one of the most critical
      mechanisms for normal DA homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms
      underlying the regulation of DAT activity in the brain remain poorly understood. 
      Here we show that the Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein Vav2 
      is required for DAT cell surface expression and transporter activity modulated by
      glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its cognate receptor Ret. 
      Mice deficient in either Vav2 or Ret displayed elevated DAT activity, which was
      accompanied by an increase in intracellular DA selectively in the nucleus
      accumbens. Vav2(-/-) mice exposed to cocaine showed reduced DAT activity and
      diminished behavioral cocaine response. Our data demonstrate that Vav2 is a
      determinant of DAT trafficking in vivo and contributes to the maintenance of DA
      homeostasis in limbic DA neuron terminals.

TI  - Retrosplenial cortex maps the conjunction of internal and external spaces.
PG  - 1143-51
LID - 10.1038/nn.4058 [doi]
AB  - Intelligent behavior demands not only multiple forms of spatial representation,
      but also coordination among the brain regions mediating those representations.
      Retrosplenial cortex is densely interconnected with the majority of cortical and 
      subcortical brain structures that register an animal's position in multiple
      internal and external spatial frames of reference. This unique anatomy suggests
      that it functions to integrate distinct forms of spatial information and provides
      an interface for transformations between them. Evidence for this was found in
      rats traversing two different routes placed at different environmental locations.
      Retrosplenial ensembles robustly encoded conjunctions of progress through the
      current route, position in the larger environment and the left versus right
      turning behavior of the animal. Thus, the retrosplenial cortex has the requisite 
      dynamics to serve as an intermediary between brain regions generating different
      forms of spatial mapping, a result that is consistent with navigational and
      episodic memory impairments following damage to this region in humans.

PG  - 1067-76
LID - 10.1038/nn.4050 [doi]
AB  - Motion-sensitive neurons have long been studied in both the mammalian retina and 
      the insect optic lobe, yet striking similarities have become obvious only
      recently. Detailed studies at the circuit level revealed that, in both systems,
      (i) motion information is extracted from primary visual information in parallel
      ON and OFF pathways; (ii) in each pathway, the process of elementary motion
      detection involves the correlation of signals with different temporal dynamics;
      and (iii) primary motion information from both pathways converges at the next
      synapse, resulting in four groups of ON-OFF neurons, selective for the four
      cardinal directions. Given that the last common ancestor of insects and mammals
      lived about 550 million years ago, this general strategy seems to be a robust
      solution for how to compute the direction of visual motion with neural hardware.

TI  - The medial entorhinal cortex is necessary for temporal organization of
      hippocampal neuronal activity.
PG  - 1123-32
LID - 10.1038/nn.4056 [doi]
AB  - The superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are a major input to
      the hippocampus. The high proportion of spatially modulated cells, including grid
      cells and border cells, in these layers suggests that MEC inputs are critical for
      the representation of space in the hippocampus. However, selective manipulations 
      of the MEC do not completely abolish hippocampal spatial firing. To determine
      whether other hippocampal firing characteristics depend more critically on MEC
      inputs, we recorded from hippocampal CA1 cells in rats with MEC lesions. Theta
      phase precession was substantially disrupted, even during periods of stable
      spatial firing. Our findings indicate that MEC inputs to the hippocampus are
      required for the temporal organization of hippocampal firing patterns and suggest
      that cognitive functions that depend on precise neuronal sequences in the
      hippocampal theta cycle are particularly dependent on the MEC.

TI  - Nuclear pore complex remodeling by p75(NTR) cleavage controls TGF-beta signaling

PG  - 1077-80
LID - 10.1038/nn.4054 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes modulate neuronal activity and inhibit regeneration. We show that
      cleaved p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is a component of the nuclear pore
      complex (NPC) required for glial scar formation and reduced gamma oscillations in
      mice via regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. Cleaved
      p75(NTR) interacts with nucleoporins to promote Smad2 nucleocytoplasmic
      shuttling. Thus, NPC remodeling by regulated intramembrane cleavage of p75(NTR)
      controls astrocyte-neuronal communication in response to profibrotic factors.

TI  - Human representation of visuo-motor uncertainty as mixtures of orthogonal basis
      distributions.
PG  - 1152-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.4055 [doi]
AB  - In many laboratory visuo-motor decision tasks, subjects compensate for their own 
      visuo-motor error, earning close to the maximum reward possible. To do so, they
      must combine information about the distribution of possible error with values
      associated with different movement outcomes. The optimal solution is a
      potentially difficult computation that presupposes knowledge of the probability
      density function (pdf) of visuo-motor error associated with each possible planned
      movement. It is unclear how the brain represents such pdfs or computes with them.
      In three experiments, we used a forced-choice method to reveal subjects' internal
      representations of their spatial visuo-motor error in a speeded reaching
      movement. Although subjects' objective distributions were unimodal, close to
      Gaussian, their estimated internal pdfs were typically multimodal and were better
      described as mixtures of a small number of distributions differing only in
      location and scale. Mixtures of a small number of uniform distributions
      outperformed other mixture distributions, including mixtures of Gaussians.

AB  - A large and rapidly increasing body of evidence indicates that
      microglia-to-neuron signaling is essential for chronic pain hypersensitivity.
      Using multiple approaches, we found that microglia are not required for
      mechanical pain hypersensitivity in female mice; female mice achieved similar
      levels of pain hypersensitivity using adaptive immune cells, likely T
      lymphocytes. This sexual dimorphism suggests that male mice cannot be used as
      proxies for females in pain research.

AB  - Motor skill learning induces long-lasting reorganization of dendritic spines,
      principal sites of excitatory synapses, in the motor cortex. However, mechanisms 
      that regulate these excitatory synaptic changes remain poorly understood. Here,
      using in vivo two-photon imaging in awake mice, we found that learning-induced
      spine reorganization of layer (L) 2/3 excitatory neurons occurs in the distal
      branches of their apical dendrites in L1 but not in the perisomatic dendrites.
      This compartment-specific spine reorganization coincided with subtype-specific
      plasticity of local inhibitory circuits. Somatostatin-expressing inhibitory
      neurons (SOM-INs), which mainly inhibit distal dendrites of excitatory neurons,
      showed a decrease in axonal boutons immediately after the training began, whereas
      parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (PV-INs), which mainly inhibit
      perisomatic regions of excitatory neurons, exhibited a gradual increase in axonal
      boutons during training. Optogenetic enhancement and suppression of SOM-IN
      activity during training destabilized and hyperstabilized spines, respectively,
      and both manipulations impaired the learning of stereotyped movements. Our
      results identify SOM inhibition of distal dendrites as a key regulator of
      learning-related changes in excitatory synapses and the acquisition of motor
      skills.

      during learning.
PG  - 1101-8

AB  - In the mammalian brain, sensory cortices exhibit plasticity during task learning,
      but how this alters information transferred between connected cortical areas
      remains unknown. We found that divergent subpopulations of cortico-cortical
      neurons in mouse whisker primary somatosensory cortex (S1) undergo functional
      changes reflecting learned behavior. We chronically imaged activity of S1 neurons
      projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex in mice
      learning a texture discrimination task. Mice adopted an active whisking strategy 
      that enhanced texture-related whisker kinematics, correlating with task
      performance. M1-projecting neurons reliably encoded basic kinematics features,
      and an additional subset of touch-related neurons was recruited that persisted
      past training. The number of S2-projecting touch neurons remained constant, but
      improved their discrimination of trial types through reorganization while
      developing activity patterns capable of discriminating the animal's decision. We 
      propose that learning-related changes in S1 enhance sensory representations in a 
      pathway-specific manner, providing downstream areas with task-relevant
      information for behavior.

TI  - Diversity of astrocyte functions and phenotypes in neural circuits.
PG  - 942-52
LID - 10.1038/nn.4043 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes tile the entire CNS. They are vital for neural circuit function, but
      have traditionally been viewed as simple, homogenous cells that serve the same
      essential supportive roles everywhere. Here, we summarize breakthroughs that
      instead indicate that astrocytes represent a population of complex and
      functionally diverse cells. Physiological diversity of astrocytes is apparent
      between different brain circuits and microcircuits, and individual astrocytes
      display diverse signaling in subcellular compartments. With respect to injury and
      disease, astrocytes undergo diverse phenotypic changes that may be protective or 
      causative with regard to pathology in a context-dependent manner. These new
      insights herald the concept that astrocytes represent a diverse population of
      genetically tractable cells that mediate neural circuit-specific roles in health 
      and disease.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms governing Ca(2+) regulation of evoked and spontaneous
      release.
PG  - 935-41
LID - 10.1038/nn.4044 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between transmitter release evoked by action potentials and
      spontaneous release has fascinated neuroscientists for half a century, and
      separate biological roles for spontaneous release are emerging. Nevertheless,
      separate functions for spontaneous and Ca(2+)-evoked release do not necessarily
      indicate different origins of these two manifestations of vesicular fusion. Here 
      we review how Ca(2+) regulates evoked and spontaneous release, emphasizing that
      Ca(2+) can briefly increase vesicle fusion rates one-millionfold above
      spontaneous rates. This high dynamic range suggests that docked and readily
      releasable pool (RRP) vesicles might be protected against spontaneous release
      while also being immediately available for ultrafast Ca(2+)-evoked release.
      Molecular mechanisms for such release clamping of highly fusogenic RRP vesicles
      are increasingly investigated. Thus, we view spontaneous release as a consequence
      of the highly release-competent state of a standing pool of RRP vesicles, which
      is molecularly fine-tuned to control spontaneous release.

TI  - A neural network that finds a naturalistic solution for the production of muscle 
      activity.
PG  - 1025-33
LID - 10.1038/nn.4042 [doi]
AB  - It remains an open question how neural responses in motor cortex relate to
      movement. We explored the hypothesis that motor cortex reflects dynamics
      appropriate for generating temporally patterned outgoing commands. To formalize
      this hypothesis, we trained recurrent neural networks to reproduce the muscle
      activity of reaching monkeys. Models had to infer dynamics that could transform
      simple inputs into temporally and spatially complex patterns of muscle activity. 
      Analysis of trained models revealed that the natural dynamical solution was a
      low-dimensional oscillator that generated the necessary multiphasic commands.
      This solution closely resembled, at both the single-neuron and population levels,
      what was observed in neural recordings from the same monkeys. Notably, data and
      simulations agreed only when models were optimized to find simple solutions. An
      appealing interpretation is that the empirically observed dynamics of motor
      cortex may reflect a simple solution to the problem of generating temporally
      patterned descending commands.

TI  - Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder predict creativity.
PG  - 953-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.4040 [doi]
AB  - We tested whether polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
      would predict creativity. Higher scores were associated with artistic society
      membership or creative profession in both Icelandic (P = 5.2 x 10(-6) and 3.8 x
      10(-6) for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder scores, respectively) and
      replication cohorts (P = 0.0021 and 0.00086). This could not be accounted for by 
      increased relatedness between creative individuals and those with psychoses,
      indicating that creativity and psychosis share genetic roots.

AB  - Memory-based decisions are often accompanied by an assessment of choice
      certainty, but the mechanisms of such confidence judgments remain unknown. We
      studied the response of 1,065 individual neurons in the human hippocampus and
      amygdala while neurosurgical patients made memory retrieval decisions together
      with a confidence judgment. Combining behavioral, neuronal and computational
      analysis, we identified a population of memory-selective (MS) neurons whose
      activity signaled stimulus familiarity and confidence, as assessed by subjective 
      report. In contrast, the activity of visually selective (VS) neurons was not
      sensitive to memory strength. The groups further differed in response latency,
      tuning and extracellular waveforms. The information provided by MS neurons was
      sufficient for a race model to decide stimulus familiarity and retrieval
      confidence. Together, our results indicate a trial-by-trial relationship between 
      a specific group of neurons and declared memory strength in humans. We suggest
      that VS and MS neurons are a substrate for declarative memories.

AB  - As the tissue macrophages of the CNS, microglia are critically involved in
      diseases of the CNS. However, it remains unknown what controls their maturation
      and activation under homeostatic conditions. We observed substantial
      contributions of the host microbiota to microglia homeostasis, as germ-free (GF) 
      mice displayed global defects in microglia with altered cell proportions and an
      immature phenotype, leading to impaired innate immune responses. Temporal
      eradication of host microbiota severely changed microglia properties. Limited
      microbiota complexity also resulted in defective microglia. In contrast,
      recolonization with a complex microbiota partially restored microglia features.
      We determined that short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), microbiota-derived bacterial
      fermentation products, regulated microglia homeostasis. Accordingly, mice
      deficient for the SCFA receptor FFAR2 mirrored microglia defects found under GF
      conditions. These findings suggest that host bacteria vitally regulate microglia 
      maturation and function, whereas microglia impairment can be rectified to some
      extent by complex microbiota.

PG  - 1051-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.4035 [doi]
AB  - Independent evidence associates beta-amyloid pathology with both non-rapid eye
      movement (NREM) sleep disruption and memory impairment in older adults. However, 
      whether the influence of beta-amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory
      is, in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and
      associated overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here we show that
      beta-amyloid burden in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) correlates significantly
      with the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM
      SWA generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory
      consolidation and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation.
      Furthermore, structural equation models revealed that the association between
      mPFC beta-amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory
      consolidation was not direct, but instead statistically depended on the
      intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking beta-amyloid pathology
      with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a mechanistic
      pathway through which beta-amyloid pathology may contribute to
      hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly.

TI  - Activin receptor signaling regulates cocaine-primed behavioral and morphological 
      plasticity.
PG  - 959-61
LID - 10.1038/nn.4036 [doi]
AB  - Activin receptor signaling, including the transcription factor Smad3, was
      upregulated in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell following withdrawal from
      cocaine. Direct genetic and pharmacological manipulations of this pathway
      bidirectionally altered cocaine seeking while governing morphological plasticity 
      in NAc neurons. Thus, Activin/Smad3 signaling is induced following withdrawal
      from cocaine, and such regulation may be a key molecular mechanism underlying
      behavioral and cellular plasticity in the brain following cocaine
      self-administration.

TI  - Distinct circuit-dependent functions of presynaptic neurexin-3 at GABAergic and
      glutamatergic synapses.
PG  - 997-1007
LID - 10.1038/nn.4037 [doi]
AB  - alpha- and beta-neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules whose general
      importance for synaptic transmission is well documented. The specific functions
      of neurexins, however, remain largely unknown because no conditional neurexin
      knockouts are available and targeting all alpha- and beta-neurexins produced by a
      particular gene is challenging. Using newly generated constitutive and
      conditional knockout mice that target all neurexin-3alpha and neurexin-3beta
      isoforms, we found that neurexin-3 was differentially required for distinct
      synaptic functions in different brain regions. Specifically, we found that, in
      cultured neurons and acute slices of the hippocampus, extracellular sequences of 
      presynaptic neurexin-3 mediated trans-synaptic regulation of postsynaptic AMPA
      receptors. In cultured neurons and acute slices of the olfactory bulb, however,
      intracellular sequences of presynaptic neurexin-3 were selectively required for
      GABA release. Thus, our data indicate that neurexin-3 performs distinct essential
      pre- or postsynaptic functions in different brain regions by distinct mechanisms.

TI  - Hand use predicts the structure of representations in sensorimotor cortex.
PG  - 1034-40
LID - 10.1038/nn.4038 [doi]
AB  - Fine finger movements are controlled by the population activity of neurons in the
      hand area of primary motor cortex. Experiments using microstimulation and
      single-neuron electrophysiology suggest that this area represents coordinated
      multi-joint, rather than single-finger movements. However, the principle by which
      these representations are organized remains unclear. We analyzed activity
      patterns during individuated finger movements using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Although the spatial layout of finger-specific activity patterns 
      was variable across participants, the relative similarity between any pair of
      activity patterns was well preserved. This invariant organization was better
      explained by the correlation structure of everyday hand movements than by
      correlated muscle activity. This also generalized to an experiment using complex 
      multi-finger movements. Finally, the organizational structure correlated with
      patterns of involuntary co-contracted finger movements for high-force presses.
      Together, our results suggest that hand use shapes the relative arrangement of
      finger-specific activity patterns in sensory-motor cortex.

AB  - Postsynaptic remodeling of glutamatergic synapses on ventral striatum (vSTR)
      medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is critical for shaping stress responses. However, it
      is unclear which presynaptic inputs are involved. Susceptible mice exhibited
      increased synaptic strength at intralaminar thalamus (ILT), but not prefrontal
      cortex (PFC), inputs to vSTR MSNs following chronic social stress. Modulation of 
      ILT-vSTR versus PFC-vSTR neuronal activity differentially regulated dendritic
      spine plasticity and social avoidance.

TI  - The schizophrenia risk gene product miR-137 alters presynaptic plasticity.
PG  - 1008-16
LID - 10.1038/nn.4023 [doi]
AB  - Noncoding variants in the human MIR137 gene locus increase schizophrenia risk
      with genome-wide significance. However, the functional consequence of these risk 
      alleles is unknown. Here we examined induced human neurons harboring the minor
      alleles of four disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in MIR137. We 
      observed increased MIR137 levels compared to those in major allele-carrying
      cells. microRNA-137 gain of function caused downregulation of the presynaptic
      target genes complexin-1 (Cplx1), Nsf and synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), leading to
      impaired vesicle release. In vivo, miR-137 gain of function resulted in changes
      in synaptic vesicle pool distribution, impaired induction of mossy fiber
      long-term potentiation and deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.
      By sequestering endogenous miR-137, we were able to ameliorate the synaptic
      phenotypes. Moreover, reinstatement of Syt1 expression partially restored
      synaptic plasticity, demonstrating the importance of Syt1 as a miR-137 target.
      Our data provide new insight into the mechanism by which miR-137 dysregulation
      can impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

      stress.
PG  - 1017-24
LID - 10.1038/nn.4028 [doi]
AB  - Resilience to aversive events has a central role in determining whether stress
      leads to the development of depression. mGluR5 has been implicated in the
      pathophysiology of depression, but the effect of mGluR5 activity on stress
      resilience remains unexplored. We found that mGluR5(-/-) (also known as
      Grm5(-/-)) mice displayed more depression-like behaviors (for example, learned
      helplessness, social withdrawal and anhedonia) than control mice following
      exposure to various stressful stimuli. Lentiviral 'rescue' of mGluR5 in the
      nucleus accumbens (NAc) decreased these depression-like behaviors in mGluR5(-/-) 
      mice. In the NAc, DeltaFosB, whose induction promotes stress resilience, failed
      to be upregulated by stress in mGluR5(-/-) mice. Notably, targeted
      pharmacological activation of mGluR5 in the NAc increased DeltaFosB expression.
      Our findings point to an essential role for mGluR5 in promoting stress resilience
      and suggest that a defect in mGluR5-mediated signaling in the NAc may represent
      an endophenotype for stress-induced depression.

TI  - Central role for PICALM in amyloid-beta blood-brain barrier transcytosis and
      clearance.
PG  - 978-87
LID - 10.1038/nn.4025 [doi]
AB  - PICALM is a highly validated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
      found that reduced expression of PICALM in AD and murine brain endothelium
      correlated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and cognitive impairment.
      Moreover, Picalm deficiency diminished Abeta clearance across the murine
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerated Abeta pathology in a manner that was
      reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Using human brain endothelial
      monolayers, we found that PICALM regulated PICALM/clathrin-dependent
      internalization of Abeta bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor related
      protein-1, a key Abeta clearance receptor, and guided Abeta trafficking to Rab5
      and Rab11, leading to Abeta endothelial transcytosis and clearance. PICALM levels
      and Abeta clearance were reduced in AD-derived endothelial monolayers, which was 
      reversible by adenoviral-mediated PICALM transfer. Inducible pluripotent stem
      cell-derived human endothelial cells carrying the rs3851179 protective allele
      exhibited higher PICALM levels and enhanced Abeta clearance. Thus, PICALM
      regulates Abeta BBB transcytosis and clearance, which has implications for Abeta 
      brain homeostasis and clearance therapy.

TI  - The human epilepsy mutation GABRG2(Q390X) causes chronic subunit accumulation and
      neurodegeneration.
PG  - 988-96
LID - 10.1038/nn.4024 [doi]
AB  - Genetic epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases are two common neurological
      disorders that are conventionally viewed as being unrelated. A subset of patients
      with severe genetic epilepsies who have impaired development and often go on to
      die of their disease respond poorly to anticonvulsant drug therapy, suggesting a 
      need for new therapeutic targets. Previously, we reported that multiple GABAA
      receptor epilepsy mutations result in protein misfolding and abnormal receptor
      trafficking. We have now developed a model of a severe human genetic epileptic
      encephalopathy, the Gabrg2(+/Q390X) knock-in mouse. We found that, in addition to
      impairing inhibitory neurotransmission, mutant GABAA receptor gamma2(Q390X)
      subunits accumulated and aggregated intracellularly, activated caspase 3 and
      caused widespread, age-dependent neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that
      the fundamental protein metabolism and cellular consequences of the
      epilepsy-associated mutant gamma2(Q390X) ion channel subunit are not
      fundamentally different from those associated with neurodegeneration. Our results
      have far-reaching relevance for the identification of conserved pathological
      cascades and mechanism-based therapies that are shared between genetic epilepsies
      and neurodegenerative diseases.

PG  - 956-8

AB  - DNA methylation is an epigenetic repressor mark for transcription dynamically
      regulated in neurons. We analyzed visual experience regulation of DNA methylation
      in mice and its involvement in ocular dominance plasticity of the developing
      visual cortex. Monocular deprivation modulated the expression of factors
      controlling DNA methylation and exerted opposite effects on DNA methylation and
      hydroxymethylation in specific plasticity genes. Inhibition of DNA
      methyltrasferase (DNMT) blocked molecular and functional effects of monocular
      deprivation, partially reversing the monocular deprivation transcriptional
      program.

TI  - Three dimensions of the amyloid hypothesis: time, space and 'wingmen'.
PG  - 800-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.4018 [doi]
AB  - The amyloid hypothesis, which has been the predominant framework for research in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been the source of considerable controversy. The
      amyloid hypothesis postulates that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the causative 
      agent in AD. It is strongly supported by data from rare autosomal dominant forms 
      of AD. However, the evidence that Abeta causes or contributes to age-associated
      sporadic AD is more complex and less clear, prompting criticism of the
      hypothesis. We provide an overview of the major arguments for and against the
      amyloid hypothesis. We conclude that Abeta likely is the key initiator of a
      complex pathogenic cascade that causes AD. However, we argue that Abeta acts
      primarily as a trigger of other downstream processes, particularly tau
      aggregation, which mediate neurodegeneration. Abeta appears to be necessary, but 
      not sufficient, to cause AD. Its major pathogenic effects may occur very early in
      the disease process.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a biologically complex neurodegenerative dementia.
      Nearly 20 years ago, with the combination of observations from biochemistry,
      neuropathology and genetics, a compelling hypothesis known as the amyloid cascade
      hypothesis was formulated. The core of this hypothesis is that it is pathological
      accumulations of amyloid-beta, a peptide fragment of a membrane protein called
      amyloid precursor protein, that act as the root cause of AD and initiate its
      pathogenesis. Yet, with the passage of time, growing amounts of data have
      accumulated that are inconsistent with the basically linear structure of this
      hypothesis. And while there is fear in the field over the consequences of
      rejecting it outright, clinging to an inaccurate disease model is the option we
      should fear most. This Perspective explores the proposition that we are
      over-reliant on amyloid to define and diagnose AD and that the time has come to
      face our fears and reject the amyloid cascade hypothesis.

TI  - Social signals of safety and risk confer utility and have asymmetric effects on
      observers' choices.
PG  - 912-916
LID - 10.1038/nn.4022 [doi]
AB  - Individuals' risk attitudes are known to guide choices about uncertain options.
      However, in the presence of others' decisions, these choices can be swayed and
      manifest as riskier or safer behavior than one would express alone. To test the
      mechanisms underlying effective social 'nudges' in human decision-making, we used
      functional neuroimaging and a task in which participants made choices about
      gambles alone and after observing others' selections. Against three alternative
      explanations, we found that observing others' choices of gambles increased the
      subjective value (utility) of those gambles for the observer. This
      'other-conferred utility' was encoded in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and
      these neural signals predicted conformity. We further identified a parametric
      interaction with individual risk preferences in anterior cingulate cortex and
      insula. These data provide a neuromechanistic account of how information from
      others is integrated with individual preferences that may explain
      preference-congruent susceptibility to social signals of safety and risk.

PG  - 903-11
LID - 10.1038/nn.4021 [doi]
AB  - Speech contains temporal structure that the brain must analyze to enable
      linguistic processing. To investigate the neural basis of this analysis, we used 
      sound quilts, stimuli constructed by shuffling segments of a natural sound,
      approximately preserving its properties on short timescales while disrupting them
      on longer scales. We generated quilts from foreign speech to eliminate language
      cues and manipulated the extent of natural acoustic structure by varying the
      segment length. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we identified
      bilateral regions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) whose responses varied
      with segment length. This effect was absent in primary auditory cortex and did
      not occur for quilts made from other natural sounds or acoustically matched
      synthetic sounds, suggesting tuning to speech-specific spectrotemporal structure.
      When examined parametrically, the STS response increased with segment length up
      to approximately 500 ms. Our results identify a locus of speech analysis in human
      auditory cortex that is distinct from lexical, semantic or syntactic processes.

TI  - Regulation of axon regeneration by the RNA repair and splicing pathway.
PG  - 817-25
LID - 10.1038/nn.4019 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms governing a neuron's regenerative ability are important but not well
      understood. We identify Rtca (RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase) as an inhibitor 
      of axon regeneration. Removal of Rtca cell-autonomously enhanced axon regrowth in
      the Drosophila CNS, whereas its overexpression reduced axon regeneration in the
      periphery. Rtca along with the RNA ligase Rtcb and its catalyst Archease operate 
      in the RNA repair and splicing pathway important for stress-induced mRNA
      splicing, including that of Xbp1, a cellular stress sensor. Drosophila Rtca and
      Archease had opposing effects on Xbp1 splicing, and deficiency of Archease or
      Xbp1 impeded axon regeneration in Drosophila. Moreover, overexpressing mammalian 
      Rtca in cultured rodent neurons reduced axonal complexity in vitro, whereas
      reducing its function promoted retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after
      optic nerve crush in mice. Our study thus links axon regeneration to cellular
      stress and RNA metabolism, revealing new potential therapeutic targets for
      treating nervous system trauma.

AB  - Intracellular Ca(2+) is a widely used neuronal activity indicator. Here we
      describe a transcriptional reporter of intracellular Ca(2+) (TRIC) in Drosophila 
      that uses a binary expression system to report Ca(2+)-dependent interactions
      between calmodulin and its target peptide. We found that in vitro assays
      predicted in vivo properties of TRIC and that TRIC signals in sensory systems
      depend on neuronal activity. TRIC was able to quantitatively monitor neuronal
      responses that changed slowly, such as those of neuropeptide F-expressing neurons
      to sexual deprivation and neuroendocrine pars intercerebralis cells to food and
      arousal. Furthermore, TRIC-induced expression of a neuronal silencer in
      nutrient-activated cells enhanced stress resistance, providing a proof of
      principle that TRIC can be used for circuit manipulation. Thus, TRIC facilitates 
      the monitoring and manipulation of neuronal activity, especially those reflecting
      slow changes in physiological states that are poorly captured by existing
      methods. TRIC's modular design should enable optimization and adaptation to other
      organisms.

TI  - Function and developmental origin of a mesocortical inhibitory circuit.
PG  - 872-82
LID - 10.1038/nn.4020 [doi]
AB  - Midbrain ventral tegmental neurons project to the prefrontal cortex and modulate 
      cognitive functions. Using viral tracing, optogenetics and electrophysiology, we 
      found that mesocortical neurons in the mouse ventrotegmental area provide fast
      glutamatergic excitation of GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex and
      inhibit prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons in a robust and reliable manner.
      These mesocortical neurons were derived from a subset of dopaminergic
      progenitors, which were dependent on prolonged Sonic Hedgehog signaling for their
      induction. Loss of these progenitors resulted in the loss of the mesocortical
      inhibitory circuit and an increase in perseverative behavior, whereas mesolimbic 
      and mesostriatal dopaminergic projections, as well as impulsivity and attentional
      function, were largely spared. Thus, we identified a previously uncharacterized
      mesocortical circuit contributing to perseverative behaviors and found that the
      diversity of dopaminergic neurons begins to be established during their
      progenitor phase.

TI  - Spine pruning drives antipsychotic-sensitive locomotion via circuit control of
      striatal dopamine.
PG  - 883-91
LID - 10.1038/nn.4015 [doi]
AB  - Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders may arise from anomalies in
      long-range neuronal connectivity downstream of pathologies in dendritic spines.
      However, the mechanisms that may link spine pathology to circuit abnormalities
      relevant to atypical behavior remain unknown. Using a mouse model to
      conditionally disrupt a critical regulator of the dendritic spine cytoskeleton,
      the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), we report here a molecular
      mechanism that unexpectedly reveals the inter-relationship of progressive spine
      pruning, elevated frontal cortical excitation of pyramidal neurons and striatal
      hyperdopaminergia in a cortical-to-midbrain circuit abnormality. The main
      symptomatic manifestations of this circuit abnormality are psychomotor agitation 
      and stereotypical behaviors, which are relieved by antipsychotics. Moreover, this
      antipsychotic-responsive locomotion can be mimicked in wild-type mice by
      optogenetic activation of this circuit. Collectively these results reveal
      molecular and neural-circuit mechanisms, illustrating how diverse pathologies may
      converge to drive behaviors relevant to psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Cis-regulatory variants that alter gene expression can modify disease
      expressivity, but none have previously been identified in Huntington disease
      (HD). Here we provide in vivo evidence in HD patients that cis-regulatory
      variants in the HTT promoter are bidirectional modifiers of HD age of onset. HTT 
      promoter analysis identified a NF-kappaB binding site that regulates HTT promoter
      transcriptional activity. A non-coding SNP, rs13102260:G > A, in this binding
      site impaired NF-kappaB binding and reduced HTT transcriptional activity and HTT 
      protein expression. The presence of the rs13102260 minor (A) variant on the HD
      disease allele was associated with delayed age of onset in familial cases,
      whereas the presence of the rs13102260 (A) variant on the wild-type HTT allele
      was associated with earlier age of onset in HD patients in an extreme case-based 
      cohort. Our findings suggest a previously unknown mechanism linking
      allele-specific effects of rs13102260 on HTT expression to HD age of onset and
      have implications for HTT silencing treatments that are currently in development.

AB  - Communication between neurons rests on their capacity to change their firing
      pattern to encode different messages. For several vital functions, such as
      respiration and mastication, neurons need to generate a rhythmic firing pattern. 
      Here we show in the rat trigeminal sensori-motor circuit for mastication that
      this ability depends on regulation of the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration
      ([Ca(2+)]e) by astrocytes. In this circuit, astrocytes respond to sensory stimuli
      that induce neuronal rhythmic activity, and their blockade with a Ca(2+) chelator
      prevents neurons from generating a rhythmic bursting pattern. This ability is
      restored by adding S100beta, an astrocytic Ca(2+)-binding protein, to the
      extracellular space, while application of an anti-S100beta antibody prevents
      generation of rhythmic activity. These results indicate that astrocytes regulate 
      a fundamental neuronal property: the capacity to change firing pattern. These
      findings may have broad implications for many other neural networks whose
      functions depend on the generation of rhythmic activity.

      activity.
PG  - 892-902

AB  - Cholinergic modulation of cortex powerfully influences information processing and
      brain states, causing robust desynchronization of local field potentials and
      strong decorrelation of responses between neurons. We found that intracortical
      cholinergic inputs to mouse visual cortex specifically and differentially drive a
      defined cortical microcircuit: they facilitate somatostatin-expressing (SOM)
      inhibitory neurons that in turn inhibit parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons
      and pyramidal neurons. Selective optogenetic inhibition of SOM responses blocked 
      desynchronization and decorrelation, demonstrating that direct cholinergic
      activation of SOM neurons is necessary for this phenomenon. Optogenetic
      inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons did not block
      desynchronization, despite these neurons being activated at high levels of
      cholinergic drive. Direct optogenetic SOM activation, independent of cholinergic 
      modulation, was sufficient to induce desynchronization. Together, these findings 
      demonstrate a mechanistic basis for temporal structure in cortical populations
      and the crucial role of neuromodulatory drive in specific inhibitory-excitatory
      circuits in actively shaping the dynamics of neuronal activity.

PG  - 863-71
LID - 10.1038/nn.4011 [doi]
AB  - Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)- and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons
      of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) are oppositely regulated by
      caloric depletion and coordinately stimulate and inhibit homeostatic satiety,
      respectively. This bimodality is principally underscored by the antagonistic
      actions of these ligands at downstream melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R) in the
      paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Although this population is
      critical to energy balance, the underlying neural circuitry remains unknown.
      Using mice expressing Cre recombinase in MC4R neurons, we demonstrate
      bidirectional control of feeding following real-time activation and inhibition of
      PVH(MC4R) neurons and further identify these cells as a functional exponent of
      ARC(AgRP) neuron-driven hunger. Moreover, we reveal this function to be mediated 
      by a PVH(MC4R)-->lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) pathway. Activation of this 
      circuit encodes positive valence, but only in calorically depleted mice. Thus,
      the satiating and appetitive nature of PVH(MC4R)-->LPBN neurons supports the
      principles of drive reduction and highlights this circuit as a promising target
      for antiobesity drug development.

PG  - 855-62
LID - 10.1038/nn.4010 [doi]
AB  - The circadian ( approximately 24 h) clock is continuously entrained (reset) by
      ambient light so that endogenous rhythms are synchronized with daily changes in
      the environment. Light-induced gene expression is thought to be the molecular
      mechanism underlying clock entrainment. mRNA translation is a key step of gene
      expression, but the manner in which clock entrainment is controlled at the level 
      of mRNA translation is not well understood. We found that a light- and circadian 
      clock-regulated MAPK/MNK pathway led to phosphorylation of the cap-binding
      protein eIF4E in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the locus
      of the master circadian clock in mammals. Phosphorylation of eIF4E specifically
      promoted translation of Period 1 (Per1) and Period 2 (Per2) mRNAs and increased
      the abundance of basal and inducible PER proteins, which facilitated circadian
      clock resetting and precise timekeeping. Together, these results highlight a
      critical role for light-regulated translational control in the physiology of the 
      circadian clock.

AB  - The role of developmental transcription factors in maintenance of neuronal
      properties and in disease remains poorly understood. Lmx1a and Lmx1b are key
      transcription factors required for the early specification of ventral midbrain
      dopamine (mDA) neurons. Here we show that conditional ablation of Lmx1a and Lmx1b
      after mDA neuron specification resulted in abnormalities that show striking
      resemblance to early cellular abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease. We found
      that Lmx1b was required for the normal execution of the autophagic-lysosomal
      pathway and for the integrity of dopaminergic nerve terminals and long-term mDA
      neuronal survival. Notably, human LMX1B expression was decreased in mDA neurons
      in brain tissue affected by Parkinson's disease. Thus, these results reveal a
      sustained and essential requirement of Lmx1b for the function of midbrain mDA
      neurons and suggest that its dysfunction is associated with Parkinson's disease
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Tet3 regulates synaptic transmission and homeostatic plasticity via DNA oxidation
      and repair.
PG  - 836-43
LID - 10.1038/nn.4008 [doi]
AB  - Contrary to the long-held belief that DNA methylation of terminally
      differentiated cells is permanent and essentially immutable, post-mitotic neurons
      exhibit extensive DNA demethylation. The cellular function of active DNA
      demethylation in neurons, however, remains largely unknown. Tet family proteins
      oxidize 5-methylcytosine to initiate active DNA demethylation through the
      base-excision repair (BER) pathway. We found that synaptic activity
      bi-directionally regulates neuronal Tet3 expression. Functionally, knockdown of
      Tet or inhibition of BER in hippocampal neurons elevated excitatory glutamatergic
      synaptic transmission, whereas overexpressing Tet3 or Tet1 catalytic domain
      decreased it. Furthermore, dysregulation of Tet3 signaling prevented homeostatic 
      synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, Tet3 dictated neuronal surface GluR1
      levels. RNA-seq analyses further revealed a pivotal role of Tet3 in regulating
      gene expression in response to global synaptic activity changes. Thus, Tet3
      serves as a synaptic activity sensor to epigenetically regulate fundamental
      properties and meta-plasticity of neurons via active DNA demethylation.

PG  - 620-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.3982 [doi]
AB  - The number of papers about the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has grown from 1 per
      month in 1987 to a current rate of over 50 per month. This publication stream has
      implicated the OFC in nearly every function known to cognitive neuroscience and
      in most neuropsychiatric diseases. However, new ideas about OFC function are
      typically based on limited data sets and often ignore or minimize competing ideas
      or contradictory findings. Yet true progress in our understanding of an area's
      function comes as much from invalidating existing ideas as proposing new ones.
      Here we consider the proposed roles for OFC, critically examining the level of
      support for these claims and highlighting the data that call them into question.

TI  - Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytes from Ip3r2(-/-) mice in brain slices and during
      startle responses in vivo.
PG  - 708-17
LID - 10.1038/nn.4001 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular Ca(2+) signaling is considered to be important for multiple
      astrocyte functions in neural circuits. However, mice devoid of inositol
      triphosphate type 2 receptors (IP3R2) reportedly lack all astrocyte Ca(2+)
      signaling, but display no neuronal or neurovascular deficits, implying that
      astrocyte Ca(2+) fluctuations are not involved in these functions. An assumption 
      has been that the loss of somatic Ca(2+) fluctuations also reflects a similar
      loss in astrocyte processes. We tested this assumption and found diverse types of
      Ca(2+) fluctuations in astrocytes, with most occurring in processes rather than
      in somata. These fluctuations were preserved in Ip3r2(-/-) (also known as
      Itpr2(-/-)) mice in brain slices and in vivo, occurred in end feet, and were
      increased by G protein-coupled receptor activation and by startle-induced
      neuromodulatory responses. Our data reveal previously unknown Ca(2+) fluctuations
      in astrocytes and highlight limitations of studies that used Ip3r2(-/-) mice to
      evaluate astrocyte contributions to neural circuit function and mouse behavior.

      cortex.
PG  - 752-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3999 [doi]
AB  - Humans, and animals, often encounter ambiguous situations that require a decision
      on whether to take an offense or a defense strategy. Behavioral studies suggest
      that a strategy decision is frequently made before concrete options are
      evaluated. It remains enigmatic, however, how a strategy is determined without
      exploration of options. Here we investigated neural correlates of quick
      offense-versus-defense strategy decision in a board game, shogi. We found that
      the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex
      complementally encoded the defense and attack strategy values, respectively. The 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared the two strategy values. Several brain
      regions were activated during decision of concrete moves under an instructed
      strategy, whereas none of them showed correlation with defense or attack strategy
      values in their activities during strategy decision. These findings suggest that 
      values of alternative strategies represented in different parts of the cingulate 
      cortex have essential roles in intuitive strategy decision-making.

TI  - A coding-independent function of an alternative Ube3a transcript during neuronal 
      development.
PG  - 666-73
LID - 10.1038/nn.3996 [doi]
AB  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube3a is an important regulator of activity-dependent
      synapse development and plasticity. Ube3a mutations cause Angelman syndrome and
      have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the
      biological significance of alternative Ube3a transcripts generated in mammalian
      neurons remains unknown. We report here that Ube3a1 RNA, a transcript that
      encodes a truncated Ube3a protein lacking catalytic activity, prevents exuberant 
      dendrite growth and promotes spine maturation in rat hippocampal neurons.
      Surprisingly, Ube3a1 RNA function was independent of its coding sequence but
      instead required a unique 3' untranslated region and an intact microRNA pathway. 
      Ube3a1 RNA knockdown increased activity of the plasticity-regulating miR-134,
      suggesting that Ube3a1 RNA acts as a dendritic competing endogenous RNA.
      Accordingly, the dendrite-growth-promoting effect of Ube3a1 RNA knockdown in vivo
      is abolished in mice lacking miR-134. Taken together, our results define a
      noncoding function of an alternative Ube3a transcript in dendritic protein
      synthesis, with potential implications for Angelman syndrome and ASD.

TI  - Therapeutic deep brain stimulation reduces cortical phase-amplitude coupling in
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 779-86
LID - 10.1038/nn.3997 [doi]
AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly applied for the treatment of brain
      disorders, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. Here we evaluate the
      effect of basal ganglia DBS on cortical function using invasive cortical
      recordings in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing DBS implantation
      surgery. In the primary motor cortex of PD patients, neuronal population spiking 
      is excessively synchronized to the phase of network oscillations. This manifests 
      in brain surface recordings as exaggerated coupling between the phase of the beta
      rhythm and the amplitude of broadband activity. We show that acute therapeutic
      DBS reversibly reduces phase-amplitude interactions over a similar time course as
      that of the reduction in parkinsonian motor signs. We propose that DBS of the

AB  - Sharp wave-associated field oscillations ( approximately 200 Hz) of the
      hippocampus, referred to as ripples, are believed to be important for
      consolidation of explicit memory. Little is known about how ripples are regulated
      by other brain regions. We found that the median raphe region (MnR) is important 
      for regulating hippocampal ripple activity and memory consolidation. We performed
      in vivo simultaneous recording in the MnR and hippocampus of mice and found that,
      when a group of MnR neurons was active, ripples were absent. Consistently,
      optogenetic stimulation of MnR neurons suppressed ripple activity and inhibition 
      of these neurons increased ripple activity. Notably, using a fear conditioning
      procedure, we found that photostimulation of MnR neurons interfered with memory
      consolidation. Our results demonstrate a critical role of the MnR in regulating
      ripples and memory consolidation.

AB  - Distributed networks of brain areas interact with one another in a time-varying
      fashion to enable complex cognitive and sensorimotor functions. Here we used new 
      network-analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of
      large-scale functional neural circuitry during learning. Using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from healthy human participants, we
      investigated changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that
      promote learning from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill.
      Our results show that learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and
      that the release of cognitive control hubs in frontal and cingulate cortices
      predicts individual differences in the rate of learning on other days of
      practice. Our general statistical approach is applicable across other cognitive
      domains and provides a key to understanding time-resolved interactions between
      distributed neural circuits that enable task performance.

PG  - 760-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.3994 [doi]
AB  - Deciding how long to keep waiting for future rewards is a nontrivial problem,
      especially when the timing of rewards is uncertain. We carried out an experiment 
      in which human decision makers waited for rewards in two environments in which
      reward-timing statistics favored either a greater or lesser degree of behavioral 
      persistence. We found that decision makers adaptively calibrated their level of
      persistence for each environment. Functional neuroimaging revealed signals that
      evolved differently during physically identical delays in the two environments,
      consistent with a dynamic and context-sensitive reappraisal of subjective value. 
      This effect was observed in a region of ventromedial prefrontal cortex that is
      sensitive to subjective value in other contexts, demonstrating continuity between
      valuation mechanisms involved in discrete choice and in temporally extended
      decisions analogous to foraging. Our findings support a model in which voluntary 
      persistence emerges from dynamic cost/benefit evaluation rather than from a
      control process that overrides valuation mechanisms.

TI  - Neuronal activity biases axon selection for myelination in vivo.
PG  - 683-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3992 [doi]
AB  - An essential feature of vertebrate neural development is ensheathment of axons
      with myelin, an insulating membrane formed by oligodendrocytes. Not all axons are
      myelinated, but mechanisms directing myelination of specific axons are unknown.
      Using zebrafish, we found that activity-dependent secretion stabilized myelin
      sheath formation on select axons. When VAMP2-dependent exocytosis was silenced in
      single axons, oligodendrocytes preferentially ensheathed neighboring axons.
      Nascent sheaths formed on silenced axons were shorter in length, but when
      activity of neighboring axons was also suppressed, inhibition of sheath growth
      was relieved. Using in vivo time-lapse microscopy, we found that only 25% of
      oligodendrocyte processes that initiated axon wrapping were stabilized during
      normal development and that initiation did not require activity. Instead,
      oligodendrocyte processes wrapping silenced axons retracted more frequently. We
      propose that axon selection for myelination results from excessive and
      indiscriminate initiation of wrapping followed by refinement that is biased by
      activity-dependent secretion from axons.

PG  - 647-56
LID - 10.1038/nn.3995 [doi]
AB  - To identify chromatin mechanisms of neuronal differentiation, we characterized
      chromatin accessibility and gene expression in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) 
      of the developing mouse. We used DNase-seq to map accessibility of cis-regulatory
      elements and RNA-seq to profile transcript abundance across postnatal stages of
      neuronal differentiation in vivo and in culture. We observed thousands of
      chromatin accessibility changes as CGNs differentiated, and verified, using
      H3K27ac ChIP-seq, reporter gene assays and CRISPR-mediated activation, that many 
      of these regions function as neuronal enhancers. Motif discovery in
      differentially accessible chromatin regions suggested a previously unknown role
      for the Zic family of transcription factors in CGN maturation. We confirmed the
      association of Zic with these elements by ChIP-seq and found, using knockdown,
      that Zic1 and Zic2 are required for coordinating mature neuronal gene expression 
      patterns. Together, our data reveal chromatin dynamics at thousands of gene
      regulatory elements that facilitate the gene expression patterns necessary for
      neuronal differentiation and function.

AB  - The myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes markedly affects CNS function, but
      how this is regulated by neuronal activity in vivo is not known. We found that
      blocking synaptic vesicle release impaired CNS myelination by reducing the number
      of myelin sheaths made by individual oligodendrocytes during their short period
      of formation. We also found that stimulating neuronal activity increased myelin
      sheath formation by individual oligodendrocytes. These data indicate that
      neuronal activity regulates the myelinating capacity of single oligodendrocytes.

TI  - Synaptic diversity enables temporal coding of coincident multisensory inputs in
      single neurons.
PG  - 718-27
LID - 10.1038/nn.3974 [doi]
AB  - The ability of the brain to rapidly process information from multiple pathways is
      critical for reliable execution of complex sensory-motor behaviors, yet the
      cellular mechanisms underlying a neuronal representation of multimodal stimuli
      are poorly understood. Here we explored the possibility that the physiological
      diversity of mossy fiber (MF) to granule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse
      vestibulocerebellum may contribute to the processing of coincident multisensory
      information at the level of individual GCs. We found that the strength and
      short-term dynamics of individual MF-GC synapses can act as biophysical
      signatures for primary vestibular, secondary vestibular and visual input
      pathways. Most GCs receive inputs from different modalities, which, when
      coactivated, produced enhanced GC firing rates and distinct first spike
      latencies. Thus, pathway-specific synaptic response properties permit temporal
      coding of correlated multisensory inputs by single GCs, thereby enriching sensory
      representation and facilitating pattern separation.

TI  - Brain feminization requires active repression of masculinization via DNA
      methylation.
PG  - 690-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.3988 [doi]
AB  - The developing mammalian brain is destined for a female phenotype unless exposed 
      to gonadal hormones during a perinatal sensitive period. It has been assumed that
      the undifferentiated brain is masculinized by direct induction of transcription
      by ligand-activated nuclear steroid receptors. We found that a primary effect of 
      gonadal steroids in the highly sexually dimorphic preoptic area (POA) is to
      reduce activity of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) enzymes, thereby decreasing DNA
      methylation and releasing masculinizing genes from epigenetic repression.
      Pharmacological inhibition of Dnmts mimicked gonadal steroids, resulting in
      masculinized neuronal markers and male sexual behavior in female rats.
      Conditional knockout of the de novo Dnmt isoform, Dnmt3a, also masculinized
      sexual behavior in female mice. RNA sequencing revealed gene and isoform variants
      modulated by methylation that may underlie the divergent reproductive behaviors
      of males versus females. Our data show that brain feminization is maintained by
      the active suppression of masculinization via DNA methylation.

TI  - GABAergic regulation of cerebellar NG2 cell development is altered in perinatal
      white matter injury.
PG  - 674-82
LID - 10.1038/nn.3990 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI), a leading cause of neurodevelopmental
      disabilities in preterm infants, is characterized by reduced oligodendrocyte
      formation. NG2-expressing oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2 cells) are exposed
      to various extrinsic regulatory signals, including the neurotransmitter GABA. We 
      investigated GABAergic signaling to cerebellar white matter NG2 cells in a mouse 
      model of DWMI (chronic neonatal hypoxia). We found that hypoxia caused a loss of 
      GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic input to NG2 cells, extensive proliferation of
      these cells and delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, leading to dysmyelination.
      Treatment of control mice with a GABAA receptor antagonist or deletion of the
      chloride-accumulating transporter NKCC1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia.
      Conversely, blockade of GABA catabolism or GABA uptake reduced NG2 cell numbers
      and increased the formation of mature oligodendrocytes both in control and
      hypoxic mice. Our results indicate that GABAergic signaling regulates NG2 cell
      differentiation and proliferation in vivo, and suggest that its perturbation is a
      key factor in DWMI.

AB  - Socioeconomic disparities are associated with differences in cognitive
      development. The extent to which this translates to disparities in brain
      structure is unclear. We investigated relationships between socioeconomic factors
      and brain morphometry, independently of genetic ancestry, among a cohort of 1,099
      typically developing individuals between 3 and 20 years of age. Income was
      logarithmically associated with brain surface area. Among children from lower
      income families, small differences in income were associated with relatively
      large differences in surface area, whereas, among children from higher income
      families, similar income increments were associated with smaller differences in
      surface area. These relationships were most prominent in regions supporting
      language, reading, executive functions and spatial skills; surface area mediated 
      socioeconomic differences in certain neurocognitive abilities. These data imply
      that income relates most strongly to brain structure among the most disadvantaged
      children.

PG  - 657-65

AB  - The mechanism by which adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are established during
      development is unclear. In this study, analysis of cell cycle progression by
      examining retention of a histone 2B (H2B)-GFP fusion protein revealed that, in a 
      subset of mouse embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the cell cycle slows
      between embryonic day (E) 13.5 and E15.5 while other embryonic NPCs continue to
      divide rapidly. By allowing H2B-GFP expressed at E9.5 to become diluted in
      dividing cells until the young adult stage, we determined that a majority of NSCs
      in the young adult subependymal zone (SEZ) originated from these slowly dividing 
      embryonic NPCs. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 is highly expressed in 
      this embryonic subpopulation, and the deletion of p57 impairs the emergence of
      adult NSCs. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of adult SEZ NSCs is 
      derived from a slowly dividing subpopulation of embryonic NPCs and identify p57
      as a key factor in generating this embryonic origin of adult SEZ NSCs.

PG  - 698-707
LID - 10.1038/nn.3984 [doi]
AB  - Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a susceptibility gene for major
      psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. DISC1 has been implicated in
      neurodevelopment in relation to scaffolding signal complexes. Here we used
      proteomic analysis to screen for DISC1 interactors and identified several
      RNA-binding proteins, such as hematopoietic zinc finger (HZF), that act as
      components of RNA-transporting granules. HZF participates in the mRNA
      localization of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1), which plays
      a key role in synaptic plasticity. DISC1 colocalizes with HZF and ITPR1 mRNA in
      hippocampal dendrites and directly associates with neuronal mRNAs, including
      ITPR1 mRNA. The binding potential of DISC1 for ITPR1 mRNA is facilitated by HZF. 
      Studies of Disc1-knockout mice have revealed that DISC1 regulates the dendritic
      transport of Itpr1 mRNA by directly interacting with its mRNA. The DISC1-mediated
      mRNA regulation is involved in synaptic plasticity. We show that DISC1 binds
      ITPR1 mRNA with HZF, thereby regulating its dendritic transport for synaptic
      plasticity.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a genetically heterogeneous
      neurodegenerative syndrome hallmarked by adult-onset loss of motor neurons. We
      performed exome sequencing of 252 familial ALS (fALS) and 827 control
      individuals. Gene-based rare variant analysis identified an exome-wide
      significant enrichment of eight loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in TBK1
      (encoding TANK-binding kinase 1) in 13 fALS pedigrees. No enrichment of LoF
      mutations was observed in a targeted mutation screen of 1,010 sporadic ALS and
      650 additional control individuals. Linkage analysis in four families gave an
      aggregate LOD score of 4.6. In vitro experiments confirmed the loss of expression
      of TBK1 LoF mutant alleles, or loss of interaction of the C-terminal TBK1
      coiled-coil domain (CCD2) mutants with the TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin, which
      has been shown to be involved in ALS pathogenesis. We conclude that
      haploinsufficiency of TBK1 causes ALS and fronto-temporal dementia.

AB  - Decisions may arise via 'model-free' repetition of previously reinforced actions 
      or by 'model-based' evaluation, which is widely thought to follow from
      prospective anticipation of action consequences using a learned map or model.
      While choices and neural correlates of decision variables sometimes reflect
      knowledge of their consequences, it remains unclear whether this actually arises 
      from prospective evaluation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a
      sequential reward-learning task in which paths contained decodable object
      categories, we found that humans' model-based choices were associated with neural
      signatures of future paths observed at decision time, suggesting a prospective
      mechanism for choice. Prospection also covaried with the degree of model-based
      influences on neural correlates of decision variables and was inversely related
      to prediction error signals thought to underlie model-free learning. These
      results dissociate separate mechanisms underlying model-based and model-free
      evaluation and support the hypothesis that model-based influences on choices and 
      neural decision variables result from prospection.

PG  - 736-43

AB  - A central neuroscientific pursuit is understanding neuronal interactions that
      support computations underlying cognition and behavior. Although neurons interact
      across disparate scales, from cortical columns to whole-brain networks, research 
      has been restricted to one scale at a time. We measured local interactions
      through multi-neuronal recordings while accessing global networks using scalp
      electroencephalography (EEG) in rhesus macaques. We measured spike count
      correlation, an index of functional connectivity with computational relevance,
      and EEG oscillations, which have been linked to various cognitive functions. We
      found a non-monotonic relationship between EEG oscillation amplitude and spike
      count correlation, contrary to the intuitive expectation of a direct
      relationship. With a widely used network model, we replicated these findings by
      incorporating a private signal targeting inhibitory neurons, a common mechanism
      proposed for gain modulation. Finally, we found that spike count correlation
      explained nonlinearities in the relationship between EEG oscillations and
      response time in a spatial selective attention task.

PG  - 637-46
LID - 10.1038/nn.3980 [doi]
AB  - The human cerebral cortex depends for its normal development and size on a
      precisely controlled balance between self-renewal and differentiation of diverse 
      neural progenitor cells. Specialized progenitors that are common in humans but
      virtually absent in rodents, called outer radial glia (ORG), have been suggested 
      to be crucial to the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. We combined
      progenitor subtype-specific sorting with transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing to
      identify genes enriched in human ORG, which included targets of the transcription
      factor neurogenin and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic long
      noncoding RNAs. Activating the neurogenin pathway in ferret progenitors promoted 
      delamination and outward migration. Finally, single-cell transcriptional
      profiling in human, ferret and mouse revealed more cells coexpressing proneural
      neurogenin targets in human than in other species, suggesting greater neuronal
      lineage commitment and differentiation of self-renewing progenitors. Thus, we
      find that the abundance of human ORG is paralleled by increased transcriptional
      heterogeneity of cortical progenitors.

TI  - Role of Tet1 and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in cocaine action.
PG  - 536-44
LID - 10.1038/nn.3976 [doi]
AB  - Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes mediate the conversion of 5-methylcytosine
      (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is enriched in brain, and its
      ultimate DNA demethylation. However, the influence of TET and 5hmC on gene
      transcription in brain remains elusive. We found that ten-eleven translocation
      protein 1 (TET1) was downregulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain 
      reward structure, by repeated cocaine administration, which enhanced behavioral
      responses to cocaine. We then identified 5hmC induction in putative enhancers and
      coding regions of genes that have pivotal roles in drug addiction. Such induction
      of 5hmC, which occurred similarly following TET1 knockdown alone, correlated with
      increased expression of these genes as well as with their alternative splicing in
      response to cocaine administration. In addition, 5hmC alterations at certain loci
      persisted for at least 1 month after cocaine exposure. Together, these reveal a
      previously unknown epigenetic mechanism of cocaine action and provide new insight
      into how 5hmC regulates transcription in brain in vivo.

TI  - Retrieval induces adaptive forgetting of competing memories via cortical pattern 
      suppression.
PG  - 582-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3973 [doi]
AB  - Remembering a past experience can, surprisingly, cause forgetting. Forgetting
      arises when other competing traces interfere with retrieval and inhibitory
      control mechanisms are engaged to suppress the distraction they cause. This form 
      of forgetting is considered to be adaptive because it reduces future
      interference. The effect of this proposed inhibition process on competing
      memories has, however, never been observed, as behavioral methods are 'blind' to 
      retrieval dynamics and neuroimaging methods have not isolated retrieval of
      individual memories. We developed a canonical template tracking method to
      quantify the activation state of individual target memories and competitors
      during retrieval. This method revealed that repeatedly retrieving target memories
      suppressed cortical patterns unique to competitors. Pattern suppression was
      related to engagement of prefrontal regions that have been implicated in
      resolving retrieval competition and, critically, predicted later forgetting.
      Thus, our findings demonstrate a cortical pattern suppression mechanism through
      which remembering adaptively shapes which aspects of our past remain accessible.

TI  - NPY signaling inhibits extended amygdala CRF neurons to suppress binge alcohol
      drinking.
PG  - 545-52
LID - 10.1038/nn.3972 [doi]
AB  - Binge alcohol drinking is a tremendous public health problem because it leads to 
      the development of numerous pathologies, including alcohol abuse and anxiety. It 
      is thought to do so by hijacking brain systems that regulate stress and reward,
      including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The
      central actions of NPY and CRF have opposing functions in the regulation of
      emotional and reward-seeking behaviors; thus, dysfunctional interactions between 
      these peptidergic systems could be involved in the development of these
      pathologies. We used converging physiological, pharmacological and chemogenetic
      approaches to identify a precise neural mechanism in the bed nucleus of the stria
      terminalis (BNST), a limbic brain region involved in pathological reward and
      anxiety behaviors, underlying the interactions between NPY and CRF in the
      regulation of binge alcohol drinking in both mice and monkeys. We found that NPY 
      Y1 receptor (Y1R) activation in the BNST suppressed binge alcohol drinking by
      enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission specifically in CRF neurons via a
      previously unknown Gi-mediated, PKA-dependent postsynaptic mechanism.
      Furthermore, chronic alcohol drinking led to persistent alterations in Y1R
      function in the BNST of both mice and monkeys, highlighting the enduring,
      conserved nature of this effect across mammalian species. Together, these data
      provide both a cellular locus and signaling framework for the development of new 
      therapeutics for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases, including alcohol use
      disorders.

TI  - Explicit memory creation during sleep demonstrates a causal role of place cells
      in navigation.
PG  - 493-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.3970 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal place cells assemblies are believed to support the cognitive map, and
      their reactivations during sleep are thought to be involved in spatial memory
      consolidation. By triggering intracranial rewarding stimulations by place cell
      spikes during sleep, we induced an explicit memory trace, leading to a
      goal-directed behavior toward the place field. This demonstrates that place
      cells' activity during sleep still conveys relevant spatial information and that 
      this activity is functionally significant for navigation.

TI  - The dorsal posterior insula subserves a fundamental role in human pain.
PG  - 499-500
LID - 10.1038/nn.3969 [doi]
AB  - Several brain regions have been implicated in human painful experiences, but none
      have been proven to be specific to pain. We exploited arterial spin-labeling
      quantitative perfusion imaging and a newly developed procedure to identify a
      specific role for the dorsal posterior insula (dpIns) in pain. Tract tracing
      studies in animals identify a similar region as fundamental to nociception, which
      suggests the dpIns is its human homolog and, as such, a potential therapeutic
      target.

TI  - Somatostatin cells regulate sensory response fidelity via subtractive inhibition 
      in olfactory cortex.
PG  - 531-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.3971 [doi]
AB  - Diverse types of local GABAergic interneurons shape the cortical representation
      of sensory information. Here we show how somatostatin-expressing interneurons
      (SOM cells) contribute to odor coding in mouse olfactory cortex. We find that
      odor-tuned SOM cells regulate principal cells through a purely subtractive
      operation that is independent of odor identity or intensity. This operation
      enhances the salience of odor-evoked activity without changing cortical odor
      tuning. SOM cells inhibit both principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons,
      indicating that subtractive inhibition reflects the interplay of multiple classes
      of interneurons.

      as well as limited NSC self-renewal and exhaustion in a few weeks. We further
      unraveled the mechanisms of neuronal subtype generation, finding that a higher
      proportion of NSCs were dedicated to generate deep granule cells in the olfactory
      bulb and that larger clones were produced by these NSCs.

TI  - Internally organized mechanisms of the head direction sense.
PG  - 569-75
LID - 10.1038/nn.3968 [doi]
AB  - The head-direction (HD) system functions as a compass, with member neurons
      robustly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head points in a
      specific direction. HD neurons may be driven by peripheral sensors or, as
      computational models postulate, internally generated (attractor) mechanisms. We
      addressed the contributions of stimulus-driven and internally generated activity 
      by recording ensembles of HD neurons in the antero-dorsal thalamic nucleus and
      the post-subiculum of mice by comparing their activity in various brain states.
      The temporal correlation structure of HD neurons was preserved during sleep,
      characterized by a 60 degrees -wide correlated neuronal firing (activity packet),
      both within and across these two brain structures. During rapid eye movement
      sleep, the spontaneous drift of the activity packet was similar to that observed 
      during waking and accelerated tenfold during slow-wave sleep. These findings
      demonstrate that peripheral inputs impinge on an internally organized network,
      which provides amplification and enhanced precision of the HD signal.

AB  - Orientation selectivity is a cornerstone property of vision, commonly believed to
      emerge in the primary visual cortex. We found that reliable orientation
      information could be detected even earlier, in the human lateral geniculate
      nucleus, and that attentional feedback selectively altered these orientation
      responses. This attentional modulation may allow the visual system to modify
      incoming feature-specific signals at the earliest possible processing site.

TI  - Mitochondrial control by DRP1 in brain tumor initiating cells.
PG  - 501-10
LID - 10.1038/nn.3960 [doi]
AB  - Brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) co-opt the neuronal high affinity glucose
      transporter, GLUT3, to withstand metabolic stress. We investigated another
      mechanism critical to brain metabolism, mitochondrial morphology, in BTICs. BTIC 
      mitochondria were fragmented relative to non-BTIC tumor cell mitochondria,
      suggesting that BTICs increase mitochondrial fission. The essential mediator of
      mitochondrial fission, dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), showed activating
      phosphorylation in BTICs and inhibitory phosphorylation in non-BTIC tumor cells. 
      Targeting DRP1 using RNA interference or pharmacologic inhibition induced BTIC
      apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Downstream, DRP1 activity regulated the
      essential metabolic stress sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and
      targeting AMPK rescued the effects of DRP1 disruption. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 
      (CDK5) phosphorylated DRP1 to increase its activity in BTICs, whereas
      Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CAMK2) inhibited DRP1 in non-BTIC
      tumor cells, suggesting that tumor cell differentiation induces a regulatory
      switch in mitochondrial morphology. DRP1 activation correlated with poor
      prognosis in glioblastoma, suggesting that mitochondrial dynamics may represent a
      therapeutic target for BTICs.

TI  - Anxious individuals have difficulty learning the causal statistics of aversive
      environments.
PG  - 590-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.3961 [doi]
AB  - Statistical regularities in the causal structure of the environment enable us to 
      predict the probable outcomes of our actions. Environments differ in the extent
      to which action-outcome contingencies are stable or volatile. Difficulty in being
      able to use this information to optimally update outcome predictions might
      contribute to the decision-making difficulties seen in anxiety. We tested this
      using an aversive learning task manipulating environmental volatility. Human
      participants low in trait anxiety matched updating of their outcome predictions
      to the volatility of the current environment, as predicted by a Bayesian model.
      Individuals with high trait anxiety showed less ability to adjust updating of
      outcome expectancies between stable and volatile environments. This was linked to
      reduced sensitivity of the pupil dilatory response to volatility, potentially
      indicative of altered norepinephrinergic responsivity to changes in this aspect
      of environmental information.

TI  - GLUT1 reductions exacerbate Alzheimer's disease vasculo-neuronal dysfunction and 
      degeneration.
PG  - 521-530
LID - 10.1038/nn.3966 [doi]
AB  - The glucose transporter GLUT1 at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediates glucose
      transport into the brain. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early
      reductions in glucose transport associated with diminished GLUT1 expression at
      the BBB. Whether GLUT1 reduction influences disease pathogenesis remains,
      however, elusive. Here we show that GLUT1 deficiency in mice overexpressing
      amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) precursor protein leads to early cerebral
      microvascular degeneration, blood flow reductions and dysregulation and BBB
      breakdown, and to accelerated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) pathology, reduced
      Abeta clearance, diminished neuronal activity, behavioral deficits, and
      progressive neuronal loss and neurodegeneration that develop after initial
      cerebrovascular degenerative changes. We also show that GLUT1 deficiency in
      endothelium, but not in astrocytes, initiates the vascular phenotype as shown by 
      BBB breakdown. Thus, reduced BBB GLUT1 expression worsens Alzheimer's disease
      cerebrovascular degeneration, neuropathology and cognitive function, suggesting
      that GLUT1 may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease
      vasculo-neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

TI  - Neural circular RNAs are derived from synaptic genes and regulated by development
      and plasticity.
PG  - 603-610
LID - 10.1038/nn.3975 [doi]
AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have re-emerged as an interesting RNA species. Using
      deep RNA profiling in different mouse tissues, we observed that circRNAs were
      substantially enriched in brain and a disproportionate fraction of them were
      derived from host genes that encode synaptic proteins. Moreover, on the basis of 
      separate profiling of the RNAs localized in neuronal cell bodies and neuropil,
      circRNAs were, on average, more enriched in the neuropil than their host gene
      mRNA isoforms. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization, we visualized circRNA
      punctae in the dendrites of neurons. Consistent with the idea that circRNAs might
      regulate synaptic function during development, many circRNAs changed their
      abundance abruptly at a time corresponding to synaptogenesis. In addition,
      following a homeostatic downscaling of neuronal activity many circRNAs exhibited 
      substantial up- or downregulation. Together, our data indicate that brain
      circRNAs are positioned to respond to and regulate synaptic function.

      alpha2 adrenergic agonists.
PG  - 553-561
LID - 10.1038/nn.3957 [doi]
AB  - Do sedatives engage natural sleep pathways? It is usually assumed that
      anesthetic-induced sedation and loss of righting reflex (LORR) arise by
      influencing the same circuitry to lesser or greater extents. For the alpha2
      adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine, we found that sedation and LORR were
      in fact distinct states, requiring different brain areas: the preoptic
      hypothalamic area and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. Selective knockdown of 
      alpha2A adrenergic receptors from the LC abolished dexmedetomidine-induced LORR, 
      but not sedation. Instead, we found that dexmedetomidine-induced sedation
      resembled the deep recovery sleep that follows sleep deprivation. We used TetTag 
      pharmacogenetics in mice to functionally mark neurons activated in the preoptic
      hypothalamus during dexmedetomidine-induced sedation or recovery sleep. The
      neuronal ensembles could then be selectively reactivated. In both cases,
      non-rapid eye movement sleep, with the accompanying drop in body temperature, was
      recapitulated. Thus, alpha2 adrenergic receptor-induced sedation and recovery
      sleep share hypothalamic circuitry sufficient for producing these behavioral
      states.

PG  - 511-20

AB  - Axonal damage has been associated with aberrant protein trafficking. We examined 
      a newly characterized class of compounds that target nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling
      by binding to the catalytic groove of the nuclear export protein XPO1 (also known
      as CRM1, chromosome region maintenance protein 1). Oral administration of
      reversible CRM1 inhibitors in preclinical murine models of demyelination
      significantly attenuated disease progression, even when started after the onset
      of paralysis. Clinical efficacy was associated with decreased proliferation of
      immune cells, characterized by nuclear accumulation of cell cycle inhibitors, and
      preservation of cytoskeletal integrity even in demyelinated axons.
      Neuroprotection was not limited to models of demyelination, but was also observed
      in another mouse model of axonal damage (that is, kainic acid injection) and
      detected in cultured neurons after knockdown of Xpo1, the gene encoding CRM1. A
      proteomic screen for target molecules revealed that CRM1 inhibitors in neurons
      prevented nuclear export of molecules associated with axonal damage while
      retaining transcription factors modulating neuroprotection.

TI  - What does gamma coherence tell us about inter-regional neural communication?
PG  - 484-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3952 [doi]
AB  - Neural oscillations have been measured and interpreted in multitudinous ways,
      with a variety of hypothesized functions in physiology, information processing
      and cognition. Much attention has been paid in recent years to gamma-band (30-100
      Hz) oscillations and synchrony, with an increasing interest in 'high gamma' (>100
      Hz) signals as mesoscopic measures of inter-regional communication. The
      biophysical origins of the measured variables are often difficult to precisely
      identify, however, making their interpretation fraught with pitfalls. Here we
      discuss how measurements of inter-regional gamma coherence can be prone to
      misinterpretation and suggest strategies for deciphering the roles that
      synchronized oscillations across brain networks may play in neural function.

TI  - The dissociable effects of punishment and reward on motor learning.
PG  - 597-602
LID - 10.1038/nn.3956 [doi]
AB  - A common assumption regarding error-based motor learning (motor adaptation) in
      humans is that its underlying mechanism is automatic and insensitive to reward-
      or punishment-based feedback. Contrary to this hypothesis, we show in a double
      dissociation that the two have independent effects on the learning and retention 
      components of motor adaptation. Negative feedback, whether graded or binary,
      accelerated learning. While it was not necessary for the negative feedback to be 
      coupled to monetary loss, it had to be clearly related to the actual performance 
      on the preceding movement. Positive feedback did not speed up learning, but it
      increased retention of the motor memory when performance feedback was withdrawn. 
      These findings reinforce the view that independent mechanisms underpin learning
      and retention in motor adaptation, reject the assumption that motor adaptation is
      independent of motivational feedback, and raise new questions regarding the
      neural basis of negative and positive motivational feedback in motor learning.

PG  - 562-568

AB  - Organization of behavior requires rapid coordination of brainstem and forebrain
      activity. The exact mechanisms of effective communication between these regions
      are presently unclear. The intralaminar thalamic nuclei (IL) probably serves as a
      central hub in this circuit by connecting the critical brainstem and forebrain
      areas. We found that GABAergic and glycinergic fibers ascending from the pontine 
      reticular formation (PRF) of the brainstem evoked fast and reliable inhibition in
      the IL via large, multisynaptic terminals. This inhibition was fine-tuned through
      heterogeneous GABAergic and glycinergic receptor ratios expressed at individual
      synapses. Optogenetic activation of PRF axons in the IL of freely moving mice led
      to behavioral arrest and transient interruption of awake cortical activity. An
      afferent system with comparable morphological features was also found in the
      human IL. These data reveal an evolutionarily conserved ascending system that
      gates forebrain activity through fast and powerful synaptic inhibition of the IL.

PG  - 576-81
LID - 10.1038/nn.3954 [doi]
AB  - Much of our knowledge of the world depends on learning associations (for example,
      face-name), for which the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are
      critical. HPC-PFC interactions have rarely been studied in monkeys, whose
      cognitive and mnemonic abilities are akin to those of humans. We found functional
      differences and frequency-specific interactions between HPC and PFC of monkeys
      learning object pair associations, an animal model of human explicit memory. PFC 
      spiking activity reflected learning in parallel with behavioral performance,
      whereas HPC neurons reflected feedback about whether trial-and-error guesses were
      correct or incorrect. Theta-band HPC-PFC synchrony was stronger after errors, was
      driven primarily by PFC to HPC directional influences and decreased with
      learning. In contrast, alpha/beta-band synchrony was stronger after correct
      trials, was driven more by HPC and increased with learning. Rapid object
      associative learning may occur in PFC, whereas HPC may guide neocortical
      plasticity by signaling success or failure via oscillatory synchrony in different
      frequency bands.

PG  - 367-72

AB  - Decades of experimental work have established an imbalance of excitation and
      inhibition as the leading mechanism of the transition from normal brain function 
      to seizure. In epilepsy, these transitions are rare and abrupt. Transition
      processes incorporating positive feedback, such as activity-dependent
      disinhibition, could provide these uncommon timing features. A rapidly expanding 
      array of genetic etiologies will help delineate the molecular mechanism(s). This 
      delineation will entail quite a bit of cell biology. The genes discovered so far 
      are more remarkable for their diversity than their similarities.

AB  - The epilepsies and related disorders of brain circuitry present significant
      challenges associated with the use of human cells to study disease mechanisms and
      develop new therapies. Some of these obstacles are being overcome through the use
      of induced pluripotent stem cells to obtain patient-derived neural cells for in
      vitro studies and as a source of cell-based treatments. The field is evolving
      rapidly with the addition of genome-editing approaches and expanding protocols
      for generating different neural cell types and three-dimensional tissues, but the
      application of these techniques to neurological disorders, and particularly to
      the epilepsies, is in its infancy. We discuss the progress made and the distinct 
      advantages and limitations of using patient-derived cells to study or treat
      epilepsy, as well as critical future directions for the field.

TI  - Microcircuits and their interactions in epilepsy: is the focus out of focus?
PG  - 351-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3950 [doi]
AB  - Epileptic seizures represent dysfunctional neural networks dominated by excessive
      and/or hypersynchronous activity. Recent progress in the field has outlined two
      concepts regarding mechanisms of seizure generation, or ictogenesis. First, all
      seizures, even those associated with what have historically been thought of as
      'primary generalized' epilepsies, appear to originate in local microcircuits and 
      then propagate from that initial ictogenic zone. Second, seizures propagate
      through cerebral networks and engage microcircuits in distal nodes, a process
      that can be weakened or even interrupted by suppressing activity in such nodes.
      We describe various microcircuit motifs, with a special emphasis on one that has 
      been broadly implicated in several epilepsies: feed-forward inhibition.
      Furthermore, we discuss how, in the dynamic network in which seizures propagate, 
      focusing on circuit 'choke points' remote from the initiation site might be as
      important as that of the initial dysfunction, the seizure 'focus'.

TI  - Pathway-driven discovery of epilepsy genes.
PG  - 344-50
LID - 10.1038/nn.3933 [doi]
AB  - Epilepsy genes deliver critical insights into the molecular control of brain
      synchronization and are revolutionizing our understanding and treatment of the
      disease. The epilepsy-associated genome is rapidly expanding, and two powerful
      complementary approaches, isolation of de novo exome variants in patients and
      targeted mutagenesis in model systems, account for the steep increase. In sheer
      number, the tally of genes linked to seizures will likely match that of cancer
      and exceed it in biological diversity. The proteins act within most intracellular
      compartments and span the molecular determinants of firing and wiring in the
      developing brain. Every facet of neurotransmission, from dendritic spine to
      exocytotic machinery, is in play, and defects of synaptic inhibition are
      over-represented. The contributions of somatic mutations and noncoding microRNAs 
      are also being explored. The functional spectrum of established epilepsy genes
      and the arrival of rapid, precise technologies for genome editing now provide a
      robust scaffold to prioritize hypothesis-driven discovery and further populate
      this genetic proto-map. Although each gene identified offers translational
      potential to stratify patient care, the complexity of individual variation and
      covert actions of genetic modifiers may confound single-gene solutions for the
      clinical disorder. In vivo genetic deconstruction of epileptic networks, ex vivo 
      validation of variant profiles in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells,
      in silico variant modeling and modifier gene discovery, now in their earliest
      stages, will help clarify individual patterns. Because seizures stand at the
      crossroads of all neuronal synchronization disorders in the developing and aging 
      brain, the neurobiological analysis of epilepsy-associated genes provides an
      extraordinary gateway to new insights into higher cortical function.

TI  - Animal models in epilepsy research: legacies and new directions.
PG  - 339-43

AB  - Human epilepsies encompass a wide variety of clinical, behavioral and electrical 
      manifestations. Correspondingly, studies of this disease in nonhuman animals have
      brought forward an equally wide array of animal models; that is, species and
      acute or chronic seizure induction protocols. Epilepsy research has a long
      history of comparative anatomical and physiological studies on a range of mostly 
      mammalian species. Nonetheless, a relatively limited number of rodent models have
      emerged as the primary choices for most investigations. In many cases, these
      animal models are selected on the basis of convenience or tradition, although
      technical or experimental rationale does, and should, factor into these
      decisions. More complex mammalian brains and genetic model organisms including
      zebrafish have been studied less, but offer substantial advantages that are
      becoming widely recognized.

PG  - 331-8

AB  - Current treatment options for epilepsy are inadequate, as too many patients
      suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from negative side effects of treatment. In
      addition to these clinical challenges, our scientific understanding of epilepsy
      is incomplete. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide
      unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and
      cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now 
      possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in
      epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention 
      strategies. Such specificity of intervention also has the potential for direct
      therapeutic benefits, allowing healthy tissue and network functions to continue
      unaffected. In this Perspective, we discuss promising uses of these technologies 
      for the study of seizures and epilepsy, as well as potential use of these
      strategies for clinical therapies.

TI  - In vivo coincidence detection in mammalian sound localization generates phase
      delays.
PG  - 444-52
LID - 10.1038/nn.3948 [doi]
AB  - Sound localization critically depends on detection of differences in arrival time
      of sounds at the two ears (acoustic delay). The fundamental mechanisms are
      debated, but all proposals include a process of coincidence detection and a
      separate source of internal delay that offsets the acoustic delay and determines 
      neural tuning. We used in vivo patch-clamp recordings of binaural neurons in the 
      Mongolian gerbil and pharmacological manipulations to directly compare neuronal
      input to output and to separate excitation from inhibition. Our results cannot be
      accounted for by existing models and reveal that coincidence detection is not an 
      instantaneous process, but is instead shaped by the interaction of intrinsic
      conductances with preceding synaptic activity. This interaction generates an
      internal delay as an intrinsic part of the process of coincidence detection. The 
      multiplication and time-shifting stages thought to extract synchronous activity
      in many brain areas can therefore be combined in a single operation.

AB  - Lapses of attention can have negative consequences, including accidents and lost 
      productivity. Here we used closed-loop neurofeedback to improve sustained
      attention abilities and reduce the frequency of lapses. During a sustained
      attention task, the focus of attention was monitored in real time with
      multivariate pattern analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging data. When indicators
      of an attentional lapse were detected in the brain, we gave human participants
      feedback by making the task more difficult. Behavioral performance improved after
      one training session, relative to control participants who received feedback from
      other participants' brains. This improvement was largest when feedback carried
      information from a frontoparietal attention network. A neural consequence of
      training was that the basal ganglia and ventral temporal cortex came to represent
      attentional states more distinctively. These findings suggest that attentional
      failures do not reflect an upper limit on cognitive potential and that attention 
      can be trained with appropriate feedback about neural signals.

PG  - 393-401
LID - 10.1038/nn.3946 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal microcircuits in the superficial layers of the mammalian cortex provide 
      the substrate for associative cortical computation. Inhibitory interneurons
      constitute an essential component of the circuitry and are fundamental to the
      integration of local and long-range information. Here we report that, during
      early development, superficially positioned Reelin-expressing neurogliaform
      interneurons in the mouse somatosensory cortex receive afferent innervation from 
      both cortical and thalamic excitatory sources. Attenuation of ascending sensory, 
      but not intracortical, excitation leads to axo-dendritic morphological defects in
      these interneurons. Moreover, abrogation of the NMDA receptors through which the 
      thalamic inputs signal results in a similar phenotype, as well as in the
      selective loss of thalamic and a concomitant increase in intracortical
      connectivity. These results suggest that thalamic inputs are critical in
      determining the balance between local and long-range connectivity and are
      fundamental to the proper integration of Reelin-expressing interneurons into
      nascent cortical circuits.

      axons.
PG  - 386-92
LID - 10.1038/nn.3945 [doi]
AB  - Mesoaccumbens fibers are thought to co-release dopamine and glutamate. However,
      the mechanism is unclear, and co-release by mesoaccumbens fibers has not been
      documented. Using electron microcopy, we found that some mesoaccumbens fibers
      have vesicular transporters for dopamine (VMAT2) in axon segments that are
      continuous with axon terminals that lack VMAT2, but contain vesicular glutamate
      transporters type 2 (VGluT2). In vivo overexpression of VMAT2 did not change the 
      segregation of the two vesicular types, suggesting the existence of highly
      regulated mechanisms for maintaining this segregation. The mesoaccumbens axon
      terminals containing VGluT2 vesicles make asymmetric synapses, commonly
      associated with excitatory signaling. Using optogenetics, we found that dopamine 
      and glutamate were released from the same mesoaccumbens fibers. These findings
      reveal a complex type of signaling by mesoaccumbens fibers in which dopamine and 
      glutamate can be released from the same axons, but are not normally released at
      the same site or from the same synaptic vesicles.

AB  - Addictive substances mediate positive and negative states promoting persistent
      drug use. However, substrates for aversive effects of drugs remain elusive. We
      found that, in mouse lateral habenula (LHb) neurons targeting the rostromedial
      tegmental nucleus, cocaine enhanced glutamatergic transmission, reduced K(+)
      currents and increased excitability. GluA1 trafficking in LHb was instrumental
      for these cocaine-evoked modifications and drug-driven aversive behaviors.
      Altogether, our results suggest that long-lasting adaptations in LHb shape
      negative symptoms after drug taking.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a crucial role in modulating neural 
      and behavioral plasticity to drugs of abuse. We found a persistent downregulation
      of exon-specific Bdnf expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in response 
      to chronic opiate exposure, which was mediated by specific epigenetic
      modifications at the corresponding Bdnf gene promoters. Exposure to chronic
      morphine increased stalling of RNA polymerase II at these Bdnf promoters in VTA
      and altered permissive and repressive histone modifications and occupancy of
      their regulatory proteins at the specific promoters. Furthermore, we found that
      morphine suppressed binding of phospho-CREB (cAMP response element binding
      protein) to Bdnf promoters in VTA, which resulted from enrichment of
      trimethylated H3K27 at the promoters, and that decreased NURR1 (nuclear receptor 
      related-1) expression also contributed to Bdnf repression and associated
      behavioral plasticity to morphine. Our findings suggest previously unknown
      epigenetic mechanisms of morphine-induced molecular and behavioral
      neuroadaptations.

LID - 10.1038/nn.3935 [doi]
AB  - Evidence has begun to emerge for microRNAs as regulators of synaptic signaling,
      specifically acting to control postsynaptic responsiveness during synaptic
      transmission. In this report, we provide evidence that Drosophila melanogaster
      miR-1000 acts presynaptically to regulate glutamate release at the synapse by
      controlling expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut). Genetic
      deletion of miR-1000 led to elevated apoptosis in the brain as a result of
      glutamatergic excitotoxicity. The seed-similar miR-137 regulated VGluT2
      expression in mouse neurons. These conserved miRNAs share a neuroprotective
      function in the brains of flies and mice. Drosophila miR-1000 showed
      activity-dependent expression, which might serve as a mechanism to allow neuronal
      activity to fine-tune the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission.

TI  - Optogenetic perturbation of preBotzinger complex inhibitory neurons modulates
      respiratory pattern.
PG  - 408-14
LID - 10.1038/nn.3938 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitory neurons make up a substantial fraction of the neurons in the
      preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a site that is critical for mammalian eupneic
      breathing. We investigated the role of glycinergic preBotC neurons in respiratory
      rhythmogenesis in mice using optogenetically targeted excitation and inhibition. 
      Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) or Archaerhodopsin (Arch) were expressed in glycinergic
      preBotC neurons of glycine transporter 2 (Glyt2, also known as Slc6a5)-Cre mice. 
      In ChR2-transfected mice, brief inspiratory-phase bilateral photostimulation
      targeting the preBotC prematurely terminated inspiration, whereas
      expiratory-phase photostimulation delayed the onset of the next inspiration.
      Prolonged photostimulation produced apneas lasting as long as the light pulse.
      Inspiratory-phase photoinhibition in Arch-transfected mice during inspiration
      increased tidal volume without altering inspiratory duration, whereas
      expiratory-phase photoinhibition shortened the latency until the next
      inspiration. During persistent apneas, prolonged photoinhibition restored
      rhythmic breathing. We conclude that glycinergic preBotC neurons modulate
      inspiratory pattern and are important for reflex apneas, but that the rhythm can 
      persist after substantial dampening of their activity.

      vivo.
PG  - 402-7
LID - 10.1038/nn.3936 [doi]
AB  - Regulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) membrane trafficking is critical for synaptic
      plasticity, as well as for learning and memory. However, the mechanisms of AMPAR 
      trafficking in vivo remain elusive. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy in the
      mouse somatosensory barrel cortex, we found that acute whisker stimulation led to
      a significant increase in the intensity of surface AMPAR GluA1 subunit (sGluA1)
      in both spines and dendritic shafts and a small increase in spine size relative
      to prestimulation values. Interestingly, the initial spine properties biased
      spine changes following whisker stimulation. Changes in spine sGluA1 intensity
      were positively correlated with changes in spine size and dendritic shaft sGluA1 
      intensity following whisker stimulation. The increase in spine sGluA1 intensity
      evoked by whisker stimulation was NMDA receptor dependent and long lasting,
      similar to major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain. In this study we were
      able to observe experience-dependent AMPAR trafficking in real time and
      characterize, in vivo, a major form of synaptic plasticity in the brain.

AB  - To examine the interaction between molecular, electrical and behavioral circadian
      rhythms, we combined optogenetic manipulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
      firing rate with bioluminescence imaging and locomotor activity monitoring.
      Manipulating firing rate reset circadian rhythms both ex vivo and in vivo, and
      this resetting required spikes and network communication. This suggests that SCN 
      firing rate is fundamental to circadian pacemaking as both an input to and output
      of the molecular clockworks.

TI  - Planning activity for internally generated reward goals in monkey amygdala
      neurons.
PG  - 461-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3925 [doi]
AB  - The best rewards are often distant and can only be achieved by planning and
      decision-making over several steps. We designed a multi-step choice task in which
      monkeys followed internal plans to save rewards toward self-defined goals. During
      this self-controlled behavior, amygdala neurons showed future-oriented activity
      that reflected the animal's plan to obtain specific rewards several trials ahead.
      This prospective activity encoded crucial components of the animal's plan,
      including value and length of the planned choice sequence. It began on initial
      trials when a plan would be formed, reappeared step by step until reward receipt,
      and readily updated with a new sequence. It predicted performance, including
      errors, and typically disappeared during instructed behavior. Such prospective
      activity could underlie the formation and pursuit of internal plans
      characteristic of goal-directed behavior. The existence of neuronal planning
      activity in the amygdala suggests that this structure is important in guiding
      behavior toward internally generated, distant goals.

TI  - Social deficits in IRSp53 mutant mice improved by NMDAR and mGluR5 suppression.
PG  - 435-43
LID - 10.1038/nn.3927 [doi]
AB  - Social deficits are observed in diverse psychiatric disorders, including autism
      spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. We found that mice lacking the excitatory
      synaptic signaling scaffold IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) showed impaired social 
      interaction and communication. Treatment of IRSp53(-/-) mice, which display
      enhanced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function in the hippocampus, with memantine, an
      NMDAR antagonist, or MPEP, a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist that
      indirectly inhibits NMDAR function, normalized social interaction. This social
      rescue was accompanied by normalization of NMDAR function and plasticity in the
      hippocampus and neuronal firing in the medial prefrontal cortex. These results,
      together with the reduced NMDAR function implicated in social impairments,
      suggest that deviation of NMDAR function in either direction leads to social
      deficits and that correcting the deviation has beneficial effects.

AB  - The striatum is required for the acquisition of procedural memories, but its
      contribution to motor control once learning has occurred is unclear. We created a
      task in which rats learned a difficult motor sequence characterized by fine-tuned
      changes in running speed adjusted to spatial and temporal constraints. After
      training and extensive practice, we found that the behavior was habitual, yet
      tetrode recordings in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) revealed continuous
      integrative representations of running speed, position and time. These
      representations were weak in naive rats that were hand-guided to perform the same
      sequence and developed slowly after learning. Finally, DLS inactivation in
      well-trained animals preserved the structure of the sequence while increasing its
      trial-by-trial variability. We conclude that, after learning, the DLS
      continuously integrates task-relevant information to constrain the execution of
      motor habits. Our results provide a straightforward mechanism by which the basal 
      ganglia may contribute to habit formation and motor control.

TI  - Astrocytic adenosine receptor A2A and Gs-coupled signaling regulate memory.
PG  - 423-34
LID - 10.1038/nn.3930 [doi]
AB  - Astrocytes express a variety of G protein-coupled receptors and might influence
      cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. However, the roles of
      astrocytic Gs-coupled receptors in cognitive function are not known. We found
      that humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had increased levels of the Gs-coupled 
      adenosine receptor A2A in astrocytes. Conditional genetic removal of these
      receptors enhanced long-term memory in young and aging mice and increased the
      levels of Arc (also known as Arg3.1), an immediate-early gene that is required
      for long-term memory. Chemogenetic activation of astrocytic Gs-coupled signaling 
      reduced long-term memory in mice without affecting learning. Like humans with AD,
      aging mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) showed increased
      levels of astrocytic A2A receptors. Conditional genetic removal of these
      receptors enhanced memory in aging hAPP mice. Together, these findings establish 
      a regulatory role for astrocytic Gs-coupled receptors in memory and suggest that 
      AD-linked increases in astrocytic A2A receptor levels contribute to memory loss.

AB  - Similarities in neocortical circuit organization across areas and species suggest
      a common strategy to process diverse types of information, including sensation
      from diverse modalities, motor control and higher cognitive processes. Cortical
      neurons belong to a small number of main classes. The properties of these
      classes, including their local and long-range connectivity, developmental
      history, gene expression, intrinsic physiology and in vivo activity patterns, are
      remarkably similar across areas. Each class contains subclasses; for a rapidly
      growing number of these, conserved patterns of input and output connections are
      also becoming evident. The ensemble of circuit connections constitutes a basic
      circuit pattern that appears to be repeated across neocortical areas, with area- 
      and species-specific modifications. Such 'serially homologous' organization may
      adapt individual neocortical regions to the type of information each must
      process.

TI  - The development of cortical circuits for motion discrimination.
PG  - 252-61
LID - 10.1038/nn.3921 [doi]
AB  - Stimulus discrimination depends on the selectivity and variability of neural
      responses, as well as the size and correlation structure of the responsive
      population. For direction discrimination in visual cortex, only the selectivity
      of neurons has been well characterized across development. Here we show in
      ferrets that at eye opening, the cortical response to visual stimulation exhibits
      several immaturities, including a high density of active neurons that display
      prominent wave-like activity, a high degree of variability and strong noise
      correlations. Over the next three weeks, the population response becomes
      increasingly sparse, wave-like activity disappears, and variability and noise
      correlations are markedly reduced. Similar changes were observed in identified
      neuronal populations imaged repeatedly over days. Furthermore, experience with a 
      moving stimulus was capable of driving a reduction in noise correlations over a
      matter of hours. These changes in variability and correlation contribute
      significantly to a marked improvement in direction discriminability over
      development.

      histone pathways.
PG  - 199-209
LID - 10.1038/nn.3922 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders have identified
      multiple genetic associations with such disorders, but better methods are needed 
      to derive the underlying biological mechanisms that these signals indicate. We
      sought to identify biological pathways in GWAS data from over 60,000 participants
      from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We developed an analysis framework to
      rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score
      across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric
      disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone
      methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found
      statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and
      neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study
      indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular
      biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between
      disorders. Our results confirm known mechanisms and suggest several novel
      insights into the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

TI  - The idiosyncratic brain: distortion of spontaneous connectivity patterns in
      autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 302-9
LID - 10.1038/nn.3919 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with a reduction in resting
      state functional connectivity, though this assertion has recently been challenged
      by reports of increased connectivity in ASD. To address these contradictory
      findings, we examined both inter- and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in
      several resting state data sets acquired from adults with high-functioning ASD
      and matched control participants. Our results reveal areas of both increased and 
      decreased connectivity in multiple ASD groups as compared to control groups. We
      propose that this heterogeneity stems from a previously unrecognized ASD
      characteristic: idiosyncratic distortions of the functional connectivity pattern 
      relative to the typical, canonical template. The magnitude of an individual's
      pattern distortion in homotopic interhemispheric connectivity correlated
      significantly with behavioral symptoms of ASD. We propose that individualized
      alterations in functional connectivity organization are a core characteristic of 
      high-functioning ASD, and that this may account for previous discrepant findings.

TI  - Visual recognition memory, manifested as long-term habituation, requires synaptic
      plasticity in V1.
PG  - 262-71
LID - 10.1038/nn.3920 [doi]
AB  - Familiarity with stimuli that bring neither reward nor punishment, manifested
      through behavioral habituation, enables organisms to detect novelty and devote
      cognition to important elements of the environment. Here we describe in mice a
      form of long-term behavioral habituation to visual grating stimuli that is
      selective for stimulus orientation. Orientation-selective habituation (OSH) can
      be observed both in exploratory behavior in an open arena and in a stereotyped
      motor response to visual stimuli in head-restrained mice. We found that the
      latter behavioral response, termed a 'vidget', requires V1. Parallel
      electrophysiological recordings in V1 revealed that plasticity, in the form of
      stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP), occurred in layer 4 of V1 as OSH 
      developed. Local manipulations of V1 that prevented and reversed
      electrophysiological modifications likewise prevented and reversed memory
      demonstrated behaviorally. These findings suggest that a form of long-term visual
      recognition memory is stored via synaptic plasticity in primary sensory cortex.

AB  - Neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode a diverse array of
      sensory and mnemonic signals, but little is known about how this information is
      dynamically routed during decision making. We analyzed the neuronal activity in
      the DLPFC of monkeys performing a probabilistic reversal task where information
      about the probability and magnitude of reward was provided by the target color
      and numerical cues, respectively. The location of the target of a given color was
      randomized across trials and therefore was not relevant for subsequent choices.
      DLPFC neurons encoded signals related to both task-relevant and irrelevant
      features, but only task-relevant mnemonic signals were encoded congruently with
      choice signals. Furthermore, only the task-relevant signals related to previous
      events were more robustly encoded following rewarded outcomes. Thus, multiple
      types of neural signals are flexibly routed in the DLPFC so as to favor actions
      that maximize reward.

TI  - Neddylation inhibition impairs spine development, destabilizes synapses and
      deteriorates cognition.
PG  - 239-51
LID - 10.1038/nn.3912 [doi]
AB  - Neddylation is a ubiquitylation-like pathway that controls cell cycle and
      proliferation by covalently conjugating Nedd8 to specific targets. However, its
      role in neurons, nonreplicating postmitotic cells, remains unexplored. Here we
      report that Nedd8 conjugation increased during postnatal brain development and is
      active in mature synapses, where many proteins are neddylated. We show that
      neddylation controls spine development during neuronal maturation and spine
      stability in mature neurons. We found that neddylated PSD-95 was present in
      spines and that neddylation on Lys202 of PSD-95 is required for the proactive
      role of the scaffolding protein in spine maturation and synaptic transmission.
      Finally, we developed Nae1(CamKIIalpha-CreERT2) mice, in which neddylation is
      conditionally ablated in adult excitatory forebrain neurons. These mice showed
      synaptic loss, impaired neurotransmission and severe cognitive deficits. In
      summary, our results establish neddylation as an active post-translational
      modification in the synapse regulating the maturation, stability and function of 
      dendritic spines.

TI  - Olfactory bulb coding of odors, mixtures and sniffs is a linear sum of odor time 
      profiles.
PG  - 272-81
LID - 10.1038/nn.3913 [doi]
AB  - The olfactory system receives intermittent and fluctuating inputs arising from
      dispersion of odor plumes and active sampling by the animal. Previous work has
      suggested that the olfactory transduction machinery and excitatory-inhibitory
      olfactory bulb circuitry generate nonlinear population trajectories of neuronal
      activity that differ across odorants. Here we show that individual mitral/tufted 
      (M/T) cells sum inputs linearly across odors and time. By decoupling odor
      sampling from respiration in anesthetized rats, we show that M/T cell responses
      to arbitrary odor waveforms and mixtures are well described by odor-specific
      impulse responses convolved with the odorant's temporal profile. The same impulse
      responses convolved with the respiratory airflow predict the classical
      respiration-locked firing of olfactory bulb neurons and several other reported
      response properties of M/T cells. These results show that the olfactory bulb
      linearly processes fluctuating odor inputs, thereby simplifying downstream
      decoding of stimulus identity and temporal dynamics.

TI  - Surface diffusion of astrocytic glutamate transporters shapes synaptic
      transmission.
PG  - 219-26
LID - 10.1038/nn.3901 [doi]
AB  - Control of the glutamate time course in the synapse is crucial for excitatory
      transmission. This process is mainly ensured by astrocytic transporters, high
      expression of which is essential to compensate for their slow transport cycle.
      Although molecular mechanisms regulating transporter intracellular trafficking
      have been identified, the relationship between surface transporter dynamics and
      synaptic function remains unexplored. We found that GLT-1 transporters were
      highly mobile on rat astrocytes. Surface diffusion of GLT-1 was sensitive to
      neuronal and glial activities and was strongly reduced in the vicinity of
      glutamatergic synapses, favoring transporter retention. Notably, glutamate
      uncaging at synaptic sites increased GLT-1 diffusion, displacing transporters
      away from this compartment. Functionally, impairing GLT-1 membrane diffusion
      through cross-linking in vitro and in vivo slowed the kinetics of excitatory
      postsynaptic currents, indicative of a prolonged time course of synaptic
      glutamate. These data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence
      for a physiological role of GLT-1 surface diffusion in shaping synaptic
      transmission.

AB  - Human chromosome 16p11.2 microdeletion is the most common gene copy number
      variation in autism, but the synaptic pathophysiology caused by this mutation is 
      largely unknown. Using a mouse with the same genetic deficiency, we found that
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-dependent synaptic plasticity and
      protein synthesis was altered in the hippocampus and that hippocampus-dependent
      memory was impaired. Notably, chronic treatment with a negative allosteric
      modulator of mGluR5 reversed the cognitive deficit.

AB  - Spatial hearing evolved independently in mammals and birds and is thought to
      adapt to altered developmental input in different ways. We found, however, that
      ferrets possess multiple forms of plasticity that are expressed according to
      which spatial cues are available, suggesting that the basis for adaptation may be
      similar across species. Our results also provide insight into the way sound
      source location is represented by populations of cortical neurons.

TI  - Hippocampal theta sequences reflect current goals.
PG  - 289-94
LID - 10.1038/nn.3909 [doi]
AB  - Hippocampal information processing is discretized by oscillations, and the
      ensemble activity of place cells is organized into temporal sequences bounded by 
      theta cycles. Theta sequences represent time-compressed trajectories through
      space. Their forward-directed nature makes them an intuitive candidate mechanism 
      for planning future trajectories, but their connection to goal-directed behavior 
      remains unclear. As rats performed a value-guided decision-making task, the
      extent to which theta sequences projected ahead of the animal's current location 
      varied on a moment-by-moment basis depending on the rat's goals. Look-ahead
      extended farther on journeys to distant goals than on journeys to more proximal
      goals and was predictive of the animal's destination. On arrival at goals,
      however, look-ahead was similar regardless of where the animal began its journey 
      from. Together, these results provide evidence that hippocampal theta sequences
      contain information related to goals or intentions, pointing toward a potential
      spatial basis for planning.

TI  - Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome protein SIL1 regulates motor neuron subtype-selective 
      ER stress in ALS.
PG  - 227-38
LID - 10.1038/nn.3903 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms underlying motor neuron subtype-selective endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      stress and associated axonal pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
      remain unclear. Here we show that the molecular environment of the ER between
      motor neuron subtypes is distinct, with characteristic signatures. We identify
      cochaperone SIL1, mutated in Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS), as being robustly 
      expressed in disease-resistant slow motor neurons but not in ER stress-prone
      fast-fatigable motor neurons. In a mouse model of MSS, we demonstrate impaired ER
      homeostasis in motor neurons in response to loss of SIL1 function. Loss of a
      single functional Sil1 allele in an ALS mouse model (SOD1-G93A) enhanced ER
      stress and exacerbated ALS pathology. In SOD1-G93A mice, SIL1 levels were
      progressively and selectively reduced in vulnerable fast-fatigable motor neurons.
      Mechanistically, reduction in SIL1 levels was associated with lowered
      excitability of fast-fatigable motor neurons, further influencing expression of
      specific ER chaperones. Adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of SIL1 to
      familial ALS motor neurons restored ER homeostasis, delayed muscle denervation
      and prolonged survival.

AB  - Broad generalization of negative memories is a potential etiology for anxiety
      disorders, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We developed a non-human

      specific changes in tuning properties of amygdala neurons: the width of auditory 
      tuning increases with the distance of its center from the conditioned stimulus.
      This center-width relationship can account for better detection and at the same
      time explain the wide stimulus generalization.

TI  - Calcium dynamics in astrocyte processes during neurovascular coupling.
PG  - 210-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.3906 [doi]
AB  - Enhanced neuronal activity in the brain triggers a local increase in blood flow, 
      termed functional hyperemia, via several mechanisms, including calcium (Ca(2+))
      signaling in astrocytes. However, recent in vivo studies have questioned the role
      of astrocytes in functional hyperemia because of the slow and sparse dynamics of 
      their somatic Ca(2+) signals and the absence of glutamate metabotropic receptor 5
      in adults. Here, we reexamined their role in neurovascular coupling by
      selectively expressing a genetically encoded Ca(2+) sensor in astrocytes of the
      olfactory bulb. We show that in anesthetized mice, the physiological activation
      of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) terminals reliably triggers Ca(2+) increases in
      astrocyte processes but not in somata. These Ca(2+) increases systematically
      precede the onset of functional hyperemia by 1-2 s, reestablishing astrocytes as 
      potential regulators of neurovascular coupling.

TI  - Theta sequences are essential for internally generated hippocampal firing fields.
PG  - 282-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.3904 [doi]
AB  - Sensory cue inputs and memory-related internal brain activities govern the firing
      of hippocampal neurons, but which specific firing patterns are induced by either 
      of the two processes remains unclear. We found that sensory cues guided the
      firing of neurons in rats on a timescale of seconds and supported the formation
      of spatial firing fields. Independently of the sensory inputs, the memory-related
      network activity coordinated the firing of neurons not only on a second-long
      timescale, but also on a millisecond-long timescale, and was dependent on medial 
      septum inputs. We propose a network mechanism that might coordinate this
      internally generated firing. Overall, we suggest that two independent mechanisms 
      support the formation of spatial firing fields in hippocampus, but only the
      internally organized system supports short-timescale sequential firing and
      episodic memory.

TI  - NeuroGrid: recording action potentials from the surface of the brain.
PG  - 310-5
LID - 10.1038/nn.3905 [doi]
AB  - Recording from neural networks at the resolution of action potentials is critical
      for understanding how information is processed in the brain. Here, we address
      this challenge by developing an organic material-based, ultraconformable,
      biocompatible and scalable neural interface array (the 'NeuroGrid') that can
      record both local field potentials(LFPs) and action potentials from superficial
      cortical neurons without penetrating the brain surface. Spikes with features of
      interneurons and pyramidal cells were simultaneously acquired by multiple
      neighboring electrodes of the NeuroGrid, allowing for the isolation of putative
      single neurons in rats. Spiking activity demonstrated consistent phase modulation
      by ongoing brain oscillations and was stable in recordings exceeding 1 week's
      duration. We also recorded LFP-modulated spiking activity intraoperatively in
      patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. The NeuroGrid constitutes an effective
      method for large-scale, stable recording of neuronal spikes in concert with local
      population synaptic activity, enhancing comprehension of neural processes across 
      spatiotemporal scales and potentially facilitating diagnosis and therapy for
      brain disorders.

TI  - Genotype to phenotype relationships in autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 191-8
LID - 10.1038/nn.3907 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by phenotypic and genetic
      heterogeneity. Our analysis of functional networks perturbed in ASD suggests that
      both truncating and nontruncating de novo mutations contribute to autism, with a 
      bias against truncating mutations in early embryonic development. We find that
      functional mutations are preferentially observed in genes likely to be
      haploinsufficient. Multiple cell types and brain areas are affected, but the
      impact of ASD mutations appears to be strongest in cortical interneurons,
      pyramidal neurons and the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, implicating
      cortical and corticostriatal brain circuits. In females, truncating ASD mutations
      on average affect genes with 50-100% higher brain expression than in males. Our
      results also suggest that truncating de novo mutations play a smaller role in the
      etiology of high-functioning ASD cases. Overall, we find that stronger functional
      insults usually lead to more severe intellectual, social and behavioral ASD
      phenotypes.

TI  - A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the
      Drosophila visual system.
PG  - 46-55
LID - 10.1038/nn.3896 [doi]
AB  - Brain areas each generate specific neuron subtypes during development. However,
      underlying regional variations in neurogenesis strategies and regulatory
      mechanisms remain poorly understood. In Drosophila, neurons in four optic lobe
      ganglia originate from two neuroepithelia, the outer (OPC) and inner (IPC)
      proliferation centers. Using genetic manipulations, we found that one IPC
      neuroepithelial domain progressively transformed into migratory progenitors that 
      matured into neural stem cells (neuroblasts) in a second domain. Progenitors
      emerged by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like mechanism that required the 
      Snail-family member Escargot and, in subdomains, Decapentaplegic signaling. The
      proneural factors Lethal of scute and Asense differentially controlled progenitor
      supply and maturation into neuroblasts. These switched expression from Asense to 
      a third proneural protein, Atonal. Dichaete and Tailless mediated this
      transition, which was essential for generating two neuron populations at defined 
      positions. We propose that this neurogenesis mode is central for setting up a new
      proliferative zone to facilitate spatio-temporal matching of neurogenesis and
      connectivity across ganglia.

TI  - ErbB4 regulation of a thalamic reticular nucleus circuit for sensory selection.
PG  - 104-11
LID - 10.1038/nn.3897 [doi]
AB  - Selective processing of behaviorally relevant sensory inputs against irrelevant
      ones is a fundamental cognitive function whose impairment has been implicated in 
      major psychiatric disorders. It is known that the thalamic reticular nucleus
      (TRN) gates sensory information en route to the cortex, but the underlying
      mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show in mice that deficiency of the Erbb4 gene
      in somatostatin-expressing TRN neurons markedly alters behaviors that are
      dependent on sensory selection. Whereas the performance of the Erbb4-deficient
      mice in identifying targets from distractors was improved, their ability to
      switch attention between conflicting sensory cues was impaired. These behavioral 
      changes were mediated by an enhanced cortical drive onto the TRN that promotes
      the TRN-mediated cortical feedback inhibition of thalamic neurons. Our results
      uncover a previously unknown role of ErbB4 in regulating cortico-TRN-thalamic
      circuit function. We propose that ErbB4 sets the sensitivity of the TRN to
      cortical inputs at levels that can support sensory selection while allowing
      behavioral flexibility.

TI  - Developmental regulation of human cortex transcription and its clinical relevance
      at single base resolution.
PG  - 154-161

AB  - Transcriptome analysis of human brain provides fundamental insight into
      development and disease, but it largely relies on existing annotation. We
      sequenced transcriptomes of 72 prefrontal cortex samples across six life stages
      and identified 50,650 differentially expression regions (DERs) associated with
      developmental and aging, agnostic of annotation. While many DERs annotated to
      non-exonic sequence (41.1%), most were similarly regulated in cytosolic mRNA
      extracted from independent samples. The DERs were developmentally conserved
      across 16 brain regions and in the developing mouse cortex, and were expressed in
      diverse cell and tissue types. The DERs were further enriched for active
      chromatin marks and clinical risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as
      schizophrenia. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitatively that these DERs associate
      with a changing neuronal phenotype related to differentiation and maturation.
      These data show conserved molecular signatures of transcriptional dynamics across
      brain development, have potential clinical relevance and highlight the incomplete
      annotation of the human brain transcriptome.

TI  - PlexinA1 is a new Slit receptor and mediates axon guidance function of Slit
      C-terminal fragments.
PG  - 36-45
LID - 10.1038/nn.3893 [doi]
AB  - Robo-Slit and Plexin-Semaphorin signaling participate in various developmental
      and pathogenic processes. During commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord,
      chemorepulsion by Semaphorin3B and Slits controls midline crossing. Slit
      processing generates an N-terminal fragment (SlitN) that binds to Robo1 and Robo2
      receptors and mediates Slit repulsive activity, as well as a C-terminal fragment 
      (SlitC) with an unknown receptor and bioactivity. We identified PlexinA1 as a
      Slit receptor and found that it binds the C-terminal Slit fragment specifically
      and transduces a SlitC signal independently of the Robos and the Neuropilins.
      PlexinA1-SlitC complexes are detected in spinal cord extracts, and ex vivo, SlitC
      binding to PlexinA1 elicits a repulsive commissural response. Analysis of various
      ligand and receptor knockout mice shows that PlexinA1-Slit and Robo-Slit
      signaling have complementary roles during commissural axon guidance. Thus,
      PlexinA1 mediates both Semaphorin and Slit signaling, and Slit processing
      generates two active fragments, each exerting distinct effects through specific
      receptors.

TI  - Cell-specific STORM super-resolution imaging reveals nanoscale organization of
      cannabinoid signaling.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1038/nn.3892 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge in neuroscience is to determine the nanoscale position and
      quantity of signaling molecules in a cell type- and subcellular
      compartment-specific manner. We developed a new approach to this problem by
      combining cell-specific physiological and anatomical characterization with
      super-resolution imaging and studied the molecular and structural parameters
      shaping the physiological properties of synaptic endocannabinoid signaling in the
      mouse hippocampus. We found that axon terminals of perisomatically projecting
      GABAergic interneurons possessed increased CB1 receptor number, active-zone
      complexity and receptor/effector ratio compared with dendritically projecting
      interneurons, consistent with higher efficiency of cannabinoid signaling at
      somatic versus dendritic synapses. Furthermore, chronic
      Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol administration, which reduces cannabinoid efficacy 
      on GABA release, evoked marked CB1 downregulation in a dose-dependent manner.
      Full receptor recovery required several weeks after the cessation of
      Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol treatment. These findings indicate that cell
      type-specific nanoscale analysis of endogenous protein distribution is possible
      in brain circuits and identify previously unknown molecular properties
      controlling endocannabinoid signaling and cannabis-induced cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - Retinal output changes qualitatively with every change in ambient illuminance.
PG  - 66-74
LID - 10.1038/nn.3891 [doi]
AB  - The collective activity pattern of retinal ganglion cells, the retinal code,
      underlies higher visual processing. How does the ambient illuminance of the
      visual scene influence this retinal output? We recorded from isolated mouse and
      pig retina and from mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vivo at up to
      seven ambient light levels covering the scotopic to photopic regimes. Across each
      luminance transition, most ganglion cells exhibited qualitative response changes,
      whereas they maintained stable responses within each luminance. We commonly
      observed the appearance and disappearance of ON responses in OFF cells and vice
      versa. Such qualitative response changes occurred for a variety of stimuli,
      including full-field and localized contrast steps and naturalistic movies. Our
      results suggest that the retinal code is not fixed but varies with every change
      of ambient luminance. This finding raises questions about signal processing
      within the retina and has implications for visual processing in higher brain
      areas.

AB  - Hyperpolarizing and inhibitory GABA regulates critical periods for plasticity in 
      sensory cortices. Here we examine the role of early, depolarizing GABA in the
      control of plasticity mechanisms. We report that brief interference with
      depolarizing GABA during early development prolonged critical-period plasticity
      in visual cortical circuits without affecting the overall development of the
      visual system. The effects on plasticity were accompanied by dampened inhibitory 
      neurotransmission, downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      expression and reduced density of extracellular matrix perineuronal nets. Early
      interference with depolarizing GABA decreased perinatal BDNF signaling, and a
      pharmacological increase of BDNF signaling during GABA interference rescued the
      effects on plasticity and its regulators later in life. We conclude that
      depolarizing GABA exerts a long-lasting, selective modulation of plasticity of
      cortical circuits by a strong crosstalk with BDNF.

      stimulus dynamics.
PG  - 56-65
LID - 10.1038/nn.3895 [doi]
AB  - Sensory stimuli fluctuate on many timescales. However, short-term plasticity
      causes synapses to act as temporal filters, limiting the range of frequencies
      that they can transmit. How synapses in vivo might transmit a range of
      frequencies in spite of short-term plasticity is poorly understood. The first
      synapse in the Drosophila olfactory system exhibits short-term depression, but
      can transmit broadband signals. Here we describe two mechanisms that broaden the 
      frequency characteristics of this synapse. First, two distinct excitatory
      postsynaptic currents transmit signals on different timescales. Second,
      presynaptic inhibition dynamically updates synaptic properties to promote
      accurate transmission of signals across a wide range of frequencies. Inhibition
      is transient, but grows slowly, and simulations reveal that these two features of
      inhibition promote broadband synaptic transmission. Dynamic inhibition is often
      thought to restrict the temporal patterns that a neuron responds to, but our
      results illustrate a different idea: inhibition can expand the bandwidth of
      neural coding.

TI  - PIEZO2 is required for mechanotransduction in human stem cell-derived touch
      receptors.
PG  - 10-6
LID - 10.1038/nn.3894 [doi]
AB  - Human sensory neurons are inaccessible for functional examination, and thus
      little is known about the mechanisms mediating touch sensation in humans. Here we
      demonstrate that the mechanosensitivity of human embryonic stem (hES)
      cell-derived touch receptors depends on PIEZO2. To recapitulate sensory neuron
      development in vitro, we established a multistep differentiation protocol and
      generated sensory neurons via the intermediate production of neural crest cells
      derived from hES cells or human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. The
      generated neurons express a distinct set of touch receptor-specific genes and
      convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, their most salient
      characteristic in vivo. Strikingly, mechanosensitivity is lost after
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated PIEZO2 gene deletion. Our work establishes a model system
      that resembles human touch receptors, which may facilitate mechanistic analysis
      of other sensory subtypes and provide insight into developmental programs
      underlying sensory neuron diversity.

PG  - 129-37
LID - 10.1038/nn.3889 [doi]
AB  - As we explore a scene, our eye movements add global patterns of motion to the
      retinal image, complicating visual motion produced by self-motion or moving
      objects. Conventionally, it has been assumed that extraretinal signals, such as
      efference copy of smooth pursuit commands, are required to compensate for the
      visual consequences of eye rotations. We consider an alternative possibility:
      namely, that the visual system can infer eye rotations from global patterns of
      image motion. We visually simulated combinations of eye translation and rotation,
      including perspective distortions that change dynamically over time. We found
      that incorporating these 'dynamic perspective' cues allowed the visual system to 
      generate selectivity for depth sign from motion parallax in macaque cortical area
      MT, a computation that was previously thought to require extraretinal signals
      regarding eye velocity. Our findings suggest neural mechanisms that analyze
      global patterns of visual motion to perform computations that require knowledge
      of eye rotations.

TI  - Neuronal encoding of the switch from specific to generalized fear.
PG  - 112-20
LID - 10.1038/nn.3888 [doi]
AB  - Fear memories are crucial for survival. However, excessive generalization of such
      memories, characterized by a failure to discriminate dangerous from safe stimuli,
      is common in anxiety disorders. Neuronal encoding of the transition from
      cue-specific to generalized fear is poorly understood. We identified distinct
      neuronal populations in the lateral amygdala (LA) of rats that signaled
      generalized versus cue-specific associations and determined how their
      distributions switched during fear generalization. Notably, the same LA neurons
      that were cue specific before the behavioral shift to generalized fear lost their
      specificity afterwards, thereby tilting the balance of activity toward a greater 
      proportion of generalizing neurons. Neuronal activity in the LA, but not the
      auditory cortex, was necessary for fear generalization. Furthermore, targeted
      activation of cAMP-PKA signaling in the LA increased neuronal excitability of LA 
      neurons and led to generalized fear. These results provide a cellular basis in
      the amygdala for the alteration of emotional states from normal to pathological
      fear.

TI  - Columnar organization of spatial phase in visual cortex.
PG  - 97-103
LID - 10.1038/nn.3878 [doi]
AB  - Images are processed in the primary visual cortex by neurons that encode
      different stimulus orientations and spatial phases. In primates and carnivores,
      neighboring cortical neurons share similar orientation preferences, but spatial
      phases were thought to be randomly distributed. We discovered a columnar
      organization for spatial phase in cats that shares similarities with the columnar
      organization for orientation. For both orientation and phase, the mean difference
      across vertically aligned neurons was less than one-fourth of a cycle. Cortical
      neurons showed threefold more diversity in phase than orientation preference;
      however, the average phase of local neuronal populations was similar through the 
      depth of layer 4. We conclude that columnar organization for visual space is not 
      only defined by the spatial location of the stimulus, but also by absolute phase.
      Taken together with previous findings, our results suggest that this
      phase-visuotopy is responsible for the emergence of orientation maps.

AB  - Humans and mice detect pain, itch, temperature, pressure, stretch and limb
      position via signaling from peripheral sensory neurons. These neurons are divided
      into three functional classes (nociceptors/pruritoceptors, mechanoreceptors and
      proprioceptors) that are distinguished by their selective expression of TrkA,
      TrkB or TrkC receptors, respectively. We found that transiently coexpressing
      Brn3a with either Ngn1 or Ngn2 selectively reprogrammed human and mouse
      fibroblasts to acquire key properties of these three classes of sensory neurons. 
      These induced sensory neurons (iSNs) were electrically active, exhibited distinct
      sensory neuron morphologies and matched the characteristic gene expression
      patterns of endogenous sensory neurons, including selective expression of Trk
      receptors. In addition, we found that calcium-imaging assays could identify
      subsets of iSNs that selectively responded to diverse ligands known to activate
      itch- and pain-sensing neurons. These results offer a simple and rapid means for 
      producing genetically diverse human sensory neurons suitable for drug screening
      and mechanistic studies.

AB  - The primary sensory system requires the integrated function of multiple cell
      types, although its full complexity remains unclear. We used comprehensive
      transcriptome analysis of 622 single mouse neurons to classify them in an
      unbiased manner, independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes. Our
      results reveal eleven types: three distinct low-threshold mechanoreceptive
      neurons, two proprioceptive, and six principal types of thermosensitive, itch
      sensitive, type C low-threshold mechanosensitive and nociceptive neurons with
      markedly different molecular and operational properties. Confirming previously
      anticipated major neuronal types, our results also classify and provide markers
      for new, functionally distinct subtypes. For example, our results suggest that
      itching during inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is linked to 
      a distinct itch-generating type. We demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an
      effective strategy for dissecting sensory responsive cells into distinct neuronal
      types. The resulting catalog illustrates the diversity of sensory types and the
      cellular complexity underlying somatic sensation.

AB  - Proprioception-the sense of the body's position in space-is important to natural 
      movement planning and execution and will likewise be necessary for successful
      motor prostheses and brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Here we demonstrate that
      monkeys were able to learn to use an initially unfamiliar multichannel
      intracortical microstimulation signal, which provided continuous information
      about hand position relative to an unseen target, to complete accurate reaches.
      Furthermore, monkeys combined this artificial signal with vision to form an
      optimal, minimum-variance estimate of relative hand position. These results
      demonstrate that a learning-based approach can be used to provide a rich
      artificial sensory feedback signal, suggesting a new strategy for restoring
      proprioception to patients using BMIs, as well as a powerful new tool for
      studying the adaptive mechanisms of sensory integration.

PG  - 17-24

AB  - Reprogramming somatic cells from one cell fate to another can generate specific
      neurons suitable for disease modeling. To maximize the utility of patient-derived
      neurons, they must model not only disease-relevant cell classes, but also the
      diversity of neuronal subtypes found in vivo and the pathophysiological changes
      that underlie specific clinical diseases. We identified five transcription
      factors that reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into noxious
      stimulus-detecting (nociceptor) neurons. These recapitulated the expression of
      quintessential nociceptor-specific functional receptors and channels found in
      adult mouse nociceptor neurons, as well as native subtype diversity. Moreover,
      the derived nociceptor neurons exhibited TrpV1 sensitization to the inflammatory 
      mediator prostaglandin E2 and the chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin, modeling the
      inherent mechanisms underlying inflammatory pain hypersensitivity and painful
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Using fibroblasts from patients with familial
      dysautonomia (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III), we found
      that the technique was able to reveal previously unknown aspects of human disease
      phenotypes in vitro.

PG  - 121-8

AB  - During real-world (RW) exploration, rodent hippocampal activity shows robust
      spatial selectivity, which is hypothesized to be governed largely by distal
      visual cues, although other sensory-motor cues also contribute. Indeed,
      hippocampal spatial selectivity is weak in primate and human studies that use
      only visual cues. To determine the contribution of distal visual cues only, we
      measured hippocampal activity from body-fixed rodents exploring a two-dimensional
      virtual reality (VR). Compared to that in RW, spatial selectivity was markedly
      reduced during random foraging and goal-directed tasks in VR. Instead we found
      small but significant selectivity to distance traveled. Despite impaired spatial 
      selectivity in VR, most spikes occurred within approximately 2-s-long hippocampal
      motifs in both RW and VR that had similar structure, including phase precession
      within motif fields. Selectivity to space and distance traveled were greatly
      enhanced in VR tasks with stereotypical trajectories. Thus, distal visual cues
      alone are insufficient to generate a robust hippocampal rate code for space but
