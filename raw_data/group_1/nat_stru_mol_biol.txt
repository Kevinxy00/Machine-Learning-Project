AB  - Cas9 (from Streptococcus pyogenes) in complex with a guide RNA targets
      complementary DNA for cleavage. Here, we developed a single-molecule FRET
      analysis to study the mechanisms of specificity enhancement of two engineered
      Cas9s (eCas9 and Cas9-HF1). A DNA-unwinding assay showed that mismatches affect
      cleavage reactions through rebalancing the unwinding-rewinding equilibrium.
      Increasing PAM-distal mismatches facilitates rewinding, and the associated
      cleavage impairment shows that cleavage proceeds from the unwound state.
      Engineered Cas9s depopulate the unwound state more readily with mismatches. The
      intrinsic cleavage rate is much lower for engineered Cas9s, preventing cleavage
      from transiently unwound off-targets. Engineered Cas9s require approximately one 
      additional base pair match for stable binding, freeing them from sites that would
      otherwise sequester them. Therefore, engineered Cas9s achieve their improved
      specificity by inhibiting stable DNA binding to partially matching sequences,
      making DNA unwinding more sensitive to mismatches and slowing down the intrinsic 
      cleavage reaction.

TI  - Structural basis of small-molecule inhibition of human multidrug transporter
      ABCG2.
PG  - 333-340
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0049-1 [doi]
AB  - ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that protects tissues against 
      xenobiotics, affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs and contributes to multidrug
      resistance. Although many inhibitors and modulators of ABCG2 have been developed,
      understanding their structure-activity relationship requires high-resolution
      structural insight. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human ABCG2 bound to
      synthetic derivatives of the fumitremorgin C-related inhibitor Ko143 or the
      multidrug resistance modulator tariquidar. Both compounds are bound to the
      central, inward-facing cavity of ABCG2, blocking access for substrates and
      preventing conformational changes required for ATP hydrolysis. The high
      resolutions allowed for de novo building of the entire transporter and also
      revealed tightly bound phospholipids and cholesterol interacting with the
      lipid-exposed surface of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Extensive chemical
      modifications of the Ko143 scaffold combined with in vitro functional analyses
      revealed the details of ABCG2 interactions with this compound family and provide 
      a basis for the design of novel inhibitors and modulators.

TI  - Atomic structures of FUS LC domain segments reveal bases for reversible amyloid
      fibril formation.
PG  - 341-346
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0050-8 [doi]
AB  - Thermostable cross-beta structures are characteristic of pathological amyloid
      fibrils, but these structures cannot explain the reversible nature of fibrils
      formed by RNA-binding proteins such as fused in sarcoma (FUS), involved in RNA
      granule assembly. Here, we find that two tandem (S/G)Y(S/G) motifs of the human
      FUS low-complexity domain (FUS LC) form reversible fibrils in a temperature- and 
      phosphorylation-dependent manner. We named these motifs reversible amyloid cores,
      or RAC1 and RAC2, and determined their atomic structures in fibrillar forms,
      using microelectron and X-ray diffraction techniques. The RAC1 structure features
      an ordered-coil fibril spine rather than the extended beta-strand typical of
      amyloids. Ser42, a phosphorylation site of FUS, is critical in the maintenance of
      the ordered-coil structure, which explains how phosphorylation controls fibril
      formation. The RAC2 structure shows a labile fibril spine with a wet interface.
      These structures illuminate the mechanism of reversible fibril formation and
      dynamic assembly of RNA granules.

LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0047-3 [doi]
AB  - Membrane potential regulates the activity of voltage-dependent ion channels via
      specialized voltage-sensing modules, but the mechanisms involved in coupling
      voltage-sensor movement to pore opening remain unclear owing to a lack of resting
      state structures and robust methods to identify allosteric pathways. Here, using 
      a newly developed interaction-energy analysis, we probe the interfaces of the
      voltage-sensing and pore modules in the Drosophila Shaker K(+) channel. Our
      measurements reveal unexpectedly strong equilibrium gating interactions between
      contacts at the S4 and S5 helices in addition to those between S6 and the S4-S5
      linker. Network analysis of MD trajectories shows that the voltage-sensor and
      pore motions are linked by two distinct pathways: a canonical pathway through the
      S4-S5 linker and a hitherto unknown pathway akin to rack-and-pinion coupling
      involving the S4 and S5 helices. Our findings highlight the central role of the
      S5 helix in electromechanical transduction in the voltage-gated ion channel
      (VGIC) superfamily.

TI  - Global delay in nascent strand DNA methylation.
PG  - 327-332
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0046-4 [doi]
AB  - Cytosine methylation is widespread among organisms and essential for mammalian
      development. In line with early postulations of an epigenetic role in gene
      regulation, symmetric CpG methylation can be mitotically propagated over many
      generations with extraordinarily high fidelity. Here, we combine BrdU labeling
      and immunoprecipitation with genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to explore the
      inheritance of cytosine methylation onto newly replicated DNA in human cells.
      Globally, we observe a pronounced lag between the copying of genetic and
      epigenetic information in embryonic stem cells that is reconsolidated within
      hours to accomplish faithful mitotic transmission. Populations of arrested cells 
      show a global reduction of lag-induced intermediate CpG methylation when compared
      to proliferating cells, whereas sites of transcription factor engagement appear
      cell-cycle invariant. Alternatively, the cancer cell line HCT116 preserves global
      epigenetic heterogeneity independently of cell-cycle arrest. Taken together, our 
      data suggest that heterogeneous methylation largely reflects asynchronous
      proliferation, but is intrinsic to actively engaged cis-regulatory elements and
      cancer.

      from TDP-43 RRM2.
PG  - 311-319
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0045-5 [doi]
AB  - Proteins in the fibrous amyloid state are a major hallmark of neurodegenerative
      disease. Understanding the multiple conformations, or polymorphs, of amyloid
      proteins at the molecular level is a challenge of amyloid research. Here, we
      detail the wide range of polymorphs formed by a segment of human TAR DNA-binding 
      protein 43 (TDP-43) as a model for the polymorphic capabilities of pathological
      amyloid aggregation. Using X-ray diffraction, microelectron diffraction (MicroED)
      and single-particle cryo-EM, we show that the (247)DLIIKGISVHI(257) segment from 
      the second RNA-recognition motif (RRM2) forms an array of amyloid polymorphs.
      These associations include seven distinct interfaces displaying five different
      symmetry classes of steric zippers. Additionally, we find that this segment can
      adopt three different backbone conformations that contribute to its polymorphic
      capabilities. The polymorphic nature of this segment illustrates at the molecular
      level how amyloid proteins can form diverse fibril structures.

TI  - Ribothrypsis, a novel process of canonical mRNA decay, mediates ribosome-phased
      mRNA endonucleolysis.
PG  - 302-310
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0042-8 [doi]
AB  - mRNAs transmit the genetic information that dictates protein production and are a
      nexus for numerous pathways that regulate gene expression. The prevailing view of
      canonical mRNA decay is that it is mediated by deadenylation and decapping
      followed by exonucleolysis from the 3' and 5' ends. By developing Akron-seq, a
      novel approach that captures the native 3' and 5' ends of capped and
      polyadenylated RNAs, respectively, we show that canonical human mRNAs are subject
      to repeated cotranslational and ribosome-phased endonucleolytic cuts at the exit 
      site of the mRNA ribosome channel, in a process that we term ribothrypsis. We
      uncovered RNA G quadruplexes among likely ribothrypsis triggers and show that
      ribothrypsis is a conserved process. Strikingly, we found that mRNA fragments are
      abundant in living cells and thus have important implications for the
      interpretation of experiments, such as RNA-seq, that rely on the assumption that 
      mRNAs exist largely as full-length molecules in vivo.

AB  - The survival rate of cancer patients is steadily increasing, owing to more
      efficient therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of
      chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) could identify targets
      for prevention of POI. Loss of the primordial follicle reserve is the most
      important cause of POI, with the p53 family member p63 being responsible for
      DNA-damage-induced apoptosis of resting oocytes. Here, we provide the first
      detailed mechanistic insight into the activation of p63, a process that requires 
      phosphorylation by both the priming kinase CHK2 and the executioner kinase CK1 in
      mouse primordial follicles. We further describe the structural changes induced by
      phosphorylation that enable p63 to adopt its active tetrameric conformation and
      demonstrate that previously discussed phosphorylation by c-Abl is not involved in
      this process. Inhibition of CK1 rescues primary oocytes from doxorubicin and
      cisplatin-induced apoptosis, thus uncovering a new target for the development of 
      fertoprotective therapies.

AB  - The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPV4 participates in multiple
      biological processes, and numerous TRPV4 mutations underlie several distinct and 
      devastating diseases. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of Xenopus tropicalis
      TRPV4 at 3.8-A resolution. The ion-conduction pore contains an intracellular gate
      formed by the inner helices, but lacks any extracellular gate in the selectivity 
      filter, as observed in other TRPV channels. Anomalous X-ray diffraction analyses 
      identify a single ion-binding site in the selectivity filter, thus explaining
      TRPV4 nonselectivity. Structural comparisons with other TRP channels and
      distantly related voltage-gated cation channels reveal an unprecedented, unique
      packing interface between the voltage-sensor-like domain and the pore domain,
      suggesting distinct gating mechanisms. Moreover, our structure begins to provide 
      mechanistic insights to the large set of pathogenic mutations, offering potential
      opportunities for drug development.

PG  - 225-232
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0036-6 [doi]
AB  - Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes methylation on lysine 27 of
      histone H3 (H3K27) and is required for maintaining transcriptional patterns and
      cellular identity, but the specification and maintenance of genomic PRC2 binding 
      and H3K27 methylation patterns remain incompletely understood. Epigenetic
      mechanisms have been proposed, wherein pre-existing H3K27 methylation directs
      recruitment and regulates the catalytic activity of PRC2 to support its own
      maintenance. Here we investigate whether such mechanisms are required for
      specifying H3K27 methylation patterns in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
      Through re-expression of PRC2 subunits in PRC2-knockout cells that have lost all 
      H3K27 methylation, we demonstrate that methylation patterns can be accurately
      established de novo. We find that regional methylation kinetics correlate with
      original methylation patterns even in their absence, and specification of the
      genomic PRC2 binding pattern is retained and specifically dependent on the PRC2
      core subunit SUZ12. Thus, the H3K27 methylation patterns in mESCs are not
      dependent on self-autonomous epigenetic inheritance.

LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0034-8 [doi]
AB  - Fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane is mediated by the dynamin-like GTPase
      mitofusin (MFN). Here, we determined the structure of the minimal GTPase domain
      (MGD) of human MFN1 in complex with GDP-BeF3(-). The MGD folds into a canonical
      GTPase fold with an associating four-helix bundle, HB1, and forms a dimer. A
      potassium ion in the catalytic core engages GDP and BeF3(-) (GDP-BeF3(-)).
      Enzymatic analysis has confirmed that efficient GTP hydrolysis by MFN1 requires
      potassium. Compared to previously reported MGD structures, the HB1 structure
      undergoes a major conformational change relative to the GTPase domains, as they
      move from pointing in opposite directions to point in the same direction,
      suggesting that a swing of the four-helix bundle can pull tethered membranes
      closer to achieve fusion. The proposed model is supported by results from in
      vitro biochemical assays and mitochondria morphology rescue assays in
      MFN1-deleted cells. These findings offer an explanation for how
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2 A (CMT2A)-causing mutations compromise
      MFN-mediated fusion.

AB  - Peptides folded through interwoven disulfides display extreme biochemical
      properties and unique medicinal potential. However, their exploitation has been
      hampered by the limited amounts isolatable from natural sources and the expense
      of chemical synthesis. We developed reliable biological methods for
      high-throughput expression, screening and large-scale production of these
      peptides: 46 were successfully produced in multimilligram quantities, and >600
      more were deemed expressible through stringent screening criteria. Many showed
      extreme resistance to temperature, proteolysis and/or reduction, and all
      displayed inhibitory activity against at least 1 of 20 ion channels tested, thus 
      confirming their biological functionality. Crystal structures of 12 confirmed
      proper cystine topology and the utility of crystallography to study these
      molecules but also highlighted the need for rational classification. Previous
      categorization attempts have focused on limited subsets featuring distinct
      motifs. Here we present a global definition, classification and analysis of >700 
      structures of cystine-dense peptides, providing a unifying framework for these

TI  - MicroRNA degradation by a conserved target RNA regulates animal behavior.
PG  - 244-251
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0032-x [doi]
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) repress target transcripts through partial complementarity. By
      contrast, highly complementary miRNA-binding sites within viral and artificially 
      engineered transcripts induce miRNA degradation in vitro and in cell lines. Here,
      we show that a genome-encoded transcript harboring a near-perfect and deeply
      conserved miRNA-binding site for miR-29 controls zebrafish and mouse behavior.
      This transcript originated in basal vertebrates as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      and evolved to the protein-coding gene NREP in mammals, where the miR-29-binding 
      site is located within the 3' UTR. We show that the near-perfect miRNA site
      selectively triggers miR-29b destabilization through 3' trimming and restricts
      its spatial expression in the cerebellum. Genetic disruption of the miR-29 site
      within mouse Nrep results in ectopic expression of cerebellar miR-29b and
      impaired coordination and motor learning. Thus, we demonstrate an endogenous
      target-RNA-directed miRNA degradation event and its requirement for animal
      behavior.

      of N-glycosylation.
PG  - 217-224
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0031-y [doi]
AB  - N-linked glycosylation is a predominant post-translational modification of
      protein in eukaryotes, and its dysregulation is the etiology of several human
      disorders. The enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:dolichyl-phosphate
      N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase (GlcNAc-1-P-transferase or GPT) catalyzes
      the first and committed step of N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic
      reticulum membrane, and it is the target of the natural product tunicamycin.
      Tunicamycin has potent antibacterial activity, inhibiting the bacterial cell wall
      synthesis enzyme MraY, but its usefulness as an antibiotic is limited by
      off-target inhibition of human GPT. Our understanding of how tunicamycin inhibits
      N-linked glycosylation and efforts to selectively target MraY are hampered by a
      lack of structural information. Here we present crystal structures of human GPT
      in complex with tunicamycin. Structural and functional analyses reveal the
      difference between GPT and MraY in their mechanisms of inhibition by tunicamycin.
      We demonstrate that this difference could be exploited to design MraY-specific
      inhibitors as potential antibiotics.

TI  - 2'-O-methylation in mRNA disrupts tRNA decoding during translation elongation.
PG  - 208-216
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0030-z [doi]
AB  - Chemical modifications of mRNA may regulate many aspects of mRNA processing and
      protein synthesis. Recently, 2'-O-methylation of nucleotides was identified as a 
      frequent modification in translated regions of human mRNA, showing enrichment in 
      codons for certain amino acids. Here, using single-molecule, bulk kinetics and
      structural methods, we show that 2'-O-methylation within coding regions of mRNA
      disrupts key steps in codon reading during cognate tRNA selection. Our results
      suggest that 2'-O-methylation sterically perturbs interactions of
      ribosomal-monitoring bases (G530, A1492 and A1493) with cognate codon-anticodon
      helices, thereby inhibiting downstream GTP hydrolysis by elongation factor Tu
      (EF-Tu) and A-site tRNA accommodation, leading to excessive rejection of cognate 
      aminoacylated tRNAs in initial selection and proofreading. Our current and prior 
      findings highlight how chemical modifications of mRNA tune the dynamics of
      protein synthesis at different steps of translation elongation.

AB  - Camelid single-domain antibody fragments ('nanobodies') provide the remarkable
      specificity of antibodies within a single 15-kDa immunoglobulin VHH domain. This 
      unique feature has enabled applications ranging from use as biochemical tools to 
      therapeutic agents. Nanobodies have emerged as especially useful tools in protein
      structural biology, facilitating studies of conformationally dynamic proteins
      such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Nearly all nanobodies available to
      date have been obtained by animal immunization, a bottleneck restricting many
      applications of this technology. To solve this problem, we report a fully in
      vitro platform for nanobody discovery based on yeast surface display. We provide 
      a blueprint for identifying nanobodies, demonstrate the utility of the library by
      crystallizing a nanobody with its antigen, and most importantly, we utilize the
      platform to discover conformationally selective nanobodies to two distinct human 
      GPCRs. To facilitate broad deployment of this platform, the library and
      associated protocols are freely available for nonprofit research.

TI  - Cotranslational protein assembly imposes evolutionary constraints on homomeric
      proteins.
PG  - 279-288
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0029-5 [doi]
AB  - Cotranslational protein folding can facilitate rapid formation of functional
      structures. However, it can also cause premature assembly of protein complexes,
      if two interacting nascent chains are in close proximity. By analyzing known
      protein structures, we show that homomeric protein contacts are enriched toward
      the C termini of polypeptide chains across diverse proteomes. We hypothesize that
      this is the result of evolutionary constraints for folding to occur before
      assembly. Using high-throughput imaging of protein homomers in Escherichia coli
      and engineered protein constructs with N- and C-terminal oligomerization domains,
      we show that, indeed, proteins with C-terminal homomeric interface residues
      consistently assemble more efficiently than those with N-terminal interface
      residues. Using in vivo, in vitro and in silico experiments, we identify features
      that govern successful assembly of homomers, which have implications for protein 
      design and expression optimization.

TI  - Cryo-electron tomography reveals that dynactin recruits a team of dyneins for
      processive motility.
PG  - 203-207
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0027-7 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic dynein is a protein complex that transports molecular cargo along
      microtubules (MTs), playing a key role in the intracellular trafficking network. 
      Vertebrate dynein's movement becomes strikingly enhanced upon interacting with
      dynactin and a cargo adaptor such as BicaudalD2. However, the mechanisms
      responsible for increased transport activity are not well understood, largely
      owing to limited structural information. We used cryo-electron tomography
      (cryo-ET) to visualize the 3D structure of the MT-bound dynein-dynactin complex
      from Mus musculus and show that the dynactin-cargo adaptor complex binds two
      dimeric dyneins. This configuration imposes spatial and conformational
      constraints on both dynein dimers, positioning the four motor domains in
      proximity to one another and oriented toward the MT minus end. We propose that
      grouping multiple dyneins onto a single dynactin scaffold promotes collective
      force production, increased processivity, and unidirectional movement, suggesting
      mechanistic parallels to axonemal dynein. These findings provide structural
      insights into a previously unknown mechanism for dynein regulation.

AB  - A limited arsenal of therapies is currently available to tackle the emergence of 
      a future influenza pandemic or even to deal effectively with the continual
      outbreaks of seasonal influenza. However, recent findings hold great promise for 
      the design of novel vaccines and therapeutics, including the possibility of more 
      universal treatments. Structural biology has been a major contributor to those
      advances, in particular through the many studies on influenza hemagglutinin (HA),
      the major surface antigen. HA's primary function is to enable the virus to enter 
      host cells, and structural work has revealed the various HA conformational forms 
      generated during the entry process. Other studies have explored how human broadly
      neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), designed proteins, peptides and small molecules,
      can inhibit and neutralize the virus. Here we review milestones in HA structural 
      biology and how the recent insights from bnAbs are paving the way to design novel
      vaccines and therapeutics.

AB  - DNA replication requires separation of genomic duplex DNA strands, an operation
      that is performed by a hexameric ring-shaped helicase in all domains of life. The
      structures and chemomechanical actions of these fascinating machines are coming
      into sharper focus. Although there is no evolutionary relationship between the

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are clinically prescribed antidepressants
      that act by increasing the local concentrations of neurotransmitters at synapses 
      and in extracellular spaces via blockade of the serotonin transporter. Here we
      report X-ray structures of engineered thermostable variants of the human
      serotonin transporter bound to the antidepressants sertraline, fluvoxamine, and
      paroxetine. The drugs prevent serotonin binding by occupying the central
      substrate-binding site and stabilizing the transporter in an outward-open
      conformation. These structures explain how residues within the central site
      orchestrate binding of chemically diverse inhibitors and mediate transporter drug
      selectivity.

TI  - Cryo-EM structures of PRC2 simultaneously engaged with two functionally distinct 
      nucleosomes.
PG  - 154-162
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0023-y [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic regulation is mediated by protein complexes that couple recognition of
      chromatin marks to activity or recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes.
      Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a gene silencer that methylates lysine 27
      of histone H3, is stimulated upon recognition of its own catalytic product and
      has been shown to be more active on dinucleosomes than H3 tails or single
      nucleosomes. These properties probably facilitate local H3K27me2/3 spreading,
      causing heterochromatin formation and gene repression. Here, cryo-EM
      reconstructions of human PRC2 bound to bifunctional dinucleosomes show how a
      single PRC2, via interactions with nucleosomal DNA, positions the H3 tails of the
      activating and substrate nucleosome to interact with the EED subunit and the SET 
      domain of EZH2, respectively. We show how the geometry of the PRC2-DNA
      interactions allows PRC2 to accommodate varying lengths of the linker DNA between
      nucleosomes. Our structures illustrate how an epigenetic regulator engages with a
      complex chromatin substrate.

      CcdA.
PG  - 163-169
LID - 10.1038/s41594-018-0022-z [doi]
AB  - Membrane oxidoreductase CcdA plays a central role in supplying reducing
      equivalents from the bacterial cytoplasm to the envelope. It transports electrons
      across the membrane using a single pair of cysteines by a mechanism that has not 
      yet been elucidated. Here we report an NMR structure of the Thermus thermophilus 
      CcdA (TtCcdA) in an oxidized and outward-facing state. CcdA consists of two
      inverted structural repeats of three transmembrane helices (2 x 3-TM). We
      computationally modeled and experimentally validated an inward-facing state,
      which suggests that CcdA uses an elevator-type movement to shuttle the reactive
      cysteines across the membrane. CcdA belongs to the LysE superfamily, and thus its
      structure may be relevant to other LysE clan transporters. Structure comparisons 
      of CcdA, semiSWEET, Pnu, and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters
      provide insights into membrane transporter architecture and mechanism.

TI  - TRF1 participates in chromosome end protection by averting TRF2-dependent
      telomeric R loops.
PG  - 147-153
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0021-5 [doi]
AB  - The shelterin protein TRF2 assembles protective T loops at chromosome ends by
      stimulating intramolecular invasion of the telomeric G-rich single-stranded DNA
      (ssDNA) overhang into the duplex telomeric array. The other shelterin factor,
      TRF1, is thought to mainly facilitate telomeric dsDNA replication without
      directly participating in end protection. Here we show that in vitro human TRF2
      stimulates invasion of G-rich TERRA-like RNA into telomeric dsDNA, leading to
      formation of telomeric RNA-DNA hybrids (telR loops). The N-terminal basic domain 
      of TRF2 binds to TERRA-like RNA and enables TRF2 to promote efficient RNA
      invasion. TRF1, through its N-terminal acidic domain, counteracts TRF2-mediated
      RNA invasion but not ssDNA invasion. In vivo, when TRF1 is depleted or replaced
      with a variant lacking the acidic domain, TRF2 induces formation of telR loops,
      which in turn cause telomere loss. Hence, uncontrolled TRF2 threatens telomere
      integrity, and TRF1 directly supports end protection by suppressing harmful telR 
      loops.

AB  - Imaging and chromatin capture techniques have provided important insights into
      our understanding of nuclear organization. A limitation of these techniques is
      the inability to resolve allele-specific spatiotemporal properties of genomic
      loci in living cells. Here, we describe an allele-specific CRISPR live-cell DNA
      imaging technique (SNP-CLING) to provide the first comprehensive insights into
      allelic positioning across space and time in mouse embryonic stem cells and
      fibroblasts. With 3D imaging, we studied alleles on different chromosomes in
      relation to one another and relative to nuclear substructures such as the
      nucleolus. We find that alleles maintain similar positions relative to each other
      and the nucleolus; however, loci occupy unique positions. To monitor
      spatiotemporal dynamics by SNP-CLING, we performed 4D imaging and determined that
      alleles are either stably positioned or fluctuating during cell state
      transitions, such as apoptosis. SNP-CLING is a universally applicable technique
      that enables the dissection of allele-specific spatiotemporal genome organization
      in live cells.

AB  - Visualizations of biomolecular structures empower us to gain insights into
      biological functions, generate testable hypotheses, and communicate biological
      concepts. Typical visualizations (such as ball and stick) primarily depict
      covalent bonds. In contrast, non-covalent contacts between atoms, which govern
      normal physiology, pathogenesis, and drug action, are seldom visualized. We
      present the Protein Contacts Atlas, an interactive resource of non-covalent
      contacts from over 100,000 PDB crystal structures. We developed multiple
      representations for visualization and analysis of non-covalent contacts at
      different scales of organization: atoms, residues, secondary structure, subunits,
      and entire complexes. The Protein Contacts Atlas enables researchers from
      different disciplines to investigate diverse questions in the framework of
      non-covalent contacts, including the interpretation of allostery, disease
      mutations and polymorphisms, by exploring individual subunits, interfaces, and
      protein-ligand contacts and by mapping external information. The Protein Contacts
      Atlas is available at http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/pca/ and also through PDBe.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of the exocyst complex.
PG  - 139-146
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0016-2 [doi]
AB  - The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein complex that
      mediates the tethering of post-Golgi secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane
      during exocytosis and is implicated in many cellular processes such as cell
      polarization, cytokinesis, ciliogenesis and tumor invasion. Using cryo-EM and
      chemical cross-linking MS (CXMS), we solved the structure of the Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae exocyst complex at an average resolution of 4.4 A. Our model revealed 
      the architecture of the exocyst and led to the identification of the helical
      bundles that mediate the assembly of the complex at its core. Sequence analysis
      suggests that these regions are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic
      systems. Additional cell biological data suggest a mechanism for exocyst assembly
      that leads to vesicle tethering at the plasma membrane.

AB  - The atomic structure of the infectious, protease-resistant, beta-sheet-rich and
      fibrillar mammalian prion remains unknown. Through the cryo-EM method MicroED, we
      reveal the sub-angstrom-resolution structure of a protofibril formed by a
      wild-type segment from the beta2-alpha2 loop of the bank vole prion protein. The 
      structure of this protofibril reveals a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds
      that link polar zippers within a sheet, producing motifs we have named 'polar
      clasps'.

TI  - MLL2 conveys transcription-independent H3K4 trimethylation in oocytes.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0013-5 [doi]
AB  - Histone 3 K4 trimethylation (depositing H3K4me3 marks) is typically associated
      with active promoters yet paradoxically occurs at untranscribed domains. Research
      to delineate the mechanisms of targeting H3K4 methyltransferases is ongoing. The 
      oocyte provides an attractive system to investigate these mechanisms, because
      extensive H3K4me3 acquisition occurs in nondividing cells. We developed low-input
      chromatin immunoprecipitation to interrogate H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 marks 
      throughout oogenesis. In nongrowing oocytes, H3K4me3 was restricted to active
      promoters, but as oogenesis progressed, H3K4me3 accumulated in a
      transcription-independent manner and was targeted to intergenic regions, putative
      enhancers and silent H3K27me3-marked promoters. Ablation of the H3K4
      methyltransferase gene Mll2 resulted in loss of transcription-independent H3K4
      trimethylation but had limited effects on transcription-coupled H3K4
      trimethylation or gene expression. Deletion of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b showed that DNA 
      methylation protects regions from acquiring H3K4me3. Our findings reveal two
      independent mechanisms of targeting H3K4me3 to genomic elements, with MLL2
      recruited to unmethylated CpG-rich regions independently of transcription.

TI  - Bap (Sil1) regulates the molecular chaperone BiP by coupling release of
      nucleotide and substrate.
PG  - 90-100
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0012-6 [doi]
AB  - BiP is the endoplasmic member of the Hsp70 family. BiP is regulated by several
      co-chaperones including the nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) Bap (Sil1 in yeast).
      Bap is a two-domain protein. The interaction of the Bap C-terminal domain with
      the BiP ATPase domain is sufficient for its weak NEF activity. However,
      stimulation of the BiP ATPase activity requires full-length Bap, suggesting a
      complex interplay of these two factors. Here, single-molecule FRET experiments
      with mammalian proteins reveal that Bap affects the conformation of both BiP
      domains, including the lid subdomain, which is important for substrate binding.
      The largely unstructured Bap N-terminal domain promotes the substrate release
      from BiP. Thus, Bap is a conformational regulator affecting both nucleotide and
      substrate interactions. The preferential interaction with BiP in its ADP state
      places Bap at a late stage of the chaperone cycle, in which it coordinates
      release of substrate and ADP, thereby resetting BiP for ATP and substrate
      binding.

TI  - Nucleotide exchange factors Fes1 and HspBP1 mimic substrate to release misfolded 
      proteins from Hsp70.
PG  - 83-89
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0008-2 [doi]
AB  - Protein quality control depends on the tight regulation of interactions between
      molecular chaperones and polypeptide substrates. Substrate release from the
      chaperone Hsp70 is triggered by nucleotide-exchange factors (NEFs) that control
      folding and degradation fates via poorly understood mechanisms. We found that the
      armadillo-type NEFs budding yeast Fes1 and its human homolog HspBP1 employ
      flexible N-terminal release domains (RDs) with substrate-mimicking properties to 
      ensure the efficient release of persistent substrates from Hsp70. The RD contacts
      the substrate-binding domain of the chaperone, competes with peptide substrate
      for binding and is essential for proper function in yeast and mammalian cells.
      Thus, the armadillo domain engages Hsp70 to trigger nucleotide exchange, whereas 
      the RD safeguards the release of substrates. Our findings provide fundamental
      mechanistic insight into the functional specialization of Hsp70 NEFs and have
      implications for the understanding of proteostasis-related disorders, including
      Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome.

TI  - Structural basis of TRPV5 channel inhibition by econazole revealed by cryo-EM.
PG  - 53-60
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0009-1 [doi]
AB  - The transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) channel is a member of the
      transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, which is highly selective for 
      Ca(2+), that is present primarily at the apical membrane of distal tubule
      epithelial cells in the kidney and plays a key role in Ca(2+) reabsorption. Here 
      we present the structure of the full-length rabbit TRPV5 channel as determined
      using cryo-EM in complex with its inhibitor econazole. This structure reveals
      that econazole resides in a hydrophobic pocket analogous to that occupied by
      phosphatidylinositides and vanilloids in TRPV1, thus suggesting conserved
      mechanisms for ligand recognition and lipid binding among TRPV channels. The
      econazole-bound TRPV5 structure adopts a closed conformation with a distinct
      lower gate that occludes Ca(2+) permeation through the channel. Structural
      comparisons between TRPV5 and other TRPV channels, complemented with molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulations of the econazole-bound TRPV5 structure, allowed us to
      gain mechanistic insight into TRPV5 channel inhibition by small molecules.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped, icosahedral flavivirus that has structural and
      functional similarities to other human flavivirus pathogens such as dengue
      (DENV), West Nile (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. ZIKV infections 
      have been linked to fetal microcephaly and the paralytic Guillain-Barre syndrome.
      This review provides a comparative structural analysis of the assembly,
      maturation and host-cell entry of ZIKV with other flaviviruses, especially DENV. 
      We also discuss the mechanisms of neutralization by antibodies.

PG  - 4-12
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0011-7 [doi]
AB  - G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay numerous extracellular signals by
      triggering intracellular signaling through coupling with G proteins and
      arrestins. Recent breakthroughs in the structural determination of GPCRs and
      GPCR-transducer complexes represent important steps toward deciphering GPCR
      signal transduction at a molecular level. A full understanding of the molecular
      basis of GPCR-mediated signaling requires elucidation of the dynamics of
      receptors and their transducer complexes as well as their energy landscapes and
      conformational transition rates. Here, we summarize current insights into the
      structural plasticity of GPCR-G-protein and GPCR-arrestin complexes that
      underlies the regulation of the receptor's intracellular signaling profile.

AB  - Thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in eukaryotic
      genomes, many of which are expressed in spatially and temporally restricted
      patterns. Nonetheless, the roles of the majority of these transcripts are still
      unknown. One of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs function is through the
      modulation of chromatin states. To assess the functions of lncRNAs, we developed 
      RNA-DamID, a novel approach that detects lncRNA-genome interactions in a
      cell-type-specific manner in vivo with high sensitivity and accuracy. Identifying
      the cell-type-specific genome occupancy of lncRNAs is vital to understanding
      their mechanisms of action in development and disease. We used RNA-DamID to
      investigate targeting of the lncRNAs in the Drosophila dosage-compensation
      complex (DCC) and show that initial targeting is cell-type specific.

AB  - The APOBEC-AID family of cytidine deaminase prefers single-stranded nucleic acids
      for cytidine-to-uridine deamination. Single-stranded nucleic acids are commonly
      involved in the DNA repair system for breaks generated by CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we
      show in human cells that APOBEC3 can trigger cytidine deamination of
      single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, which ultimately results in base
      substitution mutations in genomic DNA through homology-directed repair (HDR) of
      Cas9-generated double-strand breaks. In addition, the APOBEC3-catalyzed
      deamination in genomic single-stranded DNA formed during the repair of Cas9
      nickase-generated single-strand breaks in human cells can be further processed to
      yield mutations mainly involving insertions or deletions (indels). Both
      APOBEC3-mediated deamination and DNA-repair proteins play important roles in the 
      generation of these indels. Therefore, optimizing conditions for the repair of
      CRISPR-Cas9-generated DNA breaks, such as using double-stranded donors in HDR or 
      temporarily suppressing endogenous APOBEC3s, can repress these unwanted mutations
      in genomic DNA.

AB  - Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, package and regulate expression of
      eukaryotic genomes. Although the structure of the intact nucleosome is well
      characterized, little is known about structures of partially unwrapped, transient
      intermediates. In this study, we present nine cryo-EM structures of distinct
      conformations of nucleosome and subnucleosome particles. These structures show
      that initial DNA breathing induces conformational changes in the histone octamer,
      particularly in histone H3, that propagate through the nucleosome and prevent
      symmetrical DNA opening. Rearrangements in the H2A-H2B dimer strengthen
      interaction with the unwrapping DNA and promote nucleosome stability. In
      agreement with this, cross-linked H2A-H2B that cannot accommodate unwrapping of
      the DNA is not stably maintained in the nucleosome. H2A-H2B release and DNA
      unwrapping occur simultaneously, indicating that DNA is essential in stabilizing 
      the dimer in the nucleosome. Our structures reveal intrinsic nucleosomal
      plasticity that is required for nucleosome stability and might be exploited by
      extrinsic protein factors.

TI  - Dominant-negative SMARCA4 mutants alter the accessibility landscape of
      tissue-unrestricted enhancers.
PG  - 61-72
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0007-3 [doi]
AB  - Mutation of SMARCA4 (BRG1), the ATPase of BAF (mSWI/SNF) and PBAF complexes,
      contributes to a range of malignancies and neurologic disorders. Unfortunately,
      the effects of SMARCA4 missense mutations have remained uncertain. Here we show
      that SMARCA4 cancer missense mutations target conserved ATPase surfaces and
      disrupt the mechanochemical cycle of remodeling. We find that heterozygous
      expression of mutants alters the open chromatin landscape at thousands of sites
      across the genome. Loss of DNA accessibility does not directly overlap with
      Polycomb accumulation, but is enriched in 'A compartments' at active enhancers,
      which lose H3K27ac but not H3K4me1. Affected positions include hundreds of sites 
      identified as superenhancers in many tissues. Dominant-negative mutation induces 
      pro-oncogenic expression changes, including increased expression of Myc and its
      target genes. Together, our data suggest that disruption of enhancer
      accessibility represents a key source of altered function in disorders with
      SMARCA4 mutations in a wide variety of tissues.

AB  - Access to chromatin for processes such as transcription and DNA repair requires
      the sliding of nucleosomes along DNA. This process is aided by
      chromatin-remodeling complexes, such as the multisubunit INO80
      chromatin-remodeling complex. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the active
      core complex of human INO80 at 9.6 A, with portions at 4.1-A resolution, and
      reconstructions of combinations of subunits. Together, these structures reveal
      the architecture of the INO80 complex, including Ino80 and actin-related
      proteins, which is assembled around a single RUVBL1 (Tip49a) and RUVBL2 (Tip49b) 
      AAA+ heterohexamer. An unusual spoked-wheel structural domain of the Ino80
      subunit is engulfed by this heterohexamer; both, in combination, form the core of
      the complex. We also identify a cleft in RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, which forms a major
      interaction site for partner proteins and probably communicates these
      interactions to its nucleotide-binding sites.

      exchange.
PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.1038/s41594-017-0002-8 [doi]
AB  - During homologous recombination, Rad51 forms a nucleoprotein filament with
      single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that undergoes strand exchange with homologous
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Here, we use real-time analysis to show that strand 
      exchange by fission yeast Rad51 proceeds via two distinct three-strand
      intermediates, C1 and C2. Both intermediates contain Rad51, but whereas the donor
      duplex remains intact in C1, the ssDNA strand is intertwined with the
      complementary strand of the donor duplex in C2. Swi5-Sfr1, an evolutionarily
      conserved recombination activator, facilitates the C1-C2 transition and
      subsequent ssDNA release from C2 to complete strand exchange in an
      ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner. In contrast, Ca(2+), which activates the Rad51
      filament by curbing ATP hydrolysis, facilitates the C1-C2 transition but does not
      promote strand exchange. These results reveal that Swi5-Sfr1 and Ca(2+) have
      different activation modes in the late synaptic phase, despite their common
      function in stabilizing the presynaptic filament.

AB  - The nuclear envelope has to be reformed after mitosis to create viable daughter

      ultrastructural analysis shows that nuclear membranes form from highly
      fenestrated ER sheets whose holes progressively shrink. NPC precursors are found 
      in small membrane holes and dilate radially during assembly of the inner ring
      complex, forming thousands of transport channels within minutes. This mechanism
      is fundamentally different from that of interphase NPC assembly and explains how 
      mitotic cells can rapidly establish a closed nuclear compartment while making it 
      transport competent.

AB  - Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes are central regulators of
      chromosome architecture that are essential in all domains of life. For decades,
      the structural biology field has been debating how these conserved protein
      complexes use their intricate ring-like structures to structurally organize DNA. 
      Here, we review the contributions of single-molecule biophysical approaches to
      resolving the molecular mechanism of SMC protein function.

PG  - 1021-1027

AB  - During protein synthesis, mRNA and tRNAs must be moved rapidly through the
      ribosome while maintaining the translational reading frame. This process is
      coupled to large- and small-scale conformational rearrangements in the ribosome, 
      mainly in its rRNA. The free energy from peptide-bond formation and GTP
      hydrolysis is probably used to impose directionality on those movements. We
      propose that the free energy is coupled to two pawls, namely tRNA and EF-G, which
      enable two ratchet mechanisms to act separately and sequentially on the two
      ribosomal subunits.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3501 [doi]
AB  - Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I is an organizing scaffold protein that is critical to
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) structure and metabolism, probably mediating many 
      of its cardioprotective properties. However, HDL biogenesis is poorly understood,
      as lipid-free apoA-I has been notoriously resistant to high-resolution structural
      study. Published models from low-resolution techniques share certain features but
      vary considerably in shape and secondary structure. To tackle this central issue 
      in lipoprotein biology, we assembled a team of structural biologists specializing
      in apolipoproteins and set out to build a consensus model of monomeric lipid-free
      human apoA-I. Combining novel and published cross-link constraints, small-angle
      X-ray scattering (SAXS), hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) and crystallography
      data, we propose a time-averaged model consistent with much of the experimental
      data published over the last 40 years. The model provides a long-sought platform 
      for understanding and testing details of HDL biogenesis, structure and function.

TI  - Programming asynchronous replication in stem cells.
PG  - 1132-1138
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3503 [doi]
AB  - Many regions of the genome replicate asynchronously and are expressed
      monoallelically. It is thought that asynchronous replication may be involved in
      choosing one allele over the other, but little is known about how these patterns 
      are established during development. We show that, unlike somatic cells, which
      replicate in a clonal manner, embryonic and adult stem cells are programmed to
      undergo switching, such that daughter cells with an early-replicating paternal
      allele are derived from mother cells that have a late-replicating paternal
      allele. Furthermore, using ground-state embryonic stem (ES) cells, we demonstrate
      that in the initial transition to asynchronous replication, it is always the
      paternal allele that is chosen to replicate early, suggesting that primary
      allelic choice is directed by preset gametic DNA markers. Taken together, these
      studies help define a basic general strategy for establishing allelic
      discrimination and generating allelic diversity throughout the organism.

TI  - Cryo-EM structures of the human endolysosomal TRPML3 channel in three distinct
      states.
PG  - 1146-1154
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3502 [doi]
AB  - TRPML3 channels are mainly localized to endolysosomes and play a critical role in
      the endocytic pathway. Their dysfunction causes deafness and pigmentation defects
      in mice. TRPML3 activity is inhibited by low endolysosomal pH. Here we present
      cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human TRPML3 in the closed,
      agonist-activated, and low-pH-inhibited states, with resolutions of 4.06, 3.62,
      and 4.65 A, respectively. The agonist ML-SA1 lodges between S5 and S6 and opens
      an S6 gate. A polycystin-mucolipin domain (PMD) forms a luminal cap. S1 extends
      into this cap, forming a 'gating rod' that connects directly to a luminal pore
      loop, which undergoes dramatic conformational changes in response to low pH. S2
      extends intracellularly and interacts with several intracellular regions to form 
      a 'gating knob'. These unique structural features, combined with the results of
      electrophysiological studies, indicate a new mechanism by which luminal pH and
      other physiological modulators such as PIP2 regulate TRPML3 by changing S1 and S2
      conformations.

TI  - TFIIH generates a six-base-pair open complex during RNAP II transcription
      initiation and start-site scanning.
PG  - 1139-1145
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3500 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic mRNA transcription initiation is directed by the formation of the
      megadalton-sized preinitiation complex (PIC). After PIC formation,
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is unwound to form a single-stranded DNA bubble, and 
      the template strand is loaded into the polymerase active site. DNA opening is
      catalyzed by Ssl2 (XPB), the dsDNA translocase subunit of the basal transcription
      factor TFIIH. In yeast, transcription initiation proceeds through a scanning
      phase during which downstream DNA is searched for optimal start sites. Here, to
      test models for initial DNA opening and start-site scanning, we measure the
      DNA-bubble sizes generated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae PICs in real time using
      single-molecule magnetic tweezers. We show that ATP hydrolysis by Ssl2 opens a
      6-base-pair (bp) bubble that grows to 13 bp in the presence of NTPs. These
      observations support a two-step model wherein ATP-dependent Ssl2 translocation
      leads to a 6-bp open complex that RNA polymerase II expands via NTP-dependent RNA
      transcription.

TI  - Short poly(A) tails are a conserved feature of highly expressed genes.
PG  - 1057-1063
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3499 [doi]
AB  - Poly(A) tails are important elements in mRNA translation and stability, although 
      recent genome-wide studies have concluded that poly(A) tail length is generally
      not associated with translational efficiency in nonembryonic cells. To
      investigate whether poly(A) tail size might be coupled to gene expression in an
      intact organism, we used an adapted TAIL-seq protocol to measure poly(A) tails in
      Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, we found that well-expressed transcripts
      contain relatively short, well-defined tails. This attribute appears to be
      dependent on translational efficiency, as transcripts enriched for optimal codons
      and ribosome association had the shortest tail sizes, whereas noncoding RNAs
      retained long tails. Across eukaryotes, short tails were a feature of abundant
      and well-translated mRNAs. This seems to contradict the dogma that deadenylation 
      induces translational inhibition and mRNA decay and suggests that well-expressed 
      mRNAs accumulate with pruned tails that accommodate a minimal number of
      poly(A)-binding proteins, which may be ideal for protective and translational
      functions.

TI  - Extrachromosomal telomere repeat DNA is linked to ALT development via cGAS-STING 
      DNA sensing pathway.
PG  - 1124-1131
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3498 [doi]
AB  - Extrachromosomal telomere repeat (ECTR) DNA is unique to cancer cells that
      maintain telomeres through the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)
      pathway, but the role of ECTRs in ALT development remains elusive. We found that 
      induction of ECTRs in normal human fibroblasts activated the cGAS-STING-TBK1-IRF3
      signaling axis to trigger IFNbeta production and a type I interferon response,
      resulting in cell-proliferation defects. In contrast, ALT cancer cells are
      commonly defective in sensing cytosolic DNA. We found that STING expression was
      inhibited in ALT cancer cell lines and transformed ALT cells. Notably, the ALT
      suppressors histone H3.3 and the ATRX-Daxx histone chaperone complex were also
      required to activate the DNA-sensing pathway. Collectively, our data suggest that
      the loss of the cGAS-STING pathway may be required to evade ECTR-induced
      anti-proliferation effects and permit ALT development, and this requirement may
      be exploited for treatments specific to cancers utilizing the ALT pathway.

TI  - Telomeric TERB1-TRF1 interaction is crucial for male meiosis.
PG  - 1073-1080
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3496 [doi]
AB  - During meiotic prophase, the meiosis-specific telomere-binding protein TERB1
      regulates chromosome movement required for homologous pairing and recombination
      by interacting with the telomeric shelterin subunit TRF1. Here, we report the
      crystal structure of the TRF1-binding motif of human TERB1 in complex with the
      TRFH domain of TRF1. Notably, specific disruption of the TERB1-TRF1 interaction
      by a point mutation in the mouse Terb1 gene results in infertility only in males.
      We find that this mutation causes an arrest in the zygotene-early pachytene stage
      and mild telomere abnormalities of autosomes but unpaired X and Y chromosomes in 
      pachytene, leading to massive spermatocyte apoptosis. We propose that the loss of
      telomere structure mediated by the TERB1-TRF1 interaction significantly affects
      homologous pairing of the telomere-adjacent pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the X
      and Y chromosomes in mouse spermatocytes. Our findings uncover a specific
      mechanism of telomeres that surmounts the unique challenges of mammalian X-Y
      pairing in meiosis.

      in live cells.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3492 [doi]
AB  - LCK is a tyrosine kinase that is essential for initiating T-cell antigen receptor
      (TCR) signaling. A complete understanding of LCK function is constrained by a
      paucity of methods to quantitatively study its function within live cells. To
      address this limitation, we generated LCK*, in which a key active-site lysine is 
      replaced by a photocaged equivalent, using genetic code expansion. This strategy 
      enabled fine temporal and spatial control over kinase activity, thus allowing us 
      to quantify phosphorylation kinetics in situ using biochemical and imaging
      approaches. We find that autophosphorylation of the LCK active-site loop is
      indispensable for its catalytic activity and that LCK can stimulate its own
      activation by adopting a more open conformation, which can be modulated by point 
      mutations. We then show that CD4 and CD8, T-cell coreceptors, can enhance LCK
      activity, thereby helping to explain their effect in physiological TCR signaling.
      Our approach also provides general insights into SRC-family kinase dynamics.

TI  - Dissecting the telomere-inner nuclear membrane interface formed in meiosis.
PG  - 1064-1072
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3493 [doi]
AB  - Tethering telomeres to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) allows homologous
      chromosome pairing during meiosis. The meiosis-specific protein TERB1 binds the
      telomeric protein TRF1 to establish telomere-INM connectivity and is essential
      for mouse fertility. Here we solve the structure of the human TRF1-TERB1
      interface to reveal the structural basis for telomere-INM linkage. Disruption of 
      this interface abrogates binding and compromises telomere-INM attachment in mice.
      An embedded CDK-phosphorylation site within the TRF1-binding region of TERB1
      provides a mechanism for cap exchange, a late-pachytene phenomenon involving the 
      dissociation of the TRF1-TERB1 complex. Indeed, further strengthening this
      interaction interferes with cap exchange. Finally, our biochemical analysis
      implicates distinct complexes for telomere-INM tethering and chromosome-end
      protection during meiosis. Our studies unravel the structure, stoichiometry, and 
      physiological implications underlying telomere-INM tethering, thereby providing
      unprecedented insights into the unique function of telomeres in meiosis.

TI  - Preribosomes escaping from the nucleus are caught during translation by
      cytoplasmic quality control.
PG  - 1107-1115
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3495 [doi]
AB  - Assembly of fully functional ribosomes is a prerequisite for failsafe
      translation. This explains why maturing preribosomal subunits have to pass
      through an array of quality-control checkpoints, including nuclear export, to
      ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes engage in translation. Despite
      these safeguards, we found that nuclear pre-60S particles unable to remove a
      transient structure composed of ITS2 pre-rRNA and associated assembly factors,
      termed the 'foot', escape to the cytoplasm, where they can join with mature 40S
      subunits to catalyze protein synthesis. However, cells harboring these abnormal
      ribosomes show translation defects indicated by the formation of 80S ribosomes
      poised with pre-60S subunits carrying tRNAs in trapped hybrid states. To overcome
      this translational stress, the cytoplasmic surveillance machineries RQC and
      Ski-exosome target these malfunctioning ribosomes. Thus, pre-60S subunits that
      escape nuclear quality control can enter translation, but are caught by
      cytoplasmic surveillance mechanisms.

TI  - Dynamic regulation of CD28 conformation and signaling by charged lipids and ions.
PG  - 1081-1092
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3489 [doi]
AB  - CD28 provides an essential costimulatory signal for T cell activation, and its
      function is critical in antitumor immunity. However, the molecular mechanism of
      CD28 transmembrane signaling remains elusive. Here we show that the conformation 
      and signaling of CD28 are regulated by two counteractive charged factors, acidic 
      phospholipids and Ca(2+) ions. NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that acidic
      phospholipids can sequester CD28 signaling motifs within the membrane, thereby
      limiting CD28 basal signaling. T cell receptor (TCR) activation induced an
      increase in the local Ca(2+) concentration around CD28, and Ca(2+) directly
      disrupted CD28-lipid interaction, leading to opening and signaling of CD28. We
      observed that the TCR, Ca(2+), and CD28 together form a dual-positive-feedback
      circuit that substantially amplifies T cell signaling and thus increases antigen 
      sensitivity. This work unravels a new regulatory mechanism for CD28 signaling and
      thus contributes to the understanding of the dependence of costimulation
      signaling on TCR signaling and the high sensitivity of T cells.

TI  - Molecular basis of lipid-linked oligosaccharide recognition and processing by
      bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.
PG  - 1100-1106
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3491 [doi]
AB  - Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) is a membrane-integral enzyme that catalyzes the 
      transfer of glycans from lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) onto asparagine
      side chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation. Here, we report the X-ray
      structure of a single-subunit OST, PglB from Campylobacter lari, trapped in an
      intermediate state bound to an acceptor peptide and a synthetic LLO analog. The
      structure reveals the role of the external loop EL5, present in all OST enzymes, 
      in substrate recognition. Whereas the N-terminal half of EL5 binds LLO, the
      C-terminal half interacts with the acceptor peptide. The glycan moiety of LLO
      must thread under EL5 to access the active site. Reducing EL5 mobility decreases 
      the catalytic rate of OST when full-size heptasaccharide LLO is provided, but not
      for a monosaccharide-containing LLO analog. Our results define the chemistry of a
      ternary complex state, assign functional roles to conserved OST motifs, and
      provide opportunities for glycoengineering by rational design of PglB.

TI  - The helicase domain of Poltheta counteracts RPA to promote alt-NHEJ.
PG  - 1116-1123
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3494 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian polymerase theta (Poltheta) is a multifunctional enzyme that promotes
      error-prone DNA repair by alternative nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ). Here 
      we present structure-function analyses that reveal that, in addition to the
      polymerase domain, Poltheta-helicase activity plays a central role during
      double-strand break (DSB) repair. Our results show that the helicase domain
      promotes chromosomal translocations by alt-NHEJ in mouse embryonic stem cells and
      also suppresses CRISPR-Cas9- mediated gene targeting by homologous recombination 
      (HR). In vitro assays demonstrate that Poltheta-helicase activity facilitates the
      removal of RPA from resected DSBs to allow their annealing and subsequent joining
      by alt-NHEJ. Consistent with an antagonistic role for RPA during alt-NHEJ,
      inhibition of RPA1 enhances end joining and suppresses recombination. Taken
      together, our results reveal that the balance between HR and alt-NHEJ is
      controlled by opposing activities of Poltheta and RPA, providing further insight 
      into the regulation of repair-pathway choice in mammalian cells.

TI  - DNA binding by PHF1 prolongs PRC2 residence time on chromatin and thereby
      promotes H3K27 methylation.
PG  - 1039-1047
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3488 [doi]
AB  - Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 to
      mark genes for repression. We measured the dynamics of PRC2 binding on
      recombinant chromatin and free DNA at the single-molecule level using total
      internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. PRC2 preferentially binds
      free DNA with multisecond residence time and midnanomolar affinity. PHF1, a PRC2 
      accessory protein of the Polycomblike family, extends PRC2 residence time on DNA 
      and chromatin. Crystallographic and functional studies reveal that Polycomblike
      proteins contain a winged-helix domain that binds DNA in a sequence-nonspecific
      fashion. DNA binding by this winged-helix domain accounts for the prolonged
      residence time of PHF1-PRC2 on chromatin and makes it a more efficient H3K27
      methyltranferase than PRC2 alone. Together, these studies establish that
      interactions with DNA provide the predominant binding affinity of PRC2 for
      chromatin. Moreover, they reveal the molecular basis for how Polycomblike
      proteins stabilize PRC2 on chromatin and stimulate its activity.

TI  - Molecular analysis of PRC2 recruitment to DNA in chromatin and its inhibition by 
      RNA.
PG  - 1028-1038
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3487 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have revealed pathways of epigenetic gene silencing by Polycomb
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in vivo, but understanding the underlying molecular
      mechanisms requires biochemistry. Here we analyze interactions of reconstituted
      human PRC2 with nucleosome complexes. Histone modifications, the H3K27M cancer
      mutation, and inclusion of JARID2 or EZH1 in the PRC2 complex have unexpectedly
      minor effects on PRC2-nucleosome binding. Instead, protein-free linker DNA
      dominates the PRC2-nucleosome interaction. Specificity for CG-rich sequences is
      consistent with PRC2 occupying CG-rich DNA in vivo. PRC2 preferentially binds
      methylated DNA regulated by its AEBP2 subunit, suggesting how DNA and histone
      methylation collaborate to repress chromatin. We find that RNA, known to inhibit 
      PRC2 activity, is not a methyltransferase inhibitor per se. Instead, RNA
      sequesters PRC2 from nucleosome substrates, because PRC2 binding requires linker 
      DNA, and RNA and DNA binding are mutually exclusive. Together, we provide a model
      for PRC2 recruitment and an explanation for how actively transcribed genomic
      regions bind PRC2 but escape silencing.

TI  - Histone propionylation is a mark of active chromatin.
PG  - 1048-1056
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3490 [doi]
AB  - Histones are highly covalently modified, but the functions of many of these
      modifications remain unknown. In particular, it is unclear how histone marks are 
      coupled to cellular metabolism and how this coupling affects chromatin
      architecture. We identified histone H3 Lys14 (H3K14) as a site of propionylation 
      and butyrylation in vivo and carried out the first systematic characterization of
      histone propionylation. We found that H3K14pr and H3K14bu are deposited by
      histone acetyltransferases, are preferentially enriched at promoters of active
      genes and are recognized by acylation-state-specific reader proteins. In
      agreement with these findings, propionyl-CoA was able to stimulate transcription 
      in an in vitro transcription system. Notably, genome-wide H3 acylation profiles
      were redefined following changes to the metabolic state, and deletion of the
      metabolic enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase altered global histone propionylation 
      levels. We propose that histone propionylation, acetylation and butyrylation may 
      act in combination to promote high transcriptional output and to couple cellular 
      metabolism with chromatin structure and function.

PG  - 882-892
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3486 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas is a bacterial defense system against phage infection and nucleic acid
      invasion. Class 2 type II CRISPR-Cas9 has also been widely used for genome
      engineering. Here, we review novel insights into the CRISPR class 2 type V
      enzymes, specifically Cpf1 and C2c1, which display different DNA-recognition and 
      cleavage characteristics than those of Cas9, the best-characterized member of
      class 2. Recent structures of these ribonucleoprotein complexes that capture
      several stages of the endonuclease reaction have provided molecular details of
      recognition, unzipping and cleavage of the target DNA, allowing their comparison 
      with Cas9. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for improving 
      these genome engineering tools and expanding the genomic space that can be
      targeted.

TI  - MacroH2A1.1 regulates mitochondrial respiration by limiting nuclear NAD(+)
      consumption.
PG  - 902-910
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3481 [doi]
AB  - Histone variants are structural components of eukaryotic chromatin that can
      replace replication-coupled histones in the nucleosome. The histone variant
      macroH2A1.1 contains a macrodomain capable of binding NAD(+)-derived metabolites.
      Here we report that macroH2A1.1 is rapidly induced during myogenic
      differentiation through a switch in alternative splicing, and that myotubes that 
      lack macroH2A1.1 have a defect in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We found
      that the metabolite-binding macrodomain was essential for sustained optimal
      mitochondrial function but dispensable for gene regulation. Through direct
      binding, macroH2A1.1 inhibits basal poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1)
      activity and thus reduces nuclear NAD(+) consumption. The resultant accumulation 
      of the NAD(+) precursor NMN allows for maintenance of mitochondrial NAD(+) pools 
      that are critical for respiration. Our data indicate that macroH2A1.1-containing 
      chromatin regulates mitochondrial respiration by limiting nuclear NAD(+)
      consumption and establishing a buffer of NAD(+) precursors in differentiated
      cells.

TI  - A structural model for microtubule minus-end recognition and protection by CAMSAP
      proteins.
PG  - 931-943
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3483 [doi]
AB  - CAMSAP and Patronin family members regulate microtubule minus-end stability and
      localization and thus organize noncentrosomal microtubule networks, which are
      essential for cell division, polarization and differentiation. Here, we found
      that the CAMSAP C-terminal CKK domain is widely present among eukaryotes and
      autonomously recognizes microtubule minus ends. Through a combination of
      structural approaches, we uncovered how mammalian CKK binds between two tubulin
      dimers at the interprotofilament interface on the outer microtubule surface. In
      vitro reconstitution assays combined with high-resolution fluorescence microscopy
      and cryo-electron tomography suggested that CKK preferentially associates with
      the transition zone between curved protofilaments and the regular microtubule
      lattice. We propose that minus-end-specific features of the interprotofilament
      interface at this site serve as the basis for CKK's minus-end preference. The
      steric clash between microtubule-bound CKK and kinesin motors explains how CKK
      protects microtubule minus ends against kinesin-13-induced depolymerization and
      thus controls the stability of free microtubule minus ends.

TI  - Architectural alterations of the fission yeast genome during the cell cycle.
PG  - 965-976
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3482 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic genomes are highly ordered through various mechanisms, including
      topologically associating domain (TAD) organization. We employed an in situ Hi-C 
      approach to follow the 3D organization of the fission yeast genome during the
      cell cycle. We demonstrate that during mitosis, large domains of 300 kb-1 Mb are 
      formed by condensin. This mitotic domain organization does not suddenly dissolve,
      but gradually diminishes until the next mitosis. By contrast, small domains of
      30-40 kb that are formed by cohesin are relatively stable across the cell cycle. 
      Condensin and cohesin mediate long- and short-range contacts, respectively, by
      bridging their binding sites, thereby forming the large and small domains. These 
      domains are inversely regulated during the cell cycle but assemble independently.
      Our study describes the chromosomal oscillation between the formation and decay
      phases of the large and small domains, and we predict that the condensin-mediated
      domains serve as chromosomal compaction units.

TI  - Structural basis for GABAA receptor potentiation by neurosteroids.
PG  - 986-992
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3484 [doi]
AB  - Type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are the principal mediators of
      inhibitory neurotransmission in the human brain. Endogenous neurosteroids
      interact with GABAARs to regulate acute and chronic anxiety and are potent
      sedative, analgesic, anticonvulsant and anesthetic agents. Their mode of binding 
      and mechanism of receptor potentiation, however, remain unknown. Here we report
      crystal structures of a chimeric GABAAR construct in apo and pregnanolone-bound
      states. The neurosteroid-binding site is mechanically coupled to the helices
      lining the ion channel pore and modulates the desensitization-gate conformation. 
      We demonstrate that the equivalent site is responsible for physiological,
      heteromeric GABAAR potentiation and explain the contrasting modulatory properties
      of 3a versus 3b neurosteroid epimers. These results illustrate how peripheral
      lipid ligands can regulate the desensitization gate of GABAARs, a process of
      broad relevance to pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.

TI  - U1 snRNP telescripting regulates a size-function-stratified human genome.
PG  - 993-999
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3473 [doi]
AB  - U1 snRNP (U1) functions in splicing introns and telescripting, which suppresses
      premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA). Using U1 inhibition in human
      cells, we show that U1 telescripting is selectively required for sustaining
      long-distance transcription elongation in introns of large genes (median 39 kb). 
      Evidence of widespread PCPA in the same locations in normal tissues reveals that 
      large genes incur natural transcription attrition. Underscoring the importance of
      U1 telescripting as a gene-size-based mRNA-regulation mechanism, small genes were
      not sensitive to PCPA, and the spliced-mRNA productivity of approximately 1,000
      small genes (median 6.8 kb) increased upon U1 inhibition. Notably, these small,
      upregulated genes were enriched in functions related to acute stimuli and
      cell-survival response, whereas genes subject to PCPA were enriched in cell-cycle
      progression and developmental functions. This gene size-function polarization
      increased in metazoan evolution by enormous intron expansion. We propose that
      telescripting adds an overarching layer of regulation to size-function-stratified
      genomes, leveraged by selective intron expansion to rapidly shift gene expression
      priorities.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3476 [doi]
AB  - The 40S small ribosomal subunit is cotranscriptionally assembled in the nucleolus
      as part of a large chaperone complex called the 90S preribosome or small-subunit 
      processome. Here, we present the 3.2-A-resolution structure of the Chaetomium
      thermophilum 90S preribosome, which allowed us to build atomic structures for 34 
      assembly factors, including the Mpp10 complex, Bms1, Utp14 and Utp18, and the
      complete U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Moreover, we visualized the U3 RNA
      heteroduplexes with a 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS) and pre-18S RNA,
      and their stabilization by 90S factors. Overall, the structure explains how a
      highly intertwined network of assembly factors and pre-rRNA guide the sequential,
      independent folding of the individual pre-40S domains while the RNA regions
      forming the 40S active sites are kept immature. Finally, by identifying the
      unprocessed A1 cleavage site and the nearby Utp24 endonuclease, we suggest a
      proofreading model for regulated 5'-ETS separation and 90S-pre-40S transition.

      neurosteroid-binding sites.
PG  - 977-985
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3477 [doi]
AB  - gamma-Aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) are vital for controlling
      excitability in the brain. This is emphasized by the numerous neuropsychiatric
      disorders that result from receptor dysfunction. A critical component of most
      native GABAARs is the alpha subunit. Its transmembrane domain is the target for
      many modulators, including endogenous brain neurosteroids that impact anxiety,
      stress and depression, and for therapeutic drugs, such as general anesthetics.
      Understanding the basis for the modulation of GABAAR function requires
      high-resolution structures. Here we present the first atomic structures of a
      GABAAR chimera at 2.8-A resolution, including those bound with potentiating and
      inhibitory neurosteroids. These structures define new allosteric binding sites
      for these modulators that are associated with the alpha-subunit transmembrane
      domain. Our findings will enable the exploitation of neurosteroids for
      therapeutic drug design to regulate GABAARs in neurological disorders.

PG  - 1000-1006
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3474 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear organization of genomic DNA affects processes of DNA damage and repair,
      yet its effects on mutational landscapes in cancer genomes remain unclear. Here
      we analyzed genome-wide somatic mutations from 366 samples of six cancer types.
      We found that lamina-associated regions, which are typically localized at the
      nuclear periphery, displayed higher somatic mutation frequencies than did the
      interlamina regions at the nuclear core. This effect was observed even after
      adjustment for features such as GC percentage, chromatin, and replication timing.
      Furthermore, mutational signatures differed between the nuclear core and
      periphery, thus indicating differences in the patterns of DNA-damage or
      DNA-repair processes. For instance, smoking and UV-related signatures, as well as
      substitutions at certain motifs, were more enriched in the nuclear periphery.
      Thus, the nuclear architecture may influence mutational landscapes in cancer
      genomes beyond the previously described effects of chromatin structure and
      replication timing.

      initiated by the protein kinase PINK1 and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin.
      Ubiquitin-specific protease USP30 antagonizes Parkin-mediated ubiquitination
      events on mitochondria and is a key negative regulator of mitophagy. Parkin and
      USP30 both show a preference for assembly or disassembly, respectively, of
      Lys6-linked polyubiquitin, a chain type that has not been well studied. Here we
      report crystal structures of human USP30 bound to monoubiquitin and Lys6-linked
      diubiquitin, which explain how USP30 achieves Lys6-linkage preference through
      unique ubiquitin binding interfaces. We assess the interplay between USP30, PINK1
      and Parkin and show that distally phosphorylated ubiquitin chains impair USP30
      activity. Lys6-linkage-specific affimers identify numerous mitochondrial
      substrates for this modification, and we show that USP30 regulates
      Lys6-polyubiquitinated TOM20. Our work provides insights into the architecture,
      activity and regulation of USP30, which will aid drug design against this and
      related enzymes.

AB  - The activity of protein kinases is often regulated in an intramolecular fashion
      by signaling domains, which feature several phosphorylation or protein-docking
      sites. How kinases integrate such distinct binding and signaling events to
      regulate their activities is unclear, especially in quantitative terms. We used
      NMR spectroscopy to show how structural elements within the Abl regulatory module
      (RM) synergistically generate a multilayered allosteric mechanism that enables
      Abl kinase to function as a finely tuned switch. We dissected the structure and
      energetics of the regulatory mechanism to precisely measure the effects of
      various activating or inhibiting stimuli on Abl kinase activity. The data provide
      a mechanistic basis explaining genetic observations and reveal a previously
      unknown activator region within Abl. Our findings show that drug-resistance
      mutations in the Abl RM exert their allosteric effect by promoting the activated 
      state of Abl and not by decreasing the drug affinity for the kinase.

PG  - 911-919
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3469 [doi]
AB  - Parkin ubiquitin (Ub) ligase (also known as PARK2) ubiquitinates damaged
      mitochondria for their clearance and quality control. USP30 deubiquitinase
      opposes parkin-mediated Ub-chain formation on mitochondria by preferentially
      cleaving Lys6-linked Ub chains. Here, we report the crystal structure of
      zebrafish USP30 in complex with a Lys6-linked diubiquitin (diUb or Ub2) at 1.87-A
      resolution. The distal Ub-recognition mechanism of USP30 is similar to those of
      other USP family members, whereas Phe4 and Thr12 of the proximal Ub are
      recognized by a USP30-specific surface. Structure-based mutagenesis showed that
      the interface with the proximal Ub is critical for the specific cleavage of
      Lys6-linked Ub chains, together with the noncanonical catalytic triad composed of
      Cys-His-Ser. The structural findings presented here reveal a mechanism for
      Lys6-linkage-specific deubiquitination.

AB  - The small-subunit processome represents the earliest stable precursor of the
      eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae small-subunit processome at an overall resolution of 3.8
      A, which provides an essentially complete near-atomic model of this assembly. In 
      this nucleolar superstructure, 51 ribosome-assembly factors and two RNAs
      encapsulate the 18S rRNA precursor and 15 ribosomal proteins in a state that
      precedes pre-rRNA cleavage at site A1. Extended flexible proteins are employed to
      connect distant sites in this particle. Molecular mimicry and steric hindrance,
      as well as protein- and RNA-mediated RNA remodeling, are used in a concerted
      fashion to prevent the premature formation of the central pseudoknot and its
      surrounding elements within the small ribosomal subunit.

AB  - The spliceosome excises introns from pre-messenger RNAs using an RNA-based active

      activation, splice site positioning, catalysis, protein rearrangements and
      ATPase-mediated dynamics of the active site. The cryo-EM structures rationalize
      decades of observations from genetic and biochemical studies and provide a
      molecular framework for future functional studies.

AB  - The oxidative phosphorylation electron transport chain (OXPHOS-ETC) of the inner 
      mitochondrial membrane is composed of five large protein complexes, named CI-CV. 
      These complexes convert energy from the food we eat into ATP, a small molecule
      used to power a multitude of essential reactions throughout the cell. OXPHOS-ETC 
      complexes are organized into supercomplexes (SCs) of defined stoichiometry: CI
      forms a supercomplex with CIII2 and CIV (SC I+III2+IV, known as the respirasome),
      as well as with CIII2 alone (SC I+III2). CIII2 forms a supercomplex with CIV (SC 
      III2+IV) and CV forms dimers (CV2). Recent cryo-EM studies have revealed the
      structures of SC I+III2+IV and SC I+III2. Furthermore, recent work has shed light
      on the assembly and function of the SCs. Here we review and compare these recent 
      studies and discuss how they have advanced our understanding of mitochondrial
      electron transport.

TI  - Structures of the human mitochondrial ribosome in native states of assembly.
PG  - 866-869
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3464 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) have less rRNA content and 36
      additional proteins compared with the evolutionarily related bacterial ribosome. 
      These differences make the assembly of mitoribosomes more complex than the
      assembly of bacterial ribosomes, but the molecular details of mitoribosomal
      biogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report the structures of two late-stage
      assembly intermediates of the human mitoribosomal large subunit (mt-LSU) isolated
      from a native pool within a human cell line and solved by cryo-EM to
      approximately 3-A resolution. Comparison of the structures reveals insights into 
      the timing of rRNA folding and protein incorporation during the final steps of
      ribosomal maturation and the evolutionary adaptations that are required to
      preserve biogenesis after the structural diversification of mitoribosomes.
      Furthermore, the structures redefine the ribosome silencing factor (RsfS) family 
      as multifunctional biogenesis factors and identify two new assembly factors
      (L0R8F8 and mt-ACP) not previously implicated in mitoribosomal biogenesis.

AB  - CRISPR adaptive immune systems protect bacteria from infections by deploying
      CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided enzymes to recognize and cut foreign nucleic acids.
      Type VI-A CRISPR-Cas systems include the Cas13a enzyme, an RNA-activated RNase
      capable of crRNA processing and single-stranded RNA degradation upon
      target-transcript binding. Here we present the 2.0-A resolution crystal structure
      of a crRNA-bound Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cas13a (LbaCas13a), representing a
      recently discovered Cas13a enzyme subtype. This structure and accompanying
      biochemical experiments define the Cas13a catalytic residues that are directly
      responsible for crRNA maturation. In addition, the orientation of the
      foreign-derived target-RNA-specifying sequence in the protein interior explains
      the conformational gating of Cas13a nuclease activation. These results describe
      how Cas13a enzymes generate functional crRNAs and how catalytic activity is
      blocked before target-RNA recognition, with implications for both bacterial
      immunity and diagnostic applications.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3465 [doi]
AB  - During transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) associates with the conserved
      elongation factor DSIF. DSIF renders the elongation complex stable and functions 
      during Pol II pausing and RNA processing. We combined cryo-EM and X-ray
      crystallography to determine the structure of the mammalian Pol II-DSIF
      elongation complex at a nominal resolution of 3.4 A. Human DSIF has a modular
      structure with two domains forming a DNA clamp, two domains forming an RNA clamp,
      and one domain buttressing the RNA clamp. The clamps maintain the transcription
      bubble, position upstream DNA, and retain the RNA transcript in the exit tunnel. 
      The mobile C-terminal region of DSIF is located near exiting RNA, where it can
      recruit factors for RNA processing. The structure provides insight into the roles
      of DSIF during mRNA synthesis.

AB  - RNA modifications are integral to the regulation of RNA metabolism. One abundant 
      mRNA modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which affects various aspects 
      of RNA metabolism, including splicing, translation and degradation. Current
      knowledge about the proteins recruited to m(6)A to carry out these molecular
      processes is still limited. Here we describe comprehensive and systematic
      mass-spectrometry-based screening of m(6)A interactors in various cell types and 
      sequence contexts. Among the main findings, we identified G3BP1 as a protein that
      is repelled by m(6)A and positively regulates mRNA stability in an
      m(6)A-regulated manner. Furthermore, we identified FMR1 as a
      sequence-context-dependent m(6)A reader, thus revealing a connection between an
      mRNA modification and an autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, our data
      represent a rich resource and shed further light on the complex interplay among
      m(6)A, m(6)A interactors and mRNA homeostasis.

TI  - CNPY2 is a key initiator of the PERK-CHOP pathway of the unfolded protein
      response.
PG  - 834-839
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3458 [doi]
AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly
      conserved protein-quality-control mechanism critical for cells to make
      survival-or-death decisions under ER-stress conditions. However, how UPR sensors 
      are activated remains unclear. Here, we report that ER luminal protein canopy
      homolog 2 (CNPY2) is released from grp78 upon ER stress. Free CNPY2 then engages 
      protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) to induce expression of the transcription 
      factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), thereby initiating the UPR. Indeed,
      deletion of CNPY2 blocked the PERK-CHOP pathway and protected mice from
      UPR-induced liver damage and steatosis. Additionally, CNPY2 is transcriptionally 
      upregulated by CHOP in a forward-feed loop to further enhance UPR signaling.
      These findings demonstrate the critical roles of CNPY2 in ER stress and suggest
      that CNPY2 is a potential new therapeutic target for UPR-related diseases such as
      metabolic disorders, inflammation and cancer.

TI  - Crystal structure of an inactivated mutant mammalian voltage-gated K(+) channel.
PG  - 857-865
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3457 [doi]
AB  - C-type inactivation underlies important roles played by voltage-gated K(+) (Kv)
      channels. Functional studies have provided strong evidence that a common
      underlying cause of this type of inactivation is an alteration near the
      extracellular end of the channel's ion-selectivity filter. Unlike N-type
      inactivation, which is known to reflect occlusion of the channel's intracellular 
      end, the structural mechanism of C-type inactivation remains controversial and
      may have many detailed variations. Here we report that in voltage-gated Shaker
      K(+) channels lacking N-type inactivation, a mutation enhancing inactivation
      disrupts the outermost K(+) site in the selectivity filter. Furthermore, in a
      crystal structure of the Kv1.2-2.1 chimeric channel bearing the same mutation,
      the outermost K(+) site, which is formed by eight carbonyl-oxygen atoms, appears 
      to be slightly too small to readily accommodate a K(+) ion and in fact exhibits
      little ion density; this structural finding is consistent with the functional
      hallmark of C-type inactivation.

TI  - NEAT1 scaffolds RNA-binding proteins and the Microprocessor to globally enhance
      pri-miRNA processing.
PG  - 816-824
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3455 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is known to be modulated by a variety of RNA-binding 
      proteins (RBPs), but in most cases, individual RBPs appear to influence the
      processing of a small subset of target miRNAs. Here, we report that the
      RNA-binding NONO-PSF heterodimer binds a large number of expressed pri-miRNAs in 
      HeLa cells to globally enhance pri-miRNA processing by the Drosha-DGCR8
      Microprocessor. NONO and PSF are key components of paraspeckles organized by the 
      long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1. We further demonstrate that NEAT1 also has a
      profound effect on global pri-miRNA processing. Mechanistic dissection reveals
      that NEAT1 broadly interacts with the NONO-PSF heterodimer as well as many other 
      RBPs and that multiple RNA segments in NEAT1, including a 'pseudo pri-miRNA' near
      its 3' end, help attract the Microprocessor. These findings suggest a 'bird nest'
      model in which an lncRNA orchestrates efficient processing of potentially an
      entire class of small noncoding RNAs in the nucleus.

TI  - Discovery of a cryptic peptide-binding site on PCSK9 and design of antagonists.
PG  - 848-856
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3453 [doi]
AB  - Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates plasma LDL
      cholesterol (LDL-c) levels by promoting the degradation of liver LDL receptors
      (LDLRs). Antibodies that inhibit PCSK9 binding to the EGF(A) domain of the LDLR
      are effective in lowering LDL-c. However, the discovery of small-molecule
      therapeutics is hampered by difficulty in targeting the relatively flat
      EGF(A)-binding site on PCSK9. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to target
      this site, based on the finding that the PCSK9 P' helix displays conformational
      flexibility. As a consequence, the vacated N-terminal groove of PCSK9, which is
      adjacent to the EGF(A)-binding site, is in fact accessible to small peptides. In 
      phage-display experiments, the EGF(A)-mimicking peptide Pep2-8 was used as an
      anchor peptide for the attachment of an extension peptide library directed toward
      the groove site. Guided by structural information, we further engineered the
      identified groove-binding peptides into antagonists, which encroach on the
      EGF(A)-binding site and inhibit LDLR binding.

PG  - 840-847
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3452 [doi]
AB  - The dynamics of transcription factors play important roles in a variety of
      biological systems. However, the mechanisms by which these dynamics are decoded
      into different transcriptional responses are not well understood. Here we focus
      on the dynamics of the tumor-suppressor protein p53, which exhibits a series of
      pulses in response to DNA damage. We performed time course RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) measurements to
      determine how p53 oscillations are linked with gene expression genome wide. We
      discovered multiple distinct patterns of gene expression in response to p53
      pulses. Surprisingly, p53-binding dynamics were uniform across all genomic loci, 
      even for genes that exhibited distinct mRNA dynamics. Using a mathematical model,
      supported by additional experimental measurements in response to sustained p53
      input, we determined that p53 binds to and activates transcription of its target 
      genes uniformly, whereas post-transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for the 
      differences in gene expression dynamics.

AB  - Eukaryotic ribosome synthesis is a complex, energy-consuming process that takes
      place across the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm and requires more than 200 
      conserved assembly factors. Here, we discuss mechanisms by which the ribosome
      assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport machineries collaborate to produce
      functional ribosomes. We also highlight recent cryo-EM studies that provided
      unprecedented snapshots of ribosomes during assembly and quality control.

TI  - TRF2 binds branched DNA to safeguard telomere integrity.
PG  - 734-742
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3451 [doi]
AB  - Although t-loops protect telomeres, they are at risk of cleavage by Holliday
      junction (HJ) resolvases if branch migration converts the three-way t-loop
      junction into four-way HJs. T-loop cleavage is repressed by the TRF2 basic
      domain, which binds three- and four-way junctions and protects HJs in vitro. By
      replacing the basic domain with bacterial-protein domains binding three- and
      four-way junctions, we demonstrated the in vivo relevance of branched-DNA
      binding. Branched-DNA binding also repressed PARP1, presumably by masking the
      PARP1 site in the t-loop junction. Although PARP1 recruits HJ resolvases and
      promotes t-loop cleavage, PARP1 activation alone did not result in t-loop
      cleavage, thus suggesting that the basic domain also prevents formation of HJs.
      Concordantly, removal of HJs by BLM helicase mitigated t-loop cleavage in
      response to loss of the basic domain. We propose that TRF2 masks and stabilizes
      the t-loop three-way junction, thereby protecting telomeres from detrimental
      deletions and PARP1 activation.

TI  - X-ray structures of endothelin ETB receptor bound to clinical antagonist bosentan
      and its analog.
PG  - 758-764
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3450 [doi]
AB  - Endothelin receptors (ETRs) have crucial roles in vascular control and are
      targets for drugs designed to treat circulatory-system diseases and cancer
      progression. The nonpeptide dual-ETR antagonist bosentan is the first oral drug
      approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Here we report crystal
      structures of human endothelin ETB receptor bound to bosentan and to the
      ETB-selective analog K-8794, at 3.6-A and 2.2-A resolution, respectively. The
      K-8794-bound structure reveals the detailed water-mediated hydrogen-bonding
      network at the transmembrane core, which could account for the weak negative
      allosteric modulation of ETB by Na(+) ions. The bosentan-bound structure reveals 
      detailed interactions with ETB, which are probably conserved in the ETA receptor.
      A comparison of the two structures shows unexpected similarity between antagonist
      and agonist binding. Despite this similarity, bosentan sterically prevents the
      inward movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), and thus exerts its antagonistic 
      activity. These structural insights will facilitate the rational design of new
      ETR-targeting drugs.

      proteins.
PG  - 765-777
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3441 [doi]
AB  - Proteins with amino acid homorepeats have the potential to be detrimental to
      cells and are often associated with human diseases. Why, then, are homorepeats
      prevalent in eukaryotic proteomes? In yeast, homorepeats are enriched in proteins
      that are essential and pleiotropic and that buffer environmental insults. The
      presence of homorepeats increases the functional versatility of proteins by
      mediating protein interactions and facilitating spatial organization in a
      repeat-dependent manner. During evolution, homorepeats are preferentially
      retained in proteins with stringent proteostasis, which might minimize
      repeat-associated detrimental effects such as unregulated phase separation and
      protein aggregation. Their presence facilitates rapid protein divergence through 
      accumulation of amino acid substitutions, which often affect linear motifs and
      post-translational-modification sites. These substitutions may result in rewiring
      protein interaction and signaling networks. Thus, homorepeats are distinct
      modules that are often retained in stringently regulated proteins. Their presence
      facilitates rapid exploration of the genotype-phenotype landscape of a
      population, thereby contributing to adaptation and fitness.

TI  - Hydroxylation of a conserved tRNA modification establishes non-universal genetic 
      code in echinoderm mitochondria.
PG  - 778-782
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3449 [doi]
AB  - The genetic code is not frozen but still evolving, which can result in the
      acquisition of 'dialectal' codons that deviate from the universal genetic code.
      RNA modifications in the anticodon region of tRNAs play a critical role in
      establishing such non-universal genetic codes. In echinoderm mitochondria, the
      AAA codon specifies asparagine instead of lysine. By analyzing mitochondrial
      (mt-) tRNA(Lys) isolated from the sea urchin (Mesocentrotus nudus), we discovered
      a novel modified nucleoside, hydroxy-N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ht(6)A), 3'
      adjacent to the anticodon (position 37). Biochemical analysis revealed that
      ht(6)A37 has the ability to prevent mt-tRNA(Lys) from misreading AAA as lysine,
      thereby indicating that hydroxylation of N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t(6)A) 
      contributes to the establishment of the non-universal genetic code in echinoderm 
      mitochondria.

      severing.
PG  - 717-725
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3448 [doi]
AB  - Microtubule-severing enzymes katanin, spastin and fidgetin are AAA ATPases
      important for the biogenesis and maintenance of complex microtubule arrays in
      axons, spindles and cilia. Because of a lack of known 3D structures for these
      enzymes, their mechanism of action has remained poorly understood. Here we report
      the X-ray crystal structure of the monomeric AAA katanin module from
      Caenorhabditis elegans and cryo-EM reconstructions of the hexamer in two
      conformations. The structures reveal an unexpected asymmetric arrangement of the 
      AAA domains mediated by structural elements unique to microtubule-severing
      enzymes and critical for their function. The reconstructions show that katanin
      cycles between open spiral and closed ring conformations, depending on the ATP
      occupancy of a gating protomer that tenses or relaxes interprotomer interfaces.
      Cycling of the hexamer between these conformations would provide the power stroke
      for microtubule severing.

TI  - Rps26 directs mRNA-specific translation by recognition of Kozak sequence
      elements.
PG  - 700-707
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3442 [doi]
AB  - We describe a novel approach to separate two ribosome populations from the same
      cells and use this method in combination with RNA-seq to identify mRNAs bound to 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes with and without Rps26, a protein linked to
      the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). These analyses reveal that
      Rps26 contributes to mRNA-specific translation by recognition of the Kozak
      sequence in well-translated mRNAs and that Rps26-deficient ribosomes
      preferentially translate mRNA from select stress-response pathways. Surprisingly,
      exposure of yeast to these stresses leads to the formation of Rps26-deficient
      ribosomes and to the increased translation of their target mRNAs. These results
      describe a novel paradigm: the production of specialized ribosomes, which play
      physiological roles in augmenting the well-characterized transcriptional stress
      response with a heretofore unknown translational response, thereby creating a
      feed-forward loop in gene expression. Moreover, the simultaneous gain-of-function
      and loss-of-function phenotypes from Rps26-deficient ribosomes can explain the
      pathogenesis of DBA.

TI  - Structural basis of TIR-domain-assembly formation in MAL- and MyD88-dependent
      TLR4 signaling.
PG  - 743-751
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3444 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is a key innate immunity response to
      pathogens. Recruitment of signaling adapters such as MAL (TIRAP) and MyD88 to the
      TLRs requires Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain interactions, which remain
      structurally elusive. Here we show that MAL TIR domains spontaneously and
      reversibly form filaments in vitro. They also form cofilaments with TLR4 TIR
      domains and induce formation of MyD88 assemblies. A 7-A-resolution cryo-EM
      structure reveals a stable MAL protofilament consisting of two parallel strands
      of TIR-domain subunits in a BB-loop-mediated head-to-tail arrangement. Interface 
      residues that are important for the interaction are conserved among different TIR
      domains. Although large filaments of TLR4, MAL or MyD88 are unlikely to form
      during cellular signaling, structure-guided mutagenesis, combined with in vivo
      interaction assays, demonstrated that the MAL interactions defined within the
      filament represent a template for a conserved mode of TIR-domain interaction
      involved in both TLR and interleukin-1 receptor signaling.

AB  - The reversible phosphorylation of proteins controls most cellular functions.
      Protein kinases have been popular drug targets, unlike phosphatases, which remain
      a drug discovery challenge. Guanabenz and Sephin1 are selective inhibitors of the
      phosphatase regulatory subunit PPP1R15A (R15A) that prolong the benefit of
      eIF2alpha phosphorylation, thereby protecting cells from proteostatic defects. In
      mice, Sephin1 prevents two neurodegenerative diseases, Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B
      (CMT-1B) and SOD1-mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the
      molecular basis for R15A inhibition is unknown. Here we reconstituted human
      recombinant eIF2alpha holophosphatases, R15A-PP1 and R15B-PP1, whose activity
      depends on both the catalytic subunit PP1 (protein phosphatase 1) and either R15A
      or R15B. This system enabled the functional characterization of these
      holophosphatases and revealed that Guanabenz and Sephin1 induced a selective
      conformational change in R15A, detected by resistance to limited proteolysis.
      This altered the recruitment of eIF2alpha, preventing its dephosphorylation. This
      work demonstrates that regulatory subunits of phosphatases are valid drug targets
      and provides the molecular rationale to expand this concept to other
      phosphatases.

TI  - An information theoretic framework reveals a tunable allosteric network in group 
      II chaperonins.

AB  - ATP-dependent allosteric regulation of the ring-shaped group II chaperonins
      remains ill defined, in part because their complex oligomeric topology has
      limited the success of structural techniques in suggesting allosteric
      determinants. Further, their high sequence conservation has hindered the
      prediction of allosteric networks using mathematical covariation approaches.
      Here, we develop an information theoretic strategy that is robust to residue
      conservation and apply it to group II chaperonins. We identify a contiguous
      network of covarying residues that connects all nucleotide-binding pockets within
      each chaperonin ring. An interfacial residue between the networks of neighboring 
      subunits controls positive cooperativity by communicating nucleotide occupancy
      within each ring. Strikingly, chaperonin allostery is tunable through single
      mutations at this position. Naturally occurring variants at this position that
      double the extent of positive cooperativity are less prevalent in nature. We
      propose that being less cooperative than attainable allows chaperonins to support
      robust folding over a wider range of metabolic conditions.

TI  - An antimicrobial peptide that inhibits translation by trapping release factors on
      the ribosome.
PG  - 752-757
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3439 [doi]
AB  - Many antibiotics stop bacterial growth by inhibiting different steps of protein
      synthesis. However, no specific inhibitors of translation termination are known. 
      Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides, a component of the antibacterial defense
      system of multicellular organisms, interfere with bacterial growth by inhibiting 
      translation. Here we show that Api137, a derivative of the insect-produced
      antimicrobial peptide apidaecin, arrests terminating ribosomes using a unique
      mechanism of action. Api137 binds to the Escherichia coli ribosome and traps
      release factor (RF) RF1 or RF2 subsequent to the release of the nascent
      polypeptide chain. A high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the ribosome complexed 
      with RF1 and Api137 reveals the molecular interactions that lead to RF trapping. 
      Api137-mediated depletion of the cellular pool of free release factors causes the
      majority of ribosomes to stall at stop codons before polypeptide release, thereby
      resulting in a global shutdown of translation termination.

TI  - Two chaperones locked in an embrace: structure and function of the
      ribosome-associated complex RAC.
PG  - 611-619
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3435 [doi]
AB  - Chaperones, which assist protein folding are essential components of every living
      cell. The yeast ribosome-associated complex (RAC) is a chaperone that is highly
      conserved in eukaryotic cells. The RAC consists of the J protein Zuo1 and the
      unconventional Hsp70 homolog Ssz1. The RAC heterodimer stimulates the ATPase
      activity of the ribosome-bound Hsp70 homolog Ssb, which interacts with nascent
      polypeptide chains to facilitate de novo protein folding. In addition, the
      RAC-Ssb system is required to maintain the fidelity of protein translation.
      Recent work reveals important details of the unique structures of RAC and Ssb and
      identifies how the chaperones interact with the ribosome. The new findings start 
      to uncover how the exceptional chaperone triad cooperates in protein folding and 
      maintenance of translational fidelity and its connection to extraribosomal
      functions.

TI  - A two-helix motif positions the lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase active site
      for catalysis within the membrane bilayer.
PG  - 666-671
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3436 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidic acid (PA), the central intermediate in membrane phospholipid
      synthesis, is generated by two acyltransferases in a pathway conserved in all
      life forms. The second step in this pathway is catalyzed by
      1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, called PlsC in bacteria. Here we 
      present the crystal structure of PlsC from Thermotoga maritima, revealing an
      unusual hydrophobic/aromatic N-terminal two-helix motif linked to an
      acyltransferase alphabeta-domain that contains the catalytic HX4D motif. PlsC
      dictates the acyl chain composition of the 2-position of phospholipids, and the
      acyl chain selectivity 'ruler' is an appropriately placed and closed hydrophobic 
      tunnel. We confirmed this by site-directed mutagenesis and membrane composition
      analysis of Escherichia coli cells that expressed mutant PlsC. Molecular dynamics
      (MD) simulations showed that the two-helix motif represents a novel substructure 
      that firmly anchors the protein to one leaflet of the membrane. This binding mode
      allows the PlsC active site to acylate lysophospholipids within the membrane
      bilayer by using soluble acyl donors.

TI  - Musashi 1 regulates the timing and extent of meiotic mRNA translational
      activation by promoting the use of specific CPEs.
PG  - 672-681
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3434 [doi]
AB  - The translational reactivation of maternal mRNAs encoding meiotic drivers in
      vertebrates is accomplished mainly by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. The
      cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) present in the 3' untranslated
      regions (3' UTRs) of these transcripts, together with their cognate CPE-binding
      proteins (CPEBs), define a combinatorial code that determines the timing and
      extent of translational activation upon meiosis resumption. In addition, the
      RNA-binding protein Musashi1 (Msi1) regulates polyadenylation of CPE-containing
      mRNAs by a yet undefined CPEB-dependent or CPEB-independent mechanism. Here we
      show that Msi1 alone does not support cytoplasmic polyadenylation, but its
      binding triggers the remodeling of RNA structure, thereby exposing adjacent CPEs 
      and stimulating polyadenylation. In this way, Msi1 directs the preferential use
      of specific CPEs, which in turn affects the timing and extent of polyadenylation 
      during meiotic progression. Genome-wide analysis of CPEB1- and Msi1-associated
      mRNAs identified 491 common targets, thus revealing a new layer of CPE-mediated
      translational control.

TI  - PAR-TERRA directs homologous sex chromosome pairing.
PG  - 620-631
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3432 [doi]
AB  - In mammals, homologous chromosomes rarely pair outside meiosis. One exception is 
      the X chromosome, which transiently pairs during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI).
      How two chromosomes find each other in 3D space is not known. Here, we reveal a
      required interaction between the X-inactivation center (Xic) and the telomere in 
      mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The subtelomeric, pseudoautosomal regions (PARs)
      of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y) also undergo pairing in both female and male
      cells. PARs transcribe a class of telomeric RNA, dubbed PAR-TERRA, which accounts
      for a vast majority of all TERRA transcripts. PAR-TERRA binds throughout the
      genome, including to the PAR and Xic. During X-chromosome pairing, PAR-TERRA
      anchors the Xic to the PAR, creating a 'tetrad' of pairwise homologous
      interactions (Xic-Xic, PAR-PAR, and Xic-PAR). Xic pairing occurs within the
      tetrad. Depleting PAR-TERRA abrogates pairing and blocks initiation of XCI,
      whereas autosomal PAR-TERRA induces ectopic pairing. We propose a 'constrained
      diffusion model' in which PAR-TERRA creates an interaction hub to guide Xic
      homology searching during XCI.

TI  - Mechanochemical evolution of the giant muscle protein titin as inferred from
      resurrected proteins.
PG  - 652-657
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3426 [doi]
AB  - The sarcomere-based structure of muscles is conserved among vertebrates; however,
      vertebrate muscle physiology is extremely diverse. A molecular explanation for
      this diversity and its evolution has not been proposed. We use phylogenetic
      analyses and single-molecule force spectroscopy (smFS) to investigate the
      mechanochemical evolution of titin, a giant protein responsible for the
      elasticity of muscle filaments. We resurrect eight-domain fragments of titin
      corresponding to the common ancestors to mammals, sauropsids, and tetrapods,
      which lived 105-356 Myr ago, and compare them with titin fragments from some of
      their modern descendants. We demonstrate that the resurrected titin molecules are
      rich in disulfide bonds and display high mechanical stability. These
      mechanochemical elements have changed over time, creating a paleomechanical trend
      that seems to correlate with animal body size, allowing us to estimate the sizes 
      of extinct species. We hypothesize that mechanical adjustments in titin
      contributed to physiological changes that allowed the muscular development and
      diversity of modern tetrapods.

TI  - Multi-domain utilization by TUT4 and TUT7 in control of let-7 biogenesis.
PG  - 658-665
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3428 [doi]
AB  - The uridyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 (collectively called TUT4(7)) switch
      between two modes of activity, either promoting expression of let-7 microRNA
      (monoU) or marking it for degradation (oligoU). Lin28 modulates the switch via
      recruitment of TUT4(7) to the precursor pre-let-7 in stem cells and human
      cancers. We found that TUT4(7) utilize two multidomain functional modules during 
      the switch from monoU to oligoU. The catalytic module (CM) is essential for both 
      activities, while the Lin28-interacting module (LIM) is indispensable for oligoU.
      A TUT7 CM structure trapped in the monoU activity staterevealed a
      duplex-RNA-binding pocket that orients group II pre-let-7 hairpins to favor monoU
      addition. Conversely, the switch to oligoU requires the ZK domain of Lin28 to
      drive the formation of a stable ternary complex between pre-let-7 and the
      inactive LIM. Finally, ZK2 of TUT4(7) aids oligoU addition by engaging the
      growing oligoU tail through uracil-specific interactions.

TI  - Asparagine endopeptidase cleaves alpha-synuclein and mediates pathologic
      activities in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 632-642
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3433 [doi]
AB  - Aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
      synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effects of alpha-synuclein are not
      completely understood. Here we show that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) cleaves
      human alpha-synuclein, triggers its aggregation and escalates its neurotoxicity, 
      thus leading to dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor impairments in a mouse
      model. AEP is activated and cleaves human alpha-synuclein at N103 in an
      age-dependent manner. AEP is highly activated in human brains with PD, and it
      fragments alpha-synuclein, which is found aggregated in Lewy bodies.
      Overexpression of the AEP-cleaved alpha-synuclein1-103 fragment in the substantia
      nigra induces both dopaminergic neuronal loss and movement defects in mice. In
      contrast, inhibition of AEP-mediated cleavage of alpha-synuclein (wild type and
      A53T mutant) diminishes alpha-synuclein's pathologic effects. Together, these
      findings support AEP's role as a key mediator of alpha-synuclein-related
      etiopathological effects in PD.

AB  - The complement system labels microbes and host debris for clearance. Degradation 
      of surface-bound C3b is pivotal to direct immune responses and protect host
      cells. How the serine protease factor I (FI), assisted by regulators, cleaves
      either two or three distant peptide bonds in the CUB domain of C3b remains
      unclear. We present a crystal structure of C3b in complex with FI and regulator
      factor H (FH; domains 1-4 with 19-20). FI binds C3b-FH between FH domains 2 and 3
      and a reoriented C3b C-terminal domain and docks onto the first scissile bond,
      while stabilizing its catalytic domain for proteolytic activity. One cleavage in 
      C3b does not affect its overall structure, whereas two cleavages unfold CUB and
      dislodge the thioester-containing domain (TED), affecting binding of regulators
      and thereby determining the number of cleavages. These data explain how FI
      generates late-stage opsonins iC3b or C3dg in a context-dependent manner, to
      react to foreign, danger or healthy self signals.

TI  - Chromatin-enriched lncRNAs can act as cell-type specific activators of proximal
      gene transcription.
PG  - 596-603
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3424 [doi]
AB  - We recently described a new class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are
      distinguished by especially tight chromatin association and whose presence is
      strongly correlated to expression of nearby genes. Here, we examine the
      cis-enhancer mechanism of this class of chromatin-enriched RNA (cheRNA) across
      multiple human cell lines. cheRNAs are largely cell type specific and provide the
      most reliable chromatin signature to predict cis-gene transcription in every
      human cell type examined. Targeted depletion of three cheRNAs decreases
      expression of their neighboring genes, indicating potential co-activator
      function, and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) of one 
      cheRNA-distal target gene pair suggests a spatial overlap consistent with a role 
      in chromosome looping. Additionally, the cheRNA HIDALGO stimulates the fetal
      hemoglobin subunit gamma 1 (HBG1) gene during erythroid differentiation by
      promoting contacts to a downstream enhancer. Our results suggest that multiple
      cheRNAs activate proximal lineage-specific gene transcription.

TI  - Rif1 maintains telomeres and mediates DNA repair by encasing DNA ends.
PG  - 588-595
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3420 [doi]
AB  - In yeast, Rif1 is part of the telosome, where it inhibits telomerase and
      checkpoint signaling at chromosome ends. In mammalian cells, Rif1 is not
      telomeric, but it suppresses DNA end resection at chromosomal breaks, promoting
      repair by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we describe crystal structures 
      for the uncharacterized and conserved approximately 125-kDa N-terminal domain of 
      Rif1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rif1-NTD), revealing an alpha-helical fold
      shaped like a shepherd's crook. We identify a high-affinity DNA-binding site in
      the Rif1-NTD that fully encases DNA as a head-to-tail dimer. Engagement of the
      Rif1-NTD with telomeres proved essential for checkpoint control and telomere
      length regulation. Unexpectedly, Rif1-NTD also promoted NHEJ at DNA breaks in
      yeast, revealing a conserved role of Rif1 in DNA repair. We propose that tight
      associations between the Rif1-NTD and DNA gate access of processing factors to
      DNA ends, enabling Rif1 to mediate diverse telomere maintenance and DNA repair
      functions.

TI  - Structural basis for the cooperative allosteric activation of the free fatty acid
      receptor GPR40.
PG  - 570-577
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3417 [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies indicate that partial agonists of the G-protein-coupled, free
      fatty acid receptor 1 GPR40 enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and
      represent a potential mechanism for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Full allosteric agonists (AgoPAMs) of GPR40 bind to a site distinct from partial 
      agonists and can provide additional efficacy. We report the 3.2-A crystal
      structure of human GPR40 (hGPR40) in complex with both the partial agonist
      MK-8666 and an AgoPAM, which exposes a novel lipid-facing AgoPAM-binding pocket
      outside the transmembrane helical bundle. Comparison with an additional 2.2-A
      structure of the hGPR40-MK-8666 binary complex reveals an induced-fit
      conformational coupling between the partial agonist and AgoPAM binding sites,
      involving rearrangements of the transmembrane helices 4 and 5 (TM4 and TM5) and
      transition of the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) into a short helix. These
      conformational changes likely prime GPR40 to a more active-like state and explain
      the binding cooperativity between these ligands.

AB  - Eukaryotic gene expression is heavily regulated at the transcriptional and
      post-transcriptional levels. An additional layer of regulation occurs
      co-transcriptionally through processing and decay of nascent transcripts
      physically associated with chromatin. This process involves RNA interference
      (RNAi) machinery and is well documented in yeast, but little is known about its
      conservation in mammals. Here we show that Dgcr8 and Drosha physically associate 
      with chromatin in murine embryonic stem cells (mES), specifically with a subset
      of transcribed coding and noncoding genes. Dgcr8 recruitment to chromatin is
      dependent on transcription as well as methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), which
      catalyzes RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A). Intriguingly, we found that acute
      temperature stress causes radical relocalization of Dgcr8 and Mettl3 to
      heat-shock genes, where they act to co-transcriptionally mark mRNAs for
      subsequent RNA degradation. Together, our findings elucidate a novel mode of
      co-transcriptional gene regulation, in which m(6)A serves as a chemical mark that
      instigates subsequent post-transcriptional RNA-processing events.

TI  - Structural analysis of MDM2 RING separates degradation from regulation of p53
      transcription activity.
PG  - 578-587
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3414 [doi]
AB  - MDM2-MDMX complexes bind the p53 tumor-suppressor protein, inhibiting p53's
      transcriptional activity and targeting p53 for proteasomal degradation.
      Inhibitors that disrupt binding between p53 and MDM2 efficiently activate a p53
      response, but their use in the treatment of cancers that retain wild-type p53 may
      be limited by on-target toxicities due to p53 activation in normal tissue. Guided
      by a novel crystal structure of the MDM2-MDMX-E2(UbcH5B)-ubiquitin complex, we
      designed MDM2 mutants that prevent E2-ubiquitin binding without altering the
      RING-domain structure. These mutants lack MDM2's E3 activity but retain the
      ability to limit p53's transcriptional activity and allow cell proliferation.
      Cells expressing these mutants respond more quickly to cellular stress than cells
      expressing wild-type MDM2, but basal p53 control is maintained. Targeting the
      MDM2 E3-ligase activity could therefore widen the therapeutic window of p53
      activation in tumors.

TI  - A MILI-independent piRNA biogenesis pathway empowers partial germline
      reprogramming.
PG  - 604-606
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3413 [doi]
AB  - In mice, the pathway involving PIWI and PIWI-interacting RNA (PIWI-piRNA) is
      essential to re-establish transposon silencing during male-germline
      reprogramming. The cytoplasmic PIWI protein MILI mediates piRNA-guided transposon
      RNA cleavage as well as piRNA amplification. MIWI2's binding to piRNA and its
      nuclear localization are proposed to be dependent upon MILI function. Here, we
      demonstrate the existence of a piRNA biogenesis pathway that sustains partial
      MIWI2 function and reprogramming activity in the absence of MILI.

TI  - DNA N(6)-methyladenine in metazoans: functional epigenetic mark or bystander?
PG  - 503-506
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3412 [doi]
AB  - The DNA-adenine modification N(6)-methyladenine (6mA), initially thought to be
      mainly restricted to prokaryotes and certain unicellular eukaryotes, has recently
      been found in metazoans. Proposed functions vary from gene activation to
      transposon suppression. However, since most metazoan genomes possess
      5-methylcytosine (5mC) as a dominant epigenetic mark, it raises the question of
      why 6mA is required. This Perspective summarizes the latest discoveries and
      suggests potential functional roles for 6mA in metazoan genomes.

PG  - 544-552
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3411 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism by which the recently identified DNA modification 5-formylcytosine 
      ((f)C) is recognized by epigenetic writer and reader proteins is not known.
      Recently, an unusual DNA structure, F-DNA, has been proposed as the basis for
      enzyme recognition of clusters of (f)C. We used NMR and X-ray crystallography to 
      compare several modified DNA duplexes with unmodified analogs and found that in
      the crystal state the duplexes all belong to the A family, whereas in solution
      they are all members of the B family. We found that, contrary to previous
      findings, (f)C does not significantly affect the structure of DNA, although there
      are modest local differences at the modification sites. Hence, global
      conformation changes are unlikely to account for the recognition of this modified
      base, and our structural data favor a mechanism that operates at base-pair
      resolution for the recognition of (f)C by epigenome-modifying enzymes.

TI  - The myosin mesa and the basis of hypercontractility caused by hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy mutations.
PG  - 525-533
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3408 [doi]
AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is primarily caused by mutations in
      beta-cardiac myosin and myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C). Changes in the
      contractile parameters of myosin measured so far do not explain the clinical
      hypercontractility caused by such mutations. We propose that hypercontractility
      is due to an increase in the number of myosin heads (S1) that are accessible for 
      force production. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate myosin tail
      (S2)-dependent functional regulation of actin-activated human beta-cardiac myosin
      ATPase. In addition, we show that both S2 and MyBP-C bind to S1 and that
      phosphorylation of either S1 or MyBP-C weakens these interactions. Importantly,
      the S1-S2 interaction is also weakened by four myosin HCM-causing mutations but
      not by two other mutations. To explain these experimental results, we propose a
      working structural model involving multiple interactions, including those with
      myosin's own S2 and MyBP-C, that hold myosin in a sequestered state.

      required for nucleotide homeostasis. Here we show that for human CTPS,
      polymerization increases catalytic activity. The cryo-EM structures of bacterial 
      and human CTPS filaments differ considerably in overall architecture and in the
      conformation of the CTPS protomer, explaining the divergent consequences of
      polymerization on activity. The structure of human CTPS filament, the first
      structure of the full-length human enzyme, reveals a novel active conformation.
      The filament structures elucidate allosteric mechanisms of assembly and
      regulation that rely on a conserved conformational equilibrium. The findings may 
      provide a mechanism for increasing human CTPS activity in response to metabolic
      state and challenge the assumption that metabolic filaments are generally storage
      forms of inactive enzymes. Allosteric regulation of CTPS polymerization by
      ligands likely represents a fundamental mechanism underlying assembly of other
      metabolic filaments.

      decay.
PG  - 534-543
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3403 [doi]
AB  - Both p150 and p110 isoforms of ADAR1 convert adenosine to inosine in
      double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). ADAR1p150 suppresses the dsRNA-sensing mechanism
      that activates MDA5-MAVS-IFN signaling in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the
      biological function of the ADAR1p110 isoform, which is usually located in the
      nucleus, is largely unknown. Here, we show that stress-activated phosphorylation 
      of ADAR1p110 by MKK6-p38-MSK MAP kinases promotes its binding to Exportin-5 and
      its export from the nucleus. After translocating to the cytoplasm, ADAR1p110
      suppresses apoptosis in stressed cells by protecting many antiapoptotic gene
      transcripts that contain 3'-untranslated-region dsRNA structures primarily
      comprising inverted Alu repeats. ADAR1p110 competitively inhibits binding of
      Staufen1 to the 3'-untranslated-region dsRNAs and antagonizes Staufen1-mediated
      mRNA decay. Our study reveals a new stress-response mechanism in which human
      ADAR1p110 and Staufen1 regulate surveillance of a set of mRNAs required for
      survival of stressed cells.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3402 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression states influence the 3D conformation of the genome through poorly
      understood mechanisms. Here, we investigate the conformation of the murine HoxB
      locus, a gene-dense genomic region containing closely spaced genes with distinct 
      activation states in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To predict possible folding
      scenarios, we performed computer simulations of polymer models informed with
      different chromatin occupancy features that define promoter activation states or 
      binding sites for the transcription factor CTCF. Single-cell imaging of the locus
      folding was performed to test model predictions. While CTCF occupancy alone fails
      to predict the in vivo folding at genomic length scale of 10 kb, we found that
      homotypic interactions between active and Polycomb-repressed promoters
      co-occurring in the same DNA fiber fully explain the HoxB folding patterns imaged
      in single cells. We identify state-dependent promoter interactions as major
      drivers of chromatin folding in gene-dense regions.

AB  - Although R loops can occur at different genomic locations, the factors that
      determine their formation and frequency remain unclear. Emerging evidence
      indicates that DNA breaks stimulate DNA-RNA hybrid formation. Here, we discuss
      the possibility that formation of hybrids may be an inevitable risk of DNA breaks
      that occur within actively transcribed regions. While such hybrids must be
      removed to permit repair, their potential role as repair intermediates remains to
      be established.

TI  - Parkin-phosphoubiquitin complex reveals cryptic ubiquitin-binding site required
      for RBR ligase activity.
PG  - 475-483
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3400 [doi]
AB  - RING-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligases are a class of ubiquitin ligases distinct from
      RING or HECT E3 ligases. An important RBR ligase is Parkin, mutations in which
      lead to early-onset hereditary Parkinsonism. Parkin and other RBR ligases share a
      catalytic RBR module but are usually autoinhibited and activated via distinct
      mechanisms. Recent insights into Parkin regulation predict large, unknown
      conformational changes during Parkin activation. However, current data on active 
      RBR ligases reflect the absence of regulatory domains. Therefore, it remains
      unclear how individual RBR ligases are activated, and whether they share a common
      mechanism. We now report the crystal structure of a human Parkin-phosphoubiquitin
      complex, which shows that phosphoubiquitin binding induces movement in the
      'in-between RING' (IBR) domain to reveal a cryptic ubiquitin-binding site.
      Mutation of this site negatively affects Parkin's activity. Furthermore,
      ubiquitin binding promotes cooperation between Parkin molecules, which suggests a
      role for interdomain association in the RBR ligase mechanism.

TI  - An orthogonal single-molecule experiment reveals multiple-attempt dynamics of
      type IA topoisomerases.
PG  - 484-490
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3401 [doi]
AB  - Topoisomerases are enzymes that are involved in maintaining the topological state
      of cellular DNA. Their dynamic characteristics remain poorly understood despite
      numerous structural, biophysical and biochemical studies. Recent single-molecule 
      experiments revealed that an important feature of the type IA topoisomerase
      mechanism is the presence of pauses between relaxation events. However, these
      experiments could not determine whether the protein remains DNA bound during the 
      pauses or what relationship may exist between protein domain movements and
      topological changes in the DNA. By combining two orthogonal single-molecule
      techniques, we found that E. coli topoisomerase I constantly changes conformation
      when attempting to modify the topology of DNA, but succeeds in only a fraction of
      the attempts. Thus, its mechanism can be described as a series of DNA
      strand-passage attempts that culminate in a successful relaxation event.

TI  - Intraflagellar transport dynein is autoinhibited by trapping of its mechanical
      and track-binding elements.
PG  - 461-468
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3391 [doi]
AB  - Cilia are multifunctional organelles that are constructed using intraflagellar
      transport (IFT) of cargo to and from their tip. It is widely held that the
      retrograde IFT motor, dynein-2, must be controlled in order to reach the ciliary 
      tip and then unleashed to power the return journey. However, the mechanism is
      unknown. Here, we systematically define the mechanochemistry of human dynein-2
      motors as monomers, dimers, and multimotor assemblies with kinesin-II. Combining 
      these data with insights from single-particle EM, we discover that dynein-2
      dimers are intrinsically autoinhibited. Inhibition is mediated by trapping
      dynein-2's mechanical 'linker' and 'stalk' domains within a novel motor-motor
      interface. We find that linker-mediated inhibition enables efficient transport of
      dynein-2 by kinesin-II in vitro. These results suggest a conserved mechanism for 
      autoregulation among dimeric dyneins, which is exploited as a switch for
      dynein-2's recycling activity during IFT.

TI  - Structural basis for lipopolysaccharide extraction by ABC transporter LptB2FG.
PG  - 469-474
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3399 [doi]
AB  - After biosynthesis, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are transiently anchored 
      to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane (IM). The ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporter LptB2FG extracts LPS molecules from the IM and transports them to the
      outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of nucleotide-free LptB2FG
      from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The structure reveals that lipopolysaccharide
      transport proteins LptF and LptG each contain a transmembrane domain (TMD), a
      periplasmic beta-jellyroll-like domain and a coupling helix that interacts with
      LptB on the cytoplasmic side. The LptF and LptG TMDs form a large outward-facing 
      V-shaped cavity in the IM. Mutational analyses suggest that LPS may enter the
      central cavity laterally, via the interface of the TMD domains of LptF and LptG, 
      and is expelled into the beta-jellyroll-like domains upon ATP binding and
      hydrolysis by LptB. These studies suggest a mechanism for LPS extraction by
      LptB2FG that is distinct from those of classical ABC transporters that transport 
      substrates across the IM.

      translation initiation.
PG  - 453-460
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3396 [doi]
AB  - The essential ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 splits 80S ribosomes into 60S
      and 40S subunits after canonical termination or quality-control-based mRNA
      surveillance processes. However, the underlying splitting mechanism remains
      enigmatic. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the yeast 40S-ABCE1
      post-splitting complex at 3.9-A resolution. Compared to the pre-splitting state, 
      we observe repositioning of ABCE1's iron-sulfur cluster domain, which rotates 150
      degrees into a binding pocket on the 40S subunit. This repositioning explains a
      newly observed anti-association activity of ABCE1. Notably, the movement implies 
      a collision with A-site factors, thus explaining the splitting mechanism.
      Disruption of key interactions in the post-splitting complex impairs cellular
      homeostasis. Additionally, the structure of a native post-splitting complex
      reveals ABCE1 to be part of the 43S initiation complex, suggesting a coordination
      of termination, recycling, and initiation.

      the necessity for cells to stably maintain transcription programs, but also by
      the need to recognize signals and allow plastic responses to environmental
      stimuli. The mechanistic role of the epigenome in adult postmitotic tissues,
      however, remains largely unknown. In vertebrates, two variants of the Polycomb
      repressive complex (PRC2-Ezh2 and PRC2-Ezh1) control gene silencing via
      methylation of histone H3 on Lys27 (H3K27me). Here we describe a reversible
      mechanism that involves a novel isoform of Ezh1 (Ezh1beta). Ezh1beta lacks the
      catalytic SET domain and acts in the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle cells to
      control nuclear PRC2-Ezh1 activity in response to atrophic oxidative stress, by
      regulating Eed assembly with Suz12 and Ezh1alpha (the canonical isoform) at their
      target genes. We report a novel PRC2-Ezh1 function that utilizes Ezh1beta as an
      adaptive stress sensor in the cytoplasm, thus allowing postmitotic cells to
      maintain tissue integrity in response to environmental changes.

TI  - Structures of human O-GlcNAcase and its complexes reveal a new substrate
      recognition mode.
PG  - 362-369
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3390 [doi]
AB  - Human O-GlcNAcase (hOGA) is the unique enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of
      the O-linked beta-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, an essential
      protein glycosylation event that modulates the function of numerous cellular
      proteins in response to nutrients and stress. Here we report crystal structures
      of a truncated hOGA, which comprises the catalytic and stalk domains, in apo
      form, in complex with an inhibitor, and in complex with a glycopeptide substrate.
      We found that hOGA forms an unusual arm-in-arm homodimer in which the catalytic
      domain of one monomer is covered by the stalk domain of the sister monomer to
      create a substrate-binding cleft. Notably, the residues on the cleft surface
      afford extensive interactions with the peptide substrate in a recognition mode
      that is distinct from that of its bacterial homologs. These structures represent 
      the first model of eukaryotic enzymes in the glycoside hydrolase 84 (GH84) family
      and provide a crucial starting point for understanding the substrate specificity 
      of hOGA, which regulates a broad range of biological and pathological processes.

TI  - A mammalian nervous-system-specific plasma membrane proteasome complex that
      modulates neuronal function.
PG  - 419-430
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3389 [doi]
AB  - In the nervous system, rapidly occurring processes such as neuronal transmission 
      and calcium signaling are affected by short-term inhibition of proteasome
      function. It is unclear how proteasomes are able to acutely regulate such
      processes, as this action is inconsistent with their canonical role in
      proteostasis. Here we describe a mammalian nervous-system-specific membrane
      proteasome complex that directly and rapidly modulates neuronal function by
      degrading intracellular proteins into extracellular peptides that can stimulate
      neuronal signaling. This proteasome complex is closely associated with neuronal
      plasma membranes, exposed to the extracellular space, and catalytically active.
      Selective inhibition of the membrane proteasome complex by a cell-impermeable
      proteasome inhibitor blocked the production of extracellular peptides and
      attenuated neuronal-activity-induced calcium signaling. Moreover, we observed
      that membrane-proteasome-derived peptides were sufficient to induce neuronal
      calcium signaling. Our discoveries challenge the prevailing notion that
      proteasomes function primarily to maintain proteostasis, and highlight a form of 
      neuronal communication that takes place through a membrane proteasome complex.

TI  - Genome-wide mapping of long-range contacts unveils clustering of DNA
      double-strand breaks at damaged active genes.
PG  - 353-361
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3387 [doi]
AB  - The ability of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to cluster in mammalian cells has 
      been a subject of intense debate in recent years. Here we used a high-throughput 
      chromosome conformation capture assay (capture Hi-C) to investigate clustering of
      DSBs induced at defined loci in the human genome. The results unambiguously
      demonstrated that DSBs cluster, but only when they are induced within
      transcriptionally active genes. Clustering of damaged genes occurs primarily
      during the G1 cell-cycle phase and coincides with delayed repair. Moreover, DSB
      clustering depends on the MRN complex as well as the Formin 2 (FMN2) nuclear
      actin organizer and the linker of nuclear and cytoplasmic skeleton (LINC)
      complex, thus suggesting that active mechanisms promote clustering. This work
      reveals that, when damaged, active genes, compared with the rest of the genome,
      exhibit a distinctive behavior, remaining largely unrepaired and clustered in G1,
      and being repaired via homologous recombination in postreplicative cells.

      resolution.

AB  - Separase is a caspase-family protease that initiates chromatid segregation by
      cleaving the kleisin subunits (Scc1 and Rec8) of cohesin, and regulates
      centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle function through cleavage of kendrin
      and Slk19. To understand the mechanisms of securin regulation of separase, we
      used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a
      near-atomic-resolution structure of the Caenorhabditis elegans separase-securin
      complex. Separase adopts a triangular-shaped bilobal architecture comprising an
      N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like alpha-solenoid domain docked onto 
      the conserved C-terminal protease domain. Securin engages separase in an extended
      antiparallel conformation, interacting with both lobes. It inhibits separase by
      interacting with the catalytic site through a pseudosubstrate mechanism, thus
      revealing that in the inhibited separase-securin complex, the catalytic site
      adopts a conformation compatible with substrate binding. Securin is protected
      from cleavage because an aliphatic side chain at the P1 position represses
      protease activity by disrupting the organization of catalytic site residues.

      immunodominant CD8(+) T cell epitope.
PG  - 395-406
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3383 [doi]
AB  - A keystone of antiviral immunity is CD8(+) T cell recognition of viral peptides
      bound to MHC-I proteins. The recognition modes of individual T cell receptors
      (TCRs) have been studied in some detail, but the role of TCR variation in
      providing a robust response to viral antigens is unclear. The influenza M1
      epitope is an immunodominant target of CD8(+) T cells that help to control
      influenza in HLA-A2(+) individuals. Here we show that CD8(+) T cells use many
      distinct TCRs to recognize HLA-A2-M1, which enables the use of different
      structural solutions to the problem of specifically recognizing a relatively
      featureless peptide antigen. The vast majority of responding TCRs target a small 
      cleft between HLA-A2 and the bound M1 peptide. These broad repertoires lead to
      plasticity in antigen recognition and protection against T cell clonal loss and
      viral escape.

TI  - TOP2 synergizes with BAF chromatin remodeling for both resolution and formation
      of facultative heterochromatin.
PG  - 344-352
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3384 [doi]
AB  - The resolution and formation of facultative heterochromatin are essential for
      development, reprogramming, and oncogenesis. The mechanisms underlying these
      changes are poorly understood owing to the difficulty of studying heterochromatin
      dynamics and structure in vivo. We devised an in vivo approach to investigate
      these mechanisms and found that topoisomerase II (TOP2), but not TOP1, synergizes
      with BAF (mSWI/SNF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes genome-wide to
      resolve facultative heterochromatin to accessible chromatin independent of
      transcription. This indicates that changes in DNA topology that take place
      through (de-)catenation rather than the release of torsional stress through
      swiveling are necessary for heterochromatin resolution. TOP2 and BAF cooperate to
      recruit pluripotency factors, which explains some of the instructive roles of BAF
      complexes. Unexpectedly, we found that TOP2 also plays a role in the re-formation
      of facultative heterochromatin; this finding suggests that facultative
      heterochromatin and accessible chromatin exist at different states of catenation 
      or other topologies, which might be critical to their structures.

PG  - 370-378
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3382 [doi]
AB  - Binding of the gp120 envelope (Env) glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor is the first
      step in the HIV-1 infectious cycle. Although the CD4-binding site has been
      extensively characterized, the initial receptor interaction has been difficult to
      study because of major CD4-induced structural rearrangements. Here we used
      cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the initial contact of CD4
      with the HIV-1 Env trimer at 6.8-A resolution. A single CD4 molecule is embraced 
      by a quaternary HIV-1-Env surface formed by coalescence of the previously defined
      CD4-contact region with a second CD4-binding site (CD4-BS2) in the inner domain
      of a neighboring gp120 protomer. Disruption of CD4-BS2 destabilized CD4-trimer
      interaction and abrogated HIV-1 infectivity by preventing the acquisition of
      coreceptor-binding competence. A corresponding reduction in HIV-1 infectivity
      occurred after the mutation of CD4 residues that interact with CD4-BS2. Our
      results document the critical role of quaternary interactions in the initial
      HIV-Env-receptor contact, with implications for treatment and vaccine design.

TI  - Mechanistic basis for the recognition of a misfolded protein by the molecular
      chaperone Hsp90.
PG  - 407-413
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3380 [doi]
AB  - The critical toxic species in over 40 human diseases are misfolded proteins.
      Their interaction with molecular chaperones such as Hsp90, which preferentially
      interacts with metastable proteins, is essential for the blocking of disease
      progression. Here we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to
      determine the three-dimensional structure of the misfolded cytotoxic monomer of
      the amyloidogenic human protein transthyretin, which is characterized by the
      release of the C-terminal beta-strand and perturbations of the A-B loop. The
      misfolded transthyretin monomer, but not the wild-type protein, binds to human
      Hsp90. In the bound state, the Hsp90 dimer predominantly populates an open
      conformation, and transthyretin retains its globular structure. The interaction
      surface for the transthyretin monomer comprises the N-terminal and middle domains
      of Hsp90 and overlaps with that of the Alzheimer's-disease-related protein tau.
      Taken together, the data suggest that Hsp90 uses a mechanism for the recognition 
      of aggregation-prone proteins that is largely distinct from those of other Hsp90 
      clients.

TI  - HIV Tat protein and amyloid-beta peptide form multifibrillar structures that
      cause neurotoxicity.
PG  - 379-386
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3379 [doi]
AB  - Deposition of amyloid-beta plaques is increased in the brains of HIV-infected
      individuals, and the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein affects
      amyloidogenesis through several indirect mechanisms. Here, we investigated direct
      interactions between Tat and amyloid-beta peptide. Our in vitro studies showed
      that in the presence of Tat, uniform amyloid fibrils become double twisted
      fibrils and further form populations of thick unstructured filaments and
      aggregates. Specifically, Tat binding to the exterior surfaces of the Abeta
      fibrils increases beta-sheet formation and lateral aggregation into thick
      multifibrillar structures, thus producing fibers with increased rigidity and
      mechanical resistance. Furthermore, Tat and Abeta aggregates in complex
      synergistically induced neurotoxicity both in vitro and in animal models.
      Increased rigidity and mechanical resistance of the amyloid-beta-Tat complexes
      coupled with stronger adhesion due to the presence of Tat in the fibrils may
      account for increased damage, potentially through pore formation in membranes.

TI  - MHC-I peptides get out of the groove and enable a novel mechanism of HIV-1
      escape.
PG  - 387-394
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3381 [doi]
AB  - Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules play a crucial role in
      immunity by capturing peptides for presentation to T cells and natural killer
      (NK) cells. The peptide termini are tethered within the MHC-I antigen-binding
      groove, but it is unknown whether other presentation modes occur. Here we show
      that 20% of the HLA-B*57:01 peptide repertoire comprises N-terminally extended
      sets characterized by a common motif at position 1 (P1) to P2. Structures of
      HLA-B*57:01 presenting N-terminally extended peptides, including the
      immunodominant HIV-1 Gag epitope TW10 (TSTLQEQIGW), showed that the N terminus
      protrudes from the peptide-binding groove. The common escape mutant TSNLQEQIGW
      bound HLA-B*57:01 canonically, adopting a dramatically different conformation
      than the TW10 peptide. This affected recognition by killer cell
      immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 3DL1 expressed on NK cells. We thus define a
      previously uncharacterized feature of the human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I)
      immunopeptidome that has implications for viral immune escape. We further suggest
      that recognition of the HLA-B*57:01-TW10 epitope is governed by a 'molecular
      tension' between the adaptive and innate immune systems.

      chromosome conformation.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3370 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Xist ensures X-chromosome inactivation
      (XCI) in female placental mammals. Although Xist is one of the most intensively
      studied lncRNAs, the mechanisms associated with its capacity to trigger
      chromosome-wide gene silencing, the formation of facultative heterochromatin and 
      an unusual 3D conformation of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) have remained
      elusive. Now researchers have identified novel functional partners of Xist in a
      series of breakthrough studies, using unbiased techniques to isolate Xist-bound
      proteins, as well as forward genetic screens. In addition, important insights
      into the 3D organization of Xi and its relation to gene expression have been
      obtained. In this Review, we discuss how this new information is providing a
      recipe for deciphering XCI mechanisms by which a multitasking RNA can
      structurally and functionally transform an active chromosome into uniquely
      organized facultative heterochromatin.

TI  - Open-ringed structure of the Cdt1-Mcm2-7 complex as a precursor of the MCM double
      hexamer.
PG  - 300-308
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3374 [doi]
AB  - The minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM) hexameric complex (Mcm2-7) forms the
      core of the eukaryotic replicative helicase. During G1 phase, two Cdt1-Mcm2-7
      heptamers are loaded onto each replication origin by the origin-recognition
      complex (ORC) and Cdc6 to form an inactive MCM double hexamer (DH), but the
      detailed loading mechanism remains unclear. Here we examine the structures of the
      yeast MCM hexamer and Cdt1-MCM heptamer from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both
      complexes form left-handed coil structures with a 10-15-A gap between Mcm5 and
      Mcm2, and a central channel that is occluded by the C-terminal domain
      winged-helix motif of Mcm5. Cdt1 wraps around the N-terminal regions of Mcm2,
      Mcm6 and Mcm4 to stabilize the whole complex. The intrinsic coiled structures of 
      the precursors provide insights into the DH formation, and suggest a
      spring-action model for the MCM during the initial origin melting and the
      subsequent DNA unwinding.

TI  - Structural basis of Mcm2-7 replicative helicase loading by ORC-Cdc6 and Cdt1.
PG  - 316-324
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3372 [doi]
AB  - To initiate DNA replication, the origin recognition complex (ORC) and Cdc6 load
      an Mcm2-7 double hexamer onto DNA. Without ATP hydrolysis, ORC-Cdc6 recruits one 
      Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer, thus forming an ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM)
      helicase-loading intermediate. Here we report a 3.9-A structure of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae OCCM on DNA. Flexible Mcm2-7 winged-helix domains (WHDs) engage
      ORC-Cdc6. A three-domain Cdt1 configuration embraces Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6, thus
      comprising nearly half of the hexamer. The Cdt1 C-terminal domain extends to the 
      Mcm6 WHD, which binds the Orc4 WHD. DNA passes through the ORC-Cdc6 and Mcm2-7
      rings. Origin DNA interaction is mediated by an alpha-helix within Orc4 and
      positively charged loops within Orc2 and Cdc6. The Mcm2-7 C-tier AAA+ ring is
      topologically closed by an Mcm5 loop that embraces Mcm2, but the N-tier-ring
      Mcm2-Mcm5 interface remains open. This structure suggests a loading mechanism of 
      the first Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer by ORC-Cdc6.

TI  - Mechanism and timing of Mcm2-7 ring closure during DNA replication origin
      licensing.
PG  - 309-315
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3375 [doi]
AB  - The opening and closing of two ring-shaped Mcm2-7 DNA helicases is necessary to
      license eukaryotic origins of replication, although the mechanisms controlling
      these events are unclear. The origin-recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1
      facilitate this process by establishing a topological link between each Mcm2-7
      hexamer and origin DNA. Using colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy and
      single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we monitored ring
      opening and closing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm2-7 during origin licensing.
      The two Mcm2-7 rings were open during initial DNA association and closed
      sequentially, concomitant with the release of their associated Cdt1. We observed 
      that ATP hydrolysis by Mcm2-7 was coupled to ring closure and Cdt1 release, and
      failure to load the first Mcm2-7 prevented recruitment of the second Mcm2-7. Our 
      findings identify key mechanisms controlling the Mcm2-7 DNA-entry gate during
      origin licensing, and reveal that the two Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded via a
      coordinated series of events with implications for bidirectional replication
      initiation and quality control.

TI  - RdRP-synthesized antisense ribosomal siRNAs silence pre-rRNA via the nuclear RNAi
      pathway.
PG  - 258-269
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3376 [doi]
AB  - Expression of rRNA affects cell growth and proliferation, but mechanisms that
      modulate rRNA levels are poorly understood. We conducted a genetic screen for
      factors that negatively regulate generation of endogenous short interfering RNA
      (endo-siRNA) in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified a suppressor of siRNA
      (susi-1) and antisense ribosomal siRNAs (risiRNAs). risiRNAs show sequence
      complementary to 18S and 26S rRNAs and require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
      (RdRPs) for their production. They act through the nuclear RNA interference
      (RNAi) pathway to downregulate pre-rRNA. Stress stimuli, including low
      temperature and UV irradiation, induced the accumulation of risiRNAs. SUSI-1 is a
      homolog of the human DIS3L2 exonuclease involved in 3'-5' degradation of
      oligouridylated RNAs. In susi-1 mutant and in low temperature-treated animals,
      3'-tail oligouridylated 26S rRNA accumulated. The injection of oligouridylated
      rRNA elicited nuclear accumulation of NRDE-3. Our findings identify a new subset 
      of 22G-RNAs that regulate pre-rRNA expression and a mechanism to maintain rRNA
      homeostasis.

TI  - STAT2 is an essential adaptor in USP18-mediated suppression of type I interferon 
      signaling.
PG  - 279-289
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3378 [doi]
AB  - Type I interferons (IFNs) are multifunctional cytokines that regulate immune
      responses and cellular functions but also can have detrimental effects on human
      health. A tight regulatory network therefore controls IFN signaling, which in
      turn may interfere with medical interventions. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway
      transmits the IFN extracellular signal to the nucleus, thus resulting in
      alterations in gene expression. STAT2 is a well-known essential and specific
      positive effector of type I IFN signaling. Here, we report that STAT2 is also a
      previously unrecognized, crucial component of the USP18-mediated
      negative-feedback control in both human and mouse cells. We found that STAT2
      recruits USP18 to the type I IFN receptor subunit IFNAR2 via its constitutive
      membrane-distal STAT2-binding site. This mechanistic coupling of effector and
      negative-feedback functions of STAT2 may provide novel strategies for treatment
      of IFN-signaling-related human diseases.

TI  - Structural basis of the specificity of USP18 toward ISG15.
PG  - 270-278
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3371 [doi]
AB  - Protein modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) is
      counteracted by ubiquitin proteases and Ubl proteases, collectively termed DUBs. 
      In contrast to other proteases of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family,
      USP18 shows no reactivity toward ubiquitin but specifically deconjugates the
      interferon-induced Ubl ISG15. To identify the molecular determinants of this
      specificity, we solved the crystal structures of mouse USP18 alone and in complex
      with mouse ISG15. USP18 was crystallized in an open and a closed conformation,
      thus revealing high flexibility of the enzyme. Structural data, biochemical and
      mutational analysis showed that only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of
      ISG15 is recognized and essential for USP18 activity. A critical hydrophobic
      patch in USP18 interacts with a hydrophobic region unique to ISG15, thus
      providing evidence that USP18's ISG15 specificity is mediated by a small
      interaction interface. Our results may provide a structural basis for the
      development of new drugs modulating ISG15 linkage.

TI  - Eukaryotic Rad50 functions as a rod-shaped dimer.
PG  - 248-257
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3369 [doi]
AB  - The Rad50 hook interface is crucial for assembly and various functions of the
      Mre11 complex. Previous analyses suggested that Rad50 molecules interact within
      (intracomplex) or between (intercomplex) dimeric complexes. In this study, we
      determined the structure of the human Rad50 hook and coiled-coil domains. The
      data suggest that the predominant structure is the intracomplex, in which the two
      parallel coiled coils proximal to the hook form a rod shape, and that a novel
      interface within the coiled-coil domains of Rad50 stabilizes the interaction of
      Rad50 protomers in the dimeric assembly. In yeast, removal of the coiled-coil
      interface compromised Tel1 activation without affecting DNA repair, while
      simultaneous disruption of that interface and the hook phenocopied a null
      mutation. The results demonstrate that the hook and coiled-coil interfaces
      coordinately promote intracomplex assembly and define the intracomplex as the
      functional form of the Mre11 complex.

AB  - Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are ubiquitous transposable elements
      in higher eukaryotes that have a significant role in shaping genomes, owing to
      their abundance. Here we report that guanine-rich sequences in the 3'
      untranslated regions (UTRs) of hominoid-specific LINE-1 elements are coupled with
      retrotransposon speciation and contribute to retrotransposition through the
      formation of G-quadruplex (G4) structures. We demonstrate that stabilization of
      the G4 motif of a human-specific LINE-1 element by small-molecule ligands
      stimulates retrotransposition.

TI  - Xist-dependent imprinted X inactivation and the early developmental consequences 
      of its failure.
PG  - 226-233
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3365 [doi]
AB  - The long noncoding RNA Xist is expressed from only the paternal X chromosome in
      mouse preimplantation female embryos and mediates transcriptional silencing of
      that chromosome. In females, absence of Xist leads to postimplantation lethality.
      Here, through single-cell RNA sequencing of early preimplantation mouse embryos, 
      we found that the initiation of imprinted X-chromosome inactivation absolutely
      requires Xist. Lack of paternal Xist leads to genome-wide transcriptional
      misregulation in the early blastocyst and to failure to activate the
      extraembryonic pathway that is essential for postimplantation development. We
      also demonstrate that the expression dynamics of X-linked genes depends on the
      strain and parent of origin as well as on the location along the X chromosome,
      particularly at the first 'entry' sites of Xist. This study demonstrates that
      dosage-compensation failure has an effect as early as the blastocyst stage and
      reveals genetic and epigenetic contributions to orchestrating transcriptional
      silencing of the X chromosome during early embryogenesis.

TI  - The evolutionary capacitor HSP90 buffers the regulatory effects of mammalian
      endogenous retroviruses.
PG  - 234-242
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3368 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how genotypes are linked to phenotypes is important in biomedical
      and evolutionary studies. The chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) buffers
      genetic variation by stabilizing proteins with variant sequences, thereby
      uncoupling phenotypes from genotypes. Here we report an unexpected role of HSP90 
      in buffering cis-regulatory variation affecting gene expression. By using the
      tripartite-motif-containing 28 (TRIM28; also known as KAP1)-mediated epigenetic
      pathway, HSP90 represses the regulatory influence of endogenous retroviruses
      (ERVs) on neighboring genes that are critical for mouse development. Our data
      based on natural variations in the mouse genome show that genes respond to HSP90 
      inhibition in a manner dependent on their genomic location with regard to
      strain-specific ERV-insertion sites. The evolutionary-capacitor function of HSP90
      may thus have facilitated the exaptation of ERVs as key modifiers of gene
      expression and morphological diversification. Our findings add a new regulatory
      layer through which HSP90 uncouples phenotypic outcomes from individual
      genotypes.

AB  - Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) are post-translational modifications
      (PTMs) that regulate nuclear cellular processes. Here we used an augmented
      K0-SUMO proteomics strategy to identify 40,765 SUMO acceptor sites and quantify
      their fractional contribution for 6,747 human proteins. Structural-predictive
      analyses revealed that lysines residing in disordered regions are preferentially 
      targeted by SUMO, in notable contrast to other widespread lysine modifications.
      In our data set, we identified 807 SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified by
      phosphorylation, along with dozens of SUMOylated peptides that were co-modified
      by ubiquitylation, acetylation and methylation. Notably, 9% of the identified
      SUMOylome occurred proximal to phosphorylation, and numerous SUMOylation sites
      were found to be fully dependent on prior phosphorylation events. SUMO-proximal
      phosphorylation occurred primarily in a proline-directed manner, and inhibition
      of cyclin-dependent kinases dynamically affected co-modification. Collectively,
      we present a comprehensive analysis of the SUMOylated proteome, uncovering the
      structural preferences for SUMO and providing system-wide evidence for a
      remarkable degree of cross-talk between SUMOylation and other major PTMs.

PG  - 214-220
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3364 [doi]
AB  - A key step in ribosome biogenesis is the nuclear export of pre-ribosomal
      particles. Nmd3, a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes, is a specific adaptor 
      required for the export of pre-60S particles. Here we used cryo-electron
      microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-60S particles
      purified with epitope-tagged Nmd3. Our structural analysis indicates that these
      particles belong to a specific late stage of cytoplasmic pre-60S maturation in
      which ribosomal proteins uL16, uL10, uL11, eL40 and eL41 are deficient, but
      ribosome assembly factors Nmd3, Lsg1, Tif6 and Reh1 are present. Nmd3 and Lsg1
      are located near the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). In particular, Nmd3
      recognizes the PTC in its near-mature conformation. In contrast, Reh1 is anchored
      to the exit of the polypeptide tunnel, with its C terminus inserted into the
      tunnel. These findings pinpoint a structural checkpoint role for Nmd3 in PTC
      assembly, and provide information about functional and mechanistic roles of these
      assembly factors in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit.

TI  - The gastrula transition reorganizes replication-origin selection in
      Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 290-299
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3363 [doi]
AB  - Although some features underlying replication-origin activation in metazoan cells
      have been determined, little is known about their regulation during metazoan
      development. Using the nascent-strand purification method, here we identified
      replication origins throughout Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic development and
      found that the origin repertoire is thoroughly reorganized after gastrulation
      onset. During the pluripotent embryonic stages (pregastrula), potential cruciform
      structures and open chromatin are determining factors that establish replication 
      origins. The observed enrichment of replication origins in transcription
      factor-binding sites and their presence in promoters of highly transcribed genes,
      particularly operons, suggest that transcriptional activity contributes to
      replication initiation before gastrulation. After the gastrula transition, when
      embryonic differentiation programs are set, new origins are selected at
      enhancers, close to CpG-island-like sequences, and at noncoding genes. Our
      findings suggest that origin selection coordinates replication initiation with
      transcriptional programs during metazoan development.

TI  - Cotranslational folding of spectrin domains via partially structured states.
PG  - 221-225
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3355 [doi]
AB  - How do the key features of protein folding, elucidated from studies on native,
      isolated proteins, manifest in cotranslational folding on the ribosome? Using a
      well-characterized family of homologous alpha-helical proteins with a range of
      biophysical properties, we show that spectrin domains can fold vectorially on the
      ribosome and may do so via a pathway different from that of the isolated domain. 
      We use cryo-EM to reveal a folded or partially folded structure, formed in the
      vestibule of the ribosome. Our results reveal that it is not possible to predict 
      which domains will fold within the ribosome on the basis of the folding behavior 
      of isolated domains; instead, we propose that a complex balance of the rate of
      folding, the rate of translation and the lifetime of folded or partly folded
      states will determine whether folding occurs cotranslationally on actively
      translating ribosomes.

      channel.
PG  - 205-213
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3362 [doi]
AB  - The activities of organellar ion channels are often regulated by Ca(2+) and H(+),
      which are present in high concentrations in many organelles. Here we report a
      structural element critical for dual Ca(2+)/pH regulation of TRPML1, a
      Ca(2+)-release channel crucial for endolysosomal function. TRPML1 mutations cause
      mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a severe lysosomal storage disorder characterized
      by neurodegeneration, mental retardation and blindness. We obtained crystal
      structures of the 213-residue luminal domain of human TRPML1 containing three
      missense MLIV-causing mutations. This domain forms a tetramer with a highly
      electronegative central pore formed by a novel luminal pore loop. Cysteine
      cross-linking and cryo-EM analyses confirmed that this architecture occurs in the
      full-length channel. Structure-function studies demonstrated that Ca(2+) and H(+)
      interact with the luminal pore and exert physiologically important regulation.
      The MLIV-causing mutations disrupt the luminal-domain structure and cause TRPML1 
      mislocalization. Our study reveals the structural underpinnings of TRPML1's
      regulation, assembly and pathogenesis.

TI  - Molecular insights into lipid-assisted Ca(2+) regulation of the TRP channel
      Polycystin-2.
PG  - 123-130
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3357 [doi]
AB  - Polycystin-2 (PC2), a calcium-activated cation TRP channel, is involved in
      diverse Ca(2+) signaling pathways. Malfunctioning Ca(2+) regulation in PC2 causes
      autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease. Here we report two cryo-EM
      structures of distinct channel states of full-length human PC2 in complex with
      lipids and cations. The structures reveal conformational differences in the
      selectivity filter and in the large exoplasmic domain (TOP domain), which
      displays differing N-glycosylation. The more open structure has one cation bound 
      below the selectivity filter (single-ion mode, PC2SI), whereas multiple cations
      are bound along the translocation pathway in the second structure (multi-ion
      mode, PC2MI). Ca(2+) binding at the entrance of the selectivity filter suggests
      Ca(2+) blockage in PC2MI, and we observed density for the Ca(2+)-sensing
      C-terminal EF hand in the unblocked PC2SI state. The states show altered
      interactions of lipids with the pore loop and TOP domain, thus reflecting the
      functional diversity of PC2 at different locations, owing to different membrane
      compositions.

TI  - Molecular architecture and dynamics of ASH1 mRNA recognition by its
      mRNA-transport complex.
PG  - 152-161
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3351 [doi]
AB  - mRNA localization is an essential mechanism of gene regulation and is required
      for processes such as stem-cell division, embryogenesis and neuronal plasticity. 
      It is not known which features in the cis-acting mRNA localization elements (LEs)
      are specifically recognized by motor-containing transport complexes. To the best 
      of our knowledge, no high-resolution structure is available for any LE in complex
      with its cognate protein complex. Using X-ray crystallography and complementary
      techniques, we carried out a detailed assessment of an LE of the ASH1 mRNA from
      yeast, its complex with its shuttling RNA-binding protein She2p, and its highly
      specific, cytoplasmic complex with She3p. Although the RNA alone formed a
      flexible stem loop, She2p binding induced marked conformational changes. However,
      only joining by the unstructured She3p resulted in specific RNA recognition. The 
      notable RNA rearrangements and joint action of a globular and an unfolded
      RNA-binding protein offer unprecedented insights into the step-wise maturation of
      an mRNA-transport complex.

PG  - 177-183
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3350 [doi]
AB  - The secretin GspD of the type II secretion system (T2SS) forms a channel across
      the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria to transport substrates from the
      periplasm to the extracellular milieu. The lack of an atomic-resolution structure
      of the GspD channel hinders the investigation of substrate translocation
      mechanism of T2SS. Here we report cryo-EM structures of two GspD channels (
      approximately 1 MDa), from Escherichia coli K12 and Vibrio cholerae, at
      approximately 3 A resolution. The structures reveal a pentadecameric channel
      architecture, wherein three rings of GspD N domains form the periplasmic channel.
      The secretin domain constitutes a novel double beta-barrel channel, with at least
      60 beta-strands in each barrel, and is stabilized by S domains. The outer
      membrane channel is sealed by beta-strand-enriched gates. On the basis of the
      partially open state captured, we proposed a detailed gate-opening mechanism. Our
      structures provide a structural basis for understanding the secretin superfamily 
      and the mechanism of substrate translocation in T2SS.

AB  - Cotranslational chaperones assist de novo folding of nascent polypeptides,
      prevent them from aggregating and modulate translation. The ribosome-associated
      complex (RAC) is unique in that the Hsp40 protein Zuo1 and the atypical Hsp70
      chaperone Ssz1 form a stable heterodimer, which acts as a cochaperone for the
      Hsp70 chaperone Ssb. Here we present the structure of the Chaetomium thermophilum
      RAC core comprising Ssz1 and the Zuo1 N terminus. We show how the conserved
      allostery of Hsp70 proteins is abolished and this Hsp70-Hsp40 pair is molded into
      a functional unit. Zuo1 stabilizes Ssz1 in trans through interactions that in
      canonical Hsp70s occur in cis. Ssz1 is catalytically inert and cannot adopt the
      closed conformation, but the substrate binding domain beta is completed by Zuo1. 
      Our study offers insights into the coupling of a special Hsp70-Hsp40 pair, which 
      evolved to link protein folding and translation.

TI  - Self-correcting mismatches during high-fidelity DNA replication.
PG  - 140-143
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3348 [doi]
AB  - Faithful DNA replication is essential to all forms of life and depends on the
      action of 3'-5' exonucleases that remove misincorporated nucleotides from the
      newly synthesized strand. However, how the DNA is transferred from the polymerase
      to the exonuclease active site is not known. Here we present the cryo-EM
      structure of the editing mode of the catalytic core of the Escherichia coli
      replisome, revealing a dramatic distortion of the DNA whereby the polymerase
      thumb domain acts as a wedge that separates the two DNA strands. Importantly, NMR
      analysis of the DNA substrate shows that the presence of a mismatch increases the
      fraying of the DNA, thus enabling it to reach the exonuclease active site.
      Therefore the mismatch corrects itself, whereas the exonuclease subunit plays a
      passive role. Hence, our work provides unique insights into high-fidelity
      replication and establishes a new paradigm for the correction of misincorporated 
      nucleotides.

TI  - Histone degradation in response to DNA damage enhances chromatin dynamics and
      recombination rates.
PG  - 99-107
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3347 [doi]
AB  - Nucleosomes are essential for proper chromatin organization and the maintenance
      of genome integrity. Histones are post-translationally modified and often evicted
      at sites of DNA breaks, facilitating the recruitment of repair factors. Whether
      such chromatin changes are localized or genome-wide is debated. Here we show that
      cellular levels of histones drop 20-40% in response to DNA damage. This histone
      loss occurs from chromatin, is proteasome-mediated and requires both the DNA
      damage checkpoint and the INO80 nucleosome remodeler. We confirmed reductions in 
      histone levels by stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture
      (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry, genome-wide nucleosome mapping and fluorescence 
      microscopy. Chromatin decompaction and increased fiber flexibility accompanied
      histone degradation, both in response to DNA damage and after artificial
      reduction of histone levels. As a result, recombination rates and DNA-repair
      focus turnover were enhanced. Thus, we propose that a generalized reduction in
      nucleosome occupancy is an integral part of the DNA damage response in yeast that
      provides mechanisms for enhanced chromatin mobility and homology search.

TI  - Structure of the immature Zika virus at 9 A resolution.
PG  - 184-186
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3352 [doi]
AB  - The current Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is characterized by severe pathogenicity
      in both children and adults. Sequence changes in ZIKV since its first isolation
      are apparent when pre-epidemic strains are compared with those causing the
      current epidemic. However, the residues that are responsible for ZIKV
      pathogenicity are largely unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy
      (cryo-EM) structure of the immature ZIKV at 9-A resolution. The cryo-EM map was
      fitted with the crystal structures of the precursor membrane and envelope
      glycoproteins and was shown to be similar to the structures of other known
      immature flaviviruses. However, the immature ZIKV contains a partially ordered
      capsid protein shell that is less prominent in other immature flaviviruses.
      Furthermore, six amino acids near the interface between pr domains at the top of 
      the spikes were found to be different between the pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV,
      possibly influencing the composition and structure of the resulting viruses.

TI  - Crystal structure of the MOP flippase MurJ in an inward-facing conformation.
PG  - 171-176
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3346 [doi]
AB  - Peptidoglycan (PG) protects bacteria from osmotic lysis, and its biogenesis is a 
      key antibiotic target. A central step in PG biosynthesis is flipping of the
      lipid-linked PG precursor lipid II across the cytoplasmic membrane for subsequent
      incorporation into PG. MurJ, part of the
      multidrug/oligosaccharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide (MOP) transporter superfamily,
      was recently shown to carry out this process. However, understanding of how MurJ 
      flips lipid II, and of how MOP transporters operate in general, remains limited
      due to a lack of structural information. Here we present a crystal structure of
      MurJ from Thermosipho africanus in an inward-facing conformation at 2.0-A
      resolution. A hydrophobic groove is formed by two C-terminal transmembrane
      helices, which leads into a large central cavity that is mostly cationic. Our
      studies not only provide the first structural glimpse of MurJ but also suggest
      that alternating access is important for MurJ function, which may be applicable
      to other MOP superfamily transporters.

AB  - High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are cholesterol and lipid transport
      containers. Mature HDL particles destined for the liver develop through the
      formation of intermediate discoidal HDL particles, which are the primary
      acceptors for cholesterol. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of
      reconstituted discoidal HDL (rdHDL) particles, using a shortened construct of
      human apolipoprotein A-I, determined from a combination of nuclear magnetic
      resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM) data. The rdHDL particles feature a protein double belt
      surrounding a lipid bilayer patch in an antiparallel fashion. The integrity of
      this structure is maintained by up to 28 salt bridges and a zipper-like pattern
      of cation-pi interactions between helices 4 and 6. To accommodate a hydrophobic
      interior, a gross 'right-to-right' rotation of the helices after lipidation is
      necessary. The structure reflects the complexity required for a shuttling
      container to hold a fluid lipid or cholesterol interior at a protein:lipid ratio 
      of 1:50.

TI  - Structure of the polycystic kidney disease TRP channel Polycystin-2 (PC2).
PG  - 114-122
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3343 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in either polycystin-1 (PC1 or PKD1) or polycystin-2 (PC2, PKD2 or
      TRPP1) cause autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) through unknown
      mechanisms. Here we present the structure of human PC2 in a closed conformation, 
      solved by electron cryomicroscopy at 4.2-A resolution. The structure reveals a
      novel polycystin-specific 'tetragonal opening for polycystins' (TOP) domain
      tightly bound to the top of a classic transient receptor potential (TRP) channel 
      structure. The TOP domain is formed from two extensions to the
      voltage-sensor-like domain (VSLD); it covers the channel's endoplasmic reticulum 
      lumen or extracellular surface and encloses an upper vestibule, above the pore
      filter, without blocking the ion-conduction pathway. The TOP-domain fold is
      conserved among the polycystins, including the homologous channel-like region of 
      PC1, and is the site of a cluster of ADPKD-associated missense variants.
      Extensive contacts among the TOP-domain subunits, the pore and the VSLD provide
      ample scope for regulation through physical and chemical stimuli.

TI  - Pif1-family helicases cooperatively suppress widespread replication-fork arrest
      at tRNA genes.
PG  - 162-170
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3342 [doi]
AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two Pif1-family helicases-Pif1 and Rrm3-which 
      have been reported to play distinct roles in numerous nuclear processes. Here, we
      systematically characterized the roles of Pif1 helicases in replisome progression
      and lagging-strand synthesis in S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that either Pif1 or
      Rrm3 redundantly stimulates strand displacement by DNA polymerase delta during
      lagging-strand synthesis. By analyzing replisome mobility in pif1 and rrm3
      mutants, we show that Rrm3, with a partially redundant contribution from Pif1,
      suppresses widespread terminal arrest of the replisome at tRNA genes. Although
      both head-on and codirectional collisions induce replication-fork arrest at tRNA 
      genes, head-on collisions arrest a higher proportion of replisomes. In agreement 
      with this observation, we found that head-on collisions between tRNA
      transcription and replication are under-represented in the S. cerevisiae genome. 
      We demonstrate that tRNA-mediated arrest is R-loop independent and propose that
      replisome arrest and DNA damage are mechanistically separable.

      APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B.
PG  - 131-139
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3344 [doi]
AB  - APOBEC-catalyzed cytosine-to-uracil deamination of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
      has beneficial functions in immunity and detrimental effects in cancer. APOBEC
      enzymes have intrinsic dinucleotide specificities that impart hallmark mutation
      signatures. Although numerous structures have been solved, mechanisms for global 
      ssDNA recognition and local target-sequence selection remain unclear. Here we
      report crystal structures of human APOBEC3A and a chimera of human APOBEC3B and
      APOBEC3A bound to ssDNA at 3.1-A and 1.7-A resolution, respectively. These
      structures reveal a U-shaped DNA conformation, with the specificity-conferring -1
      thymine flipped out and the target cytosine inserted deep into the
      zinc-coordinating active site pocket. The -1 thymine base fits into a groove
      between flexible loops and makes direct hydrogen bonds with the protein,
      accounting for the strong 5'-TC preference. These findings explain both conserved
      and unique properties among APOBEC family members, and they provide a basis for
      the rational design of inhibitors to impede the evolvability of viruses and
      tumors.

AB  - Current therapies to treat persistent pain and neuropathic pain are limited by
      poor efficacy, side effects and risk of addiction. Here, we present a novel class
      of potent selective, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant potentiators of
      glycine receptors (GlyRs), ligand-gated ion channels expressed in the CNS.
      AM-1488 increased the response to exogenous glycine in mouse spinal cord and
      significantly reversed mechanical allodynia induced by nerve injury in a mouse
      model of neuropathic pain. We obtained an X-ray crystal structure of human
      homopentameric GlyRalpha3 in complex with AM-3607, a potentiator of the same
      class with increased potency, and the agonist glycine, at 2.6-A resolution.
      AM-3607 binds a novel allosteric site between subunits, which is adjacent to the 
      orthosteric site where glycine binds. Our results provide new insights into the
      potentiation of cysteine-loop receptors by positive allosteric modulators and
      hold promise in structure-based design of GlyR modulators for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain.

TI  - Cryo-EM structures of human RAD51 recombinase filaments during catalysis of
      DNA-strand exchange.
PG  - 40-46
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3336 [doi]
AB  - The central step in eukaryotic homologous recombination (HR) is ATP-dependent
      DNA-strand exchange mediated by the Rad51 recombinase. In this process, Rad51
      assembles on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and generates a helical filament that is
      able to search for and invade homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), thus
      leading to strand separation and formation of new base pairs between the
      initiating ssDNA and the complementary strand within the duplex. Here, we used
      cryo-EM to solve the structures of human RAD51 in complex with DNA molecules, in 
      presynaptic and postsynaptic states, at near-atomic resolution. Our structures
      reveal both conserved and distinct structural features of the human RAD51-DNA
      complexes compared with their prokaryotic counterpart. Notably, we also captured 
      the structure of an arrested synaptic complex. Our results provide new insight
      into the molecular mechanisms of the DNA homology search and strand-exchange
      processes.

TI  - Warfarin and vitamin K compete for binding to Phe55 in human VKOR.
PG  - 77-85
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3338 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) catalyzes the reduction of vitamin K quinone
      and vitamin K 2,3-epoxide, a process essential to sustain gamma-carboxylation of 
      vitamin K-dependent proteins. VKOR is also a therapeutic target of warfarin, a
      treatment for thrombotic disorders. However, the structural and functional basis 
      of vitamin K reduction and the antagonism of warfarin inhibition remain elusive. 
      Here, we identified putative binding sites of both K vitamers and warfarin on
      human VKOR. The predicted warfarin-binding site was verified by shifted
      dose-response curves of specified mutated residues. We used
      CRISPR-Cas9-engineered HEK 293T cells to assess the vitamin K quinone and vitamin
      K 2,3-epoxide reductase activities of VKOR variants to characterize the vitamin K
      naphthoquinone head- and isoprenoid side chain-binding regions. Our results
      challenge the prevailing concept of noncompetitive warfarin inhibition because K 
      vitamers and warfarin share binding sites on VKOR that include Phe55, a key
      residue binding either the substrate or inhibitor.

      electron transfer.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3333 [doi]
AB  - Although warfarin is the most widely used anticoagulant worldwide, the mechanism 
      by which warfarin inhibits its target, human vitamin K epoxide reductase (hVKOR),
      remains unclear. Here we show that warfarin blocks a dynamic electron-transfer
      process in hVKOR. A major fraction of cellular hVKOR is in an intermediate redox 
      state containing a Cys51-Cys132 disulfide, a characteristic accommodated by a
      four-transmembrane-helix structure of hVKOR. Warfarin selectively inhibits this
      major cellular form of hVKOR, whereas disruption of the Cys51-Cys132 disulfide
      impairs warfarin binding and causes warfarin resistance. Relying on binding
      interactions identified by cysteine alkylation footprinting and mass spectrometry
      coupled with mutagenesis analysis, we conducted structure simulations, which
      revealed a closed warfarin-binding pocket stabilized by the Cys51-Cys132 linkage.
      Understanding the selective warfarin inhibition of a specific redox state of
      hVKOR should enable the rational design of drugs that exploit the redox chemistry
      and associated conformational changes in hVKOR.

TI  - A balance between elongation and trimming regulates telomere stability in stem
      cells.
PG  - 30-39
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3335 [doi]
AB  - Telomere length maintenance ensures self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells
      (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); however, the mechanisms
      governing telomere length homeostasis in these cell types are unclear. Here, we
      report that telomere length is determined by the balance between telomere
      elongation, which is mediated by telomerase, and telomere trimming, which is
      controlled by XRCC3 and Nbs1, homologous recombination proteins that generate
      single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA and double-stranded telomeric circular DNA
      (T-circles), respectively. We found that reprogramming of differentiated cells
      induces T-circle and single-stranded C-rich telomeric DNA accumulation,
      indicating the activation of telomere trimming pathways that compensate
      telomerase-dependent telomere elongation in hiPSCs. Excessive telomere elongation
      compromises telomere stability and promotes the formation of partially
      single-stranded telomeric DNA circles (C-circles) in hESCs, suggesting heightened
      sensitivity of stem cells to replication stress at overly long telomeres. Thus,
      tight control of telomere length homeostasis is essential to maintain telomere
      stability in hESCs.

TI  - FICD acts bifunctionally to AMPylate and de-AMPylate the endoplasmic reticulum
      chaperone BiP.
PG  - 23-29
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3337 [doi]
AB  - Protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is defended by an
      unfolded protein response that matches ER chaperone capacity to the burden of
      unfolded proteins. As levels of unfolded proteins decline, a metazoan-specific
      FIC-domain-containing ER-localized enzyme (FICD) rapidly inactivates the major ER
      chaperone BiP by AMPylating T518. Here we show that the single catalytic domain
      of FICD can also release the attached AMP, restoring functionality to BiP.
      Consistent with a role for endogenous FICD in de-AMPylating BiP, FICD(-/-)
      hamster cells are hypersensitive to introduction of a constitutively AMPylating, 
      de-AMPylation-defective mutant FICD. These opposing activities hinge on a
      regulatory residue, E234, whose default state renders FICD a constitutive
      de-AMPylase in vitro. The location of E234 on a conserved regulatory helix and
      the mutually antagonistic activities of FICD in vivo, suggest a mechanism whereby
      fluctuating unfolded protein load actively switches FICD from a de-AMPylase to an
      AMPylase.

      repeats.
PG  - 55-60
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3334 [doi]
AB  - Expansions of (CAG)n/(CTG)n trinucleotide repeats are responsible for over a
      dozen neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders. Large-scale expansions are
      commonly observed in human pedigrees and may be explained by iterative
      small-scale events such as strand slippage during replication or repair DNA
      synthesis. Alternatively, a distinct mechanism may lead to a large-scale repeat
      expansion as a single step. To distinguish between these possibilities, we
      developed a novel experimental system specifically tuned to analyze large-scale
      expansions of (CAG)n/(CTG)n repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The median size 
      of repeat expansions was approximately 60 triplets, although we also observed
      additions of more than 150 triplets. Genetic analysis revealed that Rad51, Rad52,
      Mre11, Pol32, Pif1, and Mus81 and/or Yen1 proteins are required for large-scale
      expansions, whereas proteins previously implicated in small-scale expansions are 
      not involved. From these results, we propose a new model for large-scale
      expansions, which is based on the recovery of replication forks broken at
      (CAG)n/(CTG)n repeats via break-induced replication.

TI  - Reciprocal regulation of carbon monoxide metabolism and the circadian clock.
PG  - 15-22
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3331 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clocks are cell-autonomous oscillators regulating daily rhythms in a
      wide range of physiological, metabolic and behavioral processes. Feedback of
      metabolic signals, such as redox state, NAD(+)/NADH and AMP/ADP ratios, or heme, 
      modulate circadian rhythms and thereby optimize energy utilization across the
      24-h cycle. We show that rhythmic heme degradation, which generates the signaling
      molecule carbon monoxide (CO), is required for normal circadian rhythms as well
      as circadian metabolic outputs. CO suppresses circadian transcription by
      attenuating CLOCK-BMAL1 binding to target promoters. Pharmacological inhibition
      or genetic depletion of CO-producing heme oxygenases abrogates normal daily
      cycles in mammalian cells and Drosophila. In mouse hepatocytes, suppression of CO
      production leads to a global upregulation of CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent circadian gene
      expression and dysregulated glucose metabolism. Together, our findings show that 
      CO metabolism is an important link between the basic circadian-clock machinery,
      metabolism and behavior.

AB  - The ribosome can change its reading frame during translation in a process known
      as programmed ribosomal frameshifting. These rare events are supported by complex
      mRNA signals. However, we found that the ciliates Euplotes crassus and Euplotes
      focardii exhibit widespread frameshifting at stop codons. 47 different codons
      preceding stop signals resulted in either +1 or +2 frameshifts, and +1
      frameshifting at AAA was the most frequent. The frameshifts showed unusual
      plasticity and rapid evolution, and had little influence on translation rates.
      The proximity of a stop codon to the 3' mRNA end, rather than its occurrence or
      sequence context, appeared to designate termination. Thus, a 'stop codon' is not 
      a sufficient signal for translation termination, and the default function of stop
      codons in Euplotes is frameshifting, whereas termination is specific to certain
      mRNA positions and probably requires additional factors.

      metabolism profiles.
PG  - 86-96
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3325 [doi]
AB  - Pervasive transcription of the human genome results in a heterogeneous mix of
      coding RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Only a small fraction of lncRNAs
      have demonstrated regulatory functions, thus making functional lncRNAs difficult 
      to distinguish from nonfunctional transcriptional byproducts. This difficulty has
      resulted in numerous competing human lncRNA classifications that are complicated 
      by a steady increase in the number of annotated lncRNAs. To address these
      challenges, we quantitatively examined transcription, splicing, degradation,
      localization and translation for coding and noncoding human genes. We observed
      that annotated lncRNAs had lower synthesis and higher degradation rates than
      mRNAs and discovered mechanistic differences explaining slower lncRNA splicing.
      We grouped genes into classes with similar RNA metabolism profiles, containing
      both mRNAs and lncRNAs to varying extents. These classes exhibited distinct RNA
      metabolism, different evolutionary patterns and differential sensitivity to
      cellular RNA-regulatory pathways. Our classification provides an alternative to
      genomic context-driven annotations of lncRNAs.

TI  - Position effects influence HIV latency reversal.
PG  - 47-54
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3328 [doi]
AB  - The main obstacle to curing HIV is the presence of latent proviruses in the
      bodies of infected patients. The partial success of reactivation therapies
      suggests that the genomic context of integrated proviruses can interfere with
      treatment. Here we developed a method called Barcoded HIV ensembles (B-HIVE) to
      map the chromosomal locations of thousands of individual proviruses while
      tracking their transcriptional activities in an infected cell population. B-HIVE 
      revealed that, in Jurkat cells, the expression of HIV is strongest close to
      endogenous enhancers. The insertion site also affects the response to
      latency-reversing agents, because we found that phytohemagglutinin and vorinostat
      reactivated proviruses inserted at distinct genomic locations. From these
      results, we propose that combinations of drugs targeting all areas of the genome 
      will be most effective. Overall, our data suggest that the insertion context of
      HIV is a critical determinant of the viral response to reactivation therapies.

AB  - Oscillations in time and space are ubiquitous in nature and play critical roles
      in dynamic cellular processes. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      generation of the dynamics are diverse, several distinct regulatory elements have
      been recognized as being critical in producing and modulating oscillatory
      dynamics. These include negative and positive feedback, time delay, nonlinearity 
      in regulation, and random fluctuations ('noise'). Here we discuss the specific
      roles of these five elements in promoting or attenuating oscillatory dynamics, by
      drawing on insights from quantitative analyses of natural or synthetic biological
      networks.

AB  - Endogenous biological rhythms with approximately 24-h periodicity are generated
      by the circadian clock, in which clock genes coordinate with one another and form
      a transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop. The precision of the
      circadian clock is further regulated by multiple post-translational modifications
      (PTMs), including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and SUMOylation.
      Here, we review current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the core
      clock proteins by PTMs in the mammalian circadian clock.

AB  - The mammalian molecular clock comprises a complex network of transcriptional
      programs that integrates environmental signals with physiological pathways in a
      tissue-specific manner. Emerging technologies are extending knowledge of basic
      clock features by uncovering their underlying molecular mechanisms, thus setting 
      the stage for a 'systems' view of the molecular clock. Here we discuss how recent
      data from genome-wide genetic and epigenetic studies have informed the
      understanding of clock function. In addition to its importance in human
      physiology and disease, the clock mechanism provides an ideal model to assess
      general principles of dynamic transcription regulation in vivo.

      rhythms.
PG  - 1035-1044
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3311 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic cycles result from the partitioning of oxidative and reductive
      metabolism into rhythmic phases of gene expression and oscillating
      post-translational protein modifications. Relatively little is known about how
      these switches in gene expression are controlled, although recent studies have
      suggested that transcription itself may play a central role. This review explores
      the molecular basis of the metabolic and gene-expression oscillations in the
      yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as how they relate to other biological
      time-keeping mechanisms, such as circadian rhythms.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms at the core of the plant circadian oscillator.
PG  - 1061-1069

AB  - Circadian clocks are endogenous timekeeping networks that allow organisms to
      align their physiology with their changing environment and to perform biological 
      processes at the most relevant times of the day and year. Initial feedback-loop
      models of the oscillator have been enriched by emerging evidence highlighting the
      increasing variety of factors and mechanisms that contribute to the generation of
      rhythms. In this Review, we consider the two major input pathways that connect
      the circadian clock of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to its environment
      and discuss recent advances in understanding of how transcriptional,
      post-translational and post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to clock
      function.

TI  - Oxidative guanine base damage regulates human telomerase activity.
PG  - 1092-1100
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3319 [doi]
AB  - Changes in telomere length are associated with degenerative diseases and cancer. 
      Oxidative stress and DNA damage have been linked to both positive and negative
      alterations in telomere length and integrity. Here we examined how the common
      oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanine (8-oxoG) regulates telomere
      elongation by human telomerase. When 8-oxoG is present in the dNTP pool as
      8-oxodGTP, telomerase utilization of the oxidized nucleotide during telomere
      extension is mutagenic and terminates further elongation. Depletion of MTH1, the 
      enzyme that removes oxidized dNTPs, increases telomere dysfunction and cell death
      in telomerase-positive cancer cells with shortened telomeres. In contrast, a
      preexisting 8-oxoG within the telomeric DNA sequence promotes telomerase activity
      by destabilizing the G-quadruplex DNA structure. We show that the mechanism by
      which 8-oxoG arises in telomeres, either by insertion of oxidized nucleotides or 
      by direct reaction with free radicals, dictates whether telomerase is inhibited
      or stimulated and thereby mediates the biological outcome.

TI  - The ribosome-engaged landscape of alternative splicing.
PG  - 1117-1123
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3317 [doi]
AB  - High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed an enormous complexity of
      alternative splicing (AS) across diverse cell and tissue types. However, it is
      currently unknown to what extent repertoires of splice-variant transcripts are
      translated into protein products. Here, we surveyed AS events engaged by the
      ribosome. Notably, at least 75% of human exon-skipping events detected in
      transcripts with medium-to-high abundance in RNA-seq data were also detected in
      ribosome profiling data. Furthermore, relatively small subsets of functionally
      related splice variants are engaged by ribosomes at levels that do not reflect
      their absolute abundance, thus indicating a role for AS in modulating
      translational output. This mode of regulation is associated with control of the
      mammalian cell cycle. Our results thus suggest that a major fraction of splice
      variants is translated and that specific cellular functions including cell-cycle 
      control are subject to AS-dependent modulation of translation output.

TI  - Large-scale ATP-independent nucleosome unfolding by a histone chaperone.
PG  - 1111-1116
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3321 [doi]
AB  - DNA accessibility to regulatory proteins is substantially influenced by
      nucleosome structure and dynamics. The facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT)
      complex increases the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, but the mechanism and
      extent of its nucleosome reorganization activity are unknown. Here we determined 
      the effects of FACT from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on single nucleosomes
      by using single-particle Forster resonance energy transfer (spFRET) microscopy.
      FACT binding results in dramatic ATP-independent, symmetrical and reversible DNA 
      uncoiling that affects at least 70% of the DNA within a nucleosome, occurs
      without apparent loss of histones and proceeds via an 'all-or-none' mechanism. A 
      mutated version of FACT is defective in uncoiling, and a histone mutation that
      suppresses phenotypes caused by this FACT mutation in vivo restores the uncoiling
      activity in vitro. Thus, FACT-dependent nucleosome unfolding modulates the
      accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, and this activity is an important function of
      FACT in vivo.

AB  - RNAs can begin to fold immediately as they emerge from RNA polymerase. During
      cotranscriptional folding, interactions between nascent RNAs and ligands are able
      to direct the formation of alternative RNA structures, a feature exploited by
      noncoding RNAs called riboswitches to make gene-regulatory decisions. Despite
      their importance, cotranscriptional folding pathways have yet to be uncovered
      with sufficient resolution to reveal how cotranscriptional folding governs RNA
      structure and function. To access cotranscriptional folding at nucleotide
      resolution, we extended selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by
      primer-extension sequencing (SHAPE-seq) to measure structural information of
      nascent RNAs during transcription. Using cotranscriptional SHAPE-seq, we
      determined how the cotranscriptional folding pathway of the Bacillus cereus crcB 
      fluoride riboswitch undergoes a ligand-dependent bifurcation that delays or
      promotes terminator formation via a series of coordinated structural transitions.
      Our results directly link cotranscriptional RNA folding to a genetic decision and
      establish a framework for cotranscriptional analysis of RNA structure at
      nucleotide resolution.

TI  - Staggered ATP binding mechanism of eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (CCT) revealed
      through high-resolution cryo-EM.
PG  - 1083-1091
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3309 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT) assists in the folding of 10% of
      cytosolic proteins. Here we present two cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae TRiC in a newly identified nucleotide partially preloaded (NPP) state 
      and in the ATP-bound state, at 4.7-A and 4.6-A resolution, respectively. Through 
      inner-subunit eGFP tagging, we identified the subunit locations in open-state
      TRiC and found that the CCT2 subunit pair forms an unexpected Z shape. ATP
      binding induces a dramatic conformational change on the CCT2 side, thereby
      suggesting that CCT2 plays an essential role in TRiC allosteric cooperativity.
      Our structural and biochemical data reveal a staggered ATP binding mechanism of
      TRiC with preloaded nucleotide on the CCT6 side of NPP-TRiC and demonstrate that 
      TRiC has evolved into a complex that is structurally divided into two sides. This
      work offers insight into how the TRiC nucleotide cycle coordinates with its
      mechanical cycle in preparing folding intermediates for further productive
      folding.

TI  - Ribosome-stalk biogenesis is coupled with recruitment of nuclear-export factor to
      the nascent 60S subunit.
PG  - 1074-1082
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3312 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear export of preribosomal subunits is a key step during eukaryotic ribosome 
      formation. To efficiently pass through the FG-repeat meshwork of the nuclear pore
      complex, the large pre-60S subunit requires several export factors. Here we
      describe the mechanism of recruitment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-export 
      receptor Mex67-Mtr2 to the pre-60S subunit at the proper time. Mex67-Mtr2 binds
      at the premature ribosomal-stalk region, which later during translation serves as
      a binding platform for translational GTPases on the mature ribosome. The assembly
      factor Mrt4, a structural homolog of cytoplasmic-stalk protein P0, masks this
      site, thus preventing untimely recruitment of Mex67-Mtr2 to nuclear pre-60S
      particles. Subsequently, Yvh1 triggers Mrt4 release in the nucleus, thereby
      creating a narrow time window for Mex67-Mtr2 association at this site and
      facilitating nuclear export of the large subunit. Thus, a spatiotemporal mark on 
      the ribosomal stalk controls the recruitment of an RNA-export receptor to the
      nascent 60S subunit.

TI  - RNA-binding protein CPEB1 remodels host and viral RNA landscapes.
PG  - 1101-1110
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3310 [doi]
AB  - Host and virus interactions occurring at the post-transcriptional level are
      critical for infection but remain poorly understood. Here, we performed
      comprehensive transcriptome-wide analyses revealing that human cytomegalovirus
      (HCMV) infection results in widespread alternative splicing (AS), shortening of
      3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and lengthening of poly(A)-tails in host gene
      transcripts. We found that the host RNA-binding protein CPEB1 was highly induced 
      after infection, and ectopic expression of CPEB1 in noninfected cells
      recapitulated infection-related post-transcriptional changes. CPEB1 was also
      required for poly(A)-tail lengthening of viral RNAs important for productive
      infection. Strikingly, depletion of CPEB1 reversed infection-related
      cytopathology and post-transcriptional changes, and decreased productive HCMV
      titers. Host RNA processing was also altered in herpes simplex virus-2
      (HSV-2)-infected cells, thereby indicating that this phenomenon might be a common
      occurrence during herpesvirus infections. We anticipate that our work may serve
      as a starting point for therapeutic targeting of host RNA-binding proteins in
      herpesvirus infections.

TI  - Importance of cycle timing for the function of the molecular chaperone Hsp90.
PG  - 1020-1028
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3305 [doi]
AB  - Hsp90 couples ATP hydrolysis to large conformational changes essential for
      activation of client proteins. The structural transitions involve dimerization of
      the N-terminal domains and formation of 'closed states' involving the N-terminal 
      and middle domains. Here, we used Hsp90 mutants that modulate ATPase activity and
      biological function as probes to address the importance of conformational cycling
      for Hsp90 activity. We found no correlation between the speed of ATP turnover and
      the in vivo activity of Hsp90: some mutants with almost normal ATPase activity
      were lethal, and some mutants with lower or undetectable ATPase activity were
      viable. Our analysis showed that it is crucial for Hsp90 to attain and spend time
      in certain conformational states: a certain dwell time in open states is required
      for optimal processing of client proteins, whereas a prolonged population of
      closed states has negative effects. Thus, the timing of conformational
      transitions is crucial for Hsp90 function and not cycle speed.

      nuclear-membrane protein NPP-14.
PG  - 958-964
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3308 [doi]
AB  - Caspases are cysteine proteases with critical roles in apoptosis. The
      Caenorhabditis elegans caspase CED-3 is activated by autocatalytic cleavage, a
      process enhanced by CED-4. Here we report that the CED-3 zymogen localizes to the
      perinuclear region in C. elegans germ cells and that CED-3 autocatalytic cleavage
      is held in check by C. elegans nuclei and activated by CED-4. The nuclear-pore
      protein NPP-14 interacts with the CED-3 zymogen prodomain, colocalizes with CED-3
      in vivo and inhibits CED-3 autoactivation in vitro. Several missense mutations in
      the CED-3 prodomain result in stronger association with NPP-14 and decreased
      CED-3 activation by CED-4 in the presence of nuclei or NPP-14, thus leading to
      cell-death defects. Those same mutations enhance autocatalytic cleavage of CED-3 
      in vitro and increase apoptosis in vivo in the absence of npp-14. Our results
      reveal a critical role of nuclei and nuclear-membrane proteins in regulating the 
      activation and localization of CED-3.

TI  - Structural basis of mRNA-cap recognition by Dcp1-Dcp2.
PG  - 987-994
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3301 [doi]
AB  - Removal of the 5' cap on mRNA by the decapping enzyme Dcp2 is a critical step in 
      5'-to-3' mRNA decay. Understanding the structural basis of Dcp2 activity has been
      a challenge because Dcp2 is dynamic and has weak affinity for the cap substrate. 
      Here we present a 2.6-A-resolution crystal structure of a heterotrimer of fission
      yeast Dcp2, its essential activator Dcp1, and the human NMD cofactor PNRC2, in
      complex with a tight-binding cap analog. Cap binding is accompanied by a
      conformational change in Dcp2, thereby forming a composite nucleotide-binding
      site comprising conserved residues in the catalytic and regulatory domains.
      Kinetic analysis of PNRC2 revealed that a conserved short linear motif enhances
      both substrate affinity and the catalytic step of decapping. These findings
      explain why Dcp2 requires a conformational change for efficient catalysis and
      reveals that coactivators promote RNA binding and the catalytic step of
      decapping, possibly through different conformational states.

TI  - Structure of the active form of Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme bound to m(7)GDP and

PG  - 982-986
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3300 [doi]
AB  - Elimination of the 5' cap of eukaryotic mRNAs, known as decapping, is considered 
      to be a crucial, irreversible and highly regulated step required for the rapid
      degradation of mRNA by Xrn1, the major cytoplasmic 5'-3' exonuclease. Decapping
      is accomplished by the recruitment of a protein complex formed by the Dcp2
      catalytic subunit and its Dcp1 cofactor. However, this complex has a low
      intrinsic enzymatic activity and requires several accessory proteins such as the 
      Lsm1-7 complex, Pat1, Edc1-Edc2 and/or Edc3 to be fully active. Here we present
      the crystal structure of the active form of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis
      Dcp1-Dcp2 enzyme bound to its product (m(7)GDP) and its potent activator Edc3.
      This structure of the Dcp1-Dcp2 complex bound to a cap analog further explains

AB  - Noncoding RNAs, mobile elements, and alternative splicing are all critical for
      the regulation of gene expression. Here we show that a conserved noncoding RNA
      acquires a new function due to the insertion of a mobile element. We identified a
      noncoding RNA, termed 5S-OT, which is transcribed from 5S rDNA loci in eukaryotes
      including fission yeast and mammals. 5S-OT plays a cis role in regulating the
      transcription of 5S rRNA in mice and humans. In the anthropoidea suborder of
      primates, an antisense Alu element has been inserted at the 5S-OT locus. We found
      that in human cells, 5S-OT regulates alternative splicing of multiple genes in
      trans via Alu/anti-Alu pairing with target genes and by interacting with the
      splicing factor U2AF65. This trans effect of 5S-OT in splicing might be exploited
      in biotechnological applications.

TI  - Substrate-translocating loops regulate mechanochemical coupling and power
      production in AAA+ protease ClpXP.
PG  - 974-981
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3298 [doi]
AB  - ATP-dependent proteases of the AAA+ family, including Escherichia coli ClpXP and 
      the eukaryotic proteasome, contribute to maintenance of cellular proteostasis.
      ClpXP unfolds and translocates substrates into an internal degradation chamber,
      using cycles of alternating dwell and burst phases. The ClpX motor performs
      chemical transformations during the dwell and translocates the substrate in
      increments of 1-4 nm during the burst, but the processes occurring during these
      phases remain unknown. Here we characterized the complete mechanochemical cycle
      of ClpXP, showing that ADP release and ATP binding occur nonsequentially during
      the dwell, whereas ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release occur during the burst.
      The highly conserved translocating loops within the ClpX pore are optimized to
      maximize motor power generation, the coupling between chemical and mechanical
      tasks, and the efficiency of protein processing. Conformational resetting of
      these loops between consecutive bursts appears to determine ADP release from
      individual ATPase subunits and the overall duration of the motor's cycle.

TI  - Skywalker-TBC1D24 has a lipid-binding pocket mutated in epilepsy and required for
      synaptic function.
PG  - 965-973
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3297 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in TBC1D24 cause severe epilepsy and DOORS syndrome, but the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying these pathologies are unresolved. We solved the crystal
      structure of the TBC domain of the Drosophila ortholog Skywalker, revealing an
      unanticipated cationic pocket conserved among TBC1D24 homologs. Cocrystallization
      and biochemistry showed that this pocket binds phosphoinositides phosphorylated
      at the 4 and 5 positions. The most prevalent patient mutations affect the
      phosphoinositide-binding pocket and inhibit lipid binding. Using in vivo
      photobleaching of Skywalker-GFP mutants, including pathogenic mutants, we showed 
      that membrane binding via this pocket restricts Skywalker diffusion in
      presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the pathogenic mutations cause severe
      neurological defects in flies, including impaired synaptic-vesicle trafficking
      and seizures, and these defects are reversed by genetically increasing synaptic
      PI(4,5)P2 concentrations through synaptojanin mutations. Hence, we discovered
      that a TBC domain affected by clinical mutations directly binds phosphoinositides
      through a cationic pocket and that phosphoinositide binding is critical for
      presynaptic function.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3296 [doi]
AB  - Multiple protein ubiquitination events at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
      regulate damage recognition, signaling and repair. It has remained poorly
      understood how the repair process of DSBs is coordinated with the apoptotic
      response. Here, we identified the E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD-2 as a mediator of
      DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in a genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans. We
      found that, after initiation of homologous recombination by RAD-51, UFD-2 forms
      foci that contain substrate-processivity factors including the
      ubiquitin-selective segregase CDC-48 (p97), the deubiquitination enzyme ATX-3
      (Ataxin-3) and the proteasome. In the absence of UFD-2, RAD-51 foci persist, and 
      DNA damage-induced apoptosis is prevented. In contrast, UFD-2 foci are retained
      until recombination intermediates are removed by the Holliday-junction-processing
      enzymes GEN-1, MUS-81 or XPF-1. Formation of UFD-2 foci also requires
      proapoptotic CEP-1 (p53) signaling. Our findings establish a central role of
      UFD-2 in the coordination between the DNA-repair process and the apoptotic
      response.

      ribosomal subunits.

AB  - Ribosome-associated J protein-Hsp70 chaperones promote nascent-polypeptide
      folding and normal translational fidelity. The J protein Zuo1 is known to span
      the ribosomal subunits, but understanding of its function is limited. Here we
      present new structural and cross-linking data allowing more precise positioning
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Zuo1 near the 60S polypeptide-exit site and
      suggesting interactions of Zuo1 with the ribosomal protein eL31 and 25S rRNA
      helix 24. The junction between the 60S-interacting and subunit-spanning helices
      is a hinge that positions Zuo1 on the 40S yet accommodates subunit rotation.
      Interaction between the Zuo1 C terminus and 40S occurs via 18S rRNA expansion
      segment 12 (ES12) of helix 44, which originates at the decoding site. Deletions
      in either ES12 or the Zuo1 C terminus alter readthrough of stop codons and -1
      frameshifting. Our study offers insight into how this cotranslational chaperone
      system may monitor decoding-site activity and nascent-polypeptide transit,
      thereby coordinating protein translation and folding.

TI  - Natively glycosylated HIV-1 Env structure reveals new mode for antibody
      recognition of the CD4-binding site.
PG  - 906-915
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3291 [doi]
AB  - HIV-1 vaccine design is informed by structural studies elucidating mechanisms by 
      which broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) recognize and/or accommodate
      N-glycans on the trimeric envelope glycoprotein (Env). Variability in
      high-mannose and complex-type Env glycoforms leads to heterogeneity that usually 
      precludes visualization of the native glycan shield. We present 3.5-A- and
      3.9-A-resolution crystal structures of the HIV-1 Env trimer with fully processed 
      and native glycosylation, revealing a glycan shield of high-mannose and
      complex-type N-glycans, which we used to define complete epitopes of two bNAbs.
      Env trimer was complexed with 10-1074 (against the V3-loop) and IOMA, a new
      CD4-binding site (CD4bs) antibody. Although IOMA derives from VH1-2*02, the
      germline gene of CD4bs-targeting VRC01-class bNAbs, its light chain lacks the
      short CDRL3 that defines VRC01-class bNAbs. Thus IOMA resembles
      8ANC131-class/VH1-46-derived CD4bs bNAbs, which have normal-length CDRL3s. The
      existence of bNAbs that combine features of VRC01-class and 8ANC131-class
      antibodies has implications for immunization strategies targeting VRC01-like
      bNAbs.

TI  - Glycan shield and epitope masking of a coronavirus spike protein observed by
      cryo-electron microscopy.
PG  - 899-905
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3293 [doi]
AB  - The threat of a major coronavirus pandemic urges the development of strategies to
      combat these pathogens. Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an
      alpha-coronavirus that can cause severe lower-respiratory-tract infections
      requiring hospitalization. We report here the 3.4-A-resolution cryo-EM
      reconstruction of the HCoV-NL63 coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer, which
      mediates entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies 
      during infection. The map resolves the extensive glycan shield obstructing the
      protein surface and, in combination with mass spectrometry, provides a structural
      framework to understand the accessibility to antibodies. The structure reveals
      the complete architecture of the fusion machinery including the triggering loop
      and the C-terminal domains, which contribute to anchoring the trimer to the viral
      membrane. Our data further suggest that HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses use
      molecular trickery, based on epitope masking with glycans and activating
      conformational changes, to evade the immune system of infected hosts.

TI  - A minimized human insulin-receptor-binding motif revealed in a Conus geographus
      venom insulin.
PG  - 916-920
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3292 [doi]
AB  - Insulins in the venom of certain fish-hunting cone snails facilitate prey capture
      by rapidly inducing hypoglycemic shock. One such insulin, Conus geographus G1
      (Con-Ins G1), is the smallest known insulin found in nature and lacks the
      C-terminal segment of the B chain that, in human insulin, mediates engagement of 
      the insulin receptor and assembly of the hormone's hexameric storage form.
      Removal of this segment (residues B23-B30) in human insulin results in
      substantial loss of receptor affinity. Here, we found that Con-Ins G1 is
      monomeric, strongly binds the human insulin receptor and activates receptor
      signaling. Con-Ins G1 thus is a naturally occurring B-chain-minimized mimetic of 
      human insulin. Our crystal structure of Con-Ins G1 reveals a tertiary structure
      highly similar to that of human insulin and indicates how Con-Ins G1's lack of an
      equivalent to the key receptor-engaging residue Phe(B24) is mitigated. These
      findings may facilitate efforts to design ultrarapid-acting therapeutic insulins.

AB  - Recycling of internalized receptors from endosomal compartments is essential for 
      the receptors' cell-surface homeostasis. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) cooperates with
      the retromer complex in the recycling of proteins containing type I PSD95-Dlg-ZO1
      (PDZ)-binding motifs. Here we define specific acidic amino acid sequences
      upstream of the PDZ-binding motif required for high-affinity engagement of the
      human SNX27 PDZ domain. However, a subset of SNX27 ligands, such as the beta2
      adrenergic receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, lack these sequence
      determinants. Instead, we identified conserved sites of phosphorylation that
      substitute for acidic residues and dramatically enhance SNX27 interactions. This 
      newly identified mechanism suggests a likely regulatory switch for PDZ
      interaction and protein transport by the SNX27-retromer complex. Defining this
      SNX27 binding code allowed us to classify more than 400 potential SNX27 ligands
      with broad functional implications in signal transduction, neuronal plasticity
      and metabolite transport.

AB  - Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems include genomic arrays of short repeats flanking
      foreign DNA sequences and provide adaptive immunity against viruses. Integration 
      of foreign DNA must occur specifically to avoid damaging the genome or the CRISPR
      array, but surprisingly promiscuous activity occurs in vitro. Here we
      reconstituted full-site DNA integration and show that the Streptococcus pyogenes 
      type II-A Cas1-Cas2 integrase maintains specificity in part through limitations
      on the second integration step. At non-CRISPR sites, integration stalls at the
      half-site intermediate, thereby enabling reaction reversal. S. pyogenes Cas1-Cas2
      is highly specific for the leader-proximal repeat and recognizes the repeat's
      palindromic ends, thus fitting a model of independent recognition by distal Cas1 
      active sites. These findings suggest that DNA-insertion sites are less common
      than suggested by previous work, thereby preventing toxicity during CRISPR immune
      adaptation and maintaining host genome integrity.

      toward destruction.
PG  - 933-940
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3284 [doi]
AB  - The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr is required for efficient viral infection of
      macrophages and promotion of viral replication in T cells. Vpr's biological
      activities are closely linked to the interaction with human DCAF1, a cellular
      substrate receptor of the Cullin4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) of the host
      ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation pathway. The molecular details 
      of how Vpr usurps the protein degradation pathway have not been delineated. Here 
      we present the crystal structure of the DDB1-DCAF1-HIV-1-Vpr-uracil-DNA
      glycosylase (UNG2) complex. The structure reveals how Vpr engages with DCAF1,
      creating a binding interface for UNG2 recruitment in a manner distinct from the
      recruitment of SAMHD1 by Vpx proteins. Vpr and Vpx use similar N-terminal and
      helical regions to bind the substrate receptor, whereas different regions target 
      the specific cellular substrates. Furthermore, Vpr uses molecular mimicry of DNA 
      by a variable loop for specific recruitment of the UNG2 substrate.

TI  - Membrane insertion of a Tc toxin in near-atomic detail.
PG  - 884-890
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3281 [doi]
AB  - Tc toxins from pathogenic bacteria use a special syringe-like mechanism to
      perforate the host cell membrane and inject a deadly enzyme into the host
      cytosol. The molecular mechanism of this unusual injection system is poorly
      understood. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined the structure of TcdA1
      from Photorhabdus luminescens embedded in lipid nanodiscs. In our structure,
      compared with the previous structure of TcdA1 in the prepore state, the
      transmembrane helices rearrange in the membrane and open the initially closed
      pore. However, the helices do not span the complete membrane; instead, the loops 
      connecting the helices form the rim of the funnel. Lipid head groups reach into
      the space between the loops and consequently stabilize the pore conformation. The
      linker domain is folded and packed into a pocket formed by the other domains of
      the toxin, thereby considerably contributing to stabilization of the pore state.

TI  - Staphylococcal SCCmec elements encode an active MCM-like helicase and thus may be
      replicative.
PG  - 891-898
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3286 [doi]
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a public-health threat
      worldwide. Although the mobile genomic island responsible for this phenotype,
      staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC), has been thought to be nonreplicative, 
      we predicted DNA-replication-related functions for some of the conserved proteins
      encoded by SCC. We show that one of these, Cch, is homologous to the self-loading
      initiator helicases of an unrelated family of genomic islands, that it is an
      active 3'-to-5' helicase and that the adjacent ORF encodes a single-stranded
      DNA-binding protein. Our 2.9-A crystal structure of intact Cch shows that it
      forms a hexameric ring. Cch, like the archaeal and eukaryotic MCM-family
      replicative helicases, belongs to the pre-sensor II insert clade of AAA+ ATPases.
      Additionally, we found that SCC elements are part of a broader family of mobile
      elements, all of which encode a replication initiator upstream of their
      recombinases. Replication after excision would enhance the efficiency of
      horizontal gene transfer.

AB  - Proteins with knotted configurations, in comparison with unknotted proteins, are 
      restricted in conformational space. Little is known regarding whether knotted
      proteins have sufficient dynamics to communicate between spatially separated
      substrate-binding sites. TrmD is a bacterial methyltransferase that uses a
      knotted protein fold to catalyze methyl transfer from S-adenosyl methionine
      (AdoMet) to G37-tRNA. The product, m(1)G37-tRNA, is essential for life and
      maintains protein-synthesis reading frames. Using an integrated approach of
      structural, kinetic, and computational analysis, we show that the structurally
      constrained TrmD knot is required for its catalytic activity. Unexpectedly, the
      TrmD knot undergoes complex internal movements that respond to AdoMet binding and
      signaling. Most of the signaling propagates the free energy of AdoMet binding,
      thereby stabilizing tRNA binding and allowing assembly of the active site. This
      work demonstrates new principles of knots as organized structures that capture
      the free energies of substrate binding and facilitate catalysis.

AB  - The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase (pol) II
      comprises conserved heptad repeats, and post-translational modification of the
      CTD regulates transcription and cotranscriptional RNA processing. Recently, the
      spatial patterns of modification of the CTD repeats have been investigated, and
      new functions of CTD modification have been revealed. In addition, there are new 
      insights into the roles of the enzymes that decorate the CTD. We review these new
      findings and reassess the role of the pol II CTD in the regulation of gene
      expression.

TI  - An accurately preorganized IRES RNA structure enables eIF4G capture for
      initiation of viral translation.
PG  - 859-64
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3280 [doi]
AB  - Many viruses bypass canonical cap-dependent translation in host cells by using
      internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) in their transcripts; IRESs hijack
      initiation factors for the assembly of initiation complexes. However, it is
      currently unknown how IRES RNAs recognize initiation factors that have no
      endogenous RNA binding partners; in a prominent example, the IRES of
      encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) interacts with the HEAT-1 domain of eukaryotic 
      initiation factor 4G (eIF4G). Here we report the solution structure of the J-K
      region of this IRES and show that its stems are precisely organized to position
      protein-recognition bulges. This multisite interaction mechanism operates on an
      all-or-nothing principle in which all domains are required. This preorganization 
      is accomplished by an 'adjuster module': a pentaloop motif that acts as a
      dual-sided docking station for base-pair receptors. Because subtle changes in the
      orientation abrogate protein capture, our study highlights how a viral RNA
      acquires affinity for a target protein.

PG  - 847-52
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3279 [doi]
AB  - Effectors secreted by the type III secretion system are essential for bacterial
      pathogenesis. Members of the Yersinia outer-protein J (YopJ) family of effectors 
      found in diverse plant and animal pathogens depend on a protease-like catalytic
      triad to acetylate host proteins and produce virulence. However, the structural
      basis for this noncanonical acetyltransferase activity remains unknown. Here, we 
      report the crystal structures of the YopJ effector HopZ1a, produced by the
      phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, in complex with the eukaryote-specific
      cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and/or coenzyme A (CoA). Structural,
      computational and functional characterizations reveal a catalytic core with a
      fold resembling that of ubiquitin-like cysteine proteases and an
      acetyl-CoA-binding pocket formed after IP6-induced structural rearrangements.
      Modeling-guided mutagenesis further identified key IP6-interacting residues of
      Salmonella effector AvrA that are required for acetylating its substrate. Our
      study reveals the structural basis of a novel class of acetyltransferases and the
      conserved allosteric regulation of YopJ effectors by IP6.

TI  - One-way membrane trafficking of SOS in receptor-triggered Ras activation.
PG  - 838-46
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3275 [doi]
AB  - SOS is a key activator of the small GTPase Ras. In cells, SOS-Ras signaling is
      thought to be initiated predominantly by membrane recruitment of SOS via the
      adaptor Grb2 and balanced by rapidly reversible Grb2-SOS binding kinetics.
      However, SOS has multiple protein and lipid interactions that provide linkage to 
      the membrane. In reconstituted-membrane experiments, these Grb2-independent
      interactions were sufficient to retain human SOS on the membrane for many
      minutes, during which a single SOS molecule could processively activate thousands
      of Ras molecules. These observations raised questions concerning how receptors
      maintain control of SOS in cells and how membrane-recruited SOS is ultimately
      released. We addressed these questions in quantitative assays of reconstituted
      SOS-deficient chicken B-cell signaling systems combined with single-molecule
      measurements in supported membranes. These studies revealed an essentially
      one-way trafficking process in which membrane-recruited SOS remains trapped on
      the membrane and continuously activates Ras until being actively removed via
      endocytosis.

PG  - 853-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3271 [doi]
AB  - The lipid-enveloped influenza virus enters host cells during infection by binding
      cell-surface receptors and, after receptor-mediated endocytosis, fusing with the 
      membrane of the endosome and delivering the viral genome and transcription
      machinery into the host cell. These events are mediated by the hemagglutinin (HA)
      surface glycoprotein. At the low pH of the endosome, an irreversible
      conformational change in the HA, including the exposure of the hydrophobic fusion
      peptide, activates membrane fusion. Here we used electron cryomicroscopy and
      cryotomography to image the fusion of influenza virus with target membranes at
      low pH. We visualized structural intermediates of HA and their interactions with 
      membranes during the course of membrane fusion as well as ultrastructural changes
      in the virus that accompany membrane fusion. Our observations are relevant to a
      wide range of protein-mediated membrane-fusion processes and demonstrate how
      dynamic membrane events may be studied by cryomicroscopy.

TI  - Iterative structure-based improvement of a fusion-glycoprotein vaccine against
      RSV.
PG  - 811-820
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3267 [doi]
AB  - Structure-based design of vaccines, particularly the iterative optimization used 
      so successfully in the structure-based design of drugs, has been a long-sought
      goal. We previously developed a first-generation vaccine antigen called DS-Cav1, 
      comprising a prefusion-stabilized form of the fusion (F) glycoprotein, which
      elicits high-titer protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
      in mice and macaques. Here we report the improvement of DS-Cav1 through iterative
      cycles of structure-based design that significantly increased the titer of
      RSV-protective responses. The resultant second-generation 'DS2'-stabilized
      immunogens have their F subunits genetically linked, their fusion peptides
      deleted and their interprotomer movements stabilized by an additional disulfide
      bond. These DS2 immunogens are promising vaccine candidates with superior
      attributes, such as their lack of a requirement for furin cleavage and their
      increased antigenic stability against heat inactivation. The iterative
      structure-based improvement described here may have utility in the optimization
      of other vaccine antigens.

TI  - Clathrin-coat disassembly illuminates the mechanisms of Hsp70 force generation.
PG  - 821-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3272 [doi]
AB  - Hsp70s use ATP hydrolysis to disrupt protein-protein associations and to move
      macromolecules. One example is the Hsc70- mediated disassembly of the clathrin
      coats that form on vesicles during endocytosis. Here, we exploited the
      exceptional features of these coats to test three models-Brownian ratchet,
      power-stroke and entropic pulling-proposed to explain how Hsp70s transform their 
      substrates. Our data rule out the ratchet and power-stroke models and instead
      support a collision-pressure mechanism whereby collisions between clathrin-coat
      walls and Hsc70s drive coats apart. Collision pressure is the complement to the
      pulling force described in the entropic pulling model. We also found that
      self-association augments collision pressure, thereby allowing disassembly of
      clathrin lattices that have been predicted to be resistant to disassembly. These 
      results illuminate how Hsp70s generate the forces that transform their
      substrates.

TI  - m(1)A and m(1)G disrupt A-RNA structure through the intrinsic instability of
      Hoogsteen base pairs.
PG  - 803-10
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3270 [doi]
AB  - The B-DNA double helix can dynamically accommodate G-C and A-T base pairs in
      either Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen configurations. Here, we show that G-C(+) (in
      which + indicates protonation) and A-U Hoogsteen base pairs are strongly
      disfavored in A-RNA. As a result,N(1)-methyladenosine and N(1)-methylguanosine,
      which occur in DNA as a form of alkylation damage and in RNA as
      post-transcriptional modifications, have dramatically different consequences.
      Whereas they create G-C(+) and A-T Hoogsteen base pairs in duplex DNA, thereby
      maintaining the structural integrity of the double helix, they block base-pairing
      and induce local duplex melting in RNA. These observations provide a mechanism
      for disrupting RNA structure through post-transcriptional modifications. The
      different propensities to form Hoogsteen base pairs in B-DNA and A-RNA may help
      cells meet the opposing requirements of maintaining genome stability, on the one 
      hand, and of dynamically modulating the structure of the epitranscriptome, on the
      other.

TI  - Spiral architecture of the Hsp104 disaggregase reveals the basis for polypeptide 
      translocation.
PG  - 830-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3277 [doi]
AB  - Hsp104, a conserved AAA+ protein disaggregase, promotes survival during cellular 
      stress. Hsp104 remodels amyloids, thereby supporting prion propagation, and
      disassembles toxic oligomers associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However,
      a definitive structural mechanism for its disaggregase activity has remained
      elusive. We determined the cryo-EM structure of wild-type Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae Hsp104 in the ATP state, revealing a near-helical hexamer architecture
      that coordinates the mechanical power of the 12 AAA+ domains for disaggregation. 
      An unprecedented heteromeric AAA+ interaction defines an asymmetric seam in an
      apparent catalytic arrangement that aligns the domains in a two-turn spiral.
      N-terminal domains form a broad channel entrance for substrate engagement and
      Hsp70 interaction. Middle-domain helices bridge adjacent protomers across the
      nucleotide pocket, thus explaining roles in ATP hydrolysis and protein
      disaggregation. Remarkably, substrate-binding pore loops line the channel in a
      spiral arrangement optimized for substrate transfer across the AAA+ domains,
      thereby establishing a continuous path for polypeptide translocation.

TI  - Skp is a multivalent chaperone of outer-membrane proteins.
PG  - 786-793
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3266 [doi]
AB  - The trimeric chaperone Skp sequesters outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) within a
      hydrophobic cage, thereby preventing their aggregation during transport across
      the periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we studied the interaction between
      Escherichia coli Skp and five OMPs of varying size. Investigations of the
      kinetics of OMP folding revealed that higher Skp/OMP ratios are required to
      prevent the folding of 16-stranded OMPs compared with their 8-stranded
      counterparts. Ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) data, computer
      modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence that 10- to
      16-stranded OMPs are encapsulated within an expanded Skp substrate cage. For OMPs
      that cannot be fully accommodated in the expanded cavity, sequestration is
      achieved by binding of an additional Skp trimer. The results suggest a new
      mechanism for Skp chaperone activity involving the coordination of multiple
      copies of Skp in protecting a single substrate from aggregation.

AB  - Bacteriophages express proteins that inactivate the CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune
      system. Here we report the crystal structure of the anti-CRISPR protein AcrF3 in 
      complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas3 (PaCas3). AcrF3 forms a homodimer that
      locks PaCas3 in an ADP-bound form, blocks the entrance of the DNA-binding tunnel 
      in the helicase domain, and masks the linker region and C-terminal domain of
      PaCas3, thereby preventing recruitment by Cascade and inhibiting the type I-F
      CRISPR-Cas system.

TI  - Structural basis for tRNA modification by Elp3 from Dehalococcoides mccartyi.
PG  - 794-802
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3265 [doi]
AB  - During translation elongation, decoding is based on the recognition of codons by 
      corresponding tRNA anticodon triplets. Molecular mechanisms that regulate global 
      protein synthesis via specific base modifications in tRNA anticodons are
      receiving increasing attention. The conserved eukaryotic Elongator complex
      specifically modifies uridines located in the wobble base position of tRNAs.
      Mutations in Elongator subunits are associated with certain neurodegenerative
      diseases and cancer. Here we present the crystal structure of D. mccartyi Elp3
      (DmcElp3) at 2.15-A resolution. Our results reveal an unexpected arrangement of
      Elp3 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)
      domains, which share a large interface and form a composite active site and
      tRNA-binding pocket, with an iron-sulfur cluster located in the dimerization
      interface of two DmcElp3 molecules. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies of yeast
      Elp3 confirmed the relevance of our findings for eukaryotic Elp3s and should aid 
      in understanding the cellular functions and pathophysiological roles of
      Elongator.

TI  - An atomic structure of the human 26S proteasome.
PG  - 778-85
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3273 [doi]
AB  - We report the cryo-EM structure of the human 26S proteasome at an average
      resolution of 3.5 A, allowing atomic modeling of 28 subunits in the core particle
      (CP) and 18 subunits in the regulatory particle (RP). The C-terminal residues of 
      Rpt3 and Rpt5 subunits in the RP can be seen inserted into surface pockets formed
      between adjacent alpha subunits in the CP. Each of the six Rpt subunits contains 
      a bound nucleotide, and the central gate of the CP alpha-ring is closed despite
      RP association. The six pore 1 loops in the Rpt ring are arranged similarly to a 
      spiral staircase along the axial channel of substrate transport, which is
      constricted by the pore 2 loops. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 
      human proteasome bound to the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 at 4.35-A resolution.
      Together, our structures provide a framework for mechanistic understanding of
      eukaryotic proteasome function.

AB  - We show here that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GARP complex and the Cog1-4
      subcomplex of the COG complex, both members of the complexes associated with
      tethering containing helical rods (CATCHR) family of multisubunit tethering
      complexes, share the same subunit organization. We also show that HOPS, a
      tethering complex acting in the endolysosomal pathway, shares a similar
      architecture, thus suggesting that multisubunit tethering complexes use related
      structural frameworks.

AB  - The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex orchestrates vesicular trafficking
      to and within the Golgi apparatus. Here, we use negative-stain electron
      microscopy to elucidate the architecture of the hetero-octameric COG complex from
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intact COG has an intricate shape, with four (or
      possibly five) flexible legs, that differs strikingly from that of the exocyst
      complex and appears to be well suited for vesicle capture and fusion.

PG  - 722-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3259 [doi]
AB  - SWI2/SNF2 family proteins regulate a myriad of nucleic acid transactions by
      sliding, removing and reconstructing nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells. They
      contain two RecA-like core domains, which couple ATP hydrolysis and DNA
      translocation to chromatin remodeling. Here we report the crystal structure of
      Snf2 from the yeast Myceliophthora thermophila. The data show the two RecA-like
      core domains of Snf2 stacking together and twisting their ATP-binding motifs away
      from each other, thus explaining the inactivity of the protein in the ground
      state. We identified several DNA-binding elements, which are fully exposed to
      solvent, thus suggesting that the protein is poised for its incoming substrate.
      The catalytic core of Snf2 showed a high chromatin-remodeling activity, which was
      suppressed by the N-terminal HSA domain. Our findings reveal that the catalytic
      core of Snf2 is a competent remodeling machine, which rests in an inactive
      conformation and requires a large conformational change upon activation.

TI  - Lipids modulate the conformational dynamics of a secondary multidrug transporter.
PG  - 744-51
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3262 [doi]
AB  - Direct interactions with lipids have emerged as key determinants of the folding, 
      structure and function of membrane proteins, but an understanding of how lipids
      modulate protein dynamics is still lacking. Here, we systematically explored the 
      effects of lipids on the conformational dynamics of the proton-powered multidrug 
      transporter LmrP from Lactococcus lactis, using the pattern of distances between 
      spin-label pairs previously shown to report on alternating access of the protein.
      We uncovered, at the molecular level, how the lipid headgroups shape the
      conformational-energy landscape of the transporter. The model emerging from our
      data suggests a direct interaction between lipid headgroups and a conserved motif
      of charged residues that control the conformational equilibrium through an
      interplay of electrostatic interactions within the protein. Together, our data
      lay the foundation for a comprehensive model of secondary multidrug transport in 
      lipid bilayers.

AB  - Zika virus has emerged as a pathogen of major health concern. Here, we present a 
      high-resolution (1.62-A) crystal structure of the RNA helicase from the French
      Polynesia strain. The structure is similar to that of the RNA helicase from
      Dengue virus, with variability in the conformations of loops typically involved
      in binding ATP and RNA. We identify druggable 'hotspots' that are well suited for
      in silico and/or fragment-based high-throughput drug discovery.

TI  - Free backbone carbonyls mediate rhodopsin activation.
PG  - 738-43
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3257 [doi]
AB  - Conserved prolines in the transmembrane helices of G-protein-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) are often considered to function as hinges that divide the helix into two
      segments capable of independent motion. Depending on their potential to
      hydrogen-bond, the free C=O groups associated with these prolines can facilitate 
      conformational flexibility, conformational switching or stabilization of the
      receptor structure. To address the role of conserved prolines in family A GPCRs
      through solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we focus on bovine rhodopsin, a GPCR in the
      visual receptor subfamily. The free backbone C=O groups on helices H5 and H7
      stabilize the inactive rhodopsin structure through hydrogen-bonds to residues on 
      adjacent helices. In response to light-induced isomerization of the retinal
      chromophore, hydrogen-bonding interactions involving these C=O groups are
      released, thus facilitating repacking of H5 and H7 onto the transmembrane core of
      the receptor. These results provide insights into the multiple structural and
      functional roles of prolines in membrane proteins.

TI  - The bicoid mRNA localization factor Exuperantia is an RNA-binding pseudonuclease.
PG  - 705-13
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3254 [doi]
AB  - Anterior patterning in Drosophila is mediated by the localization of bicoid (bcd)
      mRNA at the anterior pole of the oocyte. Exuperantia (Exu) is a putative
      exonuclease (EXO) associated with bcd and required for its localization. We
      present the crystal structure of Exu, which reveals a dimeric assembly with each 
      monomer consisting of a 3'-5' EXO-like domain and a sterile alpha motif
      (SAM)-like domain. The catalytic site is degenerate and inactive. Instead, the
      EXO-like domain mediates dimerization and RNA binding. We show that Exu binds RNA
      directly in vitro, that the SAM-like domain is required for RNA binding activity 
      and that Exu binds a structured element present in the bcd 3' untranslated region
      with high affinity. Through structure-guided mutagenesis, we show that Exu
      dimerization is essential for bcd localization. Our data demonstrate that Exu is 
      a noncanonical RNA-binding protein with EXO-SAM-like domain architecture that
      interacts with its target RNA as a homodimer.

TI  - Neddylation requires glycyl-tRNA synthetase to protect activated E2.
PG  - 730-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3250 [doi]
AB  - Neddylation is a post-translational modification that controls the cell cycle and
      proliferation by conjugating the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to specific
      targets. Here we report that glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), an essential enzyme 
      in protein synthesis, also plays a critical role in neddylation. In human cells, 
      knockdown of GlyRS, but not knockdown of a different tRNA synthetase, decreased
      the global level of neddylation and caused cell-cycle abnormality. This function 
      of GlyRS is achieved through direct interactions with multiple components of the 
      neddylation pathway, including NEDD8, E1, and E2 (Ubc12). Using various
      structural and functional approaches, we show that GlyRS binds the APPBP1 subunit
      of E1 and captures and protects activated E2 (NEDD8-conjugated Ubc12) before the 
      activated E2 reaches a downstream target. Therefore, GlyRS functions as a
      chaperone that critically supports neddylation. This function is probably
      conserved in all eukaryotic GlyRS enzymes and may contribute to the strong
      association of GlyRS with cancer progression.

TI  - 53BP1 fosters fidelity of homology-directed DNA repair.
PG  - 714-21
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3251 [doi]
AB  - Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammals is coordinated by the
      ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of 53BP1 at DSB-flanking chromatin. Owing to its
      ability to limit DNA-end processing, 53BP1 is thought to promote nonhomologous
      end-joining (NHEJ) and to suppress homology-directed repair (HDR). Here, we show 
      that silencing 53BP1 or exhausting its capacity to bind damaged chromatin changes
      limited DSB resection to hyper-resection and results in a switch from error-free 
      gene conversion by RAD51 to mutagenic single-strand annealing by RAD52. Thus,
      rather than suppressing HDR, 53BP1 fosters its fidelity. These findings
      illuminate causes and consequences of synthetic viability acquired through 53BP1 
      silencing in cells lacking the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. We show that such cells
      survive DSB assaults at the cost of increasing reliance on RAD52-mediated HDR,
      which may fuel genome instability. However, our findings suggest that when
      challenged by DSBs, BRCA1- and 53BP1-deficient cells may become hypersensitive
      to, and be eliminated by, RAD52 inhibition.

TI  - The dynamic interactome and genomic targets of Polycomb complexes during
      stem-cell differentiation.
PG  - 682-690
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3248 [doi]
AB  - Although the core subunits of Polycomb group (PcG) complexes are well
      characterized, little is known about the dynamics of these protein complexes
      during cellular differentiation. We used quantitative interaction proteomics and 
      genome-wide profiling to study PcG proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) 
      and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that the stoichiometry and
      genome-wide binding of PRC1 and PRC2 were highly dynamic during neural
      differentiation. Intriguingly, we observed a downregulation and loss of PRC2 from
      chromatin marked with trimethylated histone H3 K27 (H3K27me3) during
      differentiation, whereas PRC1 was retained at these sites. Additionally, we found
      PRC1 at enhancer and promoter regions independently of PRC2 binding and H3K27me3.
      Finally, overexpression of NPC-specific PRC1 interactors in ESCs led to increased
      Ring1b binding to, and decreased expression of, NPC-enriched Ring1b-target genes.
      In summary, our integrative analyses uncovered dynamic PcG subcomplexes and their
      widespread colocalization with active chromatin marks during differentiation.

TI  - Functional interdependence of BRD4 and DOT1L in MLL leukemia.
PG  - 673-81
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3249 [doi]
AB  - Targeted therapies against disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) and
      bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) are currently being evaluated in clinical
      trials. However, the mechanisms by which BRD4 and DOT1L regulate leukemogenic
      transcription programs remain unclear. Using quantitative proteomics,
      chemoproteomics and biochemical fractionation, we found that native BRD4 and
      DOT1L exist in separate protein complexes. Genetic disruption or small-molecule
      inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L showed marked synergistic activity against MLL
      leukemia cell lines, primary human leukemia cells and mouse leukemia models.
      Mechanistically, we found a previously unrecognized functional collaboration
      between DOT1L and BRD4 that is especially important at highly transcribed genes
      in proximity to superenhancers. DOT1L, via dimethylated histone H3 K79,
      facilitates histone H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4
      to chromatin. These data provide new insights into the regulation of
      transcription and specify a molecular framework for therapeutic intervention in
      this disease with poor prognosis.

AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A1 (BoNT/A1), a licensed drug widely used for
      medical and cosmetic applications, exerts its action by invading motoneurons.
      Here we report a 2.0-A-resolution crystal structure of the BoNT/A1
      receptor-binding domain in complex with its neuronal receptor, glycosylated human
      SV2C. We found that the neuronal tropism of BoNT/A1 requires recognition of both 
      the peptide moiety and an N-linked glycan on SV2. This N-glycan-which is
      conserved in all SV2 isoforms across vertebrates-is essential for BoNT/A1 binding
      to neurons and for its potent neurotoxicity. The glycan-binding interface on SV2 
      is targeted by a human BoNT/A1-neutralizing antibody currently licensed as an
      antibotulism drug. Our studies reveal a new paradigm of host-pathogen
      interactions, in which pathogens exploit conserved host post-translational
      modifications, thereby achieving highly specific receptor binding while also
      tolerating genetic changes across multiple isoforms of receptors.

AB  - Maintenance of genome integrity requires that branched nucleic acid molecules be 
      accurately processed to produce double-helical DNA. Flap endonucleases are
      essential enzymes that trim such branched molecules generated by Okazaki-fragment
      synthesis during replication. Here, we report crystal structures of bacteriophage
      T5 flap endonuclease in complexes with intact DNA substrates and products, at
      resolutions of 1.9-2.2 A. They reveal single-stranded DNA threading through a
      hole in the enzyme, which is enclosed by an inverted V-shaped helical arch
      straddling the active site. Residues lining the hole induce an unusual barb-like 
      conformation in the DNA substrate, thereby juxtaposing the scissile phosphate and
      essential catalytic metal ions. A series of complexes and biochemical analyses
      show how the substrate's single-stranded branch approaches, threads through and
      finally emerges on the far side of the enzyme. Our studies suggest that substrate
      recognition involves an unusual 'fly-casting, thread, bend and barb' mechanism.

TI  - Toward the atomic structure of the nuclear pore complex: when top down meets
      bottom up.
PG  - 624-30
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3244 [doi]
AB  - Elucidating the structure of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a prerequisite for
      understanding the molecular mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport. However,
      owing to its sheer size and flexibility, the NPC is unapproachable by classical
      structure determination techniques and requires a joint effort of complementary
      methods. Whereas bottom-up approaches rely on biochemical interaction studies and
      crystal-structure determination of NPC components, top-down approaches attempt to
      determine the structure of the intact NPC in situ. Recently, both approaches have
      converged, thereby bridging the resolution gap from the higher-order scaffold
      structure to near-atomic resolution and opening the door for structure-guided
      experimental interrogations of NPC function.

TI  - The transcription factor ERG recruits CCR4-NOT to control mRNA decay and mitotic 
      progression.
PG  - 663-72
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3243 [doi]
AB  - Control of mRNA levels, a fundamental aspect in the regulation of gene
      expression, is achieved through a balance between mRNA synthesis and decay.
      E26-related gene (Erg) proteins are canonical transcription factors whose
      previously described functions are confined to the control of mRNA synthesis.
      Here, we report that ERG also regulates gene expression by affecting mRNA
      stability and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this function in human
      cells. ERG is recruited to mRNAs via interaction with the RNA-binding protein
      RBPMS, and it promotes mRNA decay by binding CNOT2, a component of the CCR4-NOT
      deadenylation complex. Transcriptome-wide mRNA stability analysis revealed that
      ERG controls the degradation of a subset of mRNAs highly connected to Aurora
      signaling, whose decay during S phase is necessary for mitotic progression. Our
      data indicate that control of gene expression by mammalian transcription factors 
      may follow a more complex scheme than previously anticipated, integrating mRNA
      synthesis and degradation.

      liver CSC self-renewal.
PG  - 631-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3235 [doi]
AB  - Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may contribute to the high rate of recurrence and 
      heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying their self-renewal and differentiation remain largely
      unknown. Through analysis of transcriptome microarray data, we identified a long 
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) called lnc-beta-Catm, which is highly expressed in human
      HCC tumors and liver CSCs. We found that lnc-beta-Catm is required for
      self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumor propagation in mice. lnc-beta-Catm
      associates with beta-catenin and the methyltransferase EZH2, thereby promoting
      beta-catenin methylation. Methylation suppresses the ubiquitination of
      beta-catenin and promotes its stability, thus leading to activation of
      Wnt-beta-catenin signaling. Accordingly, the expression of lnc-beta-Catm, EZH2
      and Wnt-beta-catenin targets is positively correlated with cancer severity and
      prognosis of people with HCC.

AB  - Challenges in determining the structures of heterogeneous and dynamic protein
      complexes have greatly hampered past efforts to obtain a mechanistic
      understanding of many important biological processes. One such process is
      chaperone-assisted protein folding. Obtaining structural ensembles of
      chaperone-substrate complexes would ultimately reveal how chaperones help
      proteins fold into their native state. To address this problem, we devised a new 
      structural biology approach based on X-ray crystallography, termed residual
      electron and anomalous density (READ). READ enabled us to visualize even sparsely
      populated conformations of the substrate protein immunity protein 7 (Im7) in
      complex with the Escherichia coli chaperone Spy, and to capture a series of
      snapshots depicting the various folding states of Im7 bound to Spy. The ensemble 
      shows that Spy-associated Im7 samples conformations ranging from unfolded to
      partially folded to native-like states and reveals how a substrate can explore
      its folding landscape while being bound to a chaperone.

TI  - Human BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase activity counteracts chromatin barriers to DNA
      resection.
PG  - 647-55
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3236 [doi]
AB  - The opposing activities of 53BP1 and BRCA1 influence pathway choice in DNA
      double-strand-break repair. How BRCA1 counteracts the inhibitory effect of 53BP1 
      on DNA resection and homologous recombination is unknown. Here we identify the
      site of BRCA1-BARD1 required for priming ubiquitin transfer from E2 approximately
      ubiquitin and demonstrate that BRCA1-BARD1's ubiquitin ligase activity is
      required for repositioning 53BP1 on damaged chromatin. We confirm H2A
      ubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1 and show that an H2A-ubiquitin fusion protein
      promotes DNA resection and repair in BARD1-deficient cells. BRCA1-BARD1's
      function in homologous recombination requires the chromatin remodeler SMARCAD1.
      SMARCAD1 binding to H2A-ubiquitin and optimal localization to sites of damage and
      activity in DNA repair requires its ubiquitin-binding CUE domains. SMARCAD1 is
      required for 53BP1 repositioning, and the need for SMARCAD1 in olaparib or
      camptothecin resistance is alleviated by 53BP1 loss. Thus, BRCA1-BARD1 ligase
      activity and subsequent SMARCAD1-dependent chromatin remodeling are critical
      regulators of DNA repair.

PG  - 494-502
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3214 [doi]
AB  - Ion channels gated by neurotransmitters are present across metazoans, in which
      they are essential for brain function, sensation and locomotion; closely related 
      homologs are also found in bacteria. Structures of eukaryotic pentameric
      cysteine-loop (Cys-loop) receptors and tetrameric ionotropic glutamate receptors 
      in multiple functional states have recently become available. Here, I describe
      how these studies relate to established ideas regarding receptor activation and
      how they have enabled decades' worth of functional work to be pieced together,
      thus allowing previously puzzling aspects of receptor activity to be understood.

TI  - Mechanistic diversity in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.
PG  - 487-93

AB  - ABC transporters catalyze transport reactions, such as the high-affinity uptake
      of micronutrients into bacteria and the export of cytotoxic compounds from
      mammalian cells. Crystal structures of ABC domains and full transporters have
      provided a framework for formulating reaction mechanisms of ATP-driven substrate 
      transport, but recent studies have suggested remarkable mechanistic diversity
      within this protein family. This review evaluates the differing mechanistic
      proposals and outlines future directions for the exploration of
      ABC-transporter-catalyzed reactions.

PG  - 475-80

AB  - The computational design of alpha-helical membrane proteins is still in its
      infancy but has already made great progress. De novo design allows stable,
      specific and active minimal oligomeric systems to be obtained. Computational
      reengineering can improve the stability and function of naturally occurring
      membrane proteins. Currently, the major hurdle for the field is the experimental 
      characterization of the designs. The emergence of new structural methods for
      membrane proteins will accelerate progress.

AB  - Membrane-protein NMR occupies a unique niche for determining structures,
      assessing dynamics, examining folding, and studying the binding of lipids,
      ligands and drugs to membrane proteins. However, NMR analyses of membrane
      proteins also face special challenges that are not encountered with soluble
      proteins, including sample preparation, size limitation, spectral crowding and
      sparse data accumulation. This Perspective provides a snapshot of current
      achievements, future opportunities and possible limitations in this rapidly
      developing field.

AB  - Membrane proteins have long presented a challenge to biochemical and functional
      studies. In the absence of a bilayer environment, individual proteins and
      critical macromolecular complexes may be insoluble and may display altered or
      absent activities. Nanodisc technology provides important advantages for the
      isolation, purification, structural resolution and functional characterization of
      membrane proteins. In addition, the ability to precisely control the nanodisc
      composition provides a nanoscale membrane surface for investigating molecular
      recognition events.

TI  - Mechanism of extracellular ion exchange and binding-site occlusion in a
      sodium/calcium exchanger.

AB  - Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers use the Na(+) electrochemical gradient across the plasma 
      membrane to extrude intracellular Ca(2+) and play a central role in Ca(2+)
      homeostasis. Here, we elucidate their mechanisms of extracellular ion recognition
      and exchange through a structural analysis of the exchanger from Methanococcus
      jannaschii (NCX_Mj) bound to Na(+), Ca(2+) or Sr(2+) in various occupancies and
      in an apo state. This analysis defines the binding mode and relative affinity of 
      these ions, establishes the structural basis for the anticipated 3:1
      Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange stoichiometry and reveals the conformational changes at the
      onset of the alternating-access transport mechanism. An independent analysis of
      the dynamics and conformational free-energy landscape of NCX_Mj in different
      ion-occupancy states, based on enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations, 
      demonstrates that the crystal structures reflect mechanistically relevant,
      interconverting conformations. These calculations also reveal the mechanism by
      which the outward-to-inward transition is controlled by the ion occupancy,
      thereby explaining the emergence of strictly coupled Na(+)/Ca(2+) antiport.

TI  - Structure of the Dcp2-Dcp1 mRNA-decapping complex in the activated conformation.
PG  - 574-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3232 [doi]
AB  - The removal of the mRNA 5' cap (decapping) by Dcp2 shuts down translation and
      commits mRNA to full degradation. Dcp2 activity is enhanced by activator proteins
      such as Dcp1 and Edc1. However, owing to conformational flexibility, the active
      conformation of Dcp2 and the mechanism of decapping activation have remained
      unknown. Here, we report a 1.6-A-resolution crystal structure of the
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dcp2-Dcp1 heterodimer in an unprecedented conformation 
      that is tied together by an intrinsically disordered peptide from Edc1. In this
      ternary complex, an unforeseen rotation of the Dcp2 catalytic domain allows
      residues from both Dcp2 and Dcp1 to cooperate in RNA binding, thus explaining
      decapping activation by increased substrate affinity. The architecture of the
      Dcp2-Dcp1-Edc1 complex provides a rationale for the conservation of a sequence
      motif in Edc1 that is also present in unrelated decapping activators, thus
      indicating that the presently described mechanism of decapping activation is
      evolutionarily conserved.

TI  - Functional interplay between MSL1 and CDK7 controls RNA polymerase II Ser5
      phosphorylation.
PG  - 580-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3233 [doi]
AB  - Proper gene expression requires coordinated interplay among transcriptional
      coactivators, transcription factors and the general transcription machinery. We
      report here that MSL1, a central component of the dosage compensation complex in 
      Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, displays evolutionarily conserved
      sex-independent binding to promoters. Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal a
      functional interaction of MSL1 with CDK7, a subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase 
      (CAK) complex of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Importantly, MSL1
      depletion leads to decreased phosphorylation of Ser5 of RNA polymerase II. In
      addition, we demonstrate that MSL1 is a phosphoprotein, and transgenic flies
      expressing MSL1 phosphomutants show mislocalization of the histone
      acetyltransferase MOF and histone H4 K16 acetylation, thus ultimately causing
      male lethality due to a failure of dosage compensation. We propose that, by
      virtue of its interaction with components of the general transcription machinery,
      MSL1 exists in different phosphorylation states, thereby modulating transcription
      in flies.

TI  - BRD4 is a histone acetyltransferase that evicts nucleosomes from chromatin.
PG  - 540-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3228 [doi]
AB  - Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is a chromatin-binding protein implicated in cancer 
      and autoimmune diseases that functions as a scaffold for transcription factors at
      promoters and super-enhancers. Although chromatin decompaction and
      transcriptional activation of target genes are associated with BRD4 binding, the 
      mechanisms involved are unknown. We report that BRD4 is a histone
      acetyltransferase (HAT) that acetylates histones H3 and H4 with a pattern
      distinct from those of other HATs. Both mouse and human BRD4 have intrinsic HAT
      activity. Importantly, BRD4 acetylates H3 K122, a residue critical for nucleosome
      stability, thus resulting in nucleosome eviction and chromatin decompaction.
      Nucleosome clearance by BRD4 occurs genome wide, including at its targets MYC,
      FOS and AURKB (Aurora B kinase), resulting in increased transcription. These
      findings suggest a model wherein BRD4 actively links chromatin structure and
      transcription: it mediates chromatin decompaction by acetylating and evicting
      nucleosomes at target genes, thereby activating transcription.

TI  - Allosteric inhibition of antiapoptotic MCL-1.
PG  - 600-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3223 [doi]
AB  - MCL-1 is an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein that has emerged as a major
      pathogenic factor in human cancer. Like BCL-2, MCL-1 bears a surface groove whose
      function is to sequester the BH3 killer domains of proapoptotic BCL-2 family
      members, a mechanism harnessed by cancer cells to establish formidable apoptotic 
      blockades. Although drugging the BH3-binding groove has been achieved for BCL-2, 
      translating this approach to MCL-1 has been challenging. Here, we report an
      alternative mechanism for MCL-1 inhibition by small-molecule covalent
      modification of C286 at a new interaction site distant from the BH3-binding
      groove. Our structure-function analyses revealed that the BH3 binding capacity of
      MCL-1 and its suppression of BAX are impaired by molecular engagement, a
      phenomenon recapitulated by C286W mutagenic mimicry in vitro and in mouse cells. 
      Thus, we characterize an allosteric mechanism for disrupting the antiapoptotic
      BH3 binding activity of MCL-1, informing a new strategy for disarming MCL-1 in
      cancer.

TI  - Lactase nonpersistence is directed by DNA-variation-dependent epigenetic aging.

AB  - The inability to digest lactose, due to lactase nonpersistence, is a common trait
      in adult mammals, except in certain human populations that exhibit lactase
      persistence. It is not known how the lactase gene is dramatically downregulated
      with age in most individuals but remains active in some individuals. We performed
      a comprehensive epigenetic study of human and mouse small intestines, by using
      chromosome-wide DNA-modification profiling and targeted bisulfite sequencing.
      Epigenetically controlled regulatory elements accounted for the differences in
      lactase mRNA levels among individuals, intestinal cell types and species. We
      confirmed the importance of these regulatory elements in modulating lactase mRNA 
      levels by using CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletions. Genetic factors contribute to
      epigenetic changes occurring with age at the regulatory elements, because
      lactase-persistence and lactase-nonpersistence DNA haplotypes demonstrated
      markedly different epigenetic aging. Thus, genetic factors enable a gradual
      accumulation of epigenetic changes with age, thereby influencing phenotypic
      outcome.

      spliceosome evolution.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3224 [doi]
AB  - Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are essential in many
      organisms, and they have been hypothesized to share a common evolutionary
      ancestor with the spliceosome. Although structural similarity of RNA components
      supports this connection, it is of interest to determine whether associated
      protein factors also share an evolutionary heritage. Here we present the crystal 
      structures of reverse transcriptase (RT) domains from two group II intron-encoded
      proteins (maturases) from Roseburia intestinalis and Eubacterium rectale,
      obtained at 1.2-A and 2.1-A resolution, respectively. These domains are more
      similar in architecture to the spliceosomal Prp8 RT-like domain than to any other
      RTs, and they share substantial similarity with flaviviral RNA polymerases. The
      RT domain itself is sufficient for binding intron RNA with high affinity and
      specificity, and it is contained within an active RT enzyme. These studies
      provide a foundation for understanding structure-function relationships within
      group II intron-maturase complexes.

TI  - Structure of a group II intron in complex with its reverse transcriptase.
PG  - 549-57
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3220 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial group II introns are large catalytic RNAs related to nuclear
      spliceosomal introns and eukaryotic retrotransposons. They self-splice, yielding 
      mature RNA, and integrate into DNA as retroelements. A fully active group II
      intron forms a ribonucleoprotein complex comprising the intron ribozyme and an
      intron-encoded protein that performs multiple activities including reverse
      transcription, in which intron RNA is copied into the DNA target. Here we report 
      cryo-EM structures of an endogenously spliced Lactococcus lactis group IIA intron
      in its ribonucleoprotein complex form at 3.8-A resolution and in its
      protein-depleted form at 4.5-A resolution, revealing functional coordination of
      the intron RNA with the protein. Remarkably, the protein structure reveals a
      close relationship between the reverse transcriptase catalytic domain and
      telomerase, whereas the active splicing center resembles the spliceosomal Prp8
      protein. These extraordinary similarities hint at intricate ancestral
      relationships and provide new insights into splicing and retromobility.

TI  - Multilayered proteomics reveals molecular switches dictating ligand-dependent
      EGFR trafficking.
PG  - 608-18
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3218 [doi]
AB  - A fascinating conundrum in cell signaling is how stimulation of the same receptor
      tyrosine kinase with distinct ligands generates specific outcomes. To decipher
      the functional selectivity of EGF and TGF-alpha, which induce epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) degradation and recycling, respectively, we devised an
      integrated multilayered proteomics approach (IMPA). We analyzed dynamic changes
      in the receptor interactome, ubiquitinome, phosphoproteome, and late proteome in 
      response to both ligands in human cells by quantitative MS and identified 67
      proteins regulated at multiple levels. We identified RAB7 phosphorylation and RCP
      recruitment to EGFR as switches for EGF and TGF-alpha outputs, controlling
      receptor trafficking, signaling duration, proliferation, and migration. By
      manipulating RCP levels or phosphorylation of RAB7 in EGFR-positive cancer cells,
      we were able to switch a TGF-alpha-mediated response to an EGF-like response or
      vice versa as EGFR trafficking was rerouted. We propose IMPA as an approach to
      uncover fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms in cell signaling.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles during tumorigenesis by
      functioning as scaffolds that regulate protein-protein, protein-DNA or
      protein-RNA interactions. Using a clinically guided genetic screening approach,
      we identified lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1 (LINP1), which
      is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer. We found that LINP1
      enhances repair of DNA double-strand breaks by serving as a scaffold linking Ku80
      and DNA-PKcs, thereby coordinating the NHEJ pathway. Importantly, blocking LINP1,
      which is regulated by p53 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, 
      increases the sensitivity of the tumor-cell response to radiotherapy in breast
      cancer.

PG  - 531-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3212 [doi]
AB  - The herpesvirus capsid is a complex protein assembly that includes hundreds of
      copies of four major subunits and lesser numbers of several minor proteins, all
      of which are essential for infectivity. Cryo-electron microscopy is uniquely
      suited for studying interactions that govern the assembly and function of such
      large functional complexes. Here we report two high-quality capsid structures,
      from human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the animal pseudorabies virus 
      (PRV), imaged inside intact virions at ~7-A resolution. From these, we developed 
      a complete model of subunit and domain organization and identified extensive
      networks of subunit contacts that underpin capsid stability and form a pathway
      that may signal the completion of DNA packaging from the capsid interior to outer
      surface, thereby initiating nuclear egress. Differences in the folding and
      orientation of subunit domains between herpesvirus capsids suggest that common
      elements have been modified for specific functions.

TI  - Crystal structure of the prefusion surface glycoprotein of the prototypic
      arenavirus LCMV.
PG  - 513-521
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3210 [doi]
AB  - Arenaviruses exist worldwide and can cause hemorrhagic fever and neurologic
      disease. A single glycoprotein expressed on the viral surface mediates entry into
      target cells. This glycoprotein, termed GPC, contains a membrane-associated
      signal peptide, a receptor-binding subunit termed GP1 and a fusion-mediating
      subunit termed GP2. Although GPC is a critical target of antibodies and vaccines,
      the structure of the metastable GP1-GP2 prefusion complex has remained elusive
      for all arenaviruses. Here we describe the crystal structure of the fully
      glycosylated prefusion GP1-GP2 complex of the prototypic arenavirus LCMV at 3.5
      A. This structure reveals the conformational changes that the arenavirus
      glycoprotein must undergo to cause fusion and illustrates the fusion regions and 
      potential oligomeric states.

PG  - 369-77
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3208 [doi]
AB  - The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific scaffold that links
      homologous chromosomes from end to end during meiotic prophase and is required
      for the formation of meiotic crossovers. Assembly of SC components is regulated
      by a combination of associated nonstructural proteins and post-translational
      modifications, such as SUMOylation, which together coordinate the timing between 
      homologous chromosome pairing, double-strand-break formation and recombination.
      In addition, transcriptional and translational control mechanisms ensure the
      timely disassembly of the SC after crossover resolution and before chromosome
      segregation at anaphase I.

AB  - The association of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections with microcephaly has resulted in
      an ongoing public-health emergency. Here we report the crystal structure of a
      C-terminal fragment of ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a major
      host-interaction molecule that functions in flaviviral replication, pathogenesis 
      and immune evasion. Comparison with West Nile and dengue virus NS1 structures
      reveals conserved features but diverse electrostatic characteristics at
      host-interaction interfaces, thus possibly implying different modes of flavivirus
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Mammalian elongation factor 4 regulates mitochondrial translation essential for
      spermatogenesis.
PG  - 441-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3206 [doi]
AB  - Elongation factor 4 (EF4) is a key quality-control factor in translation. Despite
      its high conservation throughout evolution, EF4 deletion in various organisms has
      not yielded a distinct phenotype. Here we report that genetic ablation of
      mitochondrial EF4 (mtEF4) in mice causes testis-specific dysfunction in oxidative
      phosphorylation, leading to male infertility. Deletion of mtEF4 accelerated
      mitochondrial translation at the cost of producing unstable proteins. Somatic
      tissues overcame this defect by activating mechanistic (mammalian) target of
      rapamycin (mTOR), thereby increasing rates of cytoplasmic translation to match
      rates of mitochondrial translation. However, in spermatogenic cells, the mTOR
      pathway was downregulated as part of the developmental program, and the resulting
      inability to compensate for accelerated mitochondrial translation caused
      cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We detected the same phenotype and molecular
      defects in germline-specific mtEF4-knockout mice. Thus, our study demonstrates
      cross-talk between mtEF4-dependent quality control in mitochondria and
      cytoplasmic mTOR signaling.

TI  - Structures of human ADAR2 bound to dsRNA reveal base-flipping mechanism and basis
      for site selectivity.
PG  - 426-33
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3203 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are editing enzymes that convert
      adenosine to inosine in duplex RNA, a modification reaction with wide-ranging
      consequences in RNA function. Understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism, the
      origin of editing-site selectivity, and the effect of mutations is limited by the
      lack of high-resolution structural data for complexes of ADARs bound to substrate
      RNAs. Here we describe four crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase
      domain bound to RNA duplexes bearing a mimic of the deamination reaction
      intermediate. These structures, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and
      RNA-modification experiments, explain the basis of the ADAR deaminase domain's
      dsRNA specificity, its base-flipping mechanism, and its nearest-neighbor
      preferences. In addition, we identified an ADAR2-specific RNA-binding loop near
      the enzyme active site, thus rationalizing differences in selectivity observed
      between different ADARs. Finally, our results provide a structural framework for 
      understanding the effects of ADAR mutations associated with human disease.

TI  - Resolving individual steps of Okazaki-fragment maturation at a millisecond
      timescale.
PG  - 402-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3207 [doi]
AB  - DNA polymerase delta (Pol delta) is responsible for elongation and maturation of 
      Okazaki fragments. Pol delta and the flap endonuclease FEN1, coordinated by the
      PCNA clamp, remove RNA primers and produce ligatable nicks. We studied this
      process in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae machinery at millisecond resolution.
      During elongation, PCNA increased the Pol delta catalytic rate by >30-fold. When 
      Pol delta invaded double-stranded RNA-DNA representing unmatured Okazaki
      fragments, the incorporation rate of each nucleotide decreased successively to
      10-20% that of the preceding nucleotide. Thus, the nascent flap acts as a
      progressive molecular brake on the polymerase, and consequently FEN1 cuts
      predominantly single-nucleotide flaps. Kinetic and enzyme-trapping experiments
      support a model in which a stable PCNA-DNA-Pol delta-FEN1 complex moves
      processively through iterative steps of nick translation, ultimately completely
      removing primer RNA. Finally, whereas elongation rates are under dynamic dNTP
      control, maturation rates are buffered against changes in dNTP concentrations.

TI  - BTG4 is a meiotic cell cycle-coupled maternal-zygotic-transition licensing factor
      in oocytes.
PG  - 387-94
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3204 [doi]
AB  - The mRNAs stored in oocytes undergo general decay during the maternal-zygotic
      transition (MZT), and their stability is tightly interconnected with meiotic
      cell-cycle progression. However, the factors that trigger decay of maternal mRNA 
      and couple this event to oocyte meiotic maturation remain elusive. Here, we
      identified B-cell translocation gene-4 (BTG4) as an MZT licensing factor in mice.
      BTG4 bridged CNOT7, a catalytic subunit of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase, to eIF4E, a 
      key translation initiation factor, and facilitated decay of maternal mRNA.
      Btg4-null females produced morphologically normal oocytes but were infertile,
      owing to early developmental arrest. The intrinsic MAP kinase cascade in oocytes 
      triggered translation of Btg4 mRNA stored in fully grown oocytes by targeting the
      3' untranslated region, thereby coupling CCR4-NOT deadenylase-mediated decay of
      maternal mRNA with oocyte maturation and fertilization. This is a key step in
      oocyte cytoplasmic maturation that determines the developmental potential of
      mammalian embryos.

TI  - Molecular basis of caspase-1 polymerization and its inhibition by a new capping
      mechanism.
PG  - 416-25
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3199 [doi]
AB  - Inflammasomes are cytosolic caspase-1-activation complexes that sense intrinsic
      and extrinsic danger signals, and trigger inflammatory responses and pyroptotic
      cell death. Homotypic interactions among Pyrin domains and caspase recruitment
      domains (CARDs) in inflammasome-complex components mediate oligomerization into
      filamentous assemblies. Several cytosolic proteins consisting of only interaction
      domains exert inhibitory effects on inflammasome assembly. In this study, we
      determined the structure of the human caspase-1 CARD domain (caspase-1(CARD))
      filament by cryo-electron microscopy and investigated the biophysical properties 
      of two caspase-1-like CARD-only proteins: human inhibitor of CARD (INCA or
      CARD17) and ICEBERG (CARD18). Our results reveal that INCA caps caspase-1
      filaments, thereby exerting potent inhibition with low-nanomolar Ki on
      caspase-1(CARD) polymerization in vitro and inflammasome activation in cells.
      Whereas caspase-1(CARD) uses six complementary surfaces of three types for
      filament assembly, INCA is defective in two of the six interfaces and thus
      terminates the caspase-1 filament.

TI  - Structural basis for specific inhibition of Autotaxin by a DNA aptamer.
PG  - 395-401
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3200 [doi]
AB  - ATX is a plasma lysophospholipase D that hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)
      and produces lysophosphatidic acid. To date, no ATX-inhibition-mediated treatment
      strategies for human diseases have been established. Here, we report anti-ATX DNA
      aptamers that inhibit ATX with high specificity and efficacy. We solved the
      crystal structure of ATX in complex with the anti-ATX aptamer RB011, at 2.0-A
      resolution. RB011 binds in the vicinity of the active site through base-specific 
      interactions, thus preventing the access of the choline moiety of LPC substrates.
      Using the structural information, we developed the modified anti-ATX DNA aptamer 
      RB014, which exhibited in vivo efficacy in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
      mouse model. Our findings reveal the structural basis for the specific inhibition
      of ATX by the anti-ATX aptamer and highlight the therapeutic potential of
      anti-ATX aptamers for the treatment of human diseases, such as pulmonary
      fibrosis.

TI  - SIRT6 deacetylates H3K18ac at pericentric chromatin to prevent mitotic errors and
      cellular senescence.
PG  - 434-40
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3202 [doi]
AB  - Pericentric heterochromatin silencing at mammalian centromeres is essential for
      mitotic fidelity and genomic stability. Defective pericentric silencing has been 
      observed in senescent cells, aging tissues, and mammalian tumors, but the
      underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of these defects are unclear.
      Here, we uncover an essential role of the human SIRT6 enzyme in pericentric
      transcriptional silencing, and we show that this function protects against
      mitotic defects, genomic instability, and cellular senescence. At pericentric
      heterochromatin, SIRT6 promotes deacetylation of a new substrate, residue K18 of 
      histone H3 (H3K18), and inactivation of SIRT6 in cells leads to H3K18
      hyperacetylation and aberrant accumulation of pericentric transcripts.
      Strikingly, depletion of these transcripts through RNA interference rescues the
      mitotic and senescence phenotypes of SIRT6-deficient cells. Together, our
      findings reveal a new function for SIRT6 and regulation of acetylated H3K18 at
      heterochromatin, and demonstrate the pathogenic role of deregulated pericentric
      transcription in aging- and cancer-related cellular dysfunction.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3192 [doi]
AB  - Antisense long noncoding RNAs (ASlncRNAs) have been implicated in regulating gene
      expression in response to physiological cues. However, little is known about the 
      evolutionary dynamics of ASlncRNA and what underlies the evolution of their
      expression. Here, using budding yeast Saccharomyces spp. and Naumovozyma
      castellii as models, we show that ASlncRNA repertoires have expanded since the
      loss of RNA interference (RNAi), in terms of their expression levels, their
      lengths and their degree of overlap with coding genes. Furthermore, we show that 
      RNAi is inhibitory to ASlncRNA transcriptomes and that increased expression of
      ASlncRNAs in the presence of RNAi is deleterious to N. castellii, which has
      retained RNAi. Together, our results suggest that the loss of RNAi had
      substantial effects on the genome-wide increase in expression of ASlncRNAs during
      the evolution of budding yeasts.

AB  - The thermodynamics and kinetics of the aggregation of sickle-cell hemoglobin into
      fibers have been studied in great detail under a wide range of solution
      conditions. The stability of the fiber is measured by the solubility; the
      kinetics is characterized by a delay before the appearance of fibers. A review of
      data in the literature shows that there is no correlation of the delay time with 
      fiber stability and only a weak correlation with the initial protein
      concentration. There is, however, a striking collapse of all the data onto a
      single universal curve when the delay time is plotted versus the supersaturation,
      which is the ratio of the initial protein concentration to the solubility,
      expressed as activities. Collapse onto the same universal curve is also obtained 
      when using delay times calculated from the double-nucleation theoretical model.

TI  - Structural basis for therapeutic inhibition of complement C5.
PG  - 378-86
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3196 [doi]
AB  - Activation of complement C5 generates the potent anaphylatoxin C5a and leads to
      pathogen lysis, inflammation and cell damage. The therapeutic potential of C5
      inhibition has been demonstrated by eculizumab, one of the world's most expensive
      drugs. However, the mechanism of C5 activation by C5 convertases remains elusive,
      thus limiting development of therapeutics. Here we identify and characterize a
      new protein family of tick-derived C5 inhibitors. Structures of C5 in complex
      with the new inhibitors, the phase I and phase II inhibitor OmCI, or an
      eculizumab Fab reveal three distinct binding sites on C5 that all prevent
      activation of C5. The positions of the inhibitor-binding sites and the ability of
      all three C5-inhibitor complexes to competitively inhibit the C5 convertase
      conflict with earlier steric-inhibition models, thus suggesting that a priming
      event is needed for activation.

      alpha-synuclein.
PG  - 409-15
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3194 [doi]
AB  - Misfolded alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils are the principal components of Lewy
      bodies and neurites, hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). We present a
      high-resolution structure of an alpha-synuclein fibril, in a form that induces
      robust pathology in primary neuronal culture, determined by solid-state NMR
      spectroscopy and validated by EM and X-ray fiber diffraction. Over 200 unique
      long-range distance restraints define a consensus structure with common amyloid
      features including parallel, in-register beta-sheets and hydrophobic-core
      residues, and with substantial complexity arising from diverse structural
      features including an intermolecular salt bridge, a glutamine ladder, close
      backbone interactions involving small residues, and several steric zippers
      stabilizing a new orthogonal Greek-key topology. These characteristics contribute
      to the robust propagation of this fibril form, as supported by the structural
      similarity of early-onset-PD mutants. The structure provides a framework for
      understanding the interactions of alpha-synuclein with other proteins and small
      molecules, to aid in PD diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Choreography of molecular movements during ribosome progression along mRNA.
PG  - 342-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3193 [doi]
AB  - During translation elongation, ribosome translocation along an mRNA entails
      rotations of the ribosomal subunits, swiveling motions of the small subunit (SSU)
      head and stepwise movements of the tRNAs together with the mRNA. Here, we
      reconstructed the choreography of the collective motions of the Escherichia coli 
      ribosome during translocation promoted by elongation factor EF-G, by recording
      the fluorescence signatures of nine different reporters placed on both ribosomal 
      subunits, tRNA and mRNA. We captured an early forward swiveling of the SSU head
      taking place while the SSU body rotates in the opposite, clockwise direction.
      Backward swiveling of the SSU head starts upon tRNA translocation and continues
      until the post-translocation state is reached. This work places structures of
      translocation intermediates along a time axis and unravels principles of the
      motions of macromolecular machines.

TI  - Molecular basis and specificity of H2A.Z-H2B recognition and deposition by the
      histone chaperone YL1.
PG  - 309-16
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3189 [doi]
AB  - H2A.Z, a widely conserved histone variant, is evicted from chromatin by the
      histone chaperone ANP32E. However, to date, no deposition chaperone for H2A.Z is 
      known in metazoans. Here, we identify YL1 as a specific H2A.Z-deposition
      chaperone. The 2.7-A-resolution crystal structure of the human YL1-H2A.Z-H2B
      complex shows that YL1 binding, similarly to ANP32E binding, triggers an
      extension of the H2A.Z alphaC helix. The interaction with YL1 is, however, more
      extensive and includes both the extended acidic patch and the entire DNA-binding 
      surface of H2A.Z-H2B. Substitution of only four amino acid residues of H2A is
      sufficient for the formation of an H2A.Z-like interface specifically recognized
      by YL1. Collectively, our data reveal the molecular basis of H2A.Z-specific
      recognition by YL1 and shed light on the mechanism of H2A.Z transfer to the
      nucleosome by the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes SRCAP and
      P400-TIP60.

TI  - Axin cancer mutants form nanoaggregates to rewire the Wnt signaling network.
PG  - 324-32
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3191 [doi]
AB  - Signaling cascades depend on scaffold proteins that regulate the assembly of
      multiprotein complexes. Missense mutations in scaffold proteins are frequent in
      human cancer, but their relevance and mode of action are poorly understood. Here 
      we show that cancer point mutations in the scaffold protein Axin derail Wnt
      signaling and promote tumor growth in vivo through a gain-of-function mechanism. 
      The effect is conserved for both the human and Drosophila proteins. Mutated Axin 
      forms nonamyloid nanometer-scale aggregates decorated with disordered tentacles, 
      which 'rewire' the Axin interactome. Importantly, the tumor-suppressor activity
      of both the human and Drosophila Axin cancer mutants is rescued by preventing
      aggregation of a single nonconserved segment. Our findings establish a new
      paradigm for misregulation of signaling in cancer and show that targeting
      aggregation-prone stretches in mutated scaffolds holds attractive potential for
      cancer treatment.

TI  - Structural basis of H2A.Z recognition by SRCAP chromatin-remodeling subunit YL1.
PG  - 317-23
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3190 [doi]
AB  - Histone variant H2A.Z, a universal mark of dynamic nucleosomes flanking gene
      promoters and enhancers, is incorporated into chromatin by SRCAP (SWR1), an
      ATP-dependent, multicomponent chromatin-remodeling complex. The YL1 (Swc2)
      subunit of SRCAP (SWR1) plays an essential role in H2A.Z recognition, but how it 
      achieves this has been unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the
      H2A.Z-binding domain of Drosophila melanogaster YL1 (dYL1-Z) in complex with an
      H2A.Z-H2B dimer at 1.9-A resolution. The dYL1-Z domain adopts a new whip-like
      structure that wraps over H2A.Z-H2B, and preferential recognition is largely
      conferred by three residues in loop 2, the hyperacidic patch and the extended
      alphaC helix of H2A.Z. Importantly, this domain is essential for deposition of
      budding yeast H2A.Z in vivo and SRCAP (SWR1)-catalyzed histone H2A.Z replacement 
      in vitro. Our studies distinguish YL1-Z from known H2A.Z chaperones and suggest a
      hierarchical mechanism based on increasing binding affinity facilitating H2A.Z
      transfer from SRCAP (SWR1) to the nucleosome.

TI  - Inhibition of telomerase RNA decay rescues telomerase deficiency caused by
      dyskerin or PARN defects.

AB  - Mutations in the human telomerase RNA component (hTR), the telomerase
      ribonucleoprotein component dyskerin (DKC1) and the poly(A) RNase (PARN) can lead
      to reduced levels of hTR and to dyskeratosis congenita (DC). However, the enzymes
      and mechanisms responsible for hTR degradation are unknown. We demonstrate that
      defects in dyskerin binding lead to hTR degradation by PAPD5-mediated
      oligoadenylation, which promotes 3'-to-5' degradation by EXOSC10, as well as
      decapping and 5'-to-3' decay by the cytoplasmic DCP2 and XRN1 enzymes. PARN
      increased hTR levels by deadenylating hTR, thereby limiting its degradation by
      EXOSC10. Telomerase activity and proper hTR localization in dyskerin- or
      PARN-deficient cells were rescued by knockdown of DCP2 and/or EXOSC10. Prevention
      of hTR RNA decay also led to a rescue of localization of DC-associated hTR
      mutants. These results suggest that inhibition of RNA decay pathways might be a
      useful therapy for some telomere pathologies.

TI  - USP7 is a SUMO deubiquitinase essential for DNA replication.
PG  - 270-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3185 [doi]
AB  - Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like
      modifiers regulates DNA replication. We have previously shown that chromatin
      around replisomes is rich in SUMO and poor in Ub, whereas mature chromatin
      exhibits an opposite pattern. How this SUMO-rich, Ub-poor environment is
      maintained at sites of DNA replication in mammalian cells remains unexplored.
      Here we identify USP7 as a replisome-enriched SUMO deubiquitinase that is
      essential for DNA replication. By acting on SUMO and SUMOylated proteins, USP7
      counteracts their ubiquitination. Inhibition or genetic deletion of USP7 leads to
      the accumulation of Ub on SUMOylated proteins, which are displaced away from
      replisomes. Our findings provide a model explaining the differential accumulation
      of SUMO and Ub at replication forks and identify an essential role of USP7 in DNA
      replication that should be considered in the development of USP7 inhibitors as
      anticancer agents.

TI  - Structure and ligand-binding mechanism of the human OX1 and OX2 orexin receptors.
PG  - 293-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3183 [doi]
AB  - The orexin (also known as hypocretin) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
      regulate sleep and other behavioral functions in mammals, and are therapeutic
      targets for sleep and wake disorders. The human receptors hOX1R and hOX2R, which 
      are 64% identical in sequence, have overlapping but distinct physiological
      functions and potential therapeutic profiles. We determined structures of hOX1R
      bound to the OX1R-selective antagonist SB-674042 and the dual antagonist
      suvorexant at 2.8-A and 2.75-A resolution, respectively, and used molecular
      modeling to illuminate mechanisms of antagonist subtype selectivity between hOX1R
      and hOX2R. The hOX1R structures also reveal a conserved amphipathic alpha-helix, 
      in the extracellular N-terminal region, that interacts with orexin-A and is
      essential for high-potency neuropeptide activation at both receptors. The
      orexin-receptor crystal structures are valuable tools for the design and
      development of selective orexin-receptor antagonists and agonists.

TI  - Diverse functions of myosin VI elucidated by an isoform-specific alpha-helix
      domain.
PG  - 300-308
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3187 [doi]
AB  - Myosin VI functions in endocytosis and cell motility. Alternative splicing of
      myosin VI mRNA generates two distinct isoform types, myosin VI(short) and myosin 
      VI(long), which differ in the C-terminal region. Their physiological and
      pathological roles remain unknown. Here we identified an isoform-specific
      regulatory helix, named the alpha2-linker, that defines specific conformations
      and hence determines the target selectivity of human myosin VI. The presence of
      the alpha2-linker structurally defines a new clathrin-binding domain that is
      unique to myosin VI(long) and masks the known RRL interaction motif. This finding
      is relevant to ovarian cancer, in which alternative myosin VI splicing is
      aberrantly regulated, and exon skipping dictates cell addiction to myosin
      VI(short) in tumor-cell migration. The RRL interactor optineurin contributes to
      this process by selectively binding myosin VI(short). Thus, the alpha2-linker
      acts like a molecular switch that assigns myosin VI to distinct endocytic (myosin
      VI(long)) or migratory (myosin VI(short)) functional roles.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3182 [doi]
AB  - Although detailed pictures of ribosome structures are emerging, little is known
      about the structural and cotranslational folding properties of nascent
      polypeptide chains at the atomic level. Here we used solution-state NMR
      spectroscopy to define a structural ensemble of a ribosome-nascent chain complex 
      (RNC) formed during protein biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, in which a pair of 
      immunoglobulin-like domains adopts a folded N-terminal domain (FLN5) and a
      disordered but compact C-terminal domain (FLN6). To study how FLN5 acquires its
      native structure cotranslationally, we progressively shortened the RNC
      constructs. We found that the ribosome modulates the folding process, because the
      complete sequence of FLN5 emerged well beyond the tunnel before acquiring native 
      structure, whereas FLN5 in isolation folded spontaneously, even when truncated.
      This finding suggests that regulating structure acquisition during biosynthesis
      can reduce the probability of misfolding, particularly of homologous domains.

PG  - 333-41

AB  - Directional translocation of the ribosome through the mRNA open reading frame is 
      a critical determinant of translational fidelity. This process entails a complex 
      interplay of large-scale conformational changes within the actively translating
      particle, which together coordinate the movement of tRNA and mRNA substrates with
      respect to the large and small ribosomal subunits. Using pre-steady state,
      single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we tracked the
      nature and timing of these conformational events within the Escherichia coli
      ribosome from five structural perspectives. Our investigations revealed direct
      evidence of structurally and kinetically distinct late intermediates during
      substrate movement, whose resolution determines the rate of translocation. These 
      steps involve intramolecular events within the EF-G-GDP-bound ribosome, including
      exaggerated, reversible fluctuations of the small-subunit head domain, which
      ultimately facilitate peptidyl-tRNA's movement into its final post-translocation 
      position.

AB  - To empower experimentalists with a means for fast and comprehensive chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data analyses, we introduce an
      integrated computational environment, EaSeq. The software combines the
      exploratory power of genome browsers with an extensive set of interactive and
      user-friendly tools for genome-wide abstraction and visualization. It enables
      experimentalists to easily extract information and generate hypotheses from their
      own data and public genome-wide datasets. For demonstration purposes, we
      performed meta-analyses of public Polycomb ChIP-seq data and established a new
      screening approach to analyze more than 900 datasets from mouse embryonic stem
      cells for factors potentially associated with Polycomb recruitment. EaSeq, which 
      is freely available and works on a standard personal computer, can substantially 
      increase the throughput of many analysis workflows, facilitate transparency and
      reproducibility by automatically documenting and organizing analyses, and enable 
      a broader group of scientists to gain insights from ChIP-seq data.

TI  - Structure of the BAM complex and its implications for biogenesis of
      outer-membrane proteins.
PG  - 192-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3181 [doi]
AB  - In Gram-negative bacteria, the assembly of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins
      (OMPs) requires the beta-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM) complex. We determined
      the crystal structure of the 200-kDa BAM complex from Escherichia coli at 3.55-A 
      resolution. The structure revealed that the BAM complex assembles into a hat-like
      shape, in which the BamA beta-barrel domain forms the hat's crown embedded in the
      outer membrane, and its five polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains
      interact with the four lipoproteins BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE, thus forming the
      hat's brim in the periplasm. The assembly of the BAM complex creates a ring-like 
      apparatus beneath the BamA beta-barrel in the periplasm and a potential
      substrate-exit pore located at the outer membrane-periplasm interface. The
      complex structure suggests that the chaperone-bound OMP substrates may feed into 
      the chamber of the ring-like apparatus and insert into the outer membrane via the
      potential substrate-exit pore in an energy-independent manner.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3174 [doi]
AB  - A selective barrier formed by intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) nucleoporins 
      (Nups) allows transport receptor (TR)-facilitated translocation of
      signal-dependent cargos through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) of eukaryotic
      cells. However, the configuration of the FG-Nup barrier and its interactions with
      multiple TRs in native NPCs remain obscure. Here, we mapped the interaction sites
      of various TRs or FG segments within the FG-Nup barrier by using high-speed
      super-resolution microscopy and used these sites to reconstruct the
      three-dimensional tomography of the native barrier in the NPC. We found that each
      TR possesses a unique interaction zone within the FG-Nup barrier and that two
      major TRs, importin beta1 and Crm1, outcompete other TRs in binding FG Nups.
      Moreover, TRs may alter the tomography of the FG-Nup barrier and affect one
      another's pathways under circumstances of heavy competition.

TI  - 7SK-BAF axis controls pervasive transcription at enhancers.
PG  - 231-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3176 [doi]
AB  - RNA functions at enhancers remain mysterious. Here we show that the 7SK small
      nuclear RNA (snRNA) inhibits enhancer transcription by modulating nucleosome
      position. 7SK occupies enhancers and super enhancers genome wide in mouse and
      human cells, and it is required to limit enhancer-RNA initiation and synthesis in
      a manner distinct from promoter pausing. Clustered elements at super enhancers
      uniquely require 7SK to prevent convergent transcription and DNA-damage
      signaling. 7SK physically interacts with the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex,
      recruits BAF to enhancers and inhibits enhancer transcription by modulating
      chromatin structure. In turn, 7SK occupancy at enhancers coincides with that of
      Brd4 and is exquisitely sensitive to the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. Thus, 7SK
      uses distinct mechanisms to counteract the diverse consequences of pervasive
      transcription that distinguish super enhancers, enhancers and promoters.

TI  - CENP-C directs a structural transition of CENP-A nucleosomes mainly through
      sliding of DNA gyres.
PG  - 204-208
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3175 [doi]
AB  - The histone H3 variant CENP-A is incorporated into nucleosomes that mark
      centromere location. We have recently reported that CENP-A nucleosomes, compared 
      with their H3 counterparts, confer an altered nucleosome shape. Here, using a
      single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach with
      recombinant human histones and centromere DNA, we found that the nucleosome shape
      change directed by CENP-A is dominated by lateral passing of two DNA gyres (gyre 
      sliding). A nonhistone centromere protein, CENP-C, binds and reshapes the
      nucleosome, sliding the DNA gyres back to positions similar to those in canonical
      nucleosomes containing conventional histone H3. The model that we generated to
      explain the CENP-A-nucleosome transition provides an example of a shape change
      imposed by external binding proteins and has notable implications for
      understanding of the epigenetic basis of the faithful inheritance of centromere
      location on chromosomes.

TI  - Structure of the eukaryotic replicative CMG helicase suggests a pumpjack motion
      for translocation.
PG  - 217-24
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3170 [doi]
AB  - The CMG helicase is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7 and GINS. Here we report the
      structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CMG, determined by cryo-EM at a
      resolution of 3.7-4.8 A. The structure reveals that GINS and Cdc45 scaffold the N
      tier of the helicase while enabling motion of the AAA+ C tier. CMG exists in two 
      alternating conformations, compact and extended, thus suggesting that the
      helicase moves like an inchworm. The N-terminal regions of Mcm2-7, braced by
      Cdc45-GINS, form a rigid platform upon which the AAA+ C domains make longitudinal
      motions, nodding up and down like an oil-rig pumpjack attached to a stable
      platform. The Mcm ring is remodeled in CMG relative to the inactive Mcm2-7 double
      hexamer. The Mcm5 winged-helix domain is inserted into the central channel, thus 
      blocking entry of double-stranded DNA and supporting a steric-exclusion
      DNA-unwinding model.

TI  - A new MCM modification cycle regulates DNA replication initiation.
PG  - 209-16
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3173 [doi]
AB  - The MCM DNA helicase is a central regulatory target during genome replication.
      MCM is kept inactive during G1, and it initiates replication after being
      activated in S phase. During this transition, the only known chemical change to
      MCM is the gain of multisite phosphorylation that promotes cofactor recruitment. 
      Because replication initiation is intimately linked to multiple biological cues, 
      additional changes to MCM can provide further regulatory points. Here, we
      describe a yeast MCM SUMOylation cycle that regulates replication. MCM subunits
      undergo SUMOylation upon loading at origins in G1 before MCM phosphorylation. MCM
      SUMOylation levels then decline as MCM phosphorylation levels rise, thus
      suggesting an inhibitory role of MCM SUMOylation during replication. Indeed,
      increasing MCM SUMOylation impairs replication initiation, partly through
      promoting the recruitment of a phosphatase that decreases MCM phosphorylation and
      activation. We propose that MCM SUMOylation counterbalances kinase-based
      regulation, thus ensuring accurate control of replication initiation.

TI  - Domain-swap polymerization drives the self-assembly of the bacterial flagellar
      motor.
PG  - 197-203
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3172 [doi]
AB  - Large protein complexes assemble spontaneously, yet their subunits do not
      prematurely form unwanted aggregates. This paradox is epitomized in the bacterial
      flagellar motor, a sophisticated rotary motor and sensory switch consisting of
      hundreds of subunits. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli FliG, one of the 
      earliest-assembling flagellar motor proteins, forms ordered ring structures via
      domain-swap polymerization, which in other proteins has been associated with
      uncontrolled and deleterious protein aggregation. Solution structural data, in
      combination with in vivo biochemical cross-linking experiments and evolutionary
      covariance analysis, revealed that FliG exists predominantly as a monomer in
      solution but only as domain-swapped polymers in assembled flagellar motors. We
      propose a general structural and thermodynamic model for self-assembly, in which 
      a structural template controls assembly and shapes polymer formation into rings.

AB  - To fully understand the transport mechanism of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers, it is
      necessary to clearly establish the global rearrangements required to facilitate
      ion translocation. Currently, two different transport models have been proposed. 
      Some reports have suggested that structural isomerization is achieved through
      large elevator-like rearrangements similar to those seen in the structurally
      unrelated sodium-coupled glutamate-transporter homolog GltPh. Others have
      proposed that only small domain movements are required for ion exchange, and a
      conventional rocking-bundle model has been proposed instead. Here, to resolve
      these differences, we report atomic-resolution structures of the same Na(+)/H(+) 
      antiporter (NapA from Thermus thermophilus) in both outward- and inward-facing
      conformations. These data combined with cross-linking, molecular dynamics
      simulations and isothermal calorimetry suggest that Na(+)/H(+) antiporters
      provide alternating access to the ion-binding site by using elevator-like
      structural transitions.

TI  - The bacterial dicarboxylate transporter VcINDY uses a two-domain elevator-type
      mechanism.
PG  - 256-63
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3166 [doi]
AB  - Secondary transporters use alternating-access mechanisms to couple uphill
      substrate movement to downhill ion flux. Most known transporters use a 'rocking
      bundle' motion, wherein the protein moves around an immobile substrate-binding
      site. However, the glutamate-transporter homolog GltPh translocates its
      substrate-binding site vertically across the membrane, through an 'elevator'
      mechanism. Here, we used the 'repeat swap' approach to computationally predict
      the outward-facing state of the Na(+)/succinate transporter VcINDY, from Vibrio
      cholerae. Our model predicts a substantial elevator-like movement of VcINDY's
      substrate-binding site, with a vertical translation of ~15 A and a rotation of
      ~43 degrees . Our observation that multiple disulfide cross-links completely
      inhibit transport provides experimental confirmation of the model and
      demonstrates that such movement is essential. In contrast, cross-links across the
      VcINDY dimer interface preserve transport, thus revealing an absence of
      large-scale coupling between protomers.

TI  - A U1 snRNP-specific assembly pathway reveals the SMN complex as a versatile hub
      for RNP exchange.
PG  - 225-30
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3167 [doi]
AB  - Despite equal snRNP stoichiometry in spliceosomes, U1 snRNP (U1) is typically the
      most abundant vertebrate snRNP. Mechanisms regulating U1 overabundance and snRNP 
      repertoire are unknown. In Sm-core assembly, a key snRNP-biogenesis step mediated
      by the SMN complex, the snRNA-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) Gemin5 delivers 
      pre-snRNAs, which join SMN-Gemin2-recruited Sm proteins. We show that the human
      U1-specific RBP U1-70K can bridge pre-U1 to SMN-Gemin2-Sm, in a
      Gemin5-independent manner, thus establishing an additional and U1-exclusive Sm
      core-assembly pathway. U1-70K hijacks SMN-Gemin2-Sm, enhancing Sm-core assembly
      on U1s and inhibiting that on other snRNAs, thereby promoting U1 overabundance
      and regulating snRNP repertoire. SMN-Gemin2's ability to facilitate transactions 
      between different RBPs and RNAs explains its multi-RBP valency and the myriad
      transcriptome perturbations associated with SMN deficiency in neurodegenerative
      spinal muscular atrophy. We propose that SMN-Gemin2 is a versatile hub for RNP
      exchange that functions broadly in RNA metabolism.

TI  - Replication stress: getting back on track.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - The replication-stress response enables the DNA replication machinery to overcome
      DNA lesions or intrinsic replication-fork obstacles, and it is essential to
      ensure faithful transmission of genetic information to daughter cells. Multiple
      replication stress-response pathways have been identified in recent years, thus
      raising questions about the specific and possibly redundant functions of these
      pathways. Here, we review the emerging mechanisms of the replication-stress
      response in mammalian cells and consider how they may influence the dynamics of
      the core DNA replication complex.

TI  - EF4 disengages the peptidyl-tRNA CCA end and facilitates back-translocation on
      the 70S ribosome.
PG  - 125-31

AB  - EF4 catalyzes tRNA back-translocation through an unknown mechanism. We report
      cryo-EM structures of Escherichia coli EF4 in post- and pretranslocational
      ribosomes (Post- and Pre-EF4) at 3.7- and 3.2-A resolution, respectively. In
      Post-EF4, peptidyl-tRNA occupies the peptidyl (P) site, but the interaction
      between its CCA end and the P loop is disrupted. In Pre-EF4, the peptidyl-tRNA
      assumes a unique position near the aminoacyl (A) site, denoted the A site/EF4
      bound (A/4) site, with a large displacement at its acceptor arm. Mutagenesis
      analyses suggest that a specific region in the EF4 C-terminal domain (CTD)
      interferes with base-pairing between the peptidyl-tRNA 3'-CCA and the P loop,
      whereas the EF4 CTD enhances peptidyl-tRNA interaction at the A/4 site.
      Therefore, EF4 induces back-translocation by disengaging the tRNA's CCA end from 
      the peptidyl transferase center of the translating ribosome.

TI  - Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the TRPV2 ion channel.
PG  - 180-186
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3159 [doi]
AB  - Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) cation channels are polymodal
      sensors involved in a variety of physiological processes. TRPV2, a member of the 
      TRPV family, is regulated by temperature, by ligands, such as probenecid and
      cannabinoids, and by lipids. TRPV2 has been implicated in many biological
      functions, including somatosensation, osmosensation and innate immunity. Here we 
      present the atomic model of rabbit TRPV2 in its putative desensitized state, as
      determined by cryo-EM at a nominal resolution of approximately 4 A. In the TRPV2 
      structure, the transmembrane segment 6 (S6), which is involved in gate opening,
      adopts a conformation different from the one observed in TRPV1. Structural
      comparisons of TRPV1 and TRPV2 indicate that a rotation of the ankyrin-repeat
      domain is coupled to pore opening via the TRP domain, and this pore opening can
      be modulated by rearrangements in the secondary structure of S6.

TI  - Selective integrin endocytosis is driven by interactions between the integrin
      alpha-chain and AP2.
PG  - 172-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3161 [doi]
AB  - Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface adhesion molecules comprising one of 18 
      possible alpha-chains and one of eight possible beta-chains. They control a range
      of cell functions in a matrix- and ligand-specific manner. Integrins can be
      internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through beta subunit-based
      motifs found in all integrin heterodimers. However, whether specific integrin
      heterodimers can be selectively endocytosed was unknown. Here, we found that a
      subset of alpha subunits contain an evolutionarily conserved and functional
      YxxPhi motif directing integrins to selective internalization by the most
      abundant endocytic clathrin adaptor, AP2. We determined the structure of the
      human integrin alpha4-tail motif in complex with the AP2 C-mu2 subunit and
      confirmed the interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry. Mutagenesis of the
      motif impaired selective heterodimer endocytosis and attenuated integrin-mediated
      cell migration. We propose that integrins evolved to enable selective
      integrin-receptor turnover in response to changing matrix conditions.

TI  - Structural basis and function of XRN2 binding by XTB domains.
PG  - 164-71
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3155 [doi]
AB  - The RNase XRN2 is essential in RNA metabolism. In Caenorhabditis elegans, XRN2
      functions with PAXT-1, which shares a putative XRN2-binding domain (XTBD) with
      otherwise unrelated mammalian proteins. Here, we characterize the structure and
      function of an XTBD-XRN2 complex. Although XTBD stably interconnects two XRN2
      domains through numerous interacting residues, mutation of a single critical
      residue suffices to disrupt XTBD-XRN2 complexes in vitro and to recapitulate
      paxt-1-null mutant phenotypes in vivo. Demonstrating conservation of function,
      vertebrate XTBD-containing proteins bind XRN2 in vitro, and human CDKN2AIPNL
      (HsC2AIL) can substitute for PAXT-1 in vivo. In vertebrates, which express three 
      distinct XTBD-containing proteins, XRN2 may partition into distinct stable
      heterodimeric complexes, which probably differ in subcellular localization or
      function. In C. elegans, complex formation with PAXT-1, the sole XTBD protein,
      serves to preserve the stability of XRN2 in the absence of substrate.

TI  - Neil DNA glycosylases promote substrate turnover by Tdg during DNA demethylation.
PG  - 116-124
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3151 [doi]
AB  - DNA 5-methylcytosine is a dynamic epigenetic mark with important roles in
      development and disease. In the Tet-Tdg demethylation pathway, methylated
      cytosine is iteratively oxidized by Tet dioxygenases, and unmodified cytosine is 
      restored via thymine DNA glycosylase (Tdg). Here we show that human NEIL1 and
      NEIL2 DNA glycosylases coordinate abasic-site processing during TET-TDG DNA
      demethylation. NEIL1 and NEIL2 cooperate with TDG during base excision: TDG
      occupies the abasic site and is displaced by NEILs, which further process the
      baseless sugar, thereby stimulating TDG-substrate turnover. In early Xenopus
      embryos, Neil2 cooperates with Tdg in removing oxidized methylcytosines and
      specifying neural-crest development together with Tet3. Thus, Neils function as
      AP lyases in the coordinated AP-site handover during oxidative DNA demethylation.

TI  - N(6)-methyladenosine in mRNA disrupts tRNA selection and translation-elongation
      dynamics.
PG  - 110-5
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3148 [doi]
AB  - N(6)-methylation of adenosine (forming m(6)A) is the most abundant
      post-transcriptional modification within the coding region of mRNA, but its role 
      during translation remains unknown. Here, we used bulk kinetic and
      single-molecule methods to probe the effect of m(6)A in mRNA decoding. Although
      m(6)A base-pairs with uridine during decoding, as shown by X-ray crystallographic
      analyses of Thermus thermophilus ribosomal complexes, our measurements in an
      Escherichia coli translation system revealed that m(6)A modification of mRNA acts
      as a barrier to tRNA accommodation and translation elongation. The interaction
      between an m(6)A-modified codon and cognate tRNA echoes the interaction between a
      near-cognate codon and tRNA, because delay in tRNA accommodation depends on the
      position and context of m(6)A within codons and on the accuracy level of
      translation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chemical modification of mRNA 
      can change translational dynamics.

AB  - Polarized epithelia form by oriented cell divisions in which the mitotic spindle 
      aligns parallel to the epithelial plane. To orient the mitotic spindle, cortical 
      cues trigger the recruitment of NuMA-dynein-based motors, which pull on astral
      microtubules via the protein LGN. We demonstrate that the junctional protein
      Afadin is required for spindle orientation and correct epithelial morphogenesis
      of Caco-2 cysts. Molecularly, Afadin binds directly and concomitantly to F-actin 
      and to LGN. We determined the crystallographic structure of human Afadin in
      complex with LGN and show that it resembles the LGN-NuMA complex. In mitosis,
      Afadin is necessary for cortical accumulation of LGN and NuMA above the spindle
      poles, in an F-actin-dependent manner. Collectively, our results depict Afadin as
      a molecular hub governing the enrichment of LGN and NuMA at the cortex. To our
      knowledge, Afadin is the first-described mechanical anchor between dynein and
      cortical F-actin.

      transcription and translocation.
PG  - 132-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3153 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer evolution is driven by a combination of epigenetic and genetic
      alterations such as coordinated chromosomal rearrangements, termed chromoplexy.
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions found in human prostate tumors are a hallmark of
      chromoplexy. TMPRSS2-ERG fusions have been linked to androgen signaling and
      depend on androgen receptor (AR)-coupled gene transcription. Here, we show that
      dimethylation of KDM1A at K114 (to form K114me2) by the histone methyltransferase
      EHMT2 is a key event controlling androgen-dependent gene transcription and
      TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. We identified CHD1 as a KDM1A K114me2 reader and
      characterized the KDM1A K114me2-CHD1 recognition mode by solving the cocrystal
      structure. Genome-wide analyses revealed chromatin colocalization of KDM1A
      K114me2, CHD1 and AR in prostate tumor cells. Together, our data link the
      assembly of methylated KDM1A and CHD1 with AR-dependent transcription and genomic
      translocations, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the formation of
      TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions during prostate-tumor evolution.

TI  - Structures of HSF2 reveal mechanisms for differential regulation of human
      heat-shock factors.
PG  - 147-54
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3150 [doi]
AB  - Heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) family members function in stress
      protection and in human diseases including proteopathies, neurodegeneration and
      cancer. The mechanisms that drive distinct post-translational modifications,
      cofactor recruitment and target-gene activation for specific HSF paralogs are
      unknown. We present crystal structures of the human HSF2 DNA-binding domain (DBD)
      bound to DNA, revealing an unprecedented view of HSFs that provides insights into
      their unique biology. The HSF2 DBD structures resolve a new C-terminal helix that
      directs wrapping of the coiled-coil domain around DNA, thereby exposing
      paralog-specific sequences of the DBD surface for differential post-translational
      modifications and cofactor interactions. We further demonstrate a direct
      interaction between HSF1 and HSF2 through their coiled-coil domains. Together,
      these features provide a new model for HSF structure as the basis for
      differential and combinatorial regulation, which influences the transcriptional
      response to cellular stress.

PG  - 140-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3149 [doi]
AB  - Heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) has a central role in mediating the
      protective response to protein conformational stresses in eukaryotes. HSF1
      consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD), a coiled-coil oligomerization
      domain, a regulatory domain and a transactivation domain. Upon stress, HSF1
      trimerizes via its coiled-coil domain and binds to the promoters of heat shock
      protein-encoding genes. Here, we present cocrystal structures of the human HSF1
      DBD in complex with cognate DNA. A comparative analysis of the HSF1 paralog Skn7 
      from Chaetomium thermophilum showed that single amino acid changes in the DBD can
      switch DNA binding specificity, thus revealing the structural basis for the
      interaction of HSF1 with cognate DNA. We used a crystal structure of the
      coiled-coil domain of C. thermophilum Skn7 to develop a model of the active human
      HSF1 trimer in which HSF1 embraces the heat-shock-element DNA.

TI  - Ribosome-associated protein quality control.
PG  - 7-15
AB  - Protein synthesis by the ribosome can fail for numerous reasons including faulty 
      mRNA, insufficient availability of charged tRNAs and genetic errors. All
      organisms have evolved mechanisms to recognize stalled ribosomes and initiate
      pathways for recycling, quality control and stress signaling. Here we review the 
      discovery and molecular dissection of the eukaryotic ribosome-associated
      quality-control pathway for degradation of nascent polypeptides arising from
      interrupted translation.

PG  - 24-30

AB  - Methylation of cytosine deoxynucleotides generates 5-methylcytosine (m(5)dC), a
      well-established epigenetic mark. However, in higher eukaryotes much less is
      known about modifications affecting other deoxynucleotides. Here, we report the
      detection of N(6)-methyldeoxyadenosine (m(6)dA) in vertebrate DNA, specifically
      in Xenopus laevis but also in other species including mouse and human. Our
      methylome analysis reveals that m(6)dA is widely distributed across the
      eukaryotic genome and is present in different cell types but is commonly depleted
      from gene exons. Thus, direct DNA modifications might be more widespread than
      previously thought.

TI  - Structures of HIV-1 Env V1V2 with broadly neutralizing antibodies reveal
      commonalities that enable vaccine design.
PG  - 81-90
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3144 [doi]
AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 Env V1V2 arise in multiple 
      donors. However, atomic-level interactions had previously been determined only
      with antibodies from a single donor, thus making commonalities in recognition
      uncertain. Here we report the cocrystal structure of V1V2 with antibody CH03 from
      a second donor and model Env interactions of antibody CAP256-VRC26 from a third
      donor. These V1V2-directed bNAbs used strand-strand interactions between a
      protruding antibody loop and a V1V2 strand but differed in their N-glycan
      recognition. Ontogeny analysis indicated that protruding loops develop early, and
      glycan interactions mature over time. Altogether, the multidonor information
      suggested that V1V2-directed bNAbs form an 'extended class', for which we
      engineered ontogeny-specific antigens: Env trimers with chimeric V1V2s that
      interacted with inferred ancestor and intermediate antibodies. The ontogeny-based
      design of vaccine antigens described here may provide a general means for
      eliciting antibodies of a desired class.

TI  - Exocytotic fusion pores are composed of both lipids and proteins.
PG  - 67-73
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3141 [doi]
AB  - During exocytosis, fusion pores form the first aqueous connection that allows
      escape of neurotransmitters and hormones from secretory vesicles. Although it is 
      well established that SNARE proteins catalyze fusion, the structure and
      composition of fusion pores remain unknown. Here, we exploited the rigid
      framework and defined size of nanodiscs to interrogate the properties of
      reconstituted fusion pores, using the neurotransmitter glutamate as a
      content-mixing marker. Efficient Ca(2+)-stimulated bilayer fusion, and glutamate 
      release, occurred with approximately two molecules of mouse synaptobrevin 2
      reconstituted into approximately 6-nm nanodiscs. The transmembrane domains of
      SNARE proteins assumed distinct roles in lipid mixing versus content release and 
      were exposed to polar solvent during fusion. Additionally, tryptophan
      substitutions at specific positions in these transmembrane domains decreased
      glutamate flux. Together, these findings indicate that the fusion pore is a
      hybrid structure composed of both lipids and proteins.

TI  - Secondary ubiquitin-RING docking enhances Arkadia and Ark2C E3 ligase activity.
PG  - 45-52
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3142 [doi]
AB  - RING-domain E3 ligases enhance transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins by
      stabilizing the RING-bound thioester-linked E2 approximately ubiquitin conjugate 
      in a defined conformation that primes the active site for nucleophilic attack.
      Here we report that the monomeric RING domains from the human E3 ligases Arkadia 
      and Ark2C bind directly to free ubiquitin with an affinity comparable to that of 
      other dedicated ubiquitin-binding domains. Further work showed that the Ark-like 
      RING domain and the noncovalently bound ubiquitin molecule coordinately stabilize
      the E2-conjugated ubiquitin (donor ubiquitin) in the 'closed' conformation. Our
      studies identify the RING domain of Arkadia as a ubiquitin-binding domain and
      provide insight into a new ubiquitin-dependent mechanism used by monomeric RING
      domains to activate ubiquitin transfer. This study also suggests how substrates
      that have been monoubiquitinated could be favored for further ubiquitination.

TI  - Subunit connectivity, assembly determinants and architecture of the yeast exocyst
      complex.
PG  - 59-66
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3146 [doi]
AB  - The exocyst is a hetero-octameric complex that has been proposed to serve as the 
      tethering complex for exocytosis, although it remains poorly understood at the
      molecular level. Here, we purified endogenous exocyst complexes from
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are stable and consist of all eight
      subunits with equal stoichiometry. Using a combination of biochemical and auxin
      induced-degradation experiments in yeast, we mapped the subunit connectivity,
      identified two stable four-subunit modules within the octamer and demonstrated
      that several known exocyst-binding partners are not necessary for exocyst
      assembly and stability. Furthermore, we visualized the structure of the yeast
      complex by using negative-stain electron microscopy; our results indicate that
      the exocyst exists predominantly as a stable, octameric complex with an elongated
      architecture that suggests that the subunits are contiguous helical bundles
      packed together into a bundle of long rods.

TI  - Structural dynamics of potassium-channel gating revealed by single-molecule FRET.
PG  - 31-36
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3138 [doi]
AB  - Crystallography has provided invaluable insights regarding ion-channel
      selectivity and gating, but to advance understanding to a new level, dynamic
      views of channel structures within membranes are essential. We labeled tetrameric
      KirBac1.1 potassium channels with single donor and acceptor fluorophores at
      different sites and then examined structural dynamics within lipid membranes by
      single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We found that the 
      extracellular region is structurally rigid in both closed and open states,
      whereas the N-terminal slide helix undergoes marked conformational fluctuations. 
      The cytoplasmic C-terminal domain fluctuates between two major structural states,
      both of which become less dynamic and move away from the pore axis and away from 
      the membrane in closed channels. Our results reveal mobile and rigid
      conformations of functionally relevant KirBac1.1 channel motifs, implying similar
      dynamics for similar motifs in eukaryotic Kir channels and in cation channels in 
      general.

TI  - Recognition of distinct RNA motifs by the clustered CCCH zinc fingers of neuronal
      protein Unkempt.
PG  - 16-23
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3140 [doi]
AB  - Unkempt is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates
      translation of its target genes and is required for the establishment of the
      early bipolar neuronal morphology. Here we determined the X-ray crystal structure
      of mouse Unkempt and show that its six CCCH zinc fingers (ZnFs) form two compact 
      clusters, ZnF1-3 and ZnF4-6, that recognize distinct trinucleotide RNA
      substrates. Both ZnF clusters adopt a similar overall topology and use distinct
      recognition principles to target specific RNA sequences. Structure-guided point
      mutations reduce the RNA binding affinity of Unkempt both in vitro and in vivo,
      ablate Unkempt's translational control and impair the ability of Unkempt to

      of cell entry.
PG  - 74-80
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3134 [doi]
AB  - Viruses sense environmental cues such as pH to engage in membrane interactions
      for cell entry during infection, but how nonenveloped viruses sense pH is largely
      undefined. Here, we report both high- and low-pH structures of bluetongue virus
      (BTV), which enters cells via a two-stage endosomal process. The receptor-binding
      protein VP2 possesses a zinc finger that may function to maintain VP2 in a
      metastable state and a conserved His866, which senses early-endosomal pH. The
      membrane-penetration protein VP5 has three domains: dagger, unfurling and
      anchoring. Notably, the beta-meander motif of the anchoring domain contains a
      histidine cluster that can sense late-endosomal pH and also possesses four
      putative membrane-interaction elements. Exposing BTV to low pH detaches VP2 and
      dramatically refolds the dagger and unfurling domains of VP5. Our biochemical and
      structure-guided-mutagenesis studies support these coordinated pH-sensing
      mechanisms.

TI  - Substrate protein folds while it is bound to the ATP-independent chaperone Spy.
PG  - 53-58
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3133 [doi]
AB  - Chaperones assist in the folding of many proteins in the cell. Although the most 
      well-studied chaperones use cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis to assist in
      protein folding, a number of chaperones have been identified that promote folding
      in the absence of high-energy cofactors. Precisely how ATP-independent chaperones
      accomplish this feat is unclear. Here we characterized the kinetic mechanism of
      substrate folding by the small ATP-independent chaperone Spy from Escherichia
      coli. Spy rapidly associates with its substrate, immunity protein 7 (Im7),
      thereby eliminating Im7's potential for aggregation. Remarkably, Spy then allows 
      Im7 to fully fold into its native state while it remains bound to the surface of 
      the chaperone. These results establish a potentially widespread mechanism whereby
      ATP-independent chaperones assist in protein refolding. They also provide
      compelling evidence that substrate proteins can fold while being continuously
      bound to a chaperone.

      remodeling.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3132 [doi]
AB  - Ribosome synthesis is catalyzed by approximately 200 assembly factors, which
      facilitate efficient production of mature ribosomes. Here, we determined the
      cryo-EM structure of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleoplasmic pre-60S particle
      containing the dynein-related 550-kDa Rea1 AAA(+) ATPase and the Rix1 subcomplex.
      This particle differs from its preceding state, the early Arx1 particle, by two
      massive structural rearrangements: an approximately 180 degrees rotation of the
      5S ribonucleoprotein complex and the central protuberance (CP) rRNA helices, and 
      the removal of the 'foot' structure from the 3' end of the 5.8S rRNA. Progression
      from the Arx1 to the Rix1 particle was blocked by mutational perturbation of the 
      Rix1-Rea1 interaction but not by a dominant-lethal Rea1 AAA(+) ATPase-ring
      mutant. After remodeling, the Rix1 subcomplex and Rea1 become suitably positioned
      to sense correct structural maturation of the CP, which allows unidirectional
      progression toward mature ribosomes.

AB  - Single-molecule approaches are having a dramatic impact on views of how proteins 
      work. The ability to observe molecular properties at the single-molecule level
      allows characterization of subpopulations and acquisition of detailed kinetic
      information that would otherwise be hidden in the averaging over an ensemble of
      molecules. In this Perspective, we discuss how such approaches have successfully 
      been applied to in vitro-reconstituted systems of increasing complexity.

PG  - 953-8

AB  - Immunoglobulin G4 antibodies exhibit unusual properties with important biological
      consequences. We report the structure of the human full-length IgG4 S228P
      anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab, solved to 2.3-A resolution. Pembrolizumab is a
      compact molecule, consistent with the presence of a short hinge region. The Fc
      domain is glycosylated at the CH2 domain on both chains, but one CH2 domain is
      rotated 120 degrees with respect to the conformation observed in all reported
      structures to date, and its glycan chain faces the solvent. We speculate that
      this new conformation is driven by the shorter hinge. The structure suggests a
      role for the S228P mutation in preventing the IgG4 arm exchange. In addition,
      this unusual Fc conformation suggests possible structural diversity between IgG
      subclasses and shows that use of isolated antibody fragments could mask
      potentially important interactions, owing to molecular flexibility.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for post-transcriptional regulation of 
      gene expression. Recent high-throughput screens have dramatically increased the
      number of experimentally identified RBPs; however, comprehensive identification
      of RBPs within living organisms is elusive. Here we describe the repertoire of
      765 and 594 proteins that reproducibly interact with polyadenylated mRNAs in
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively. Furthermore,
      we report the differential association of mRNA-binding proteins (mRPBs) upon
      induction of apoptosis in C. elegans L4-stage larvae. Strikingly, most proteins
      composing mRBPomes, including components of early metabolic pathways and the
      proteasome, are evolutionarily conserved between yeast and C. elegans. We
      speculate, on the basis of our evidence that glycolytic enzymes bind distinct
      glycolytic mRNAs, that enzyme-mRNA interactions relate to an ancient mechanism
      for post-transcriptional coordination of metabolic pathways that perhaps was
      established during the transition from the early 'RNA world' to the 'protein
      world'.

TI  - Structural characterization of human heparanase reveals insights into substrate
      recognition.
PG  - 1016-22
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3136 [doi]
AB  - Heparan sulfate (HS) is a glycosaminoglycan that forms a key component of the
      extracellular matrix (ECM). Breakdown of HS is carried out by heparanase (HPSE), 
      an endo-beta-glucuronidase of the glycoside hydrolase 79 (GH79) family.
      Overexpression of HPSE results in breakdown of extracellular HS and release of
      stored growth factors and hence is strongly linked to cancer metastasis. Here we 
      present crystal structures of human HPSE at 1.6-A to 1.9-A resolution that reveal
      how an endo-acting binding cleft is exposed by proteolytic activation of latent
      proHPSE. We used oligosaccharide complexes to map the substrate-binding and
      sulfate-recognition motifs. These data shed light on the structure and
      interactions of a key enzyme involved in ECM maintenance and provide a starting
      point for the design of HPSE inhibitors for use as biochemical tools and
      anticancer therapeutics.

      amyloid-fibril formation.
PG  - 1008-15
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3127 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological 
      diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form beta-rich amyloid fibrils and 
      intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases
      caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The
      mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain
      unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is
      mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid 
      kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into alpha-helical clusters with
      diverse oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of
      visible aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric
      state of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This
      self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt
      protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.

      the transmembrane helices (TMs). Purified MscS contains E. coli lipids, and
      fluorescence quenching demonstrates that phospholipid acyl chains exchange
      between bilayer and TM pockets. Molecular dynamics and biophysical analyses show 
      that the volume of the pockets and thus the number of lipid acyl chains within
      them decreases upon channel opening. Phospholipids with one acyl chain per head
      group (lysolipids) displace normal phospholipids (with two acyl chains) from MscS
      pockets and trigger channel opening. We propose that the extent of acyl-chain
      interdigitation in these pockets determines the conformation of MscS. When
      interdigitation is perturbed by increased membrane tension or by lysolipids, the 
      closed state becomes unstable, and the channel gates.

AB  - Numerous chromatin-remodeling factors are regulated by interactions with RNA,
      although the contexts and functions of RNA binding are poorly understood. Here we
      show that R loops, RNA-DNA hybrids consisting of nascent transcripts hybridized
      to template DNA, modulate the binding of two key chromatin-regulatory complexes, 
      Tip60-p400 and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in mouse embryonic stem cells
      (ESCs). Like PRC2, the Tip60-p400 histone acetyltransferase complex binds to
      nascent transcripts; however, transcription promotes chromatin binding of
      Tip60-p400 but not PRC2. Interestingly, we observed higher Tip60-p400 and lower
      PRC2 levels at genes marked by promoter-proximal R loops. Furthermore, disruption
      of R loops broadly decreased Tip60-p400 occupancy and increased PRC2 occupancy
      genome wide. In agreement with these alterations, ESCs partially depleted of R
      loops exhibited impaired differentiation. These results show that R loops act
      both positively and negatively in modulating the recruitment of key pluripotency 
      regulators.

TI  - EGF-receptor specificity for phosphotyrosine-primed substrates provides signal
      integration with Src.
PG  - 983-90
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3117 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) contributes to many human cancers 
      by activating the Ras-MAPK pathway and other pathways. EGFR signaling is
      augmented by Src-family kinases, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we
      show that human EGFR preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that are
      primed by a prior phosphorylation. Using peptides based on the sequence of the
      adaptor protein Shc1, we show that Src mediates the priming phosphorylation, thus
      promoting subsequent phosphorylation by EGFR. Importantly, the doubly
      phosphorylated Shc1 peptide binds more tightly than singly phosphorylated peptide
      to the Ras activator Grb2; this binding is a key step in activating the Ras-MAPK 
      pathway. Finally, a crystal structure of EGFR in complex with a primed Shc1
      peptide reveals the structural basis for EGFR substrate specificity. These
      results provide a molecular explanation for the integration of Src and EGFR
      signaling with downstream effectors such as Ras.

AB  - Tetrahymena telomerase holoenzyme subunits p75, p45 and p19 form a subcomplex
      (7-4-1) peripheral to the catalytic core. We report structures of p45 and p19 and
      reveal them as the Stn1 and Ten1 subunits of the CST complex, which stimulates
      telomerase complementary-strand synthesis. 7-4-1 binds telomeric single-stranded 
      DNA, and mutant p19 overexpression causes telomere 3'-overhang elongation. We
      propose that telomerase-tethered Tetrahymena CST coordinates telomere G-strand
      and C-strand synthesis.

PG  - 968-75
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3116 [doi]
AB  - E3 protein ligases enhance transfer of ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins from E2
      conjugating enzymes to substrates by stabilizing the thioester-charged E2~Ubl in 
      a closed configuration optimally aligned for nucleophilic attack. Here, we report
      biochemical and structural data that define the N-terminal domain of the Homo
      sapiens ZNF451 as the catalytic module for SUMO E3 ligase activity. The ZNF451
      catalytic module contains tandem SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) bridged by a
      Pro-Leu-Arg-Pro (PLRP) motif. The first SIM and PLRP motif engage
      thioester-charged E2~SUMO while the next SIM binds a second molecule of SUMO
      bound to the back side of E2. We show that ZNF451 is SUMO2 specific and that SUMO
      modification of ZNF451 may contribute to activity by providing a second molecule 
      of SUMO that interacts with E2. Our results are consistent with ZNF451
      functioning as a bona fide SUMO E3 ligase.

TI  - A new vertebrate SUMO enzyme family reveals insights into SUMO-chain assembly.
PG  - 959-67
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3114 [doi]
AB  - SUMO chains act as stress-induced degradation tags or repair factor-recruiting
      signals at DNA lesions. Although E1 activating, E2 conjugating and E3 ligating
      enzymes efficiently assemble SUMO chains, specific chain-elongation mechanisms
      are unknown. E4 elongases are specialized E3 ligases that extend a chain but are 
      inefficient in the initial conjugation of the modifier. We identified ZNF451, a
      representative member of a new class of SUMO2 and SUMO3 (SUMO2/3)-specific
      enzymes that execute catalysis via a tandem SUMO-interaction motif (SIM) region. 
      One SIM positions the donor SUMO while a second SIM binds SUMO on the back side
      of the E2 enzyme. This tandem-SIM region is sufficient to extend a back
      side-anchored SUMO chain (E4 elongase activity), whereas efficient chain
      initiation also requires a zinc-finger region to recruit the initial acceptor
      SUMO (E3 ligase activity). Finally, we describe four human proteins sharing E4
      elongase activities and their function in stress-induced SUMO2/3 conjugation.

TI  - The architecture of a eukaryotic replisome.
PG  - 976-82
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3113 [doi]
AB  - At the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, it is widely believed that the
      Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) helicase is positioned in front to unwind DNA and that
      DNA polymerases trail behind the helicase. Here we used single-particle EM to
      directly image a Saccharomyces cerevisiae replisome. Contrary to expectations,
      the leading strand Pol varepsilon is positioned ahead of CMG helicase, whereas
      Ctf4 and the lagging-strand polymerase (Pol) alpha-primase are behind the
      helicase. This unexpected architecture indicates that the leading-strand DNA
      travels a long distance before reaching Pol varepsilon, first threading through
      the Mcm2-7 ring and then making a U-turn at the bottom and reaching Pol
      varepsilon at the top of CMG. Our work reveals an unexpected configuration of the
      eukaryotic replisome, suggests possible reasons for this architecture and
      provides a basis for further structural and biochemical replisome studies.

AB  - Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) involves homology-directed telomere
      synthesis. This multistep process is facilitated by loss of the ATRX or DAXX
      chromatin-remodeling factors and by abnormalities of the telomere nucleoprotein
      architecture, including altered DNA sequence and decreased TRF2 saturation.
      Induction of telomere-specific DNA damage triggers homology-directed searches,
      and NuRD-ZNF827 protein-protein interactions provide a platform for the telomeric
      recruitment of homologous recombination (HR) proteins. Telomere lengthening
      proceeds by strand exchange and template-driven DNA synthesis, which culminates
      in dissolution of HR intermediates.

AB  - Mutations in genes encoding proteins required for telomere structure,
      replication, repair and length maintenance are associated with several
      debilitating human genetic disorders. These complex telomere biology disorders
      (TBDs) give rise to critically short telomeres that affect the homeostasis of
      multiple organs. Furthermore, genome instability is often a hallmark of telomere 
      syndromes, which are associated with increased cancer risk. Here, we summarize
      the molecular causes and cellular consequences of disease-causing mutations
      associated with telomere dysfunction.

AB  - Natural chromosome ends resemble double-stranded DNA breaks, but they do not
      activate a damage response in healthy cells. Telomeres therefore have evolved to 
      solve the 'end-protection problem' by inhibiting multiple DNA damage-response
      pathways. During the past decade, the view of telomeres has progressed from
      simple caps that hide chromosome ends to complex machineries that have an active 
      role in organizing the genome. Here we focus on mammalian telomeres and summarize
      and interpret recent discoveries in detail, focusing on how repair pathways are
      inhibited, how resection and replication are controlled and how these mechanisms 
      govern cell fate during senescence, crisis and transformation.

TI  - TERRA and the state of the telomere.
PG  - 853-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3078 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) has been implicated in
      telomere maintenance in a telomerase-dependent and a telomerase-independent
      manner during replicative senescence and cancer. TERRA's proposed activities are 
      diverse, thus making it difficult to pinpoint the critical roles that TERRA may
      have. We propose that TERRA orchestrates different activities at chromosome ends 
      in a manner that depends on the state of the telomere.

TI  - Control of telomerase action at human telomeres.
PG  - 848-52
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3083 [doi]
AB  - Recent progress has greatly increased the understanding of telomere-bound
      shelterin proteins and the telomerase holoenzyme, predominantly as separate
      complexes. Pioneering studies have begun to investigate the requirements for
      shelterin-telomerase interaction. From this vantage point, focusing on human
      cells, we review and discuss models for how telomerase and shelterin subunits
      coordinate to achieve balanced telomere-length homeostasis.

TI  - A DNA-hairpin model for repeat-addition processivity in telomere synthesis.
PG  - 844-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3098 [doi]
AB  - We propose a DNA-hairpin model for the processivity of telomeric-repeat addition.
      Concomitantly with template-RNA translocation after each repeat synthesis, the
      complementary DNA repeat, for example, AGGGTT, loops out in a noncanonical
      base-paired hairpin, thus freeing the RNA template for the next round of repeat
      synthesis. The DNA hairpin is temporarily stabilized by telomerase and the
      incoming dGTP but becomes realigned for processive telomere synthesis.

TI  - Mechanism of eIF6 release from the nascent 60S ribosomal subunit.
PG  - 914-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3112 [doi]
AB  - SBDS protein (deficient in the inherited leukemia-predisposition disorder
      Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) and the GTPase EFL1 (an EF-G homolog) activate
      nascent 60S ribosomal subunits for translation by catalyzing eviction of the
      antiassociation factor eIF6 from nascent 60S ribosomal subunits. However, the
      mechanism is completely unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human
      SBDS and SBDS-EFL1 bound to Dictyostelium discoideum 60S ribosomal subunits with 
      and without endogenous eIF6. SBDS assesses the integrity of the peptidyl (P)
      site, bridging uL16 (mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) with uL11 at
      the P-stalk base and the sarcin-ricin loop. Upon EFL1 binding, SBDS is
      repositioned around helix 69, thus facilitating a conformational switch in EFL1
      that displaces eIF6 by competing for an overlapping binding site on the 60S
      ribosomal subunit. Our data reveal the conserved mechanism of eIF6 release, which
      is corrupted in both inherited and sporadic leukemias.

AB  - Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis involves a plethora of ribosome-assembly factors, 
      and their temporal order of association with preribosomal RNA is largely unknown.
      By using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we developed a system that
      recapitulates and arrests ribosome assembly at early stages, thus providing in
      vivo snapshots of nascent preribosomal particles. Here we report the
      stage-specific order in which 70 ribosome-assembly factors associate with
      preribosomal RNA domains, thereby forming the 6-MDa small-subunit processome.

TI  - HflX is a ribosome-splitting factor rescuing stalled ribosomes under stress
      conditions.
PG  - 906-13
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3103 [doi]
AB  - Adverse cellular conditions often lead to nonproductive translational stalling
      and arrest of ribosomes on mRNAs. Here, we used fast kinetics and cryo-EM to
      characterize Escherichia coli HflX, a GTPase with unknown function. Our data
      reveal that HflX is a heat shock-induced ribosome-splitting factor capable of
      dissociating vacant as well as mRNA-associated ribosomes with deacylated tRNA in 
      the peptidyl site. Structural data demonstrate that the N-terminal effector
      domain of HflX binds to the peptidyl transferase center in a strikingly similar
      manner as that of the class I release factors and induces dramatic conformational
      changes in central intersubunit bridges, thus promoting subunit dissociation.
      Accordingly, loss of HflX results in an increase in stalled ribosomes upon heat
      shock. These results suggest a primary role of HflX in rescuing translationally
      arrested ribosomes under stress conditions.

TI  - The chaperone alphaB-crystallin uses different interfaces to capture an amorphous
      and an amyloid client.
PG  - 898-905
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3108 [doi]
AB  - Small heat-shock proteins, including alphaB-crystallin (alphaB), play an
      important part in protein homeostasis, because their ATP-independent chaperone
      activity inhibits uncontrolled protein aggregation. Mechanistic details of human 
      alphaB, particularly in its client-bound state, have been elusive so far, owing
      to the high molecular weight and the heterogeneity of these complexes. Here we
      provide structural insights into this highly dynamic assembly and show, by using 
      state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy, that the alphaB complex is assembled from
      asymmetric building blocks. Interaction studies demonstrated that the
      fibril-forming Alzheimer's disease Abeta1-40 peptide preferentially binds to a
      hydrophobic edge of the central beta-sandwich of alphaB. In contrast, the
      amorphously aggregating client lysozyme is captured by the partially disordered
      N-terminal domain of alphaB. We suggest that alphaB uses its inherent structural 
      plasticity to expose distinct binding interfaces and thus interact with a wide
      range of structurally variable clients.

TI  - Capturing snapshots of APE1 processing DNA damage.
PG  - 924-31
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3105 [doi]
AB  - DNA apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) sites are prevalent noncoding threats to genomic
      stability and are processed by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). APE1 incises the AP-site
      phosphodiester backbone, generating a DNA-repair intermediate that is potentially
      cytotoxic. The molecular events of the incision reaction remain elusive, owing in
      part to limited structural information. We report multiple high-resolution human 
      APE1-DNA structures that divulge new features of the APE1 reaction, including the
      metal-binding site, the nucleophile and the arginine clamps that mediate product 
      release. We also report APE1-DNA structures with a T-G mismatch 5' to the AP
      site, representing a clustered lesion occurring in methylated CpG dinucleotides. 
      These structures reveal that APE1 molds the T-G mismatch into a unique
      Watson-Crick-like geometry that distorts the active site, thus reducing incision.
      These snapshots provide mechanistic clarity for APE1 while affording a rational
      framework to manipulate biological responses to DNA damage.

TI  - Structural basis of template-boundary definition in Tetrahymena telomerase.
PG  - 883-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3101 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase is required to maintain repetitive G-rich telomeric DNA sequences at
      chromosome ends. To do so, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunit
      reiteratively uses a small region of the integral telomerase RNA (TER) as a
      template. An essential feature of telomerase catalysis is the strict definition
      of the template boundary to determine the precise TER nucleotides to be reverse
      transcribed by TERT. We report the 3-A crystal structure of the Tetrahymena TERT 
      RNA-binding domain (tTRBD) bound to the template boundary element (TBE) of TER.
      tTRBD is wedged into the base of the TBE RNA stem-loop, and each of the flanking 
      RNA strands wraps around opposite sides of the protein domain. The structure
      illustrates how the tTRBD establishes the template boundary by positioning the
      TBE at the correct distance from the TERT active site to prohibit copying of
      nontemplate nucleotides.

TI  - Rif1 binds to G quadruplexes and suppresses replication over long distances.
PG  - 889-97
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3102 [doi]
AB  - Rif1 regulates replication timing and repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Using a
      chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing method, we identified 35 high-affinity
      Rif1-binding sites in fission yeast chromosomes. Binding sites tended to be
      located near dormant origins and to contain at least two copies of a conserved
      motif, CNWWGTGGGGG. Base substitution within these motifs resulted in complete
      loss of Rif1 binding and in activation of late-firing or dormant origins located 
      up to 50 kb away. We show that Rif1-binding sites adopt G quadruplex-like
      structures in vitro, in a manner dependent on the conserved sequence and on other
      G tracts, and that purified Rif1 preferentially binds to this structure. These
      results suggest that Rif1 recognizes and binds G quadruplex-like structures at
      selected intergenic regions, thus generating local chromatin structures that may 
      exert long-range suppressive effects on origin firing.

      fork restart.

AB  - To maintain genetic stability, DNA must be replicated only once per cell cycle,
      and replication must be completed even when individual replication forks are
      inactivated. Because fork inactivation is common, passive convergence of an
      adjacent fork is insufficient to rescue all inactive forks. Thus, eukaryotic
      cells have evolved homologous recombination-dependent mechanisms to restart
      persistent inactive forks. Completing DNA synthesis via homologous
      recombination-restarted replication (HoRReR) ensures cell survival, but at a
      cost. One such cost is increased mutagenesis because HoRReR is more error prone
      than canonical replication. This increased error rate implies the HoRReR
      mechanism is distinct from that of a canonical fork. Here we demonstrate, in
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that a DNA sequence duplicated by HoRReR during S
      phase is replicated semiconservatively, but both the leading and lagging strands 
      are synthesized by DNA polymerase delta.

TI  - Synaptotagmin-1 binds to PIP(2)-containing membrane but not to SNAREs at
      physiological ionic strength.
PG  - 815-23
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3097 [doi]
AB  - The Ca(2+) sensor synaptotagmin-1 is thought to trigger membrane fusion by
      binding to acidic membrane lipids and SNARE proteins. Previous work has shown
      that binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions that are sensitive to the 
      ionic environment. However, the influence of divalent or polyvalent ions, at
      physiological concentrations, on synaptotagmin's binding to membranes or SNAREs
      has not been explored. Here we show that binding of rat synaptotagmin-1 to
      membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is regulated by
      charge shielding caused by the presence of divalent cations. Surprisingly,
      polyvalent ions such as ATP and Mg(2+) completely abrogate synaptotagmin-1
      binding to SNAREs regardless of the presence of Ca(2+). Altogether, our data
      indicate that at physiological ion concentrations Ca(2+)-dependent
      synaptotagmin-1 binding is confined to PIP2-containing membrane patches in the
      plasma membrane, suggesting that membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 rather
      than SNARE binding triggers exocytosis of vesicles.

      virus vaccine design.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3096 [doi]
AB  - Virus capsids are primed for disassembly, yet capsid integrity is key to
      generating a protective immune response. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)
      capsids comprise identical pentameric protein subunits held together by tenuous
      noncovalent interactions and are often unstable. Chemically inactivated or
      recombinant empty capsids, which could form the basis of future vaccines, are
      even less stable than live virus. Here we devised a computational method to
      assess the relative stability of protein-protein interfaces and used it to design
      improved candidate vaccines for two poorly stable, but globally important,
      serotypes of FMDV: O and SAT2. We used a restrained molecular dynamics strategy
      to rank mutations predicted to strengthen the pentamer interfaces and applied the
      results to produce stabilized capsids. Structural analyses and stability assays
      confirmed the predictions, and vaccinated animals generated improved
      neutralizing-antibody responses to stabilized particles compared to parental
      viruses and wild-type capsids.

AB  - The mechanism by which transmembrane reductases use a single pair of cysteine
      residues to relay electrons between protein substrates across biological
      membranes is a long-standing mystery in thiol-redox biochemistry. Here we show
      the NMR structure of a reduced-state mimic of archaeal CcdA, a protein that
      transfers electrons across the inner membrane, by using a redox-active NMR
      sample. The two cysteine positions in CcdA are separated by 20 A. Whereas one is 
      accessible to the cytoplasm, the other resides in the protein core, thus implying
      that conformational exchange is required for periplasmic accessibility. In vivo
      mixed disulfide-trapping experiments validated the functional positioning of the 
      cysteines, and in vitro accessibility results confirmed conformational exchange. 
      Our NMR and functional data together show the existence of multiple
      conformational states and suggest a four-state model for relaying electrons from 
      cytosolic to periplasmic redox substrates.

TI  - Structure of a prokaryotic fumarate transporter reveals the architecture of the
      SLC26 family.
PG  - 803-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3091 [doi]
AB  - The SLC26 family of membrane proteins combines a variety of functions within a
      conserved molecular scaffold. Its members, besides coupled anion transporters and
      channels, include the motor protein Prestin, which confers electromotility to
      cochlear outer hair cells. To gain insight into the architecture of this protein 
      family, we characterized the structure and function of SLC26Dg, a facilitator of 
      proton-coupled fumarate symport, from the bacterium Deinococcus geothermalis. Its
      modular structure combines a transmembrane unit and a cytoplasmic STAS domain.
      The membrane-inserted domain consists of two intertwined inverted repeats of
      seven transmembrane segments each and resembles the fold of the unrelated
      transporter UraA. It shows an inward-facing, ligand-free conformation with a
      potential substrate-binding site at the interface between two helix termini at
      the center of the membrane. This structure defines the common framework for the
      diverse functional behavior of the SLC26 family.

TI  - miR-128 represses L1 retrotransposition by binding directly to L1 RNA.
PG  - 824-31
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3090 [doi]
AB  - Long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons compose 17% of the
      human genome. Active L1 elements are capable of replicative transposition
      (mobilization) and can act as drivers of genetic diversity. However, this
      mobilization is mutagenic and may be detrimental to the host, and therefore it is
      under strict control. Somatic cells usually silence L1 activity by DNA
      methylation of the L1 promoter. In hypomethylated cells, such as cancer cells and
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a window of opportunity for L1
      reactivation emerges, and with it comes an increased risk of genomic instability 
      and tumorigenesis. Here we show that miR-128 represses new retrotransposition
      events in human cancer cells and iPSCs by binding directly to L1 RNA. Thus, we
      have identified and characterized a new function of microRNAs: mediating genomic 
      stability by suppressing the mobility of endogenous retrotransposons.

PG  - 795-802
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3087 [doi]
AB  - Chaperones increase the folding yields of soluble proteins by suppressing
      misfolding and aggregation, but how they modulate the folding of integral
      membrane proteins is not well understood. Here we use single-molecule force
      spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy to observe the periplasmic holdase chaperones
      SurA and Skp shaping the folding trajectory of the large beta-barrel
      outer-membrane receptor FhuA from Escherichia coli. Either chaperone prevents
      FhuA from misfolding by stabilizing a dynamic, unfolded state, thus allowing the 
      substrate to search for structural intermediates. During this search, the
      SurA-chaperoned FhuA polypeptide inserts beta-hairpins into the membrane in a
      stepwise manner until the beta-barrel is folded. The membrane acts as a
      free-energy sink for beta-hairpin insertion and physically separates transient
      folds from chaperones. This stabilization of dynamic unfolded states and the
      trapping of folding intermediates funnel the FhuA polypeptide toward the native
      conformation.

      transport channel.
PG  - 774-81
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3084 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate transport between the nucleus and
      cytoplasm. NPCs are composed of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), most of
      which are organized in stable subcomplexes. How these modules are interconnected 
      within the large NPC framework has been unknown. Here we show a mechanism of how 
      supercomplexes can form between NPC modules. The Nup192 inner-pore-ring complex
      serves as a seed to which the Nup82 outer-ring complex and Nsp1 channel complex
      are tethered. The linkage between these subcomplexes is generated by short
      sequences within linker Nups. The conserved Nup145N is the most versatile
      connector of NPC modules because it has three discrete binding sites for Nup192, 
      Nup170 and Nup82. We assembled a large part of a Chaetomium thermophilum NPC
      protomer in vitro, providing a step forward toward the reconstitution of the
      entire NPC.

TI  - Translational arrest by a prokaryotic signal recognition particle is mediated by 
      RNA interactions.
PG  - 767-73
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3086 [doi]
AB  - The signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes signal sequences of nascent
      polypeptides and targets ribosome-nascent chain complexes to membrane
      translocation sites. In eukaryotes, translating ribosomes are slowed down by the 
      Alu domain of SRP to allow efficient targeting. In prokaryotes, however, little
      is known about the structure and function of Alu domain-containing SRPs. Here, we
      report a complete molecular model of SRP from the Gram-positive bacterium
      Bacillus subtilis, based on cryo-EM. The SRP comprises two subunits, 6S RNA and
      SRP54 or Ffh, and it facilitates elongation slowdown similarly to its eukaryotic 
      counterpart. However, protein contacts with the small ribosomal subunit observed 
      for the mammalian Alu domain are substituted in bacteria by RNA-RNA interactions 
      of 6S RNA with the alpha-sarcin-ricin loop and helices H43 and H44 of 23S rRNA.
      Our findings provide a structural basis for cotranslational targeting and
      RNA-driven elongation arrest in prokaryotes.

TI  - Histone monoubiquitination by Clock-Bmal1 complex marks Per1 and Per2 genes for
      circadian feedback.
PG  - 759-66
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3076 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms in mammals are driven by a feedback loop in which the
      transcription factor Clock-Bmal1 activates expression of Per and Cry proteins,
      which together form a large nuclear complex (Per complex) that represses
      Clock-Bmal1 activity. We found that mouse Clock-Bmal1 recruits the Ddb1-Cullin-4 
      ubiquitin ligase to Per (Per1 and Per2), Cry (Cry1 and Cry2) and other circadian 
      target genes. Histone H2B monoubiquitination at Per genes was rhythmic and
      depended on Bmal1, Ddb1 and Cullin-4a. Depletion of Ddb1-Cullin-4a or an
      independent decrease in H2B monoubiquitination caused defective circadian
      feedback and decreased the association of the Per complex with DNA-bound
      Clock-Bmal1. Clock-Bmal1 thus covalently marks Per genes for subsequent
      recruitment of the Per complex. Our results reveal a chromatin-mediated signal
      from the positive to the negative limb of the clock that provides a licensing
      mechanism for circadian feedback.

TI  - Structural basis for specific recognition of single-stranded RNA by Toll-like
      receptor 13.
PG  - 782-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3080 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have crucial roles in innate immunity, functioning as 
      pattern-recognition receptors. TLR13 recognizes a conserved sequence from
      bacterial 23S rRNA and then triggers an immune response. Here we report the
      crystal structure of the mouse TLR13 ectodomain bound by a 13-nt single-stranded 
      (ss) RNA derived from 23S rRNA. The ssRNA induces TLR13 dimerization but assumes 
      a stem-loop-like structure that is completely different from that in the
      bacterial ribosome but nevertheless is crucial for TLR13 recognition. Most of the
      RNA nucleotides are splayed out to make base-specific contacts with the concave
      surface of TLR13, and RNA-specific interactions are important to allow TLR13 to
      distinguish RNA from DNA. Interestingly, a viral-derived 16-nt ssRNA predicted to
      form a similar stem-loop-like structure also induces TLR13 activation. Together, 
      our results reveal the structural mechanism of TLR13's sequence- and
      conformation-specific recognition of ssRNA.

TI  - Charting oxidized methylcytosines at base resolution.
PG  - 656-61
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3071 [doi]
AB  - DNA cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic mark that is required for normal
      mammalian development. Iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by the TET
      family of DNA dioxygenases generates three oxidized nucleotides:
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine
      (5caC). Recent advances in genomic mapping techniques have suggested that these
      oxidized cytosines not only function in the process of active reversal of 5mC but
      also may possess unique regulatory functions in the mammalian genome.

TI  - Ubp6 deubiquitinase controls conformational dynamics and substrate degradation of
      the 26S proteasome.
PG  - 712-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3075 [doi]
AB  - Substrates are targeted for proteasomal degradation through the attachment of
      ubiquitin chains that need to be removed by proteasomal deubiquitinases before
      substrate processing. In budding yeast, the deubiquitinase Ubp6 trims ubiquitin
      chains and affects substrate processing by the proteasome, but the underlying
      mechanisms and the location of Ubp6 within the holoenzyme have been elusive. Here
      we show that Ubp6 activity strongly responds to interactions with the base ATPase
      and the conformational state of the proteasome. Electron microscopy analyses
      reveal that ubiquitin-bound Ubp6 contacts the N ring and AAA+ ring of the ATPase 
      hexamer and is in proximity to the deubiquitinase Rpn11. Ubiquitin-bound Ubp6
      inhibits substrate deubiquitination by Rpn11, stabilizes the substrate-engaged
      conformation of the proteasome and allosterically interferes with the engagement 
      of a subsequent substrate. Ubp6 may thus act as a ubiquitin-dependent 'timer' to 
      coordinate individual processing steps at the proteasome and modulate substrate
      degradation.

      two RNA subdomains.
PG  - 679-85
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3073 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial alarmone 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside 5'-triphosphate
      (AICAR triphosphate or ZTP), derived from the monophosphorylated purine precursor
      ZMP, accumulates during folate starvation. ZTP regulates genes involved in purine
      and folate metabolism through a cognate riboswitch. The linker connecting this
      riboswitch's two subdomains varies in length by over 100 nucleotides. We report
      the cocrystal structure of the Fusobacterium ulcerans riboswitch bound to ZMP,
      which spans the two subdomains whose interface also comprises a pseudoknot and
      ribose zipper. The riboswitch recognizes the carboxamide oxygen of ZMP through an
      unprecedented inner-sphere coordination with a Mg(2+) ion. We show that the
      affinity of the riboswitch for ZMP is modulated by the linker length. Notably,
      ZMP can simultaneously bind to the two subdomains even when they are synthesized 
      as separate RNAs. The ZTP riboswitch demonstrates how specific small-molecule
      binding can drive association of distant noncoding-RNA domains to regulate gene
      expression.

TI  - Recruitment and activation of the ATM kinase in the absence of DNA-damage
      sensors.
PG  - 736-43
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3072 [doi]
AB  - Two kinases, ATM and DNA-PKcs, control rapid responses to DNA double-strand
      breaks (DSBs). The paradigm for ATM control is recruitment and activation by the 
      Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 (MRN) sensor complex, whereas DNA-PKcs requires the sensor Ku
      (Ku70-Ku80). Using mouse cells containing targeted mutant alleles of Mre11
      (Mre11a) and/or Ku70 (Xrcc6), together with pharmacologic kinase inhibition, we
      demonstrate that ATM can be activated by DSBs in the absence of MRN. When MRN is 
      deficient, DNA-PKcs efficiently substitutes for ATM in facilitating local
      chromatin responses. In the absence of both MRN and Ku, ATM is recruited to
      chromatin, where it phosphorylates H2AX and triggers the G2-M cell-cycle
      checkpoint, but the DNA-repair functions of MRN are not restored. These results
      suggest that, in contrast to straightforward recruitment and activation by MRN, a
      complex interplay between sensors has a substantial role in ATM control.

TI  - Structure and mechanism of activity-based inhibition of the EGF receptor by Mig6.
PG  - 703-711
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3074 [doi]
AB  - Mig6 is a feedback inhibitor that directly binds, inhibits and drives
      internalization of ErbB-family receptors. Mig6 selectively targets activated
      receptors. Here we found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      phosphorylates Mig6 on Y394 and that this phosphorylation is primed by prior
      phosphorylation of an adjacent residue, Y395, by Src. Crystal structures of human
      EGFR-Mig6 complexes reveal the structural basis for enhanced phosphorylation of
      primed Mig6 and show how Mig6 rearranges after phosphorylation by EGFR to
      effectively irreversibly inhibit the same receptor that catalyzed its
      phosphorylation. This dual phosphorylation site allows Mig6 to inactivate EGFR in
      a manner that requires activation of the target receptor and that can be
      modulated by Src. Loss of Mig6 is a driving event in human cancer; analysis of
      1,057 gliomas reveals frequent focal deletions of ERRFI1, the gene that encodes
      Mig6, in EGFR-amplified glioblastomas.

TI  - Probing Galphai1 protein activation at single-amino acid resolution.
PG  - 686-694
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3070 [doi]
AB  - We present comprehensive maps at single-amino acid resolution of the residues
      stabilizing the human Galphai1 subunit in nucleotide- and receptor-bound states. 
      We generated these maps by measuring the effects of alanine mutations on the
      stability of Galphai1 and the rhodopsin-Galphai1 complex. We identified
      stabilization clusters in the GTPase and helical domains responsible for
      structural integrity and the conformational changes associated with activation.
      In activation cluster I, helices alpha1 and alpha5 pack against strands
      beta1-beta3 to stabilize the nucleotide-bound states. In the receptor-bound
      state, these interactions are replaced by interactions between alpha5 and strands
      beta4-beta6. Key residues in this cluster are Y320, which is crucial for the
      stabilization of the receptor-bound state, and F336, which stabilizes
      nucleotide-bound states. Destabilization of helix alpha1, caused by rearrangement
      of this activation cluster, leads to the weakening of the interdomain interface
      and release of GDP.

TI  - Structure of Rab11-FIP3-Rabin8 reveals simultaneous binding of FIP3 and Rabin8
      effectors to Rab11.
PG  - 695-702
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3065 [doi]
AB  - The small GTPase Rab11 and its effectors FIP3 and Rabin8 are essential to
      membrane-trafficking pathways required for cytokinesis and ciliogenesis. Although
      effector binding is generally assumed to be sequential and mutually exclusive, we
      show that Rab11 can simultaneously bind FIP3 and Rabin8. We determined crystal
      structures of human Rab11-GMPPNP-Rabin8 and Rab11-GMPPNP-FIP3-Rabin8. The
      structures reveal that the C-terminal domain of Rabin8 adopts a previously
      undescribed fold that interacts with Rab11 at an unusual effector-binding site
      neighboring the canonical FIP3-binding site. We show that
      Rab11-GMPPNP-FIP3-Rabin8 is more stable than Rab11-GMPPNP-Rabin8, owing to direct
      interaction between Rabin8 and FIP3 within the dual effector-bound complex. The
      data allow us to propose a model for how membrane-targeting complexes assemble at
      the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes, through multiple weak
      interactions that create high-avidity complexes.

TI  - Crystal structures of the PsbS protein essential for photoprotection in plants.
PG  - 729-35
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3068 [doi]
AB  - The photosystem II protein PsbS has an essential role in qE-type nonphotochemical
      quenching, which protects plants from photodamage under excess light conditions. 
      qE is initiated by activation of PsbS by low pH, but the mechanism of PsbS action
      remains elusive. Here we report the low-pH crystal structures of PsbS from
      spinach in its free form and in complex with the qE inhibitor
      N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), revealing that PsbS adopts a unique folding
      pattern, and, unlike other members of the light-harvesting-complex superfamily,
      it is a noncanonical pigment-binding protein. Structural and biochemical evidence
      shows that both active and inactive PsbS form homodimers in the thylakoid
      membranes, and DCCD binding disrupts the lumenal intermolecular hydrogen bonds of
      the active PsbS dimer. Activation of PsbS by low pH during qE may involve a
      conformational change associated with altered lumenal intermolecular interactions
      of the PsbS dimer.

TI  - Early embryonic-like cells are induced by downregulating replication-dependent
      chromatin assembly.
PG  - 662-71
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3066 [doi]
AB  - Cellular plasticity is essential for early embryonic cells. Unlike pluripotent
      cells, which form embryonic tissues, totipotent cells can generate a complete
      organism including embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Cells resembling
      2-cell-stage embryos (2C-like cells) arise at very low frequency in embryonic
      stem (ES) cell cultures. Although induced reprogramming to pluripotency is well
      established, totipotent cells remain poorly characterized, and whether
      reprogramming to totipotency is possible is unknown. We show that mouse 2C-like
      cells can be induced in vitro through downregulation of the chromatin-assembly
      activity of CAF-1. Endogenous retroviruses and genes specific to 2-cell embryos
      are the highest-upregulated genes upon CAF-1 knockdown. Emerging 2C-like cells
      exhibit molecular characteristics of 2-cell embryos and higher reprogrammability 
      than ES cells upon nuclear transfer. Our results suggest that early
      embryonic-like cells can be induced by modulating chromatin assembly and that
      atypical histone deposition may trigger the emergence of totipotent cells.

TI  - The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD.
PG  - 672-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3064 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces necrosis of infected cells to evade
      immune responses. Recently, we found that Mtb uses the protein CpnT to kill human
      macrophages by secreting its C-terminal domain, named tuberculosis necrotizing
      toxin (TNT), which induces necrosis by an unknown mechanism. Here we show that
      TNT gains access to the cytosol of Mtb-infected macrophages, where it hydrolyzes 
      the essential coenzyme NAD(+). Expression or injection of a noncatalytic TNT
      mutant showed no cytotoxicity in macrophages or in zebrafish zygotes,
      respectively, thus demonstrating that the NAD(+) glycohydrolase activity is
      required for TNT-induced cell death. To prevent self-poisoning, Mtb produces an
      immunity factor for TNT (IFT) that binds TNT and inhibits its activity. The
      crystal structure of the TNT-IFT complex revealed a new NAD(+) glycohydrolase
      fold of TNT, the founding member of a toxin family widespread in pathogenic
      microorganisms.

TI  - Structure and mechanism of the Rubisco-assembly chaperone Raf1.
PG  - 720-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3062 [doi]
AB  - Biogenesis of the photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco, a complex of eight large (RbcL) 
      and eight small (RbcS) subunits, requires assembly chaperones. Here we analyzed
      the role of Rubisco accumulation factor1 (Raf1), a dimer of approximately 40-kDa 
      subunits. We find that Raf1 from Synechococcus elongatus acts downstream of
      chaperonin-assisted RbcL folding by stabilizing RbcL antiparallel dimers for
      assembly into RbcL8 complexes with four Raf1 dimers bound. Raf1 displacement by
      RbcS results in holoenzyme formation. Crystal structures show that Raf1 from
      Arabidopsis thaliana consists of a beta-sheet dimerization domain and a flexibly 
      linked alpha-helical domain. Chemical cross-linking and EM reconstruction
      indicate that the beta-domains bind along the equator of each RbcL2 unit, and the
      alpha-helical domains embrace the top and bottom edges of RbcL2. Raf1 fulfills a 
      role similar to that of the assembly chaperone RbcX, thus suggesting that
      functionally redundant factors ensure efficient Rubisco biogenesis.

TI  - The active site of O-GlcNAc transferase imposes constraints on substrate
      sequence.
PG  - 744-750
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3063 [doi]
AB  - O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) glycosylates a diverse range of intracellular proteins
      with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), an essential and dynamic
      post-translational modification in metazoans. Although this enzyme modifies
      hundreds of proteins with O-GlcNAc, it is not understood how OGT achieves
      substrate specificity. In this study, we describe the application of a
      high-throughput OGT assay to a library of peptides. We mapped sites of O-GlcNAc
      modification by electron transfer dissociation MS and found that they correlate
      with previously detected O-GlcNAc sites. Crystal structures of four acceptor
      peptides in complex with Homo sapiens OGT suggest that a combination of size and 
      conformational restriction defines sequence specificity in the -3 to +2 subsites.
      This work reveals that although the N-terminal TPR repeats of OGT may have roles 
      in substrate recognition, the sequence restriction imposed by the peptide-binding
      site makes a substantial contribution to O-GlcNAc site specificity.

TI  - Structural basis for plasmepsin V inhibition that blocks export of malaria
      proteins to human erythrocytes.
PG  - 590-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3061 [doi]
AB  - Plasmepsin V, an essential aspartyl protease of malaria parasites, has a key role
      in the export of effector proteins to parasite-infected erythrocytes.
      Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria
      parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. We developed a
      potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the
      Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). WEHI-842 inhibits recombinant plasmepsin V
      with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 nM, efficiently blocks
      protein export and inhibits parasite growth. We obtained the structure of P.
      vivax plasmepsin V in complex with WEHI-842 to 2.4-A resolution, which provides
      an explanation for the strict requirements for substrate and inhibitor binding.
      The structure characterizes both a plant-like fold and a malaria-specific
      helix-turn-helix motif that are likely to be important in cleavage of effector
      substrates for export.

TI  - Structure of human ST8SiaIII sialyltransferase provides insight into cell-surface
      polysialylation.
PG  - 627-35
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3060 [doi]
AB  - Sialyltransferases of the mammalian ST8Sia family catalyze oligo- and
      polysialylation of surface-localized glycoproteins and glycolipids through
      transfer of sialic acids from CMP-sialic acid to the nonreducing ends of sialic
      acid acceptors. The crystal structure of human ST8SiaIII at 1.85-A resolution
      presented here is, to our knowledge, the first solved structure of a
      polysialyltransferase from any species, and it reveals a cluster of
      polysialyltransferase-specific structural motifs that collectively provide an
      extended electropositive surface groove for binding of oligo-polysialic acid
      chain products. The ternary complex of ST8SiaIII with a donor sugar analog and a 
      sulfated glycan acceptor identified with a sialyltransferase glycan array
      provides insight into the residues involved in substrate binding, specificity and
      sialyl transfer.

AB  - During DNA replication, chromatin is reassembled by recycling of modified old
      histones and deposition of new ones. How histone dynamics integrates with DNA
      replication to maintain genome and epigenome information remains unclear. Here,
      we reveal how human MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, chaperones histones
      H3-H4. Our first structure shows an H3-H4 tetramer bound by two MCM2
      histone-binding domains (HBDs), which hijack interaction sites used by
      nucleosomal DNA. Our second structure reveals MCM2 and ASF1 cochaperoning an
      H3-H4 dimer. Mutational analyses show that the MCM2 HBD is required for MCM2-7
      histone-chaperone function and normal cell proliferation. Further, we show that
      MCM2 can chaperone both new and old canonical histones H3-H4 as well as H3.3 and 
      CENPA variants. The unique histone-binding mode of MCM2 thus endows the
      replicative helicase with ideal properties for recycling histones genome wide
      during DNA replication.

AB  - Flexible filamentous plant viruses cause more than half the viral crop damage in 
      the world but are also potentially useful for biotechnology. Structural studies
      began more than 75 years ago but have failed, owing to the virion's extreme
      flexibility. We have used cryo-EM to generate an atomic model for bamboo mosaic
      virus, which reveals flexible N- and C-terminal extensions that allow deformation
      while still maintaining structural integrity.

      dispersion.
PG  - 636-41
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3059 [doi]
AB  - The ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) transports ADP and ATP across the inner mitochondrial
      membrane. Unlike most transporters, which have two-fold direct or inverted
      quasisymmetry, AAC has apparent three-fold rotational symmetry. Further, its
      transport rate is relatively fast for transporters that carry large solutes.
      Here, we study the yeast AAC carrier 3 by obtaining comprehensive NMR relaxation 
      dispersion measurements, which provide residue-specific information on the
      protein's conformational exchange. Our data indicate that AAC is predominantly in
      the cytosol-facing open state and converts to a sparsely populated state in an
      asymmetric manner despite its three-fold structural symmetry. Binding of the
      substrate ADP substantially increases the rate of conformational exchange,
      whereas the inhibitor CATR slows the exchange. These results suggest that
      although the transporter catalyzes the translocation of substrate the substrate
      also facilitates interconversion between alternating states, and this
      interconversion may be relevant to the transport function.

TI  - SR protein kinases promote splicing of nonconsensus introns.
PG  - 611-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3057 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorylation of the spliceosome is essential for RNA splicing, yet how and to 
      what extent kinase signaling affects splicing have not been defined on a
      genome-wide basis. Using a chemical genetic approach, we show in
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe that the SR protein kinase Dsk1 is required for
      efficient splicing of introns with suboptimal splice sites. Systematic substrate 
      mapping in fission yeast and human cells revealed that SRPKs target
      evolutionarily conserved spliceosomal proteins, including the branchpoint-binding
      protein Bpb1 (SF1 in humans), by using an RXXSP consensus motif for substrate
      recognition. Phosphorylation of SF1 increases SF1 binding to introns with
      nonconsensus splice sites in vitro, and mutation of such sites to consensus
      relieves the requirement for Dsk1 and phosphorylated Bpb1 in vivo. Modulation of 
      splicing efficiency through kinase signaling pathways may allow tuning of gene
      expression in response to environmental and developmental cues.

AB  - RING E3 ligase-catalyzed formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains by the
      Ube2V2-Ubc13 E2 complex is required in many important biological processes. Here 
      we report the structure of the RING-domain dimer of rat RNF4 in complex with a
      human Ubc13 approximately Ub conjugate and Ube2V2. The structure has captured
      Ube2V2 bound to the acceptor (priming) ubiquitin with K63 in a position favorable
      for attack on the linkage between Ubc13 and the donor (second) ubiquitin held in 
      the active 'folded back' conformation by the RING domain of RNF4. We verified the
      interfaces identified in the structure by in vitro ubiquitination assays of
      site-directed mutants. To our knowledge, this represents the first view of
      synthesis of K63-linked ubiquitin chains in which both substrate ubiquitin and
      ubiquitin-loaded E2 are juxtaposed to allow E3 ligase-mediated catalysis.

TI  - Recognition of microbial glycans by human intelectin-1.
PG  - 603-10
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3053 [doi]
AB  - The glycans displayed on mammalian cells can differ markedly from those on
      microbes. Such differences could, in principle, be 'read' by carbohydrate-binding
      proteins, or lectins. We used glycan microarrays to show that human intelectin-1 
      (hIntL-1) does not bind known human glycan epitopes but does interact with
      multiple glycan epitopes found exclusively on microbes: beta-linked
      D-galactofuranose (beta-Galf), D-phosphoglycerol-modified glycans, heptoses,
      D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KO) and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid
      (KDO). The 1.6-A-resolution crystal structure of hIntL-1 complexed with beta-Galf
      revealed that hIntL-1 uses a bound calcium ion to coordinate terminal exocyclic
      1,2-diols. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a sialic acid widespread in human
      glycans, has an exocyclic 1,2-diol but does not bind hIntL-1, probably owing to
      unfavorable steric and electronic effects. hIntL-1 marks only Streptococcus
      pneumoniae serotypes that display surface glycans with terminal 1,2-diol groups. 
      This ligand selectivity suggests that hIntL-1 functions in microbial
      surveillance.

TI  - Crystal structure of human stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in complex with
      substrate.
PG  - 581-5
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3049 [doi]
AB  - Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) has an important role in lipid
      metabolism, and SCD1 inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents for the
      treatment of metabolic diseases and cancers. Here we report the 3.25-A crystal
      structure of human SCD1 in complex with its substrate, stearoyl-coenzyme A, which
      defines the new SCD1 dimetal catalytic center and reveals the determinants of
      substrate binding to provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of
      desaturation of the stearoyl moiety. The structure also provides a mechanism for 
      localization of SCD1 in the endoplasmic reticulum: human SCD1 folds around a
      tight hydrophobic core formed from four long alpha-helices that presumably
      function as an anchor spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Furthermore,
      our results provide a framework for the rational design of pharmacological
      inhibitors targeting the SCD1 enzyme.

TI  - Small-RNA asymmetry is directly driven by mammalian Argonautes.
PG  - 512-21
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3050 [doi]
AB  - Asymmetric selection of single-stranded guide RNAs from double-stranded RNA
      precursors is crucial in RNA silencing-mediated gene regulation. However, the
      precise mechanisms of small-RNA asymmetry are unclear, especially because
      asymmetric selection can still occur when the putative asymmetry sensors
      Drosophila R2D2 and mammalian Dicer are depleted. Here we report a direct
      contribution of mammalian Argonaute 2 (Ago2) to microRNA (miRNA) asymmetry. Ago2 
      selects strands with 5'-uridine or 5'-adenosine and thermodynamically unstable 5'
      ends in parallel through its two sensor regions, which contact the 5' nucleobases
      and 5'-phosphates of prospective guide strands. Hence, miRNA asymmetry shows
      superposed patterns reflecting 5'-end nucleotide identity ('digital' pattern) and
      thermodynamic stability ('analog' pattern). Furthermore, we demonstrate that
      cancer-associated miRNA variations reprogram asymmetric selection. Finally, our
      study presents a model of this universal principle, to aid in comprehensive
      understanding of miRNA function and development of new RNA-silencing therapies in
      precision medicine.

PG  - 522-31
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3051 [doi]
AB  - As the sole viral antigen on the HIV-1-virion surface, trimeric Env is a focus of
      vaccine efforts. Here we present the structure of the ligand-free HIV-1-Env
      trimer, fix its conformation and determine its receptor interactions. Epitope
      analyses revealed trimeric ligand-free Env to be structurally compatible with
      broadly neutralizing antibodies but not poorly neutralizing ones. We coupled
      these compatibility considerations with binding antigenicity to engineer
      conformationally fixed Envs, including a 201C 433C (DS) variant specifically
      recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. DS-Env retained nanomolar affinity
      for the CD4 receptor, with which it formed an asymmetric intermediate: a closed
      trimer bound by a single CD4 without the typical antigenic hallmarks of CD4
      induction. Antigenicity-guided structural design can thus be used both to
      delineate mechanism and to fix conformation, with DS-Env trimers in
      virus-like-particle and soluble formats providing a new generation of vaccine
      antigens.

PG  - 532-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3048 [doi]
AB  - Mosquito-based malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (mTBVs) target
      midgut-surface antigens of the Plasmodium parasite's obligate vector, the
      Anopheles mosquito. The alanyl aminopeptidase N (AnAPN1) is the leading mTBV
      immunogen; however, AnAPN1's role in Plasmodium infection of the mosquito and how
      anti-AnAPN1 antibodies functionally block parasite transmission have remained
      elusive. Here we present the 2.65-A crystal structure of AnAPN1 and the
      immunoreactivity and transmission-blocking profiles of three monoclonal
      antibodies (mAbs) to AnAPN1, including mAb 4H5B7, which effectively blocks
      transmission of natural strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Using the AnAPN1
      structure, we map the conformation-dependent 4H5B7 neoepitope to a previously
      uncharacterized region on domain 1 and further demonstrate that nonhuman-primate 
      neoepitope-specific IgG also blocks parasite transmission. We discuss the
      prospect of a new biological function of AnAPN1 as a receptor for Plasmodium in
      the mosquito midgut and the implications for redesigning the AnAPN1 mTBV.

TI  - ATP binding drives substrate capture in an ECF transporter by a release-and-catch
      mechanism.
PG  - 565-71
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3040 [doi]
AB  - ECF transporters are a family of active transporters for vitamins. They are
      composed of four subunits: a membrane-embedded substrate-binding subunit (EcfS), 
      a transmembrane coupling subunit (EcfT) and two ATP-binding-cassette ATPases
      (EcfA and EcfA'). We have investigated the mechanism of the ECF transporter for
      riboflavin from the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, LmECF-RibU. Using structural
      and biochemical approaches, we found that ATP binding to the EcfAA' ATPases
      drives a conformational change that dissociates the S subunit from the EcfAA'T
      ECF module. Upon release from the ECF module, the RibU S subunit then binds the
      riboflavin transport substrate. We also find that S subunits for distinct
      substrates compete for the ATP-bound state of the ECF module. Our results explain
      how ECF transporters capture the transport substrate and reproduce the in vivo
      observations on S-subunit competition for which the family was named.

TI  - The pilus usher controls protein interactions via domain masking and is
      functional as an oligomer.
PG  - 540-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3044 [doi]
AB  - The chaperone-usher (CU) pathway assembles organelles termed pili or fimbriae in 
      Gram-negative bacteria. Type 1 pili expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli
      are prototypical structures assembled by the CU pathway. Biogenesis of pili by
      the CU pathway requires a periplasmic chaperone and an outer-membrane protein
      termed the usher (FimD). We show that the FimD C-terminal domains provide the
      high-affinity substrate-binding site but that these domains are masked in the
      resting usher. Domain masking requires the FimD plug domain, which serves as a
      switch controlling usher activation. We demonstrate that usher molecules can act 
      in trans for pilus biogenesis, providing conclusive evidence for a functional
      usher oligomer. These results reveal mechanisms by which molecular machines such 
      as the usher regulate and harness protein-protein interactions and suggest that
      ushers may interact in a cooperative manner during pilus assembly in bacteria.

TI  - Structure of the Atg101-Atg13 complex reveals essential roles of Atg101 in
      autophagy initiation.
PG  - 572-80
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3036 [doi]
AB  - Atg101 is an essential component of the autophagy-initiating ULK complex in
      higher eukaryotes, but it is absent from the functionally equivalent Atg1 complex
      in budding yeast. Here, we report the crystal structure of the fission yeast
      Atg101-Atg13 complex. Atg101 has a Hop1, Rev7 and Mad2 (HORMA) architecture
      similar to that of Atg13. Mad2 HORMA has two distinct conformations (O-Mad2 and
      C-Mad2), and, intriguingly, Atg101 resembles O-Mad2 rather than the C-Mad2-like
      Atg13. Atg13 HORMA from higher eukaryotes possesses an inherently unstable fold, 
      which is stabilized by Atg101 via interactions analogous to those between O-Mad2 
      and C-Mad2. Mutational studies revealed that Atg101 is responsible for recruiting
      downstream factors to the autophagosome-formation site in mammals via a newly
      identified WF finger. These data define the molecular functions of Atg101,
      providing a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mammalian autophagy
      initiation by the ULK complex.

TI  - Syntaxin opening by the MUN domain underlies the function of Munc13 in
      synaptic-vesicle priming.
PG  - 547-54
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3038 [doi]
AB  - UNC-13-Munc13s have a central function in synaptic-vesicle priming through their 
      MUN domains. However, it is unclear whether this function arises from the ability
      of the MUN domain to mediate the transition from the Munc18-1-closed syntaxin-1
      complex to the SNARE complex in vitro. The crystal structure of the rat Munc13-1 
      MUN domain now reveals an elongated, arch-shaped architecture formed by
      alpha-helical bundles, with a highly conserved hydrophobic pocket in the middle. 
      Mutation of two residues (NF) in this pocket abolishes the stimulation caused by 
      the Munc13-1 MUN domain on SNARE-complex assembly and on SNARE-dependent
      proteoliposome fusion in vitro. Moreover, the same mutation in UNC-13 abrogates
      synaptic-vesicle priming in Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions. These
      results support the notion that orchestration of syntaxin-1 opening and
      SNARE-complex assembly underlies the central role of UNC-13-Munc13s in
      synaptic-vesicle priming.

TI  - Dynamic binding mode of a Synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex in solution.
PG  - 555-64
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3035 [doi]
AB  - Rapid neurotransmitter release depends on the Ca2+ sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) 
      and the SNARE complex formed by synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. How Syt1
      triggers release has been unclear, partly because elucidating high-resolution
      structures of Syt1-SNARE complexes has been challenging. An NMR approach based on
      lanthanide-induced pseudocontact shifts now reveals a dynamic binding mode in
      which basic residues in the concave side of the Syt1 C2B-domain beta-sandwich
      interact with a polyacidic region of the SNARE complex formed by syntaxin-1 and
      SNAP-25. The physiological relevance of this dynamic structural model is
      supported by mutations in basic residues of Syt1 that markedly impair
      SNARE-complex binding in vitro and Syt1 function in neurons. Mutations with
      milder effects on binding have correspondingly milder effects on Syt1 function.
      Our results support a model whereby dynamic interaction facilitates cooperation
      between Syt1 and the SNAREs in inducing membrane fusion.

PG  - 442-51

AB  - DMRT transcription factors are deeply conserved regulators of metazoan sexual
      development. They share the DM DNA-binding domain, a unique intertwined double
      zinc-binding module followed by a C-terminal recognition helix, which binds a
      pseudopalindromic target DNA. Here we show that DMRT proteins use a unique
      binding interaction, inserting two adjacent antiparallel recognition helices into
      a widened DNA major groove to make base-specific contacts. Versatility in how
      specific base contacts are made allows human DMRT1 to use multiple DNA binding
      modes (tetramer, trimer and dimer). Chromatin immunoprecipitation with
      exonuclease treatment (ChIP-exo) indicates that multiple DNA binding modes also
      are used in vivo. We show that mutations affecting residues crucial for DNA
      recognition are associated with an intersex phenotype in flies and with
      male-to-female sex reversal in humans. Our results illuminate an ancient
      molecular interaction underlying much of metazoan sexual development.

PG  - 466-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3031 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a global health issue necessitating the
      development of new effective therapeutics. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides
      (PrAMPs), which include oncocins, are an extensively studied class of AMPs that
      counteract bacterial infection at submicromolar concentrations. Oncocins enter
      and kill bacteria by inhibiting certain targets rather than by acting through
      membrane lysis. Although they have recently been reported to bind DnaK and the
      bacterial ribosome, their mode of inhibition has remained elusive. Here we report
      the crystal structure of the oncocin derivative Onc112 bound to the Thermus
      thermophilus 70S ribosome. Strikingly, this 19-residue proline-rich peptide
      manifests the features of several known classes of ribosome inhibitors by
      simultaneously blocking the peptidyl transferase center and the peptide-exit
      tunnel of the ribosome. This high-resolution structure thus reveals the mechanism
      by which oncocins inhibit protein synthesis, providing an opportunity for
      structure-based design of new-generation therapeutics.

PG  - 470-5
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3034 [doi]
AB  - The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is making
      current antibiotics obsolete. Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs)
      display potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and thus represent an
      avenue for antibiotic development. PrAMPs from the oncocin family interact with
      the ribosome to inhibit translation, but their mode of action has remained
      unclear. Here we have determined a structure of the Onc112 peptide in complex
      with the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome at a resolution of 3.1 A by X-ray
      crystallography. The Onc112 peptide binds within the ribosomal exit tunnel and
      extends toward the peptidyl transferase center, where it overlaps with the
      binding site for an aminoacyl-tRNA. We show biochemically that the binding of
      Onc112 blocks and destabilizes the initiation complex, thus preventing entry into
      the elongation phase. Our findings provide a basis for the future development of 
      this class of potent antimicrobial agents.

PG  - 485-91
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3033 [doi]
AB  - The human APOBEC3G (A3G) DNA cytosine deaminase restricts and hypermutates
      DNA-based parasites including HIV-1. The viral infectivity factor (Vif) prevents 
      restriction by triggering A3G degradation. Although the structure of the A3G
      catalytic domain is known, the structure of the N-terminal Vif-binding domain has
      proven more elusive. Here, we used evolution- and structure-guided mutagenesis to
      solubilize the Vif-binding domain of A3G, thus permitting structural
      determination by NMR spectroscopy. A smaller zinc-coordinating pocket and altered
      helical packing distinguish the structure from previous catalytic-domain
      structures and help to explain the reported inactivity of this domain. This
      soluble A3G N-terminal domain is bound by Vif; this enabled mutagenesis and
      biochemical experiments, which identified a unique Vif-interacting surface formed
      by the alpha1-beta1, beta2-alpha2 and beta4-alpha4 loops. This structure sheds
      new light on the Vif-A3G interaction and provides critical information for future
      drug development.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3019 [doi]
AB  - We characterize in real time the composition and catalytic state of the initial
      Escherichia coli transcription-coupled repair (TCR) machinery by using
      correlative single-molecule methods. TCR initiates when RNA polymerase (RNAP)
      stalled by a lesion is displaced by the Mfd DNA translocase, thus giving repair
      components access to the damage. We previously used DNA nanomanipulation to
      obtain a nanomechanical readout of protein-DNA interactions during TCR
      initiation. Here we correlate this signal with simultaneous single-molecule
      fluorescence imaging of labeled components (RNAP, Mfd or RNA) to monitor the
      composition and localization of the complex. Displacement of stalled RNAP by Mfd 
      results in loss of nascent RNA but not of RNAP, which remains associated with Mfd
      as a long-lived complex on the DNA. This complex translocates at approximately 4 
      bp/s along the DNA, in a manner determined by the orientation of the stalled RNAP
      on the DNA.

AB  - Most antidepressants elicit their therapeutic benefits through selective blockade
      of Na(+)/Cl(-)-coupled neurotransmitter transporters. Here we report X-ray
      structures of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter in complexes with 
      the polycyclic antidepressants nisoxetine or reboxetine. The inhibitors stabilize
      the transporter in an outward-open conformation by occupying the
      substrate-binding site. These structures explain how interactions between the
      binding pocket and substituents on the aromatic rings of antidepressants modulate
      drug-transporter selectivity.

TI  - Cryptochrome 1 regulates the circadian clock through dynamic interactions with
      the BMAL1 C terminus.
PG  - 476-484
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3018 [doi]
AB  - The molecular circadian clock in mammals is generated from transcriptional
      activation by the bHLH-PAS transcription factor CLOCK-BMAL1 and subsequent
      repression by PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY). The mechanism by which CRYs repress 
      CLOCK-BMAL1 to close the negative feedback loop and generate 24-h timing is not
      known. Here we show that, in mouse fibroblasts, CRY1 competes for binding with
      coactivators to the intrinsically unstructured C-terminal transactivation domain 
      (TAD) of BMAL1 to establish a functional switch between activation and repression
      of CLOCK-BMAL1. TAD mutations that alter affinities for co-regulators affect the 
      balance of repression and activation to consequently change the intrinsic
      circadian period or eliminate cycling altogether. Our results suggest that CRY1
      fulfills its role as an essential circadian repressor by sequestering the TAD
      from coactivators, and they highlight regulation of the BMAL1 TAD as a critical
      mechanism for establishing circadian timing.

TI  - Abeta(1-42) fibril structure illuminates self-recognition and replication of
      amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 499-505
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2991 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence has suggested that formation and propagation of misfolded
      aggregates of 42-residue human amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42)), rather than of the
      more abundant Abeta(1-40), provokes the Alzheimer's disease cascade. However,
      structural details of misfolded Abeta(1-42) have remained elusive. Here we
      present the atomic model of an Abeta(1-42) amyloid fibril, from solid-state NMR
      (ssNMR) data. It displays triple parallel-beta-sheet segments that differ from
      reported structures of Abeta(1-40) fibrils. Remarkably, Abeta(1-40) is
      incompatible with the triple-beta-motif, because seeding with Abeta(1-42) fibrils
      does not promote conversion of monomeric Abeta(1-40) into fibrils via
      cross-replication. ssNMR experiments suggest that C-terminal Ala42, absent in
      Abeta(1-40), forms a salt bridge with Lys28 to create a self-recognition
      molecular switch that excludes Abeta(1-40). The results provide insight into the 
      Abeta(1-42)-selective self-replicating amyloid-propagation machinery in
      early-stage Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) control crucial processes including cell
      motility, adhesion, immune-cell regulation and systemic iron metabolism. RGMs
      signal via the neogenin (NEO1) and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways.
      Here, we report crystal structures of the N-terminal domains of all human RGM
      family members in complex with the BMP ligand BMP2, revealing a new protein fold 
      and a conserved BMP-binding mode. Our structural and functional data suggest a
      pH-linked mechanism for RGM-activated BMP signaling and offer a rationale for RGM
      mutations causing juvenile hemochromatosis. We also determined the crystal
      structure of the ternary BMP2-RGM-NEO1 complex, which, along with solution
      scattering and live-cell super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, indicates
      BMP-induced clustering of the RGM-NEO1 complex. Our results show how RGM acts as 
      the central hub that links BMP and NEO1 and physically connects these fundamental
      signaling pathways.

TI  - Vps4 disassembles an ESCRT-III filament by global unfolding and processive
      translocation.
PG  - 492-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3015 [doi]
AB  - The AAA+ ATPase Vps4 disassembles ESCRT-III and is essential for HIV-1 budding
      and other pathways. Vps4 is a paradigmatic member of a class of hexameric AAA+
      ATPases that disassemble protein complexes without degradation. To distinguish
      between local displacement versus global unfolding mechanisms for complex
      disassembly, we carried out hydrogen/deuterium exchange during Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae Vps4 disassembly of a chimeric Vps24-2 ESCRT-III filament. EX1
      exchange behavior shows that Vps4 completely unfolds ESCRT-III substrates on a
      time scale consistent with the disassembly reaction. The established unfoldase
      ClpX showed the same pattern, thus demonstrating a common unfolding mechanism.
      Vps4 hexamers containing a single cysteine residue in the pore loops were
      cross-linked to ESCRT-III subunits containing unique cysteines within the folded 
      core domain. These data support a mechanism in which Vps4 disassembles its
      substrates by completely unfolding them and threading them through the central
      pore.

TI  - Notch is a direct negative regulator of the DNA-damage response.
PG  - 417-24

AB  - The DNA-damage response (DDR) ensures genome stability and proper inheritance of 
      genetic information, both of which are essential to survival. It is presently
      unclear to what extent other signaling pathways modulate DDR function. Here we
      show that Notch receptor binds and inactivates ATM kinase and that this mechanism
      is evolutionarily conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis and humans.
      In C. elegans, the Notch pathway impairs DDR signaling in gonad germ cells. In
      mammalian cells, activation of human Notch1 leads to reduced ATM signaling in a
      manner independent of Notch1 transcriptional activity. Notch1 binds directly to
      the regulatory FATC domain of ATM and inhibits ATM kinase activity. Notch1 and
      ATM activation are inversely correlated in human breast cancers, and inactivation
      of ATM by Notch1 contributes to the survival of Notch1-driven leukemia cells upon
      DNA damage.

TI  - PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human 
      GPCRome.
PG  - 362-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3014 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential mediators of cellular signaling
      and are important targets of drug action. Of the approximately 350 nonolfactory
      human GPCRs, more than 100 are still considered to be 'orphans' because their
      endogenous ligands remain unknown. Here, we describe a unique open-source
      resource that allows interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome via a G
      protein-independent beta-arrestin-recruitment assay. We validate this unique
      platform at more than 120 nonorphan human GPCR targets, demonstrate its utility
      for discovering new ligands for orphan human GPCRs and describe a method
      (parallel receptorome expression and screening via transcriptional output, with
      transcriptional activation following arrestin translocation (PRESTO-Tango)) for
      the simultaneous and parallel interrogation of the entire human nonolfactory
      GPCRome.

TI  - Translational control of the cytosolic stress response by mitochondrial ribosomal
      protein L18.
PG  - 404-10
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3010 [doi]
AB  - In response to stress, cells attenuate global protein synthesis but permit
      efficient translation of mRNAs encoding heat-shock proteins (HSPs). Although
      decades have passed since the first description of the heat-shock response, how
      cells achieve translational control of HSP synthesis remains enigmatic. Here we
      report an unexpected role for mitochondrial ribosomal protein L18 (MRPL18) in the
      mammalian cytosolic stress response. MRPL18 bears a downstream CUG start codon
      and generates a cytosolic isoform in a stress-dependent manner. Cytosolic MRPL18 
      incorporates into the 80S ribosome and facilitates ribosome engagement on mRNAs
      selected for translation during stress. MRPL18 knockdown has minimal effects on
      mitochondrial function but substantially dampens cytosolic HSP expression at the 
      level of translation. Our results uncover a hitherto-uncharacterized
      stress-adaptation mechanism in mammalian cells, which involves formation of a
      'hybrid' ribosome responsible for translational regulation during the cytosolic
      stress response.

TI  - Subunit asymmetry and roles of conformational switching in the hexameric AAA+
      ring of ClpX.
PG  - 411-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3012 [doi]
AB  - The hexameric AAA+ ring of Escherichia coli ClpX, an ATP-dependent machine for
      protein unfolding and translocation, functions with the ClpP peptidase to degrade
      target substrates. For efficient function, ClpX subunits must switch between
      nucleotide-loadable (L) and nucleotide-unloadable (U) conformations, but the
      roles of switching are uncertain. Moreover, it is controversial whether working
      AAA+-ring enzymes assume symmetric or asymmetric conformations. Here, we show
      that a covalent ClpX ring with one subunit locked in the U conformation catalyzes
      robust ATP hydrolysis, with each unlocked subunit able to bind and hydrolyze ATP,
      albeit with highly asymmetric position-specific affinities. Preventing U<-->L
      interconversion in one subunit alters the cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis and
      reduces the efficiency of substrate binding, unfolding and degradation, showing
      that conformational switching enhances multiple aspects of wild-type ClpX
      function. These results support an asymmetric and probabilistic model of
      AAA+-ring activity.

TI  - A lncRNA regulates alternative splicing via establishment of a splicing-specific 
      chromatin signature.
PG  - 370-6
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3005 [doi]
AB  - Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a highly cell type-specific process essential to
      generating protein diversity. However, the mechanisms responsible for the
      establishment and maintenance of heritable cell-specific alternative-splicing
      programs are poorly understood. Recent observations point to a role of histone
      modifications in the regulation of alternative splicing. Here we report a new
      mechanism of chromatin-mediated splicing control involving a long noncoding RNA
      (lncRNA). We have identified an evolutionarily conserved nuclear antisense
      lncRNA, generated from within the human FGFR2 locus, that promotes
      epithelial-specific alternative splicing of FGFR2. The lncRNA acts through
      recruitment of Polycomb-group proteins and the histone demethylase KDM2a to
      create a chromatin environment that impairs binding of a repressive
      chromatin-splicing adaptor complex important for mesenchymal-specific splicing.
      Our results uncover a new function for lncRNAs in the establishment and
      maintenance of cell-specific alternative splicing via modulation of chromatin
      signatures.

TI  - Structural mechanism of integrin inactivation by filamin.
PG  - 383-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2999 [doi]
AB  - Activation of heterodimeric (alphabeta) integrin is crucial for regulating cell
      adhesion. Binding of talin to the cytoplasmic face of integrin activates the
      receptor, but how integrin is maintained in a resting state to counterbalance its
      activation has remained obscure. Here, we report the structure of the cytoplasmic
      domain of human integrin alphaIIbbeta3 bound to its inhibitor, the immunoglobin
      repeat 21 of filamin A (FLNa-Ig21). The structure reveals an unexpected ternary
      complex in which FLNa-Ig21 not only binds to the C terminus of the integrin beta3
      cytoplasmic tail (CT), as previously predicted, but also engages N-terminal
      helices of alphaIIb and beta3 CTs to stabilize an inter-CT clasp that helps
      restrain the integrin in a resting state. Combined with functional data, the
      structure reveals a new mechanism of filamin-mediated retention of inactive
      integrin, suggesting a new framework for understanding regulation of integrin
      activation and adhesion.

TI  - Crystal structure of a light-driven sodium pump.
PG  - 390-5
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3002 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the first known light-driven sodium pumps, from the microbial rhodopsin
      family, were discovered. We have solved the structure of one of them,
      Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2), in the monomeric blue state and in two 
      pentameric red states, at resolutions of 1.45 A and 2.2 and 2.8 A, respectively. 
      The structures reveal the ion-translocation pathway and show that the sodium ion 
      is bound outside the protein at the oligomerization interface, that the
      ion-release cavity is capped by a unique N-terminal alpha-helix and that the
      ion-uptake cavity is unexpectedly large and open to the surface. Obstruction of
      the cavity with the mutation G263F imparts KR2 with the ability to pump
      potassium. These results pave the way for the understanding and rational design
      of cation pumps with new specific properties valuable for optogenetics.

      II-transcribed genes.
PG  - 396-403
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3000 [doi]
AB  - Transcription through early-elongation checkpoints requires phosphorylation of
      negative transcription elongation factors (NTEFs) by the cyclin-dependent kinase 
      (CDK) 9. Using CDK9 inhibitors and global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), we have
      mapped CDK9 inhibitor-sensitive checkpoints genome wide in human cells. Our data 
      indicate that early-elongation checkpoints are a general feature of RNA
      polymerase (pol) II-transcribed human genes and occur independently of polymerase
      stalling. Pol II that has negotiated the early-elongation checkpoint can elongate
      in the presence of inhibitors but, remarkably, terminates transcription
      prematurely close to the terminal polyadenylation (poly(A)) site. Our analysis
      has revealed an unexpected poly(A)-associated elongation checkpoint, which has
      major implications for the regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, the
      pattern of modification of the C-terminal domain of pol II terminated at this new
      checkpoint largely mirrors the pattern normally found downstream of the poly(A)
      site, thus suggesting common mechanisms of termination.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2995 [doi]
AB  - R-type pyocins are representatives of contractile ejection systems, a class of
      biological nanomachines that includes, among others, the bacterial type VI
      secretion system (T6SS) and contractile bacteriophage tails. We report atomic
      models of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa precontraction pyocin sheath and tube, and
      the postcontraction sheath, obtained by cryo-EM at 3.5-A and 3.9-A resolutions,
      respectively. The central channel of the tube is negatively charged, in contrast 
      to the neutral and positive counterparts in T6SSs and phage tails. The sheath is 
      interwoven by long N- and C-terminal extension arms emanating from each subunit, 
      which create an extensive two-dimensional mesh that has the same connectivity in 
      the extended and contracted state of the sheath. We propose that the contraction 
      process draws energy from electrostatic and shape complementarities to insert the
      inner tube through bacterial cell membranes to eventually kill the bacteria.

TI  - Atomic structure of the Y complex of the nuclear pore.
PG  - 425-431
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2998 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the principal gateway for transport into and
      out of the nucleus. Selectivity is achieved through the hydrogel-like core of the
      NPC. The structural integrity of the NPC depends on ~15 architectural proteins,
      which are organized in distinct subcomplexes to form the >40-MDa ring-like
      structure. Here we present the 4.1-A crystal structure of a heterotetrameric core
      element ('hub') of the Y complex, the essential NPC building block, from
      Myceliophthora thermophila. Using the hub structure together with known Y-complex
      fragments, we built the entire ~0.5-MDa Y complex. Our data reveal that the
      conserved core of the Y complex has six rather than seven members. Evolutionarily
      distant Y-complex assemblies share a conserved core that is very similar in shape
      and dimension, thus suggesting that there are closely related architectural codes
      for constructing the NPC in all eukaryotes.

PG  - 277-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2997 [doi]
AB  - Pioneering studies in voltage-gated potassium channels have described movement of
      the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) S4 helix across the membrane electric field in
      molecular detail, but much less is known regarding opening of the intrinsic
      proton pore within VSDs of voltage-dependent proton channels. By systematically
      probing local kinematics, a new study reveals that movements in helix S1
      correlate with pore opening and are distinct from voltage-sensing movements of
      the charged S4 segment.

TI  - Human DNA polymerase theta grasps the primer terminus to mediate DNA repair.
PG  - 304-11
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2993 [doi]
AB  - DNA polymerase theta protects against genomic instability via an alternative
      end-joining repair pathway for DNA double-strand breaks. Polymerase theta is
      overexpressed in breast, lung and oral cancers, and reduction of its activity in 
      mammalian cells increases sensitivity to double-strand break-inducing agents,
      including ionizing radiation. Reported here are crystal structures of the
      C-terminal polymerase domain from human polymerase theta, illustrating two
      potential modes of dimerization. One structure depicts insertion of ddATP
      opposite an abasic-site analog during translesion DNA synthesis. The second
      structure describes a cognate ddGTP complex. Polymerase theta uses a specialized 
      thumb subdomain to establish unique upstream contacts to the primer DNA strand,
      including an interaction with the 3'-terminal phosphate from one of five
      distinctive insertion loops. These observations demonstrate how polymerase theta 
      grasps the primer to bypass DNA lesions or extend poorly annealed DNA termini to 
      mediate end-joining.

      we report crystal structures of human DNA polymerase nu (Pol nu), which is
      homologous to high-fidelity replicases yet is error prone. Instead of a simple
      open-to-closed movement of the O helix upon binding of a correct incoming
      nucleotide, Pol nu has a different open state and requires the finger domain to
      swing sideways and undergo both opening and closing motions to accommodate the
      nascent base pair. A single-amino acid substitution in the O helix of the finger 
      domain improves the fidelity of Pol nu nearly ten-fold. A unique cavity and the
      flexibility of the thumb domain allow Pol nu to generate and accommodate a
      looped-out primer strand. Primer loop-out may be a mechanism for DNA
      trinucloetide-repeat expansion.

TI  - High-resolution structure of the Escherichia coli ribosome.
PG  - 336-41
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2994 [doi]
AB  - Protein synthesis by the ribosome is highly dependent on the ionic conditions in 
      the cellular environment, but the roles of ribosome solvation have remained
      poorly understood. Moreover, the functions of modifications to ribosomal RNA and 
      ribosomal proteins have also been unclear. Here we present the structure of the
      Escherichia coli 70S ribosome at 2.4-A resolution. The structure reveals details 
      of the ribosomal subunit interface that are conserved in all domains of life, and
      it suggests how solvation contributes to ribosome integrity and function as well 
      as how the conformation of ribosomal protein uS12 aids in mRNA decoding. This
      structure helps to explain the phylogenetic conservation of key elements of the
      ribosome, including post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications,
      and should serve as a basis for future antibiotic development.

TI  - Evidence that processing of ribonucleotides in DNA by topoisomerase 1 is
      leading-strand specific.
PG  - 291-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2989 [doi]
AB  - Ribonucleotides incorporated during DNA replication are removed by RNase
      H2-dependent ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). In RER-defective yeast,
      topoisomerase 1 (Top1) incises DNA at unrepaired ribonucleotides, initiating
      their removal, but this is accompanied by RNA-DNA-damage phenotypes. Here we show
      that these phenotypes are incurred by a high level of ribonucleotides
      incorporated by a leading strand-replicase variant, DNA polymerase (Pol)
      varepsilon, but not by orthologous variants of the lagging-strand replicases,
      Pols alpha or delta. Moreover, loss of both RNases H1 and H2 is lethal in
      combination with increased ribonucleotide incorporation by Pol varepsilon but not
      by Pols alpha or delta. Several explanations for this asymmetry are considered,
      including the idea that Top1 incision at ribonucleotides relieves torsional
      stress in the nascent leading strand but not in the nascent lagging strand, in
      which preexisting nicks prevent the accumulation of superhelical tension.

TI  - NAD(+)-SIRT1 control of H3K4 trimethylation through circadian deacetylation of
      MLL1.
PG  - 312-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2990 [doi]
AB  - The circadian clock controls the transcription of hundreds of genes through
      specific chromatin-remodeling events. The histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage
      leukemia 1 (MLL1) coordinates recruitment of CLOCK-BMAL1 activator complexes to
      chromatin, an event associated with cyclic trimethylation of histone H3 Lys4
      (H3K4) at circadian promoters. Remarkably, in mouse liver circadian H3K4
      trimethylation is modulated by SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase involved in
      clock control. We show that mammalian MLL1 is acetylated at two conserved
      residues, K1130 and K1133. Notably, MLL1 acetylation is cyclic, controlled by the
      clock and by SIRT1, and it affects the methyltransferase activity of MLL1.
      Moreover, H3K4 methylation at clock-controlled-gene promoters is influenced by
      pharmacological or genetic inactivation of SIRT1. Finally, levels of MLL1
      acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation at circadian gene promoters depend on NAD(+) 
      circadian levels. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory
      pathway between energy metabolism and histone methylation.

TI  - Small-RNA loading licenses Argonaute for assembly into a transcriptional
      silencing complex.
PG  - 328-35
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2979 [doi]
AB  - Argonautes and their small-RNA cofactors form the core effectors of ancient and
      diverse gene-silencing mechanisms whose roles include regulation of gene
      expression and defense against foreign genetic elements. Although Argonautes
      generally act within multisubunit complexes, what governs their assembly into
      these machineries is not well defined. Here, we show that loading of small RNAs
      onto Argonaute is a checkpoint for Argonaute's association with conserved
      GW-protein components of silencing complexes. We demonstrate that the Argonaute
      small interfering RNA chaperone (ARC) complex mediates loading of small RNAs onto
      Ago1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and that deletion of its subunits, or mutations
      in Ago1 that prevent small-RNA loading, abolish the assembly of the GW
      protein-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex. Our
      studies uncover a mechanism that ensures that Argonaute loading precedes RITS
      assembly and thereby averts the formation of inert and potentially deleterious
      complexes.

TI  - A specialized molecular motion opens the Hv1 voltage-gated proton channel.
PG  - 283-290
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2978 [doi]
AB  - The Hv1 proton channel is unique among voltage-gated channels for containing the 
      pore and gate within its voltage-sensing domain. Pore opening has been proposed
      to include assembly of the selectivity filter between an arginine (R3) of segment
      S4 and an aspartate (D1) of segment S1. We determined whether gating involves
      motion of S1, using Ciona intestinalis Hv1. We found that channel opening is
      concomitant with solution access to the pore-lining face of S1, from the
      cytoplasm to deep inside the pore. Voltage- and patch-clamp fluorometry showed
      that this involves a motion of S1 relative to its surroundings. S1 motion and the
      S4 motion that precedes it are each influenced by residues on the other helix,
      thus suggesting a dynamic interaction between S1 and S4. Our findings suggest
      that the S1 of Hv1 has specialized to function as part of the channel's gate.

TI  - Microprocessor mediates transcriptional termination of long noncoding RNA
      transcripts hosting microRNAs.
PG  - 319-27
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2982 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a major part in the post-transcriptional regulation of
      gene expression. Mammalian miRNA biogenesis begins with cotranscriptional
      cleavage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts by the Microprocessor complex.
      Although most miRNAs are located within introns of protein-coding transcripts, a 
      substantial minority of miRNAs originate from long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, for
      which transcript processing is largely uncharacterized. We show, by detailed
      characterization of liver-specific lnc-pri-miR-122 and genome-wide analysis in
      human cell lines, that most lncRNA transcripts containing miRNAs (lnc-pri-miRNAs)
      do not use the canonical cleavage-and-polyadenylation pathway but instead use
      Microprocessor cleavage to terminate transcription. Microprocessor inactivation
      leads to extensive transcriptional readthrough of lnc-pri-miRNA and
      transcriptional interference with downstream genes. Consequently we define a new 
      RNase III-mediated, polyadenylation-independent mechanism of Pol II transcription
      termination in mammalian cells.

TI  - Crystal structure of a phosphorylation-coupled vitamin C transporter.
PG  - 238-41
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2975 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria use vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) as a carbon source under anaerobic
      conditions. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS),
      comprising a transporter (UlaA), a IIB-like enzyme (UlaB) and a IIA-like enzyme
      (UlaC), is required for the anaerobic uptake of vitamin C and its phosphorylation
      to L-ascorbate 6-phosphate. Here, we present the crystal structures of vitamin
      C-bound UlaA from Escherichia coli in two conformations at 1.65-A and 2.35-A
      resolution. UlaA forms a homodimer and exhibits a new fold. Each UlaA protomer
      consists of 11 transmembrane segments arranged into a 'V-motif' domain and a
      'core' domain. The V motifs form the interface between the two protomers, and the
      core-domain residues coordinate vitamin C. The alternating access of the
      substrate from the opposite side of the cell membrane may be achieved through
      rigid-body rotation of the core relative to the V motif.

TI  - Structures of CYLD USP with Met1- or Lys63-linked diubiquitin reveal mechanisms
      for dual specificity.
PG  - 222-9
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2970 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor CYLD belongs to a ubiquitin (Ub)-specific protease (USP)
      family and specifically cleaves Met1- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains to
      suppress inflammatory signaling pathways. Here, we report crystal structures
      representing the catalytic states of zebrafish CYLD for Met1- and Lys63-linked Ub
      chains and two distinct precatalytic states for Met1-linked chains. In both
      catalytic states, the distal Ub is bound to CYLD in a similar manner, and the
      scissile bond is located close to the catalytic residue, whereas the proximal Ub 
      is bound in a manner specific to Met1- or Lys63-linked chains. Further
      structure-based mutagenesis experiments support the mechanism by which CYLD
      specifically cleaves both Met1- and Lys63-linked chains and provide insight into 
      tumor-associated mutations of CYLD. This study provides new structural insight
      into the mechanisms by which USP family deubiquitinating enzymes recognize and
      cleave Ub chains with specific linkage types.

TI  - A molecular chaperone breaks the catalytic cycle that generates toxic Abeta
      oligomers.
PG  - 207-213
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2971 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder whose
      pathogenesis has been associated with aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide
      (Abeta42). Recent studies have revealed that once Abeta42 fibrils are generated, 
      their surfaces effectively catalyze the formation of neurotoxic oligomers. Here
      we show that a molecular chaperone, a human Brichos domain, can specifically
      inhibit this catalytic cycle and limit human Abeta42 toxicity. We demonstrate in 
      vitro that Brichos achieves this inhibition by binding to the surfaces of
      fibrils, thereby redirecting the aggregation reaction to a pathway that involves 
      minimal formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates. We verify that this
      mechanism occurs in living mouse brain tissue by cytotoxicity and
      electrophysiology experiments. These results reveal that molecular chaperones can
      help maintain protein homeostasis by selectively suppressing critical microscopic
      steps within the complex reaction pathways responsible for the toxic effects of
      protein misfolding and aggregation.

PG  - 265-8

AB  - Bifunctional mu- and delta-opioid receptor (OR) ligands are potential therapeutic
      alternatives, with diminished side effects, to alkaloid opiate analgesics. We
      solved the structure of human delta-OR bound to the bifunctional delta-OR
      antagonist and mu-OR agonist tetrapeptide H-Dmt-Tic-Phe-Phe-NH2 (DIPP-NH2) by
      serial femtosecond crystallography, revealing a cis-peptide bond between H-Dmt
      and Tic. The observed receptor-peptide interactions are critical for
      understanding of the pharmacological profiles of opioid peptides and for
      development of improved analgesics.

TI  - Exon-intron circular RNAs regulate transcription in the nucleus.
PG  - 256-64
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2959 [doi]
AB  - Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have numerous roles in development and disease, and one
      of the prominent roles is to regulate gene expression. A vast number of circular 
      RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified, and some have been shown to function as
      microRNA sponges in animal cells. Here, we report a class of circRNAs associated 
      with RNA polymerase II in human cells. In these circRNAs, exons are circularized 
      with introns 'retained' between exons; we term them exon-intron circRNAs or
      EIciRNAs. EIciRNAs predominantly localize in the nucleus, interact with U1 snRNP 
      and promote transcription of their parental genes. Our findings reveal a new role
      for circRNAs in regulating gene expression in the nucleus, in which EIciRNAs
      enhance the expression of their parental genes in cis, and highlight a regulatory
      strategy for transcriptional control via specific RNA-RNA interaction between U1 
      snRNA and EIciRNAs.

TI  - Yersinia effector YopO uses actin as bait to phosphorylate proteins that regulate
      actin polymerization.
PG  - 248-55
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2964 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic Yersinia species evade host immune systems through the injection of
      Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into phagocytic cells. One Yop, YopO, also known
      as YpkA, induces actin-filament disruption, impairing phagocytosis. Here we
      describe the X-ray structure of Yersinia enterocolitica YopO in complex with
      actin, which reveals that YopO binds to an actin monomer in a manner that blocks 
      polymerization yet allows the bound actin to interact with host actin-regulating 
      proteins. SILAC-MS and biochemical analyses confirm that actin-polymerization
      regulators such as VASP, EVL, WASP, gelsolin and the formin diaphanous 1 are
      directly sequestered and phosphorylated by YopO through formation of ternary
      complexes with actin. This leads to a model in which YopO at the membrane
      sequesters actin from polymerization while using the bound actin as bait to
      recruit, phosphorylate and misregulate host actin-regulating proteins to disrupt 
      phagocytosis.

TI  - A global profile of replicative polymerase usage.
PG  - 192-198
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2962 [doi]
AB  - Three eukaryotic DNA polymerases are essential for genome replication. Polymerase
      (Pol) alpha-primase initiates each synthesis event and is rapidly replaced by
      processive DNA polymerases: Polvarepsilon replicates the leading strand, whereas 
      Poldelta performs lagging-strand synthesis. However, it is not known whether this
      division of labor is maintained across the whole genome or how uniform it is
      within single replicons. Using Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we have developed a
      polymerase usage sequencing (Pu-seq) strategy to map polymerase usage genome
      wide. Pu-seq provides direct replication-origin location and efficiency data and 
      indirect estimates of replication timing. We confirm that the division of labor
      is broadly maintained across an entire genome. However, our data suggest a subtle
      variability in the usage of the two polymerases within individual replicons. We
      propose that this results from occasional leading-strand initiation by Poldelta
      followed by exchange for Polvarepsilon.

PG  - 214-21
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2958 [doi]
AB  - The proteasome controls the concentrations of most proteins in eukaryotic cells. 
      It recognizes its protein substrates through ubiquitin tags and initiates
      degradation at disordered regions within the substrate. Here we show that the
      proteasome has pronounced preferences for the amino acid sequence of the regions 
      at which it initiates degradation. Specifically, proteins in which the initiation
      regions have biased amino acid compositions show longer half-lives in yeast than 
      proteins with unbiased sequences in the regions. The relationship is also
      observed on a genomic scale in mouse cells. These preferences affect the
      degradation rates of proteins in vitro, can explain the unexpected stability of
      natural proteins in yeast and may affect the accumulation of toxic proteins in
      disease. We propose that the proteasome's sequence preferences provide a second
      component to the degradation code and may fine-tune protein half-life in cells.

TI  - Mechanism of microhomology-mediated end-joining promoted by human DNA polymerase 
      theta.
PG  - 230-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2961 [doi]
AB  - Microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) is an error-prone alternative
      double-strand break-repair pathway that uses sequence microhomology to recombine 
      broken DNA. Although MMEJ has been implicated in cancer development, the
      mechanism of this pathway is unknown. We demonstrate that purified human DNA
      polymerase theta (Poltheta) performs MMEJ of DNA containing 3' single-strand DNA 
      overhangs with >/=2 bp of homology, including DNA modeled after telomeres, and
      show that MMEJ is dependent on Poltheta in human cells. Our data support a
      mechanism whereby Poltheta facilitates end-joining and microhomology annealing,
      then uses the opposing overhang as a template in trans to stabilize the DNA
      synapse. Poltheta exhibits a preference for DNA containing a 5'-terminal
      phosphate, similarly to polymerases involved in nonhomologous end-joining.
      Finally, we identify a conserved loop domain that is essential for MMEJ and
      higher-order structures of Poltheta that probably promote DNA synapse formation.

TI  - DNA interstrand cross-link repair requires replication-fork convergence.
PG  - 242-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2956 [doi]
AB  - DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) prevent strand separation during DNA
      replication and transcription and therefore are extremely cytotoxic. In
      metazoans, a major pathway of ICL repair is coupled to DNA replication, and it
      requires the Fanconi anemia pathway. In most current models, collision of a
      single DNA replication fork with an ICL is sufficient to initiate repair. In
      contrast, we show here that in Xenopus egg extracts two DNA replication forks
      must converge on an ICL to trigger repair. When only one fork reaches the ICL,
      the replicative CMG helicase fails to unload from the stalled fork, and repair is
      blocked. Arrival of a second fork, even when substantially delayed, rescues
      repair. We conclude that ICL repair requires a replication-induced X-shaped DNA
      structure surrounding the lesion, and we speculate on how this requirement helps 
      maintain genomic stability in S phase.

TI  - Structural basis for amyloidogenic peptide recognition by sorLA.
PG  - 199-206
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2954 [doi]
AB  - SorLA is a neuronal sorting receptor considered to be a major risk factor for
      Alzheimer's disease. We have recently reported that it directs lysosomal
      targeting of nascent neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides by directly binding
      Abeta. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human sorLA domain
      responsible for Abeta capture, Vps10p, in an unbound state and in complex with
      two ligands. Vps10p assumes a ten-bladed beta-propeller fold with a large tunnel 
      at the center. An internal ligand derived from the sorLA propeptide bound inside 
      the tunnel to extend the beta-sheet of one of the propeller blades. The structure
      of the sorLA Vps10p-Abeta complex revealed that the same site is used. Peptides
      are recognized by sorLA Vps10p in redundant modes without strict dependence on a 
      particular amino acid sequence, thus suggesting a broad specificity toward
      peptides with a propensity for beta-sheet formation.

TI  - Tracking replication enzymology in vivo by genome-wide mapping of ribonucleotide 
      incorporation.
PG  - 185-91
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2957 [doi]
AB  - Ribonucleotides are frequently incorporated into DNA during replication in
      eukaryotes. Here we map genome-wide distribution of these ribonucleotides as
      markers of replication enzymology in budding yeast, using a new 5' DNA
      end-mapping method, hydrolytic end sequencing (HydEn-seq). HydEn-seq of DNA from 
      ribonucleotide excision repair-deficient strains reveals replicase- and
      strand-specific patterns of ribonucleotides in the nuclear genome. These patterns
      support the roles of DNA polymerases alpha and delta in lagging-strand
      replication and of DNA polymerase varepsilon in leading-strand replication. They 
      identify replication origins, termination zones and variations in ribonucleotide 
      incorporation frequency across the genome that exceed three orders of magnitude. 
      HydEn-seq also reveals strand-specific 5' DNA ends at mitochondrial replication
      origins, thus suggesting unidirectional replication of a circular genome. Given
      the conservation of enzymes that incorporate and process ribonucleotides in DNA, 
      HydEn-seq can be used to track replication enzymology in other organisms.

TI  - K63 polyubiquitination is a new modulator of the oxidative stress response.
PG  - 116-23
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2955 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that signals multiple
      processes, including protein degradation, trafficking and DNA repair.
      Polyubiquitin accumulates globally during the oxidative stress response, and this
      has been mainly attributed to increased ubiquitin conjugation and perturbations
      in protein degradation. Here we show that the unconventional Lys63 (K63)-linked
      polyubiquitin accumulates in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a highly
      sensitive and regulated manner as a result of exposure to peroxides. We
      demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide inhibits the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2,
      leading to accumulation of K63 conjugates assembled by the Rad6 ubiquitin
      conjugase and the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase. Using linkage-specific isolation methods
      and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based
      quantitative proteomics, we identified >100 new K63-polyubiquitinated targets,
      which were substantially enriched in ribosomal proteins. Finally, we demonstrate 
      that impairment of K63 ubiquitination during oxidative stress affects polysome
      stability and protein expression, rendering cells more sensitive to stress, and
      thereby reveal a new redox-regulatory role for this modification.

TI  - Ring closure activates yeast gammaTuRC for species-specific microtubule
      nucleation.
PG  - 132-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2953 [doi]
AB  - The gamma-tubulin ring complex (gammaTuRC) is the primary microtubule nucleator
      in cells. gammaTuRC is assembled from repeating gamma-tubulin small complex
      (gammaTuSC) subunits and is thought to function as a template by presenting a
      gamma-tubulin ring that mimics microtubule geometry. However, a previous yeast
      gammaTuRC structure showed gammaTuSC in an open conformation that prevents
      matching to microtubule symmetry. By contrast, we show here that gamma-tubulin
      complexes are in a closed conformation when attached to microtubules. To confirm 
      the functional importance of the closed gammaTuSC ring, we trapped the closed
      state and determined its structure, showing that the gamma-tubulin ring precisely
      matches microtubule symmetry and providing detailed insight into gammaTuRC
      architecture. Importantly, the closed state is a stronger nucleator, thus
      suggesting that this conformational switch may allosterically control gammaTuRC
      activity. Finally, we demonstrate that gammaTuRCs have a strong preference for
      tubulin from the same species.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 8 senses degradation products of single-stranded RNA.
PG  - 109-15
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2943 [doi]
AB  - Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) recognizes viral or bacterial single-stranded RNA
      (ssRNA) and activates innate immune systems. TLR8 is activated by uridine- and
      guanosine-rich ssRNA as well as by certain synthetic chemicals; however, the
      molecular basis for ssRNA recognition has remained unknown. In this study, to
      elucidate the recognition mechanism of ssRNA, we determined the crystal
      structures of human TLR8 in complex with ssRNA. TLR8 recognized two degradation
      products of ssRNA-uridine and a short oligonucleotide-at two distinct sites:
      uridine bound the site on the dimerization interface where small chemical ligands
      are recognized, whereas short oligonucleotides bound a newly identified site on
      the concave surface of the TLR8 horseshoe structure. Site-directed mutagenesis
      revealed that both binding sites were essential for activation of TLR8 by ssRNA. 
      These results demonstrate that TLR8 is a sensor for both uridine and a short
      oligonucleotide derived from RNA.

TI  - The RNA helicase Aquarius exhibits structural adaptations mediating its
      recruitment to spliceosomes.
PG  - 138-44
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2951 [doi]
AB  - Aquarius is a multifunctional putative RNA helicase that binds precursor-mRNA
      introns at a defined position. Here we report the crystal structure of human
      Aquarius, revealing a central RNA helicase core and several unique accessory
      domains, including an ARM-repeat domain. We show that Aquarius is integrated into
      spliceosomes as part of a pentameric intron-binding complex (IBC) that, together 
      with the ARM domain, cross-links to U2 snRNP proteins within activated
      spliceosomes; this suggests that the latter aid in positioning Aquarius on the
      intron. Aquarius's ARM domain is essential for IBC formation, thus indicating
      that it has a key protein-protein-scaffolding role. Finally, we provide evidence 
      that Aquarius is required for efficient precursor-mRNA splicing in vitro. Our
      findings highlight the remarkable structural adaptations of a helicase to achieve
      position-specific recruitment to a ribonucleoprotein complex and reveal a new
      building block of the human spliceosome.

TI  - The energy landscape of adenylate kinase during catalysis.
PG  - 124-31
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2941 [doi]
AB  - Kinases perform phosphoryl-transfer reactions in milliseconds; without enzymes,
      these reactions would take about 8,000 years under physiological conditions.
      Despite extensive studies, a comprehensive understanding of kinase energy
      landscapes, including both chemical and conformational steps, is lacking. Here we
      scrutinize the microscopic steps in the catalytic cycle of adenylate kinase,
      through a combination of NMR measurements during catalysis, pre-steady-state
      kinetics, molecular-dynamics simulations and crystallography of active complexes.
      We find that the Mg(2+) cofactor activates two distinct molecular events:
      phosphoryl transfer (>10(5)-fold) and lid opening (10(3)-fold). In contrast,
      mutation of an essential active site arginine decelerates phosphoryl transfer
      10(3)-fold without substantially affecting lid opening. Our results highlight the
      importance of the entire energy landscape in catalysis and suggest that adenylate
      kinases have evolved to activate key processes simultaneously by precise
      placement of a single, charged and very abundant cofactor in a preorganized
      active site.

TI  - Tetrameric Ctp1 coordinates DNA binding and DNA bridging in DNA
      double-strand-break repair.
PG  - 158-66
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2945 [doi]
AB  - Ctp1 (also known as CtIP or Sae2) collaborates with Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 to initiate 
      repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), but its functions remain enigmatic. We
      report that tetrameric Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ctp1 contains multivalent
      DNA-binding and DNA-bridging activities. Through structural and biophysical
      analyses of the Ctp1 tetramer, we define the salient features of Ctp1
      architecture: an N-terminal interlocking tetrameric helical dimer-of-dimers
      (THDD) domain and a central intrinsically disordered region (IDR) linked to
      C-terminal 'RHR' DNA-interaction motifs. The THDD, IDR and RHR are required for
      Ctp1 DNA-bridging activity in vitro, and both the THDD and RHR are required for
      efficient DSB repair in S. pombe. Our results establish non-nucleolytic roles of 
      Ctp1 in binding and coordination of DSB-repair intermediates and suggest that
      ablation of human CtIP DNA binding by truncating mutations underlie the
      CtIP-linked Seckel and Jawad syndromes.

TI  - Control of repeat-protein curvature by computational protein design.
PG  - 167-74
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2938 [doi]
AB  - Shape complementarity is an important component of molecular recognition, and the
      ability to precisely adjust the shape of a binding scaffold to match a target of 
      interest would greatly facilitate the creation of high-affinity protein reagents 
      and therapeutics. Here we describe a general approach to control the shape of the
      binding surface on repeat-protein scaffolds and apply it to leucine-rich-repeat
      proteins. First, self-compatible building-block modules are designed that, when
      polymerized, generate surfaces with unique but constant curvatures. Second, a set
      of junction modules that connect the different building blocks are designed.
      Finally, new proteins with custom-designed shapes are generated by appropriately 
      combining building-block and junction modules. Crystal structures of the designs 
      illustrate the power of the approach in controlling repeat-protein curvature.

TI  - Charge-driven dynamics of nascent-chain movement through the SecYEG translocon.
PG  - 145-149
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2940 [doi]
AB  - On average, every fifth residue in secretory proteins carries either a positive
      or a negative charge. In a bacterium such as Escherichia coli, charged residues
      are exposed to an electric field as they transit through the inner membrane, and 
      this should generate a fluctuating electric force on a translocating nascent
      chain. Here, we have used translational arrest peptides as in vivo force sensors 
      to measure this electric force during cotranslational chain translocation through
      the SecYEG translocon. We find that charged residues experience a biphasic
      electric force as they move across the membrane, including an early component
      with a maximum when they are 47-49 residues away from the ribosomal P site,
      followed by a more slowly varying component. The early component is generated by 
      the transmembrane electric potential, whereas the second may reflect interactions
      between charged residues and the periplasmic membrane surface.

TI  - CtIP tetramer assembly is required for DNA-end resection and repair.
PG  - 150-157
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2937 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian CtIP protein has major roles in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.
      Although it is well established that CtIP promotes DNA-end resection in
      preparation for homology-dependent DSB repair, the molecular basis for this
      function has remained unknown. Here we show by biophysical and X-ray
      crystallographic analyses that the N-terminal domain of human CtIP exists as a
      stable homotetramer. Tetramerization results from interlocking interactions
      between the N-terminal extensions of CtIP's coiled-coil region, which lead to a
      'dimer-of-dimers' architecture. Through interrogation of the CtIP structure, we
      identify a point mutation that abolishes tetramerization of the N-terminal domain
      while preserving dimerization in vitro. Notably, we establish that this mutation 
      abrogates CtIP oligomer assembly in cells, thus leading to strong defects in
      DNA-end resection and gene conversion. These findings indicate that the CtIP
      tetramer architecture described here is essential for effective DSB repair by
      homologous recombination.

AB  - Since its relatively recent discovery, RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a
      potent, specific and ubiquitous means of gene regulation. Through a number of
      pathways that are conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to humans, small noncoding
      RNAs direct molecular machinery to silence gene expression. In this Review, we
      focus on mechanisms and structures that govern RNA silencing in higher organisms.
      In addition to highlighting recent advances, we discuss parallels and differences
      among RNAi pathways. Together, the studies reviewed herein reveal the versatility
      and programmability of RNA-induced silencing complexes and emphasize the
      importance of both upstream biogenesis and downstream silencing factors.

AB  - The ribosome, central to protein synthesis in all cells, is a complex
      multicomponent assembly with rRNA at its functional core. During the process of
      ribosome biogenesis, diverse noncoding RNAs participate in controlling the
      quantity and quality of this rRNA. In this Review, I discuss the multiple roles
      assumed by noncoding RNAs during the different steps of ribosome biogenesis and
      how they contribute to the generation of ribosome heterogeneity, which affects
      normal and pathophysiological processes.

AB  - Cellular fate is determined by transcriptional networks and epigenetic states. In
      addition to protein factors, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs and 
      long ncRNAs, are able to remodel transcriptional circuits and reshape epigenetic 
      landscapes. Here we draw upon recent findings to discuss the emerging roles of
      these ncRNAs in cellular reprogramming, transdifferentiation and organ
      regeneration.

TI  - Human cells contain natural double-stranded RNAs with potential regulatory
      functions.
PG  - 89-97
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2934 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence has suggested the existence of sense-antisense transcription in
      mammals, but the existence of double-stranded RNAs endowed with biological
      function has remained elusive. Herein we show that hundreds of putative natural
      double-stranded RNAs (ndsRNAs) are expressed from interspersed genomic locations 
      and respond to cellular cues. We demonstrate that a subset of ndsRNAs localize in
      the nucleus and, in their double-stranded form, interact with nuclear proteins.
      Detailed characterization of an ndsRNA (nds-2a) revealed that this molecule
      displays differential localization throughout the cell cycle and directly
      interacts with RCC1 and RAN and, through the latter, with the mitotic
      RANGAP1-SUMO1-RANBP2 complex. Notably, altering nds-2a levels led to postmitotic 
      abnormalities, mitotic catastrophe and cell death, thus supporting a
      mitosis-related role. Altogether, our study reveals a hitherto-unrecognized class
      of RNAs that potentially participate in major biological processes in human
      cells.

TI  - 5-Formylcytosine alters the structure of the DNA double helix.
PG  - 44-49
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2936 [doi]
AB  - The modified base 5-formylcytosine (5fC) was recently identified in mammalian DNA
      and might be considered to be the 'seventh' base of the genome. This nucleotide
      has been implicated in active demethylation mediated by the base excision repair 
      enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase. Genomics and proteomics studies have suggested an
      additional role for 5fC in transcription regulation through chromatin remodeling.
      Here we propose that 5fC might affect these processes through its effect on DNA
      conformation. Biophysical and structural analysis revealed that 5fC alters the
      structure of the DNA double helix and leads to a conformation unique among known 
      DNA structures including those comprising other cytosine modifications. The
      1.4-A-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a DNA dodecamer comprising three
      5fCpG sites shows how 5fC changes the geometry of the grooves and base pairs
      associated with the modified base, leading to helical underwinding.

AB  - Long-chain bacterial polysaccharides have important roles in pathogenicity. In
      Escherichia coli O9a, a model for ABC transporter-dependent polysaccharide
      assembly, a large extracellular carbohydrate with a narrow size distribution is
      polymerized from monosaccharides by a complex of two proteins, WbdA (polymerase) 
      and WbdD (terminating protein). Combining crystallography and small-angle X-ray
      scattering, we found that the C-terminal domain of WbdD contains an extended
      coiled-coil that physically separates WbdA from the catalytic domain of WbdD. The
      effects of insertions and deletions in the coiled-coil region were analyzed in
      vivo, revealing that polymer size is controlled by varying the length of the
      coiled-coil domain. Thus, the coiled-coil domain of WbdD functions as a molecular
      ruler that, along with WbdA:WbdD stoichiometry, controls the chain length of a
      model bacterial polysaccharide.

TI  - The AAA3 domain of cytoplasmic dynein acts as a switch to facilitate microtubule 
      release.
PG  - 73-80
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2930 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic dynein is an AAA+ motor responsible for intracellular cargo transport
      and force generation along microtubules (MTs). Unlike kinesin and myosin, dynein 
      contains multiple ATPase subunits, with AAA1 serving as the primary catalytic
      site. ATPase activity at AAA3 is also essential for robust motility, but its role
      in dynein's mechanochemical cycle remains unclear. Here, we introduced transient 
      pauses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae dynein motility by using a slowly hydrolyzing 
      ATP analog. Analysis of pausing behavior revealed that AAA3 hydrolyzes nucleotide
      an order of magnitude more slowly than AAA1, and the two sites do not coordinate.
      ATPase mutations to AAA3 abolish the ability of dynein to modulate MT release.
      Nucleotide hydrolysis at AAA3 lifts this 'MT gate' to allow fast motility. These 
      results suggest that AAA3 acts as a switch that repurposes cytoplasmic dynein for
      fast cargo transport and MT-anchoring tasks in cells.

TI  - Visualizing phosphodiester-bond hydrolysis by an endonuclease.
PG  - 65-72
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2932 [doi]
AB  - The enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA phosphodiester bonds has been widely studied, but
      the chemical reaction has not yet been observed. Here we follow the generation of
      a DNA double-strand break (DSB) by the Desulfurococcus mobilis homing
      endonuclease I-DmoI, trapping sequential stages of a two-metal-ion cleavage
      mechanism. We captured intermediates of the different catalytic steps, and this
      allowed us to watch the reaction by 'freezing' multiple states. We observed the
      successive entry of two metals involved in the reaction and the arrival of a
      third cation in a central position of the active site. This third metal ion has a
      crucial role, triggering the consecutive hydrolysis of the targeted
      phosphodiester bonds in the DNA strands and leaving its position once the DSB is 
      generated. The multiple structures show the orchestrated conformational changes
      in the protein residues, nucleotides and metals during catalysis.

TI  - Conformational dynamics in substrate-binding domains influences transport in the 
      ABC importer GlnPQ.
PG  - 57-64
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2929 [doi]
AB  - The conformational dynamics in ABC transporters is largely elusive. The ABC
      importer GlnPQ from Lactococcus lactis has different covalently linked
      substrate-binding domains (SBDs), thus making it an excellent model system to
      elucidate the dynamics and role of the SBDs in transport. We demonstrate by
      single-molecule spectroscopy that the two SBDs intrinsically transit from open to
      closed ligand-free conformation, and the proteins capture their amino acid
      ligands via an induced-fit mechanism. High-affinity ligands elicit transitions
      without changing the closed-state lifetime, whereas low-affinity ligands
      dramatically shorten it. We show that SBDs in the closed state compete for
      docking onto the translocator, but remarkably the effect is strongest without
      ligand. We find that the rate-determining steps depend on the SBD and the amino
      acid transported. We conclude that the lifetime of the closed conformation
      controls both SBD docking to the translocator and substrate release.

TI  - Crystal structure of a BRAF kinase domain monomer explains basis for allosteric
      regulation.
PG  - 37-43
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2924 [doi]
AB  - Reported RAF kinase domain structures adopt a side-to-side dimer configuration
      reflective of an 'on' state that underpins an allosteric mechanism of regulation.
      Atomic details of the monomer 'off' state have been elusive. Reinspection of the 
      BRAF kinase domain structures revealed that sulfonamide inhibitors induce
      features of an off state, primarily a laterally displaced helix alphaC stabilized
      by the activation segment helix 1 (AS-H1). These features correlated with the
      ability of sulfonamides to disrupt human BRAF homodimers in cells, in vitro and
      in crystals yielding a structure of BRAF in a monomer state. The crystal
      structure revealed exaggerated, nonproductive positions of helix alphaC and
      AS-H1, the latter of which is the target of potent BRAF oncogenic mutations.
      Together, this work provides formal proof of an allosteric link between the RAF
      dimer interface, the activation segment and the catalytic infrastructure.

TI  - Structure of myosin-1c tail bound to calmodulin provides insights into
      calcium-mediated conformational coupling.
PG  - 81-8
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2923 [doi]
AB  - Class I myosins can sense cellular mechanical forces and function as
      tension-sensitive anchors or transporters. How mechanical load is transduced from
      the membrane-binding tail to the force-generating head in myosin-1 is unknown.
      Here we determined the crystal structure of the entire tail of mouse myosin-1c in
      complex with apocalmodulin, showing that myosin-1c adopts a stable monomer
      conformation suited for force transduction. The lever-arm helix and the
      C-terminal extended PH domain of the motor are coupled by a stable post-IQ domain
      bound to calmodulin in a highly unusual mode. Ca(2+) binding to calmodulin
      induces major conformational changes in both IQ motifs and the post-IQ domain and
      increases flexibility of the myosin-1c tail. Our study provides a structural
      blueprint for the neck and tail domains of myosin-1 and expands the target
      binding modes of the master Ca(2+)-signal regulator calmodulin.
