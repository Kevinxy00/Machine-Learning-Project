AB  - Biased agonism at G-protein-coupled receptors is generally conceptualized as the 
      ability of certain stimuli to trigger downstream signaling exclusively through
      one of two effectors. Recent studies reveal that signaling downstream of the
      beta1 adrenergic receptor and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor induced by
      biased stimuli actually involves both effectors.

      analogous to the immune system of multicellular organisms where immune cells kill

      of the researchers who had cracked the genetic code in the 1960s. Francis had
      died in 2004, and I was contacting some of the people who knew him when he was
      struggling to decipher the code. Francis didn't appear to struggle often - he is 
      known mostly for his successes - and, as it turns out, this one well-known
      struggle may have had a clue sitting just barely out of sight.

AB  - Symmetry is appealing, be it in architecture, art or facial expression, where
      symmetry is a key feature to finding someone attractive or not. Yet, asymmetries 
      are widespread in nature, not as an erroneous deviation from the norm but as a
      way to adapt to the prevailing environmental conditions at a time. Asymmetries in
      many cases are actively selected for: they might well have increased the
      evolutionary fitness of a species. Even many single-celled organisms are built
      asymmetrically, such as the pear-shaped ciliate Paramecium, which may depend on
      its asymmetry to navigate towards the oxygen-richer surface of turbid waters, at 
      least based on modeling. Everybody knows the lobster with its asymmetric pair of 
      claws, the large crusher usually on the left and the smaller cutter on the right.
      Snail shells coil asymmetrically, as do the organs they house. Organ asymmetries 
      are found throughout the animal kingdom, referring to asymmetric positioning,
      asymmetric morphology or both, with the vertebrate heart being an example for the
      latter. Functional asymmetries, such as that of the human brain with its
      localization of the language center in one hemisphere, add to the complexity of
      organ asymmetries and presumably played a decisive role for sociocultural
      evolution. The evolutionary origin of organ asymmetries may have been a longer
      than body length gut, which allows efficient retrieval of nutrients, and the need
      to stow a long gut in the body cavity in an orderly manner that ensures optimal
      functioning. Vertebrate organ asymmetries (situs solitus) are quite
      sophisticated: in humans, the apex of the asymmetrically built heart points to
      the left; the lung in turn, due to space restrictions, has fewer lobes on the
      left than on the right side (two versus three in humans), stomach and spleen are 
      found on the left, the liver on the right, and small and large intestine coil in 
      a chiral manner (Figure 1A). In very rare cases (1:10,000), the organ situs is
      inverted (situs inversus), while heterotaxia refers to another rare situation
      (about 1:1,000), in which subsets of organs show normal or aberrant positioning
      or morphology (Figure 1B). Individuals with situs solitus or situs inversus are
      healthy, whereas heterotaxia presents severe congenital malformations. Many human
      syndromes are known in which patients suffer from laterality defects, such as
      Katagener syndrome, in which the organ situs is inverted in one half of patients 
      and males are sterile. Snail shells and vertebrate organs are examples of biased 
      asymmetries with on average only one inversion in every 10,000 cases. Other
      asymmetries such as the coiling of the tails of piglets occur randomly with a
      50:50 distribution. This primer exclusively deals with organ asymmetries in the
      animal kingdom, specifically with the mechanisms that ensure the development of
      biased asymmetries during embryogenesis.

AB  - The pineal and parapineal organs are dorsal outpocketings of the vertebrate
      diencephalon that play key roles in orientation and in circadian and annual
      cycles. Lampreys are four eyed in that both the pineal and parapineal form
      eyelike photosensory structures, but the pineal is the dominant or sole median
      photosensory structure in most lower vertebrate clades. The pineal complex has
      been thought to evolve in a single direction by losing photosensory and
      augmenting secretory function in the transitions from three-eyed lower
      vertebrates to two-eyed mammals and archosaurs [1-3]. Yet the widely accepted
      elaboration of the parapineal instead of the pineal as the primary median
      photosensory organ [4] in Lepidosauria (lizards, snakes, and tuataras) hints at a
      more complex evolutionary history. Here we present evidence that a fourth eye
      re-evolved from the pineal organ at least once within vertebrates, specifically
      in an extinct monitor lizard, Saniwa ensidens, in which pineal and parapineal
      eyes were present simultaneously. The tandem midline location of these structures
      confirms in a striking fashion the proposed homology of the parietal eye with the
      parapineal organ and refutes the classical model of pineal bilaterality. It
      furthermore raises questions about the evolution and functional interpretation of
      the median photosensory organ in other tetrapod clades.

AB  - Germ cells develop in a microenvironment created by the somatic cells of the
      gonad [1-3]. Although in males, the germ and somatic support cells lie in direct 
      contact, in females, a thick extracellular coat surrounds the oocyte, physically 
      separating it from the somatic follicle cells [4]. To bypass this barrier to
      communication, narrow cytoplasmic extensions of the follicle cells traverse the
      extracellular coat to reach the oocyte plasma membrane [5-9]. These delicate
      structures provide the sole platform for the contact-mediated communication
      between the oocyte and its follicular environment that is indispensable for
      production of a fertilizable egg [8, 10-15]. Identifying the mechanisms
      underlying their formation should uncover conserved regulators of fertility. We
      show here in mice that these structures, termed transzonal projections (TZPs),
      are specialized filopodia whose number amplifies enormously as oocytes grow,
      enabling increased germ-soma communication. By creating chimeric complexes of
      genetically tagged oocytes and follicle cells, we demonstrate that follicle cells
      elaborate new TZPs that push through the extracellular coat to reach the oocyte
      surface. We further show that growth-differentiation factor 9, produced by the
      oocyte, drives the formation of new TZPs, uncovering a key yet unanticipated role
      for the germ cell in building these essential bridges of communication. Moreover,
      TZP number and germline-soma communication are strikingly reduced in
      reproductively aged females. Thus, the growing oocyte locally remodels follicular
      architecture to ensure that its developmental needs are met, and an inability of 
      somatic follicle cells to respond appropriately to oocyte-derived cues may
      contribute to human infertility.

AB  - Most animal embryos display a delay in the activation of zygotic transcription
      during early embryogenesis [1]. This process is thought to help coordinate rapid 
      increases in cell number during early development [2]. The timing of zygotic
      genome activation (ZGA) during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) remains
      uncertain despite extensive efforts. We explore ZGA in the simple
      protovertebrate, Ciona intestinalis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) assays 
      identified Cyclin B3 (Ccnb3) as a putative mediator of ZGA. Maternal Ccnb3
      transcripts rapidly diminish in abundance during the onset of zygotic
      transcription at the 8-cell and 16-cell stages. Disruption of Ccnb3 activity
      results in precocious activation of zygotic transcription, while overexpression
      abolishes normal activation. These observations suggest that the depletion of
      maternal Cyclin B3 products is a critical component of the MZT and ZGA. We
      discuss evidence that this mechanism might play a conserved role in the MZT of
      other metazoans, including mice and humans.

AB  - The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on the health of bee pollinators is a
      topic of intensive research and considerable current debate [1]. As insecticides,
      certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and
      thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they
      target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees
      orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as
      thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid
      metabolism of these compounds [2-5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved
      remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically
      important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the 
      CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation
      in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids
      does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in
      divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of 
      P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes
      thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We
      demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their
      sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional
      ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid
      sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are
      equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to
      insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health.

AB  - The identification of cell types and marker genes is critical for dissecting
      neural development and function, but the size and complexity of the brain has
      hindered the comprehensive discovery of cell types. We combined single-cell
      RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with anatomical brain registration to create a comprehensive 
      map of the zebrafish habenula, a conserved forebrain hub involved in pain
      processing and learning. Single-cell transcriptomes of approximately 13,000
      habenular cells with 4x cellular coverage identified 18 neuronal types and dozens
      of marker genes. Registration of marker genes onto a reference atlas created a
      resource for anatomical and functional studies and enabled the mapping of active 
      neurons onto neuronal types following aversive stimuli. Strikingly, despite brain
      growth and functional maturation, cell types were retained between the larval and
      adult habenula. This study provides a gene expression atlas to dissect habenular 
      development and function and offers a general framework for the comprehensive
      characterization of other brain regions.

AB  - Cognitive disabilities that occur with age represent a growing and expensive
      health problem. Age-associated memory deficits are observed across many species, 
      but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully identified. Here, we
      report elevations in the levels and activity of the striatal-enriched phosphatase
      (STEP) in the hippocampus of aged memory-impaired mice and rats, in aged rhesus
      monkeys, and in people diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). 
      The accumulation of STEP with aging is related to dysfunction of the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system that normally leads to the degradation of STEP.
      Higher level of active STEP is linked to enhanced dephosphorylation of its
      substrates GluN2B and ERK1/2, CREB inactivation, and a decrease in total levels
      of GluN2B and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These molecular events
      are reversed in aged STEP knockout and heterozygous mice, which perform similarly
      to young control mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tasks. In
      addition, administration of the STEP inhibitor TC-2153 to old rats significantly 
      improved performance in a delayed alternation T-maze memory task. In contrast,
      viral-mediated STEP overexpression in the hippocampus is sufficient to induce
      memory impairment in the MWM and Y-maze tests, and these cognitive deficits are
      reversed by STEP inhibition. In old LOU/C/Jall rats, a model of healthy aging
      with preserved memory capacities, levels of STEP and GluN2B are stable, and
      phosphorylation of GluN2B and ERK1/2 is unaltered. Altogether, these data suggest
      that elevated levels of STEP that appear with advancing age in several species
      contribute to the cognitive declines associated with aging.

AB  - To determine the fundamentals of cell growth, we must extend cell biological
      studies to non-model organisms. Here, we investigated the growth modes of the
      only two rods known to widen instead of elongating, Candidatus Thiosymbion
      oneisti and Thiosymbion hypermnestrae. These bacteria are attached by one pole to
      the surface of their respective nematode hosts. By incubating live Ca. T. oneisti
      and T. hypermnestrae with a peptidoglycan metabolic probe, we observed that the
      insertion of new cell wall starts at the poles and proceeds inward, concomitantly
      with FtsZ-based membrane constriction. Remarkably, in Ca. T. hypermnestrae, the
      proximal, animal-attached pole grows before the distal, free pole, indicating
      that the peptidoglycan synthesis machinery is host oriented. Immunostaining of
      the symbionts with an antibody against the actin homolog MreB revealed that it
      was arranged medially-that is, parallel to the cell long axis-throughout the
      symbiont life cycle. Given that depolymerization of MreB abolished newly
      synthesized peptidoglycan insertion and impaired divisome assembly, we conclude
      that MreB function is required for symbiont widening and division. In conclusion,
      our data invoke a reassessment of the localization and function of the bacterial 
      actin homolog.

AB  - Group living is ubiquitous among animals [1, 2], but the exact benefits of group 
      living experienced by individual groupmates is related to their spatial location 
      within the overall group [3-5]. Individual variation in behavioral traits and
      nutritional state is known to affect interactions between individuals and their
      social group [6, 7], but physiological mechanisms underpinning collective animal 
      behavior remain largely unexplored [8]. Here, we show that while fish at the
      front of moving groups are most successful at capturing food items, these
      individuals then show a systematic, post-feeding movement toward the rear of
      groups. Using observations of fish feeding in groups coupled with estimates of
      metabolic rate in fish consuming different meal sizes, we demonstrate that the
      magnitude of this shift in spatial position is directly related to the aerobic
      metabolic scope remaining after accounting for energetic costs of digestion.
      While previous work has shown that hungry individuals occupy anterior positions
      in moving groups [9, 10], our results show that the metabolic demand of food
      processing reduces the aerobic capacity available for locomotion in individuals
      that eat most, thus preventing them from maintaining leading positions. This
      basic trade-off between feeding and locomotor capacity could fundamentally
      dictate the spatial position of individuals within groups, perhaps obviating the 
      role of individual traits in determining spatial preferences over shorter
      timescales (e.g., hours to days). This may be a general constraint for
      individuals within animal collectives, representing a key, yet overlooked,
      mediator of group functioning that could affect leadership, social information
      transfer, and group decision making.

AB  - Natural selection is generally expected to favor one form of a given trait within
      a population. The presence of multiple functional variants of traits involved in 
      activities such as feeding, reproduction, or the defense against predators is
      relatively uncommon within animal species. The genetic architecture and
      evolutionary mechanisms underlying the origin and maintenance of such
      polymorphisms are of special interest. Among rattlesnakes, several instances of
      the production of biochemically distinct neurotoxic or hemorrhagic venom types
      within the same species are known. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of
      this phenomenon in three species and found that neurotoxic and hemorrhagic
      individuals of the same species possess markedly different haplotypes at two
      toxin gene complexes. For example, neurotoxic and hemorrhagic Crotalus scutulatus
      individuals differ by 5 genes at the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) toxin gene complex
      and by 11 genes at the metalloproteinase (MP) gene complex. A similar set of
      extremely divergent haplotypes also underlies alternate venom types within C.
      helleri and C. horridus. We further show that the MP and PLA2 haplotypes of
      neurotoxic C. helleri appear to have been acquired through hybridization with C. 
      scutulatus-a rare example of the horizontal transfer of a potentially highly
      adaptive suite of genes. These large structural variants appear analogous to
      immunity gene complexes in host-pathogen arms races and may reflect the impact of
      balancing selection at the PLA2 and MP complexes for predation on different prey.

AB  - Oxytocin (OXT)-mediated behavioral responses to social and stressful cues have
      extensively been studied in male rodents. Here, we investigated the capacity of
      brain OXT receptor (OXTR) signaling in the lateral septum (LS) to prevent social 
      fear expression in female mice using the social-fear-conditioning paradigm.
      Utilizing the activated OXT system during lactation, we show that lactating mice 
      did not express fear 24 hr after social fear conditioning. Supporting the role of
      OXTR signaling in the LS in attenuation of social fear, synthetic OXT infusion or
      overexpression of OXTR in the LS diminished social fear expression, whereas
      constitutive OXTR knockout severely impaired social fear extinction in virgin
      mice. Subsequently, both pharmacological blockade of local OXTRs in the LS and
      chemogenetic silencing of supraoptic nucleus OXTergic afferents to the LS
      increased social fear expression in lactating mice. Hence, LS-projecting OXT
      neurons suppress social fear in female mice.

AB  - When we encounter a new word, there are often multiple objects that the word
      might refer to [1]. Nonetheless, because names for concrete nouns are constant,
      we are able to learn them across successive encounters [2, 3]. This form of
      "cross-situational" learning may result from either associative mechanisms that
      gradually accumulate evidence for each word-object association [4, 5] or rapid
      propose-but-verify (PbV) mechanisms where only one hypothesized referent is
      stored for each word, which is either subsequently verified or rejected [6, 7].
      Using model-based representation similarity analyses of fMRI data acquired during
      learning, we find evidence for learning mediated by a PbV mechanism. This
      learning may be underpinned by rapid pattern-separation processes in the
      hippocampus. Our findings shed light on the psychological and neural processes
      that support word learning, suggesting that adults rely on their episodic memory 
      to track a limited number of word-object associations.

AB  - Endowed with an elaborate cerebral cortex, humans and other primates can assess
      the number of items in a set, or numerosity, from birth on [1] and without being 
      trained [2]. Whether spontaneous numerosity extraction is a unique feat of the
      mammalian cerebral cortex [3-7] or rather an adaptive property that can be found 
      in differently designed and independently evolved neural substrates, such as the 
      avian enbrain [8], is unknown. To address this question, we recorded single-cell 
      activity from the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a high-level avian association
      brain area [9-11], of numerically naive crows. We found that a proportion of NCL 
      neurons were spontaneously responsive to numerosity and tuned to the number of
      items, even though the crows were never trained to assess numerical quantity. Our
      data show that numerosity-selective neuronal responses are spontaneously present 
      in the distinct endbrains of diverge vertebrate taxa. This seemingly hard-wired
      property of the avian endbrain to extract numerical quantity explains how birds
      in the wild, or right after hatching, can exploit numerical cues when making
      foraging or social decisions. It suggests that endbrain circuitries that evolved 
      based on convergent evolution, such as the avian endbrain, give rise to the same 
      numerosity code.

AB  - Despite their growing popularity as models of visual functions, it remains
      unclear whether rodents are capable of deploying advanced shape-processing
      strategies when engaged in visual object recognition. In rats, for instance,
      pattern vision has been reported to range from mere detection of overall object
      luminance to view-invariant processing of discriminative shape features. Here we 
      sought to clarify how refined object vision is in rodents, and how variable the
      complexity of their visual processing strategy is across individuals. To this
      aim, we measured how well rats could discriminate a reference object from 11
      distractors, which spanned a spectrum of image-level similarity to the reference.
      We also presented the animals with random variations of the reference, and
      processed their responses to these stimuli to derive subject-specific models of
      rat perceptual choices. Our models successfully captured the highly variable
      discrimination performance observed across subjects and object conditions. In
      particular, they revealed that the animals that succeeded with the most
      challenging distractors were those that integrated the wider variety of
      discriminative features into their perceptual strategies. Critically, these
      strategies were largely preserved when the rats were required to discriminate
      outlined and scaled versions of the stimuli, thus showing that rat object vision 
      can be characterized as a transformation-tolerant, feature-based filtering
      process. Overall, these findings indicate that rats are capable of advanced
      processing of shape information, and point to the rodents as powerful models for 
      investigating the neuronal underpinnings of visual object recognition and other
      high-level visual functions.

      circuit are grid cells in entorhinal cortex [2], largely thought to support
      intrinsic self-motion-related computations, such as path integration (i.e.,
      keeping track of one's position by integrating self-motion cues) [3-6]. Given
      that entorhinal cortex is particularly vulnerable to neurodegenerative processes 
      during aging and Alzheimer's disease [7-14], deficits in grid cell function could
      be a key mechanism to explain age-related navigational decline. To test this
      hypothesis, we conducted two experiments in healthy young and older adults.
      First, in an fMRI experiment, we found significantly reduced grid-cell-like
      representations in entorhinal cortex of older adults. Second, in a behavioral
      path integration experiment, older adults showed deficits in computations of
      self-position during path integration based on body-based or visual self-motion
      cues. Most strikingly, we found that these path integration deficits in older
      adults could be explained by their individual magnitudes of grid-cell-like
      representations, as reduced grid-cell-like representations were associated with
      larger path integration errors. Together, these results show that grid-cell-like 
      representations in entorhinal cortex are compromised in healthy aging.
      Furthermore, the association between grid-cell-like representations and path
      integration performance in old age supports the notion that grid cells underlie
      path integration processes. We therefore conclude that impaired grid cell
      function may play a key role in age-related decline of specific higher-order
      cognitive functions, such as spatial navigation.

AB  - Alongside the development of sexual characteristics and reproductive competence, 
      adolescents undergo marked cognitive, social, and emotional development [1]. A
      fundamental question is whether these changes are triggered by activation of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis at puberty (puberty dependent) or
      whether they occur independently of HPG activation (puberty independent).
      Disentangling puberty-dependent from puberty-independent mechanisms is difficult 
      because puberty and adolescence typically proceed concurrently. Here, we test a
      new approach that leverages natural adaptations of a seasonally breeding species 
      to dissociate pubertal status from chronological age. Siberian hamsters (Phodopus
      sungorus) reared in a long, summer-like day length (LD) exhibit rapid pubertal
      development, whereas those reared in a short, winter-like day length (SD) delay
      puberty by several months to synchronize breeding with the following spring [2,
      3]. We tested whether the SD-induced delay in puberty delays the peri-adolescent 
      decline in juvenile social play and the rise in aggression that characterizes
      adolescent social development in many species [4-6] and compared the results to
      those obtained after prepubertal gonadectomy. Neither SD rearing nor prepubertal 
      gonadectomy altered the age at which hamsters transitioned from play to
      aggression; SD-reared hamsters completed this transition prior to puberty. SD
      rearing and prepubertal gonadectomy, however, increased levels of play in male
      and female juveniles, implicating a previously unknown role for prepubertal
      gonadal hormones in juvenile social behavior. Levels of aggression were also
      impacted (decreased) in SD-reared and gonadectomized males. These data
      demonstrate that puberty-independent mechanisms regulate the timing of adolescent
      social development, while prepubertal and adult gonadal hormones modulate levels 
      of age-appropriate social behaviors.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized cells that require continuous turnover of membrane
      proteins at axon terminals to develop, function, and survive. Yet, it is still
      unclear whether membrane protein degradation requires transport back to the cell 
      body or whether degradation also occurs locally at the axon terminal, where live 
      observation of sorting and degradation has remained a challenge. Here, we report 
      direct observation of two cargo-specific membrane protein degradation mechanisms 
      at axon terminals based on a live-imaging approach in intact Drosophila brains.
      We show that different acidification-sensing cargo probes are sorted into
      distinct classes of degradative "hub" compartments for synaptic vesicle proteins 
      and plasma membrane proteins at axon terminals. Sorting and degradation of the
      two cargoes in the separate hubs are molecularly distinct. Local sorting of
      synaptic vesicle proteins for degradation at the axon terminal is, surprisingly, 
      Rab7 independent, whereas sorting of plasma membrane proteins is Rab7 dependent. 
      The cathepsin-like protease CP1 is specific to synaptic vesicle hubs, and its
      delivery requires the vesicle SNARE neuronal synaptobrevin. Cargo separation only
      occurs at the axon terminal, whereas degradative compartments at the cell body
      are mixed. These data show that at least two local, molecularly distinct pathways
      sort membrane cargo for degradation specifically at the axon terminal, whereas
      degradation can occur both at the terminal and en route to the cell body.

AB  - The female sex in honeybees (Apis spp.) comprises a reproductive queen and a
      sterile worker caste. Nurse bees feed all larvae progressively with a
      caste-specific food jelly until the prepupal stage. Only those larvae that are
      exclusively fed a large amount of royal jelly (RJ) develop into queens [1]. RJ is
      a composite secretion of two specialized head glands: the mandibular glands,
      which produce mainly fatty acids [2], and the hypopharyngeal glands, which
      contribute proteins, primarily belonging to the major royal jelly protein (MRJP) 
      family [3]. Past research on RJ has focused on its nutritional function and
      overlooked its central role with regard to the orientation of the larva in the
      royal brood cell. Whereas workers are reared in the regular horizontal cells of
      the comb, the queen cells are specifically built outside of the normal comb area 
      to accommodate for the larger queen [4, 5]. These cells hang freely along the
      bottom of the comb and are vertically oriented, opening downward [6]. Queen
      larvae are attached by their RJ diet to the cell ceiling. Thus, the physical
      properties of RJ are central to successful retention of larvae in the cell. Here,
      we show that the main protein of RJ (MRJP1) polymerizes in complex with another
      protein, apisimin, into long fibrous structures that build the basis for the high
      viscosity of RJ to hold queen larvae on the RJ surface.

AB  - Ancient DNA from Vanuatu and Tonga dating to about 2,900-2,600 years ago (before 
      present, BP) has revealed that the "First Remote Oceanians" associated with the
      Lapita archaeological culture were directly descended from the population that,
      beginning around 5000 BP, spread Austronesian languages from Taiwan to the
      Philippines, western Melanesia, and eventually Remote Oceania. Thus, ancestors of
      the First Remote Oceanians must have passed by the Papuan-ancestry populations
      they encountered in New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands
      with minimal admixture [1]. However, all present-day populations in Near and
      Remote Oceania harbor >25% Papuan ancestry, implying that additional eastward
      migration must have occurred. We generated genome-wide data for 14 ancient
      individuals from Efate and Epi Islands in Vanuatu from 2900-150 BP, as well as
      185 present-day individuals from 18 islands. We find that people of almost
      entirely Papuan ancestry arrived in Vanuatu by around 2300 BP, most likely
      reflecting migrations a few hundred years earlier at the end of the Lapita
      period, when there is also evidence of changes in skeletal morphology and
      cessation of long-distance trade between Near and Remote Oceania [2, 3]. Papuan
      ancestry was subsequently diluted through admixture but remains at least 80%-90% 
      in most islands. Through a fine-grained analysis of ancestry profiles, we show
      that the Papuan ancestry in Vanuatu derives from the Bismarck Archipelago rather 
      than the geographically closer Solomon Islands. However, the Papuan ancestry in
      Polynesia-the most remote Pacific islands-derives from different sources,
      documenting a third stream of migration from Near to Remote Oceania.

AB  - Approach-avoidance conflict arises when an animal encounters a stimulus that is
      associated simultaneously with positive and negative valences [1]. The effective 
      resolution of approach-avoidance conflict is critical for survival and is
      believed to go awry in a number of mental disorders, such as anxiety and
      addiction. An accumulation of evidence from both rodents and humans suggests that
      the ventral hippocampus (anterior in humans) plays a key role in
      approach-avoidance conflict processing [2-8], with one influential model
      proposing that this structure modulates behavioral inhibition in the face of
      conflicting goals by increasing the influence of negative valences [9]. Very
      little is known, however, about the contributions of specific hippocampal
      subregions to this process-an important issue given the functional and anatomical
      heterogeneity of this structure. Using a non-spatial cue-based paradigm in rats, 
      we found that transient pharmacological inactivation of ventral CA1 produced an
      avoidance of a conflict cue imbued with both learned positive and learned
      negative outcomes, whereas inactivation of the ventral CA3 resulted in the
      opposite pattern of behavior, with significant preference for the conflict cue.
      In contrast, dorsal CA1- and CA3-inactivated rats showed no change in conflict
      behavior, and furthermore, additional behavioral tasks confirmed that the
      observed pattern of approach-avoidance findings could not be explained by other
      factors, such as differential alterations in novelty detection or locomotor
      activity. Our data demonstrate that ventral CA1 and CA3 subserve distinct and
      opposing roles in approach-avoidance conflict processing and provide important
      insight into the functions and circuitry of the ventral hippocampus.

TI  - Identification of an Intra- and Inter-specific Tear Protein Signal in Rodents.

LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.060 [doi]
AB  - Rodents use the vomeronasal olfactory system to acquire both inter- and
      intra-specific information from the external environment and take appropriate
      actions. For example, urinary proteins from predator species elicit avoidance in 
      mice, while those from male mice attract female mice. In addition to urinary
      proteins, recent studies have highlighted the importance of lacrimal proteins for
      intra-specific communications in mice. However, whether the tear fluid of other
      species also mediates social signals remains unknown. Here, we show that a
      lacrimal protein in rats (predators of mice), called cystatin-related protein 1
      (ratCRP1), activates the vomeronasal system of mice. This protein is specifically
      produced by adult male rats in a steroid hormone-dependent manner, activates the 
      vomeronasal system of female rats, and enhances stopping behavior. When detected 
      by mice, ratCRP1 activates the medial hypothalamic defensive circuit, resulting
      in decreased locomotion coupled with lowered body temperature and heart rate.
      Notably, ratCRP1 is recognized by multiple murine type 2 vomeronasal receptors,
      including Vmn2r28. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of vmn2r28 impaired both
      ratCRP1-induced neural activation of the hypothalamic center and decrease of
      locomotor activity in mice. Taken together, these data reveal the neural and
      molecular basis by which a tear fluid compound in rats affects the behavior of
      mice. Furthermore, our study reveals a case in which a single compound that
      mediates an intra-specific signal in a predator species also functions as an
      inter-specific signal in the prey species.

AB  - Crossing over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis repairs programmed
      DNA double-strand breaks, ensures proper segregation at meiosis I [1], shapes the
      genomic distribution of nucleotide variability in populations, and enhances the
      efficacy of natural selection among genetically linked sites [2]. Between closely
      related Drosophila species, large differences exist in the rate and chromosomal
      distribution of crossing over. Little, however, is known about the molecular
      genetic changes or population genetic forces that mediate evolved differences in 
      recombination between species [3, 4]. Here, we show that a meiosis gene with a
      history of rapid evolution acts as a trans-acting modifier of species differences
      in crossing over. In transgenic flies, the dicistronic gene, mei-217/mei-218,
      recapitulates a large part of the species differences in the rate and chromosomal
      distribution of crossing over. These phenotypic differences appear to result from
      changes in protein sequence not gene expression. Our population genetics analyses
      show that the protein-coding sequence of mei-218, but not mei-217, has a history 
      of recurrent positive natural selection. By modulating the intensity of
      centromeric and telomeric suppression of crossing over, evolution at mei-217/-218
      has incidentally shaped gross differences in the chromosomal distribution of
      nucleotide variability between species. We speculate that recurrent bouts of
      adaptive evolution at mei-217/-218 might reflect a history of coevolution with
      selfish genetic elements.

AB  - Starburst amacrine cell (SAC) morphology is considered central to retinal
      direction selectivity. In Sema6A(-/-) mice, SAC dendritic arbors are smaller and 
      no longer radially symmetric, leading to a reduction in SAC dendritic plexus
      density. Sema6A(-/-) mice also have a dramatic reduction in the directional
      tuning of retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Here we show that
      the loss of DSGC tuning in Sema6A(-/-) mice is due to reduced null direction
      inhibition, even though strong asymmetric SAC-DSGC connectivity and SAC dendritic
      direction selectivity are maintained. Hence, the reduced coverage factor of SAC
      dendrites leads specifically to a loss of null direction inhibition. Moreover,
      SAC dendrites are no longer strictly tuned to centrifugal motion, indicating that
      SAC morphology is critical in coordinating synaptic connectivity and dendritic
      integration to generate direction selectivity.

      Drosophila Neurons.

LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.048 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria play fundamental roles within cells, including energy provision,
      calcium homeostasis, and the regulation of apoptosis. The transport of
      mitochondria by microtubule-based motors is critical for neuronal structure and
      function. This process allows local requirements for mitochondrial functions to
      be met and also facilitates recycling of these organelles [1, 2]. An age-related 
      reduction in mitochondrial transport has been observed in neurons of mammalian
      and non-mammalian organisms [3-6], and has been proposed to contribute to the
      broader decline in neuronal function that occurs during aging [3, 5-7]. However, 
      the factors that influence mitochondrial transport in aging neurons are poorly
      understood. Here we provide evidence using the tractable Drosophila wing nerve
      system that the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway promotes the
      axonal transport of mitochondria in adult neurons. The level of the catalytic
      subunit of PKA decreases during aging, and acute activation of the cAMP/PKA
      pathway in aged flies strongly stimulates mitochondrial motility. Thus, the
      age-related impairment of transport is reversible. The expression of many genes
      is increased by PKA activation in aged flies. However, our results indicate that 
      elevated mitochondrial transport is due in part to upregulation of the heavy
      chain of the kinesin-1 motor, the level of which declines during aging. Our study
      identifies evolutionarily conserved factors that can strongly influence
      mitochondrial motility in aging neurons.

AB  - To optimally balance opposing demands of speed and accuracy during
      decision-making, we must flexibly adapt how much evidence we require before
      making a choice. Such adjustments in decision thresholds have been linked to the 
      subthalamic nucleus (STN), and therapeutic STN deep-brain stimulation (DBS) has
      been shown to interfere with this function. Here, we performed continuous as well
      as closed-loop DBS of the STN while Parkinson's disease patients performed a
      perceptual decision-making task. Closed-loop STN DBS allowed temporally patterned
      STN stimulation and simultaneous recordings of STN activity. This revealed that
      DBS only affected patients' ability to adjust decision thresholds if applied in a
      specific temporally confined time window during deliberation. Only stimulation in
      that window diminished the normal slowing of response times that occurred on
      difficult trials when DBS was turned off. Furthermore, DBS eliminated a relative,
      time-specific increase in STN beta oscillations and compromised its functional
      relationship with trial-by-trial adjustments in decision thresholds. Together,
      these results provide causal evidence that the STN is involved in adjusting
      decision thresholds in distinct, time-limited processing windows during
      deliberation.

AB  - Cells from all three domains of life on Earth utilize motile macromolecular
      devices that protrude from the cell surface to generate forces that allow them to
      swim through fluid media. Research carried out on archaea during the past decade 
      or so has led to the recognition that, despite their common function, the
      motility devices of the three domains display fundamental differences in their
      properties and ancestry, reflecting a striking example of convergent evolution.
      Thus, the flagella of bacteria and the archaella of archaea employ rotary
      filaments that assemble from distinct subunits that do not share a common
      ancestor and generate torque using energy derived from distinct fuel sources,
      namely chemiosmotic ion gradients and FlaI motor-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis,
      respectively. The cilia of eukaryotes, however, assemble via kinesin-2-driven
      intraflagellar transport and utilize microtubules and ATP-hydrolyzing dynein
      motors to beat in a variety of waveforms via a sliding filament mechanism. Here, 
      with reference to current structural and mechanistic information about these
      organelles, we briefly compare the evolutionary origins, assembly and tactic
      motility of archaella, flagella and cilia.

AB  - For over half a century, the multitudinous mirror eyes of the lowly scallop have 
      continuously amazed us with their visual eccentricities. The latest surprise is
      the mirror itself, which turns out to be an extraordinary optical wonder.

AB  - The sequencing and analysis of the Sumatran rhinoceros genome provides vital data
      for understanding the history of the subspecies in Sumatra [1], but not for
      reconstructing the history of the population on the mainland after the two were
      separated by rising seas in the early Holocene. Evidence from zooarchaeology,
      texts and artifacts makes clear that the Holocene range of the Sumatran
      rhinoceros extended all the way from the tropics to the temperate Yellow River
      Valley of North China (35 degrees North), and that humans have extirpated the
      species from most of its range. While the name 'Sumatran' suggests that these are
      tropical animals, in fact they are the only extant hairy rhinoceros, which
      presumably protected them from cold, and are the most closely related of all
      living rhinoceroses to the extinct cold-adapted woolly rhinoceros [2].

AB  - How are brief encounters transformed into lasting memories? Previous research has
      established the role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, along with its
      electrophysiological signatures of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles, for
      memory consolidation [1-4]. In related work, experimental manipulations have
      demonstrated that NREM sleep provides a window of opportunity to selectively
      strengthen particular memory traces via the delivery of auditory cues [5-10], a
      procedure known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). It has remained unclear,
      however, whether TMR triggers the brain's endogenous consolidation mechanisms
      (linked to SOs and/or spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn mediate
      effective processing of mnemonic information. We devised a novel paradigm in
      which associative memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) were
      selectively cued during a post-learning nap, successfully stabilizing next-day
      retention relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that, compared to novel 
      control adjectives, memory cues evoked an increase in fast spindles. Critically, 
      during the time window of cue-induced spindle activity, the memory category
      linked to the verbal cue (object or scene) could be reliably decoded, with the
      fidelity of this decoding predicting the behavioral consolidation benefits of
      TMR. These results provide correlative evidence for an information processing
      role of sleep spindles in service of memory consolidation.

AB  - The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) has been initially identified as a
      supraspinal center capable of initiating and modulating locomotion. Whereas its
      functional contribution to locomotion has been widely documented throughout the
      phylogeny from the lamprey to humans, there is still debate about its exact
      organization. Combining kinematic and electrophysiological recordings in mouse
      genetics, our study reveals that glutamatergic neurons of the cuneiform nucleus
      initiate locomotion and induce running gaits, whereas glutamatergic and
      cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus modulate locomotor pattern
      and rhythm, contributing to slow-walking gaits. By initiating, modulating, and
      accelerating locomotion, our study identifies and characterizes distinct neuronal
      populations of this functional region important to locomotor command.

TI  - Diversification Patterns of Lanternfishes Reveal Multiple Rate Shifts in a
      Critical Mesopelagic Clade Targeted for Human Exploitation.

AB  - The mesopelagic (midwater) and deep-sea environments together comprise over 90%
      of the volume of the world ocean [1] and provide services that are only recently 
      becoming recognized [2]. One of the most significant of these services relates to
      midwater fish biomass, recently estimated to be two orders of magnitude larger
      than the current worldwide fisheries catch [3, 4]. Calls to exploit midwater fish
      biomass have increased despite warnings about the unknown recovery potential of
      such organisms [2] and despite existing data suggesting that deep-sea fishes
      could be classified as endangered [5]. Here, to provide a null model for the
      respondability of midwater fishes, I use lanternfishes-which comprise the
      majority of worldwide midwater fish biomass [6]-to examine the diversification
      response of a critical midwater clade to oceanic changes over evolutionary
      timescales, including several extinction and turnover events. Using a
      time-calibrated molecular phylogeny based on seven autosomal protein-coding loci,
      with over 50% species sampling and three ingroup node calibrations, I show that
      lanternfishes exhibit a continuously increasing diversification rate, consistent 
      with nonequilibrium speciation dynamics, and three major evolutionary rate shift 
      locations with timing that is similar to those of marine clades in more
      well-known environments. These results suggest that lanternfish diversification
      patterns overlapped with major events in the physical partitioning of the ocean
      volume and that the clade has responded positively to a range of pre-Anthropocene
      extinction drivers [7]. However, lanternfish respondability to modern extinction 
      drivers-habitat loss and overexploitation-is best addressed with populational and
      ecological data and remains largely unknown.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) store fats and play critical roles in lipid and energy
      homeostasis. They form between the leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      membrane and consist of a neutral lipid core wrapped in a phospholipid monolayer 
      with proteins. Two types of ER-LD architecture are thought to exist and be
      essential for LD functioning. Maturing LDs either emerge from the ER into the
      cytoplasm, remaining attached to the ER by a narrow membrane neck, or stay
      embedded in the ER and are surrounded by ER membrane. Here, we identify a
      lipid-based mechanism that controls which of these two architectures is favored. 
      Theoretical modeling indicated that the intrinsic molecular curvatures of ER
      phospholipids can determine whether LDs remain embedded in or emerge from the ER;
      lipids with negative intrinsic curvature such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and
      phosphatidylethanolamine favor LD embedding, while those with positive intrinsic 
      curvature, like lysolipids, support LD emergence. This prediction was verified by
      altering the lipid composition of the ER in S. cerevisiae using mutants and the
      addition of exogenous lipids. We found that fat-storage-inducing transmembrane
      protein 2 (FIT2) homologs become enriched at sites of LD generation when
      biogenesis is induced. DAG accumulates at sites of LD biogenesis, and FIT2
      proteins may promote LD emergence from the ER by reducing DAG levels at these
      sites. Altogether, our findings suggest that cells regulate LD integration in the
      ER by modulating ER lipid composition, particularly at sites of LD biogenesis and
      that FIT2 proteins may play a central role in this process.

AB  - Biological sex, a fundamental dimension of internal state, can modulate neural
      circuits to generate behavioral variation. Understanding how and why circuits are
      tuned by sex can provide important insights into neural and behavioral
      plasticity. Here we find that sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to C.
      elegans ascaroside sex pheromones are implemented by the functional modulation of
      shared chemosensory circuitry. In particular, the sexual state of a single
      sensory neuron pair, ADF, determines the nature of an animal's behavioral
      response regardless of the sex of the rest of the body. Genetic feminization of
      ADF causes males to be repelled by, rather than attracted to, ascarosides,
      whereas masculinization of ADF has the opposite effect in hermaphrodites. When
      ADF is ablated, both sexes are weakly repelled by ascarosides. Genetic sex
      modulates ADF function by tuning chemosensation: although ADF is functional in
      both sexes, it detects the ascaroside ascr#3 only in males, a consequence of
      cell-autonomous action of the master sexual regulator tra-1. This occurs in part 
      through the conserved DM-domain gene mab-3, which promotes the male state of ADF.
      The sexual modulation of ADF has a key role in reproductive fitness, as
      feminization or ablation of ADF renders males unable to use ascarosides to locate
      mates. Our results reveal an economical mechanism in which sex-specific
      behavioral valence arises through the cell-autonomous regulation of a
      chemosensory switch by genetic sex, allowing a social cue with salience for both 
      sexes to elicit navigational responses commensurate with the differing needs of
      each.

TI  - Repellent and Attractant Guidance Cues Initiate Cell Migration by Distinct
      Rear-Driven and Front-Driven Cytoskeletal Mechanisms.

AB  - Attractive and repulsive cell guidance is essential for animal life and important
      in disease. Cell migration toward attractants dominates studies [1-8], but
      migration away from repellents is important in biology yet relatively little
      studied [5, 9, 10]. It is widely held that cells initiate migration by protrusion
      of their front [11-15], yet this has not been explicitly tested for cell guidance
      because cell margin displacement at opposite ends of the cell has not been
      distinguished for any cue. We argue that protrusion of the front, retraction of
      the rear, or both together could in principle break cell symmetry and start
      migration in response to guidance cues [16]. Here, we find in the Dictyostelium
      model [6] that an attractant-cAMP-breaks symmetry by causing protrusion of the
      front of the cell, whereas its repellent analog-8CPT-breaks symmetry by causing
      retraction of the rear. Protrusion of the front of these cells in response to
      cAMP starts with local actin filament assembly, while the delayed retraction of
      the rear is independent of both myosin II polarization and of motor-based
      contractility. On the contrary, myosin II accumulates locally in the rear of the 
      cell in response to 8CPT, anticipating retraction and required for it, while
      local actin assembly is delayed and couples to delayed protrusion at the front.
      These data reveal an important new concept in the understanding of cell guidance.

AB  - Maternally transmitted Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, and Cardinium bacteria are common 
      in insects [1], but their interspecific spread is poorly understood.
      Endosymbionts can spread rapidly within host species by manipulating host
      reproduction, as typified by the global spread of wRi Wolbachia observed in
      Drosophila simulans [2, 3]. However, because Wolbachia cannot survive outside
      host cells, spread between distantly related host species requires horizontal
      transfers that are presumably rare [4-7]. Here, we document spread of wRi-like
      Wolbachia among eight highly diverged Drosophila hosts (10-50 million years) over
      only about 14,000 years (5,000-27,000). Comparing 110 wRi-like genomes, we find
      </=0.02% divergence from the wRi variant that spread rapidly through California
      populations of D. simulans. The hosts include both globally invasive species (D. 
      simulans, D. suzukii, and D. ananassae) and narrowly distributed Australian
      endemics (D. anomalata and D. pandora) [8]. Phylogenetic analyses that include
      mtDNA genomes indicate introgressive transfer of wRi-like Wolbachia between
      closely related species D. ananassae, D. anomalata, and D. pandora but no
      horizontal transmission within species. Our analyses suggest D. ananassae as the 
      Wolbachia source for the recent wRi invasion of D. simulans and D. suzukii as the
      source of Wolbachia in its sister species D. subpulchrella. Although six of these
      wRi-like variants cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, two cause no
      detectable reproductive effects, indicating that pervasive mutualistic effects
      [9, 10] complement the reproductive manipulations for which Wolbachia are best
      known. "Super spreader" variants like wRi may be particularly useful for
      controlling insect pests and vector-borne diseases with Wolbachia transinfections
      [11].

AB  - Nursery pollination involves pollinators that lay eggs on the flowers they
      pollinate and have their brood fed on flower parts or developing ovules [1-4].
      Active pollination, a ritualistic behavioral sequence shown by nursery
      pollinators when transferring pollen from anthers to stigmas, is known in only
      four plant lineages [5-8], including the classical examples of fig trees-fig
      wasps and yuccas-yucca moths [5, 6]. We report in detail a system in which
      weevils actively pollinate orchids prior to having their larvae fed on the
      developing fruits. Sampling over five years revealed that although weevils
      trigger fruit set, this interaction is negative for the plant as weevil larvae
      often consume all contents of infested fruits. However, part of weevil-infested
      fruits is often "rescued" by parasitoid wasps, which kill the weevil larvae
      before all fruit content is consumed (Figure 1). "Rescued" fruits present high
      seed viability and biomass similar to that of non-infested fruits, much higher
      than that of fruits with weevils only. Hence, parasitoids mediate the fitness
      consequences of the interaction between the plant and its parasitic pollinator.
      Weevils constitute a megadiverse group of herbivores commonly reported as
      florivores [9] but are also appreciated as flower-ovipositing pollinators of
      cycads and palms [4, 10-13] and were previously recorded carrying orchid
      pollinaria [14-16]. The orchid-weevil system presented here shows that
      plant-floral visitor interaction outcome can be mediated by a third party
      (parasitoids) and illustrates a way by which the biological context may allow the
      emergence and persistence of active nursery pollination behavior in nature.

AB  - The contribution of microtubule tip dynamics to the assembly and function of
      plant microtubule arrays remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the
      Arabidopsis SPIRAL2 (SPR2) protein modulates the dynamics of the acentrosomal
      cortical microtubule plus and minus ends in an opposing manner. Live imaging of a
      functional SPR2-mRuby fusion protein revealed that SPR2 shows both microtubule
      plus- and minus-end tracking activity in addition to localization at microtubule 
      intersections and along the lattice. Analysis of microtubule dynamics showed that
      cortical microtubule plus ends rarely undergo catastrophe in the spr2-2 knockout 
      mutant compared to wild-type. In contrast, cortical microtubule minus ends in
      spr2-2 depolymerized at a much faster rate than in wild-type. Destabilization of 
      the minus ends in spr2-2 caused a significant decrease in the lifetime of
      microtubule crossovers, which dramatically reduced the microtubule-severing
      frequency and inhibited light-induced microtubule array reorientation. Using in
      vitro reconstitution experiments combined with single-molecule imaging, we found 
      that recombinant SPR2-GFP intrinsically localizes to microtubule minus ends,
      where it binds stably and inhibits their dynamics. Together, our data establish
      SPR2 as a new type of microtubule tip regulator that governs the length and
      lifetime of microtubules.

AB  - Insular adaptive radiations in which repeated bouts of diversification lead to
      phenotypically similar sets of taxa serve to highlight predictability in the
      evolutionary process [1]. However, examples of such replicated events are rare.
      Cross-clade comparisons of adaptive radiations are much needed to determine
      whether similar ecological opportunities can lead to the same outcomes. Here, we 
      report a heretofore uncovered adaptive radiation of Hawaiian stick spiders
      (Theridiidae, Ariamnes) in which different species exhibit a set of discrete
      ecomorphs associated with different microhabitats. The three primary ecomorphs
      (gold, dark, and matte white) generally co-occur in native forest habitats.
      Phylogenetic reconstruction mapped onto the well-known chronosequence of the
      Hawaiian Islands shows both that this lineage colonized the islands only once and
      relatively recently (2-3 mya, when Kauai and Oahu were the only high islands in
      the archipelago) and that the distinct ecomorphs evolved independently multiple
      times following colonization of new islands. This parallel evolution of ecomorphs
      matches that of "spiny-leg" long-jawed spiders (Tetragnathidae, Tetragnatha),
      also in Hawaii [2]. Both lineages are free living, and both have related lineages
      in the Hawaiian Islands that show quite different patterns of diversification
      with no evidence of deterministic evolution. We argue that repeated evolution of 
      ecomorphs results from a rugged adaptive landscape, with the few peaks associated
      with camouflage for these free-living taxa against the markedly low diversity of 
      predators on isolated islands. These features, coupled with a limited genetic
      toolbox and reduced dispersal between islands, appear to be common to situations 
      of repeated evolution of ecomorphs.

AB  - Drosophila has become an excellent model system for investigating the
      organization and function of the gustatory system due to the relatively simple
      neuroanatomical organization of its brain and the availability of powerful
      genetic and transgenic technology. Thus, at the molecular and cellular levels, a 
      great deal of insight into the peripheral detection and coding of gustatory
      information has already been attained. In contrast, much less is known about the 
      central neural circuits that process this information and induce behaviorally
      appropriate motor output. Here, we combine functional behavioral tests with
      targeted transgene expression through specific driver lines to identify a single 
      bilaterally homologous pair of bitter-sensitive interneurons that are located in 
      the subesophageal zone of the brain. Anatomical and functional data indicate that
      these interneurons receive specific synaptic input from bitter-sensitive
      gustatory receptor neurons. Targeted transgenic activation and inactivation
      experiments show that these bitter-sensitive interneurons can largely suppress
      the proboscis extension reflex to appetitive stimuli, such as sugar and water.
      These functional experiments, together with calcium-imaging studies and
      calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) labeling,
      indicate that these first-order local interneurons play an important role in the 
      inhibition of the proboscis extension reflex that occurs in response to bitter
      tastants. Taken together, our studies present a cellular identification and
      functional characterization of a key gustatory interneuron in the
      bitter-sensitive gustatory circuitry of the adult fly.

AB  - Defensive responses to threatening stimuli are crucial to the survival of
      species. While expression of these responses is considered to be instinctive and 
      unconditional, their magnitude may be affected by environmental and internal
      factors. The neural circuits underlying this modulation are still largely
      unknown. In mice, looming-evoked defensive responses are mediated by the superior
      colliculus (SC), a subcortical sensorimotor integration center. We found that
      repeated stress caused an anxiety-like state in mice and accelerated defensive
      responses to looming. Stress also induced c-fos activation in locus coeruleus
      (LC) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)(+) neurons and modified adrenergic receptor
      expression in SC, suggesting a possible Th::LC-SC projection that may be involved
      in the accelerated defensive responses. Indeed, both anterograde and retrograde
      neural tracing confirmed the anatomical Th::LC-SC projection and that the
      SC-projecting TH(+) neurons in LC were activated by repeated stress. Optogenetic 
      stimulation of either LC TH(+) neurons or the Th::LC-SC fibers also caused
      anxiety-like behaviors and accelerated defensive responses to looming. Meanwhile,
      chemogenetic inhibition of LC TH(+) neurons and the infusion of an adrenergic
      receptor antagonist in SC abolished the enhanced looming defensive responses
      after repeated stress, confirming the necessity of this pathway. These findings
      suggest that the Th::LC-SC pathway plays a key role in the sophisticated
      adjustments of defensive behaviors induced by changes in physiological states.

AB  - Our understanding of bacterial cell size control is based mainly on stress-free
      growth conditions in the laboratory [1-10]. In the real world, however, bacteria 
      are routinely faced with stresses that produce long filamentous cell morphologies
      [11-28]. Escherichia coli is observed to filament in response to DNA damage
      [22-25], antibiotic treatment [11-14, 28], host immune systems [15, 16],
      temperature [17], starvation [20], and more [18, 19, 21], conditions which are
      relevant to clinical settings and food preservation [26]. This shape plasticity
      is considered a survival strategy [27]. Size control in this regime remains
      largely unexplored. Here we report that E. coli cells use a dynamic size ruler to
      determine division locations combined with an adder-like mechanism to trigger
      divisions. As filamentous cells increase in size due to growth, or decrease in
      size due to divisions, its multiple Fts division rings abruptly reorganize to
      remain one characteristic cell length away from the cell pole and two such length
      units away from each other. These rules can be explained by spatiotemporal
      oscillations of Min proteins. Upon removal of filamentation stress, the cells
      undergo a sequence of division events, randomly at one of the possible division
      sites, on average after the time required to grow one characteristic cell size.
      These results indicate that E. coli cells continuously keep track of absolute
      length to control size, suggest a wider relevance for the adder principle beyond 
      the control of normally sized cells, and provide a new perspective on the
      function of the Fts and Min systems.

AB  - The position of the division site dictates the size and fate of daughter cells in
      many organisms. In animal cells, division-site placement involves overlapping
      mechanisms, including signaling from the central spindle microtubules, astral
      microtubules, and spindle poles and through polar contractions [1-3]. In fission 
      yeast, division-site positioning requires overlapping mechanisms involving the
      anillin-related protein Mid1 and the tip complex (comprising the Kelch-repeat
      protein Tea1, the Dyrk-kinase Pom1, and the SH3-domain protein Tea4) [4-11]. In
      addition to these factors, cell shape has also been shown to participate in the
      maintenance of the position of the actomyosin ring [12-14]. The first principles 
      guiding actomyosin ring placement, however, have not been elucidated in any
      organism. Because actomyosin ring positioning, ring assembly, and cell
      morphogenesis are genetically separable in fission yeast, we have used it to
      derive actomyosin ring placement mechanisms from first principles. We report
      that, during ring assembly in the absence of cytokinetic cues (anillin-related
      Mid1 and tip-complex proteins), actin bundles follow the path of least curvature 
      and assemble actomyosin rings in an equatorial position in spherical protoplasts 
      and along the long axis in cylindrical cells and compressed protoplasts. The
      equatorial position of rings is abolished upon treatment of protoplasts with an
      actin-severing compound or by slowing down actin polymerization. We propose that 
      the physical properties of actin filaments/bundles play key roles in actomyosin
      ring assembly and positioning, and that key cytokinetic molecules may modulate
      the length of actin filaments to promote ring assembly along the short axis.

AB  - Incentives drive goal-directed behavior; however, how they impact the formation
      and stabilization of goal-relevant hippocampal maps remains unknown. Since
      dopamine is involved in reward processing, affects hippocampal-dependent
      behavior, and modulates hippocampal plasticity, we hypothesized that local
      dopaminergic transmission in the hippocampus serves to mold the formation and
      updating of hippocampal cognitive maps to adaptively represent reward-predicting 
      space of sensory inputs. We recorded CA1 place cells of rats throughout training 
      on a spatial extra-dimensional set-shift task. After learning to rely on one of
      two orthogonal sets of cues, we introduced a rule shift and infused locally the
      D1/5 receptor (D1/5R) antagonist SCH23390. Successful learning was accompanied by
      place cell reorientation to represent rule-relevant spatial dimension. SCH23390
      infusion prevented this remapping and, consequently, impaired learning, causing
      perseveration. These findings suggest that dopaminergic innervation provides
      reward information to the hippocampus and is critical for the stabilization of
      goal-related hippocampal representation, contributing to successful goal-directed
      behavior.

AB  - Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) is a conserved apical kinase in the spindle assembly
      checkpoint (SAC) that ensures accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.
      Mps1 undergoes extensive auto- and transphosphorylation, but the regulatory and
      functional consequences of these modifications remain unclear. Recent findings
      highlight the importance of intermolecular interactions between the N-terminal
      extension (NTE) of Mps1 and the Hec1 subunit of the NDC80 complex, which control 
      Mps1 localization at kinetochores and activation of the SAC. Whether the NTE
      regulates other mitotic functions of Mps1 remains unknown. Here, we report that
      phosphorylation within the NTE contributes to Mps1 activation through relief of
      catalytic autoinhibition that is mediated by the NTE itself. Moreover, we find
      that this regulatory NTE function is independent of its role in Mps1 kinetochore 
      recruitment. We demonstrate that the NTE autoinhibitory mechanism impinges most
      strongly on Mps1-dependent SAC functions and propose that Mps1 activation likely 
      occurs sequentially through dimerization of a "prone-to-autophosphorylate" Mps1
      conformer followed by autophosphorylation of the NTE prior to maximal kinase
      activation segment trans-autophosphorylation. Our observations underline the
      importance of autoregulated Mps1 activity in generation and maintenance of a
      robust SAC in human cells.

AB  - Changes in ploidy are relatively rare, but play important roles in the
      development of cancer and the acquisition of long-term adaptations. Genome
      duplications occur across the tree of life, and can alter the rate of adaptive
      evolution. Moreover, by allowing the subsequent loss of individual chromosomes
      and the accumulation of mutations, changes in ploidy can promote genomic
      instability and/or adaptation. Although many studies have been published in the
      last years about changes in chromosome number and their evolutionary
      consequences, tracking and measuring the rate of whole-genome duplications have
      been extremely challenging. We have systematically studied the appearance of
      diploid cells among haploid yeast cultures evolving for over 100 generations in
      different media. We find that spontaneous diploidization is a relatively common
      event, which is usually selected against, but under certain stressful conditions 
      may become advantageous. Furthermore, we were able to detect and distinguish
      between two different mechanisms of diploidization, one that requires
      whole-genome duplication (endoreduplication) and a second that involves
      mating-type switching despite the use of heterothallic strains. Our results have 
      important implications for our understanding of evolution and adaptation in
      fungal pathogens and the development of cancer, and for the use of yeast cells in
      biotechnological applications.

AB  - Our brain integrates information from multiple modalities in the control of
      behavior. When information from one sensory source is compromised, information
      from another source can compensate for the loss. What is not clear is whether the
      nature of this multisensory integration and the re-weighting of different sources
      of sensory information are the same across different control systems. Here, we
      investigated whether proprioceptive distance information (position sense of body 
      parts) can compensate for the loss of visual distance cues that support size
      constancy in perception (mediated by the ventral visual stream) [1, 2] versus
      size constancy in grasping (mediated by the dorsal visual stream) [3-6], in which
      the real-world size of an object is computed despite changes in viewing distance.
      We found that there was perfect size constancy in both perception and grasping in
      a full-viewing condition (lights on, binocular viewing) and that size constancy
      in both tasks was dramatically disrupted in the restricted-viewing condition
      (lights off; monocular viewing of the same but luminescent object through a 1-mm 
      pinhole). Importantly, in the restricted-viewing condition, proprioceptive cues
      about viewing distance originating from the non-grasping limb (experiment 1) or
      the inclination of the torso and/or the elbow angle of the grasping limb
      (experiment 2) compensated for the loss of visual distance cues to enable a
      complete restoration of size constancy in grasping but only a modest improvement 
      of size constancy in perception. This suggests that the weighting of different
      sources of sensory information varies as a function of the control system being
      used.

AB  - Adaptive behavior relies on complex neural processing in multiple interacting
      networks of both motor and sensory systems. One such interaction employs
      intrinsic neuronal signals, so-called 'corollary discharge' or 'efference copy', 
      that may be used to predict the sensory consequences of a specific behavioral
      action, thereby enabling self-generated (reafferent) sensory information and
      extrinsic (exafferent) sensory inflow to be dissociated. Here, by using
      well-established examples, we seek to identify the distinguishing features of
      corollary discharge and efference copy within the framework of predictive
      motor-to-sensory system coordination. We then extend the more general concept of 
      predictive signaling by showing how neural replicas of a particular motor command
      not only inform sensory pathways in order to gate reafferent stimulation, but can
      also be used to directly coordinate distinct and otherwise independent behaviors 
      to the original motor task. Moreover, this motor-to-motor pairing may
      additionally extend to a gating of sensory input to either or both of the coupled
      systems. The employment of predictive internal signaling in such motor systems
      coupling and remote sensory input control thus adds to our understanding of how
      an organism's central nervous system is able to coordinate the activity of
      multiple and generally disparate motor and sensory circuits in the production of 
      effective behavior.

AB  - The use of cues to predict the location of a visual target is an important
      cognitive strategy for primates. While mice are generally considered to be less
      dependent on vision than primates, new work shows that they can also use spatial 
      cues to direct their visual attention.

AB  - Birds are capable of high level cognition even though their telencephalon is
      organized into nuclear groups rather than a six-layered cortex as in the
      mammalian brain. New data show that, despite their different macroscale
      organization, the circuitries of avian and mammalian telencephalon are
      fundamentally similar and may therefore carry out equivalent computations.

AB  - The key structures and functions of land plants are most often studied in
      flowering plant models. However, the evolution of these traits (character states)
      is often difficult to infer, because we lack an accurate phylogenetic frame of
      reference. The potential branching order of the earliest land plants has now been
      further condensed, narrowing down potential reference frameworks for comparative 
      studies.

AB  - The evolution of gastrulation, the embryonic formation of distinct tissue layers,
      was a pivotal event in the metazoan radiation, as it paved the way for
      diversification of animal body plans from a hollow, ciliated, radially
      symmetrical ancestor [1]. The position of the site of gastrulation (that
      segregates internal endomesodermal precursors from outer ectodermal tissue) has
      played a role in our understanding of patterns of body plan evolution and is
      tightly regulated during development. In bilaterians (a large clade of
      bilaterally symmetrical animals that represent over 99% of all extant species),
      the site of gastrulation is determined by a localized molecular asymmetry
      resulting from a differential distribution of maternal determinants [2] along the
      so-called animal-vegetal axis (A-V axis) where the animal pole is marked by the
      site of polar body release during meiosis [1,3]. In most bilaterians, the site of
      gastrulation occurs at the vegetal pole (the side opposite the animal pole);
      however, in cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish) [3], the sister
      group to all bilaterians and ctenophores (comb jellies), likely to be the
      earliest branching group of extant metazoans [3], gastrulation occurs at the
      animal pole [3,4]. Here we show that components of the canonical Wnt-beta-catenin
      (cWnt) signaling pathway mediate endomesoderm formation and patterns the adult
      primary body axis.

AB  - Hummingbirds are a fascinating group of birds, but some aspects of their biology 
      are poorly understood, such as their highly diverse vocal behaviors. We show here
      that the predominant vocalization of black jacobins (Florisuga fusca), a
      hummingbird prevalent in the mountains of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, consists
      of a triplet of syllables with high fundamental frequency (mean F0 approximately 
      11.8 kHz), rapid frequency oscillations and strong ultrasonic harmonics and no
      detectable elements below approximately 10 kHz. These are the most common
      vocalizations of these birds, and their frequency range is above the known
      hearing range of any bird species recorded to date, including hearing specialists
      such as owls. These observations suggest that black jacobins either have an
      atypically high frequency hearing range, or alternatively their primary
      vocalization has a yet unknown function unrelated to vocal communication. Black
      jacobin vocalizations challenge current notions about vocal communication in
      birds.

AB  - Although familiar to each of us, the sensation of inhabiting a body is ineffable.
      Traditional senses like vision and hearing monitor the external environment,
      allowing humans to have shared sensory experiences. But proprioception, the
      sensation of body position and movement, is fundamentally personal and typically 
      absent from conscious perception. Nonetheless, this 'sixth sense' remains
      critical to human experience, a fact that is most apparent when one considers
      those who have lost it. Take, for example, the case of Ian Waterman who, at the
      age of 19, suffered a rare autoimmune response to a flu infection that attacked
      the sensory neurons from his neck down. This infection deprived him of the sense 
      of position, movement and touch in his body. With this loss of feedback came a
      complete inability to coordinate his movements. While he could compel his muscles
      to contract, he lost the ability to orchestrate these actions into purposeful
      behaviors, in essence leaving him immobile, unable to stand, walk, or use his
      body to interact with the world. Only after years of dedicated training was he
      able to re-learn to move his body entirely under visual control.

AB  - Selection of sexual partners is among the most critical decisions that
      individuals make and is therefore strongly shaped by evolution. In social
      species, where communication signals can convey substantial information about the
      identity, state, or quality of the signaler, accurate interpretation of
      communication signals for mate choice is crucial. Despite the importance of
      social information processing, to date, relatively little is known about the
      neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to sexual decision making and
      preferences. In this study, we used a combination of whole-brain functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), immediate early gene expression, and behavior 
      tests to identify the circuits that are important for the perception and
      evaluation of courtship songs in a female songbird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia 
      guttata). Female zebra finches are sensitive to subtle differences in male song
      performance and strongly prefer the longer, faster, and more stereotyped
      courtship songs to non-courtship renditions. Using BOLD fMRI and EGR1 expression 
      assays, we uncovered a novel region involved in auditory perceptual decision
      making located in a sensory integrative region of the avian central nidopallium
      outside the traditionally studied auditory forebrain pathways. Changes in
      activity in this region in response to acoustically similar but categorically
      divergent stimuli showed stronger parallels to behavioral responses than an
      auditory sensory region. These data highlight a potential role for the
      caudocentral nidopallium (NCC) as a novel node in the avian circuitry underlying 
      the evaluation of acoustic signals and their use in mate choice.

AB  - Starvation is life-threatening and therefore strongly modulates many aspects of
      animal behavior and physiology [1]. In mammals, hunger causes a reduction in body
      temperature and metabolism [2], resulting in conservation of energy for survival.
      However, the molecular basis of the modulation of thermoregulation by starvation 
      remains largely unclear. Whereas mammals control their body temperature
      internally, small ectotherms, such as Drosophila, set their body temperature by
      selecting an ideal environmental temperature through temperature preference
      behaviors [3, 4]. Here, we demonstrate in Drosophila that starvation results in a
      lower preferred temperature, which parallels the reduction in body temperature in
      mammals. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS) pathway is 
      involved in starvation-induced behaviors and physiology and is well conserved in 
      vertebrates and invertebrates [5-7]. We show that insulin-like peptide 6 (Ilp6)
      in the fat body (fly liver and adipose tissues) is responsible for the
      starvation-induced reduction in preferred temperature (Tp). Temperature
      preference behavior is controlled by the anterior cells (ACs), which respond to
      warm temperatures via transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1) [4]. We demonstrate
      that starvation decreases the responding temperature of ACs via insulin
      signaling, resulting in a lower Tp than in nutrient-rich conditions. Thus, we
      show that hunger information is conveyed from fat tissues via Ilp6 and influences
      the sensitivity of warm-sensing neurons in the brain, resulting in a lower
      temperature set point. Because starvation commonly results in a lower body
      temperature in both flies and mammals, we propose that insulin signaling is an
      ancient mediator of starvation-induced thermoregulation.

AB  - Investigating the evolution of human speech is difficult and controversial
      because human speech surpasses nonhuman primate vocal communication in scope and 
      flexibility [1-3]. Monkey vocalizations have been assumed to be largely innate,
      highly affective, and stereotyped for over 50 years [4, 5]. Recently, this
      perception has dramatically changed. Current studies have revealed distinct
      learning mechanisms during vocal development [6-8] and vocal flexibility,
      allowing monkeys to cognitively control when [9, 10], where [11], and what to
      vocalize [10, 12, 13]. However, specific call features (e.g., duration,
      frequency) remain surprisingly robust and stable in adult monkeys, resulting in
      rather stereotyped and discrete call patterns [14]. Additionally, monkeys seem to
      be unable to modulate their acoustic call structure under reinforced conditions
      beyond natural constraints [15, 16]. Behavioral experiments have shown that
      monkeys can stop sequences of calls immediately after acoustic perturbation but
      cannot interrupt ongoing vocalizations, suggesting that calls consist of single
      impartible pulses [17, 18]. Using acoustic perturbation triggered by the vocal
      behavior itself and quantitative measures of resulting vocal adjustments, we show
      that marmoset monkeys are capable of producing calls with durations beyond the
      natural boundaries of their repertoire by interrupting ongoing vocalizations
      rapidly after perturbation onset. Our results indicate that marmosets are capable
      of interrupting vocalizations only at periodic time points throughout calls,
      further supported by the occurrence of periodically segmented phees. These ideas 
      overturn decades-old concepts on primate vocal pattern generation, indicating
      that vocalizations do not consist of one discrete call pattern but are built of
      many sequentially uttered units, like human speech.

AB  - People routinely hear and understand speech at rates of 120-200 words per minute 
      [1, 2]. Thus, speech comprehension must involve rapid, online neural mechanisms
      that process words' meanings in an approximately time-locked fashion. However,
      electrophysiological evidence for such time-locked processing has been lacking
      for continuous speech. Although valuable insights into semantic processing have
      been provided by the "N400 component" of the event-related potential [3-6], this 
      literature has been dominated by paradigms using incongruous words within
      specially constructed sentences, with less emphasis on natural, narrative speech 
      comprehension. Building on the discovery that cortical activity "tracks" the
      dynamics of running speech [7-9] and psycholinguistic work demonstrating [10-12] 
      and modeling [13-15] how context impacts on word processing, we describe a new
      approach for deriving an electrophysiological correlate of natural speech
      comprehension. We used a computational model [16] to quantify the meaning carried
      by words based on how semantically dissimilar they were to their preceding
      context and then regressed this measure against electroencephalographic (EEG)
      data recorded from subjects as they listened to narrative speech. This produced a
      prominent negativity at a time lag of 200-600 ms on centro-parietal EEG channels,
      characteristics common to the N400. Applying this approach to EEG datasets
      involving time-reversed speech, cocktail party attention, and audiovisual
      speech-in-noise demonstrated that this response was very sensitive to whether or 
      not subjects understood the speech they heard. These findings demonstrate that,
      when successfully comprehending natural speech, the human brain responds to the
      contextual semantic content of each word in a relatively time-locked fashion.

AB  - A decline in female reproduction is one of the earliest hallmarks of aging in
      many animals, including invertebrates and mammals [1-4]. The insulin/insulin-like
      growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) pathway has a conserved role in regulating
      longevity [5] and also controls reproductive aging [2, 6]. Although IIS
      transcriptional targets that regulate somatic aging have been characterized [7,
      8], it was not known whether the same mechanisms influence reproductive aging. We
      previously showed that Caenorhabditis elegans daf-2 IIS receptor mutants extend
      reproductive span by maintaining oocyte quality with age [6], but IIS targets in 
      oocytes had not been identified. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of aged
      daf-2(-) and wild-type oocytes, and distinguished IIS targets in oocytes from
      soma-specific targets. Remarkably, IIS appears to regulate reproductive and
      somatic aging through largely distinct mechanisms, although the binding motif for
      longevity factor PQM-1 [8] was also overrepresented in oocyte targets. Reduction 
      of oocyte-specific IIS targets decreased reproductive span extension and oocyte
      viability of daf-2(-) worms, and pqm-1 is required for daf-2(-)'s long
      reproductive span. Cathepsin-B-like gene expression and activity levels were
      reduced in aged daf-2(-) oocytes, and RNAi against cathepsin-B-like W07B8.4
      improved oocyte quality maintenance and extended reproductive span. Importantly, 
      adult-only pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin B proteases reduced
      age-dependent deterioration in oocyte quality, even when treatment was initiated 
      in mid-reproduction. This suggests that it is possible to pharmacologically slow 
      age-related reproductive decline through mid-life intervention. Oocyte-specific
      IIS target genes thereby revealed potential therapeutic targets for maintaining
      reproductive health with age.

AB  - Root hairs facilitate a plant's ability to acquire soil anchorage and nutrients. 
      Root hair growth is regulated by the plant hormone auxin and dependent on
      localized synthesis, secretion, and modification of the root hair tip cell wall. 
      However, the exact cell wall regulators in root hairs controlled by auxin have
      yet to be determined. In this study, we describe the characterization of ERULUS
      (ERU), an auxin-induced Arabidopsis receptor-like kinase, whose expression is
      directly regulated by ARF7 and ARF19 transcription factors. ERU belongs to the
      Catharanthus roseus RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1-LIKE (CrRLK1L) subfamily of putative
      cell wall sensor proteins. Imaging of a fluorescent fusion protein revealed that 
      ERU is localized to the apical root hair plasma membrane. ERU regulates cell wall
      composition in root hairs and modulates pectin dynamics through negative control 
      of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity. Mutant eru (-/-) root hairs accumulate
      de-esterified homogalacturonan and exhibit aberrant pectin Ca(2+)-binding site
      oscillations and increased PME activity. Up to 80% of the eru root hair phenotype
      is rescued by pharmacological supplementation with a PME-inhibiting catechin
      extract. ERU transcription is altered in specific cell wall-related root hair
      mutants, suggesting that it is a target for feedback regulation. Loss of ERU
      alters the phosphorylation status of FERONIA and H(+)-ATPases 1/2, regulators of 
      apoplastic pH. Furthermore, H(+)-ATPases 1/2 and ERU are differentially
      phosphorylated in response to auxin. We conclude that ERULUS is a key
      auxin-controlled regulator of cell wall composition and pectin dynamics during
      root hair tip growth.

AB  - In the endocytic pathway of animals, two related complexes, called CORVET (class 
      C core vacuole/endosome transport) and HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein
      sorting), act as both tethers and fusion factors for early and late endosomes,
      respectively. Mutations in CORVET or HOPS lead to trafficking defects and
      contribute to human disease, including immune dysfunction. HOPS and CORVET are
      conserved throughout eukaryotes, but remarkably, in the ciliate Tetrahymena
      thermophila, the HOPS-specific subunits are absent, while CORVET-specific
      subunits have proliferated. VPS8 (vacuolar protein sorting), a CORVET subunit,
      expanded to 6 paralogs in Tetrahymena. This expansion correlated with loss of
      HOPS within a ciliate subgroup, including the Oligohymenophorea, which contains
      Tetrahymena. As uncovered via forward genetics, a single VPS8 paralog in
      Tetrahymena (VPS8A) is required to synthesize prominent secretory granules called
      mucocysts. More specifically, Deltavps8a cells fail to deliver a subset of cargo 
      proteins to developing mucocysts, instead accumulating that cargo in vesicles
      also bearing the mucocyst-sorting receptor Sor4p. Surprisingly, although this
      transport step relies on CORVET, it does not appear to involve early endosomes.
      Instead, Vps8a associates with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Rab7,
      indicating that target specificity switching occurred in CORVET subunits during
      the evolution of ciliates. Mucocysts belong to a markedly diverse and
      understudied class of protist secretory organelles called extrusomes. Our results
      underscore that biogenesis of mucocysts depends on endolysosomal trafficking,
      revealing parallels with invasive organelles in apicomplexan parasites and
      suggesting that a wide array of secretory adaptations in protists, like in
      animals, depend on mechanisms related to lysosome biogenesis.

AB  - Anatomical and functional asymmetries are widespread in the animal kingdom [1,
      2]. In vertebrates, many visceral organs are asymmetrically placed [3]. In
      snails, shells and inner organs coil asymmetrically, and in Drosophila, genitalia
      and hindgut undergo a chiral rotation during development. The evolutionary origin
      of these asymmetries remains an open question [1]. Nodal signaling is widely used
      [4], and many, but not all, vertebrates use cilia for symmetry breaking [5]. In
      Drosophila, which lacks both cilia and Nodal, the unconventional myosin ID
      (myo1d) gene controls dextral rotation of chiral organs [6, 7]. Here, we studied 
      the role of myo1d in left-right (LR) axis formation in Xenopus. Morpholino
      oligomer-mediated myo1d downregulation affected organ placement in >50% of
      morphant tadpoles. Induction of the left-asymmetric Nodal cascade was aberrant in
      >70% of cases. Expression of the flow-target gene dand5 was compromised, as was
      flow itself, due to shorter, fewer, and non-polarized cilia at the LR organizer. 
      Additional phenotypes pinpointed Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling and suggested
      that myo1d, like in Drosophila [8], acted in the context of the planar cell
      polarity pathway. Indeed, convergent extension of gastrula explant cultures was
      inhibited in myo1d morphants, and the ATF2 reporter gene for non-canonical Wnt
      signaling was downregulated. Finally, genetic interference experiments
      demonstrated a functional interaction between the core planar cell polarity
      signaling gene vangl2 and myo1d in LR axis formation. Thus, our data identified
      myo1d as a common denominator of arthropod and chordate asymmetry, in agreement
      with a monophyletic origin of animal asymmetry.

AB  - The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the etiology of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its normal physiological functions are still
      unclear. APP is cleaved by various secretases whereby sequential processing by
      the beta- and gamma-secretases produces the beta-amyloid peptide that is
      accumulating in plaques that typify AD. In addition, this produces secreted
      N-terminal sAPPbeta fragments and the APP intracellular domain (AICD).
      Alternative cleavage by alpha-secretase results in slightly longer secreted
      sAPPalpha fragments and the identical AICD. Whereas the AICD has been connected
      with transcriptional regulation, sAPPalpha fragments have been suggested to have 
      a neurotrophic and neuroprotective role [1]. Moreover, expression of sAPPalpha in
      APP-deficient mice could rescue their deficits in learning, spatial memory, and
      long-term potentiation [2]. Loss of the Drosophila APP-like (APPL) protein
      impairs associative olfactory memory formation and middle-term memory that can be
      rescued with a secreted APPL fragment [3]. We now show that APPL is also
      essential for visual working memory. Interestingly, this short-term memory
      declines rapidly with age, and this is accompanied by enhanced processing of APPL
      in aged flies. Furthermore, reducing secretase-mediated proteolytic processing of
      APPL can prevent the age-related memory loss, whereas overexpression of the
      secretases aggravates the aging effect. Rescue experiments confirmed that this
      memory requires signaling of full-length APPL and that APPL negatively regulates 
      the neuronal-adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2. Overexpression of APPL or one of its 
      secreted N termini results in a dominant-negative interaction with the FASII
      receptor. Therefore, our results show that specific memory processes require
      distinct APPL products.

AB  - In dynamic environments, split-second sensorimotor decisions must be prioritized 
      according to potential payoffs to maximize overall rewards. The impact of
      relative value on deliberative perceptual judgments has been examined extensively
      [1-6], but relatively little is known about value-biasing mechanisms in the
      common situation where physical evidence is strong but the time to act is
      severely limited. In prominent decision models, a noisy but statistically
      stationary representation of sensory evidence is integrated over time to an
      action-triggering bound, and value-biases are affected by starting the integrator
      closer to the more valuable bound. Here, we show significant departures from this
      account for humans making rapid sensory-instructed action choices. Behavior was
      best explained by a simple model in which the evidence representation-and hence, 
      rate of accumulation-is itself biased by value and is non-stationary, increasing 
      over the short decision time frame. Because the value bias initially dominates,
      the model uniquely predicts a dynamic "turn-around" effect on low-value cues,
      where the accumulator first launches toward the incorrect action but is then
      re-routed to the correct one. This was clearly exhibited in electrophysiological 
      signals reflecting motor preparation and evidence accumulation. Finally, we
      construct an extended model that implements this dynamic effect through plausible
      sensory neural response modulations and demonstrate the correspondence between
      decision signal dynamics simulated from a behavioral fit of that model and the
      empirical decision signals. Our findings suggest that value and sensory
      information can exert simultaneous and dynamically countervailing influences on
      the trajectory of the accumulation-to-bound process, driving rapid,
      sensory-guided actions.

AB  - Butterflies (Papilionoidea), with over 18,000 described species [1], have
      captivated naturalists and scientists for centuries. They play a central role in 
      the study of speciation, community ecology, biogeography, climate change, and
      plant-insect interactions and include many model organisms and pest species [2,
      3]. However, a robust higher-level phylogenetic framework is lacking. To fill
      this gap, we inferred a dated phylogeny by analyzing the first phylogenomic
      dataset, including 352 loci (> 150,000 bp) from 207 species representing 98% of
      tribes, a 35-fold increase in gene sampling and 3-fold increase in taxon sampling
      over previous studies [4]. Most data were generated with a new anchored hybrid
      enrichment (AHE) [5] gene kit (BUTTERFLY1.0) that includes both new and
      frequently used (e.g., [6]) informative loci, enabling direct comparison and
      future dataset merging with previous studies. Butterflies originated around 119
      million years ago (mya) in the late Cretaceous, but most extant lineages diverged
      after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass-extinction 65 mya. Our analyses
      support swallowtails (Papilionidae) as sister to all other butterflies, followed 
      by skippers (Hesperiidae) + the nocturnal butterflies (Hedylidae) as sister to
      the remainder, indicating a secondary reversal from diurnality to nocturnality.
      The whites (Pieridae) were strongly supported as sister to brush-footed
      butterflies (Nymphalidae) and blues + metalmarks (Lycaenidae and Riodinidae). Ant
      association independently evolved once in Lycaenidae and twice in Riodinidae.
      This study overturns prior notions of the taxon's evolutionary history, as many
      long-recognized subfamilies and tribes are para- or polyphyletic. It also
      provides a much-needed backbone for a revised classification of butterflies and
      for future comparative studies including genome evolution and ecology.

AB  - The evolutionary emergence of land plant body plans transformed the planet.
      However, our understanding of this formative episode is mired in the uncertainty 
      associated with the phylogenetic relationships among bryophytes (hornworts,
      liverworts, and mosses) and tracheophytes (vascular plants). Here we attempt to
      clarify this problem by analyzing a large transcriptomic dataset with models that
      allow for compositional heterogeneity between sites. Zygnematophyceae is resolved
      as sister to land plants, but we obtain several distinct relationships between
      bryophytes and tracheophytes. Concatenated sequence analyses that can explicitly 
      accommodate site-specific compositional heterogeneity give more support for a
      mosses-liverworts clade, "Setaphyta," as the sister to all other land plants, and
      weak support for hornworts as the sister to all other land plants. Bryophyte
      monophyly is supported by gene concatenation analyses using models explicitly
      accommodating lineage-specific compositional heterogeneity and analyses of gene
      trees. Both maximum-likelihood analyses that compare the fit of each gene tree to
      proposed species trees and Bayesian supertree estimation based on gene trees
      support bryophyte monophyly. Of the 15 distinct rooted relationships for
      embryophytes, we reject all but three hypotheses, which differ only in the
      position of hornworts. Our results imply that the ancestral embryophyte was more 
      complex than has been envisaged based on topologies recognizing liverworts as the
      sister lineage to all other embryophytes. This requires many phenotypic character
      losses and transformations in the liverwort lineage, diminishes inconsistency
      between phylogeny and the fossil record, and prompts re-evaluation of the
      phylogenetic affinity of early land plant fossils, the majority of which are
      considered stem tracheophytes.

AB  - Unsustainable exploitation of natural resources is increasingly affecting the
      highly biodiverse tropics [1, 2]. Although rapid developments in remote sensing
      technology have permitted more precise estimates of land-cover change over large 
      spatial scales [3-5], our knowledge about the effects of these changes on
      wildlife is much more sparse [6, 7]. Here we use field survey data, predictive
      density distribution modeling, and remote sensing to investigate the impact of
      resource use and land-use changes on the density distribution of Bornean
      orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus). Our models indicate that between 1999 and 2015, half
      of the orangutan population was affected by logging, deforestation, or
      industrialized plantations. Although land clearance caused the most dramatic
      rates of decline, it accounted for only a small proportion of the total loss. A
      much larger number of orangutans were lost in selectively logged and primary
      forests, where rates of decline were less precipitous, but where far more
      orangutans are found. This suggests that further drivers, independent of land-use
      change, contribute to orangutan loss. This finding is consistent with studies
      reporting hunting as a major cause in orangutan decline [8-10]. Our predictions
      of orangutan abundance loss across Borneo suggest that the population decreased
      by more than 100,000 individuals, corroborating recent estimates of decline [11].
      Practical solutions to prevent future orangutan decline can only be realized by
      addressing its complex causes in a holistic manner across political and societal 
      sectors, such as in land-use planning, resource exploitation, infrastructure
      development, and education, and by increasing long-term sustainability [12].

AB  - The avian dorsal telencephalon has two vast territories, the nidopallium and the 
      mesopallium, both of which have been shown to contribute substantially to higher 
      cognitive functions. From their connections, these territories have been proposed
      as equivalent to mammalian neocortical layers 2 and 3, various neocortical
      association areas, or the amygdala, but whether these are analogies or homologies
      by descent is unknown. We investigated the molecular profiles of the mesopallium 
      and the nidopallium with RNA-seq. Gene expression experiments established that
      the mesopallium, but not the nidopallium, shares a transcription factor network
      with the intratelencephalic class of neocortical neurons, which are found in
      neocortical layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. Experiments in alligators demonstrated that
      these neurons are also abundant in the crocodilian cortex and form a large
      mesopallium-like structure in the dorsal ventricular ridge. Together with
      previous work, these molecular findings indicate a homology by descent for
      neuronal cell types of the avian dorsal telencephalon with the major excitatory
      cell types of mammalian neocortical circuits: the layer 4 input neurons, the deep
      layer output neurons, and the multi-layer intratelencephalic association neurons.
      These data raise the interesting possibility that avian and primate lineages
      evolved higher cognitive abilities independently through parallel expansions of
      homologous cell populations.

      through Ca(2+) Signaling.

AB  - Cells maintain integrity despite changes in their mechanical properties elicited 
      during growth and environmental stress. How cells sense their physical state and 
      compensate for cell-wall damage is poorly understood, particularly in plants.
      Here we report that FERONIA (FER), a plasma-membrane-localized receptor kinase
      from Arabidopsis, is necessary for the recovery of root growth after exposure to 
      high salinity, a widespread soil stress. The extracellular domain of FER displays
      tandem regions of homology with malectin, an animal protein known to bind
      di-glucose in vitro and important for protein quality control in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum. The presence of malectin-like domains in FER and related receptor
      kinases has led to widespread speculation that they interact with cell-wall
      polysaccharides and can potentially serve a wall-sensing function. Results
      reported here show that salinity causes softening of the cell wall and that FER
      is necessary to sense these defects. When this function is disrupted in the fer
      mutant, root cells explode dramatically during growth recovery. Similar defects
      are observed in the mur1 mutant, which disrupts pectin cross-linking.
      Furthermore, fer cell-wall integrity defects can be rescued by treatment with
      calcium and borate, which also facilitate pectin cross-linking. Sensing of these 
      salinity-induced wall defects might therefore be a direct consequence of physical
      interaction between the extracellular domain of FER and pectin. FER-dependent
      signaling elicits cell-specific calcium transients that maintain cell-wall
      integrity during salt stress. These results reveal a novel extracellular toxicity
      of salinity, and identify FER as a sensor of damage to the pectin-associated
      wall.

AB  - Stimulus characteristics of the mouse's visual field differ above and below the
      skyline. Here, we show for the first time that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the
      output neurons of the retina, gradually change their functional properties along 
      the ventral-dorsal axis to allow better representation of the different stimulus 
      characteristics. We conducted two-photon targeted recordings of
      transient-Offalpha-RGCs and found that they gradually became more sustained along
      the ventral-dorsal axis, revealing >5-fold-longer duration responses in the
      dorsal retina. Using voltage-clamp recordings, pharmacology, and genetic
      manipulation, we demonstrated that the primary rod pathway underlies this
      variance. Our findings challenge the current belief that RGCs of the same subtype
      exhibit the same light responses, regardless of retinal location, and suggest
      that networks underlying RGC responses may change with retinal location to enable
      optimized sampling of the visual image.

AB  - Visual selective attention is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows us to
      process relevant visual stimuli while ignoring irrelevant distracters and has
      been extensively studied in human and non-human primate subjects. Mice have
      emerged as a powerful animal model for studying aspects of the visual system but 
      have not yet been shown to exhibit visual selective attention. Differences in the
      organization of the visual systems of primates and mice raise the possibility
      that selective visual attention might not be present in mice, at least not in the
      forms that are well established in primates. Here, we tested for selective visual
      attention in mice by using three behavioral paradigms adapted from classic
      studies of attention. In a Posner-style cueing task, a spatial cue indicated the 
      probable location of the relevant visual event, and we found that accuracy was
      higher and reaction times were shorter on validly cued trials. In a cue versus
      no-cue task, an informative spatial cue was provided on half the trials, and mice
      had higher accuracy and shorter reaction times with spatial cues and also lower
      detection thresholds measured from psychometric curves. In a filter task, the
      spatial cue indicated the location of the relevant visual event, and we found
      that mice could be trained to ignore irrelevant but otherwise identical visual
      events at uncued locations. Together, these results demonstrate that mice exhibit
      visual selective attention, paving the way to use classic attention paradigms in 
      mice to study the genetic and neuronal circuit mechanisms of selective attention.

AB  - Sensory cortical systems often activate in parallel, even when stimulation is
      experienced through a single sensory modality [1-3]. Co-activations may reflect
      the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely
      parallel but independent sensory processing. We report causal evidence consistent
      with the hypothesis that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with
      auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures [4-9],
      interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. In a 
      series of behavioral experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      to probe interactions between the somatosensory and auditory perceptual systems
      as we manipulated attention state. Acute TMS over S1 impairs auditory frequency
      perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency,
      but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency
      perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex, thus confirming the
      privileged interactions between the somatosensory and auditory systems in
      temporal frequency processing [10-13]. Our results provide a key demonstration
      that selective attention can modulate the functional properties of cortical
      systems thought to support specific sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal 
      coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions 
      and feature-specific perception.

AB  - The maintenance of a healthy and functional mitochondrial network is critical
      during development as well as throughout life in the response to physiological
      adaptations and stress conditions. Owing to their role in energy production,
      mitochondria are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species, making them
      particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial DNA mutations and protein misfolding.
      Given that mitochondria are formed from proteins encoded by both nuclear and
      mitochondrial genomes, an additional layer of complexity is inherent in the
      coordination of protein synthesis and the mitochondrial import of nuclear-encoded
      proteins. For these reasons, mitochondria have evolved multiple systems of
      quality control to ensure that the requisite number of functional mitochondria
      are present to meet the demands of the cell. These pathways work to eliminate
      damaged mitochondrial proteins or parts of the mitochondrial network by mitophagy
      and renew components by adding protein and lipids through biogenesis,
      collectively resulting in mitochondrial turnover. Mitochondrial quality control
      mechanisms are multi-tiered, operating at the protein, organelle and cell levels.
      Herein, we discuss mitophagy in different physiological contexts and then relate 
      it to other quality control pathways, including the unfolded protein response,
      shedding of vesicles, proteolysis, and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
      system. Understanding how these pathways contribute to the maintenance of
      mitochondrial homeostasis could provide insights into the development of targeted
      treatments when these systems fail in disease.

AB  - One fundamental question is to understand what neural circuits are involved when 
      social hierarchies are established, maintained and modified. Now, a new study
      shows that a previously subordinate animal can become dominant after optogenetic 
      stimulation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating that this brain
      region is necessary and sufficient to quickly induce winning during social
      competitions.

AB  - Praying mantises, like humans, calculate distance by triangulating angular
      disparities of corresponding image regions between their eyes. New work shows
      they can do this using just dynamic luminance changes, and thus judge distance in
      scenes that we see as flat.

AB  - The euarthropod body consists of serially repeated segments with various degrees 
      of functional specialization and regionalization [1]. Some representatives
      exhibit deviant metameric patterns expressed as an indirect correspondence
      between components of the exoskeleton, usually the number or position of
      dorsoventral sclerotized plates and walking legs (Supplemental Information)
      [1-3]. Segmental mismatch in the form of supernumerary walking legs per tergite
      (i.e. dorsal exoskeletal plate) is characteristic of fuxianhuiids, Cambrian
      euarthropods widely regarded as critical for understanding the origin of this
      phylum [4,5]. The broader significance of this organization remains obscure,
      however, due to the difficulty of distinguishing which components of the
      fuxianhuiid trunk reflect ancestral or derived traits. Here, we describe for the 
      first time the presence of metameric midgut diverticulae in Fuxianhuia protensa
      from the Chengjiang Konservat-Lagerstatte and demonstrate that these digestive
      structures follow the segmentation pattern of the dorsal exoskeleton. Midgut
      diverticulae signal a predatory or scavenging ecology [6,7], falsifying the view 
      of fuxianhuiids as simple mud-feeders [4]. Comparison with other euarthropods
      [1-3,5] indicates that fuxianhuiids possessed a unique mode of exoskeletal and
      visceral segmental mismatch, in which the tergites and midgut were segmentally
      patterned independently from the walking legs and ventral nerve cord. Our
      findings provide direct evidence of substantial developmental flexibility among
      stem-group euarthropods during the Cambrian.

AB  - Cirrate octopods (Cephalopoda: Cirrata) are among the largest invertebrates of
      the deep sea. These organisms have long been known to lay single, large egg
      capsules on hard substrates on the ocean bottom [1], including cold-water
      octocorals (Anthozoa: Octocorallia). The egg capsule is comprised of an external 
      egg case as well as the chorion and developing embryo. Development in cirrates
      proceeds for an extended time without parental care [2]. Although juveniles have 
      previously been collected in the midwater [3], cirrate hatchlings have so far
      never been observed. Here, we provide the first video of a living hatchling and
      use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze its anatomy and assign the
      specimen to the genus Grimpoteuthis, the so-called dumbo octopods. The specimen's
      behavior and advanced state of organ development show that cirrate hatchlings
      possess all morphological features required for movement via fin-swimming, for
      visually and chemically sensing their environment, and for prey capture. In
      addition, the presence of a large internal yolk sac reduces the risk of failure
      at first feeding. These data provide evidence that dumbo octopods hatch as
      competent juveniles.

AB  - The gut microbiota of animals exert major effects on host biology [1]. Although
      horizontal transfer is generally considered the prevalent route for the
      acquisition of gut bacteria in mammals [2], some bacterial lineages have
      co-speciated with their hosts on timescales of several million years [3].
      Termites harbor a complex gut microbiota, and their advanced social behavior
      provides the potential for long-term vertical symbiont transmission, and
      co-evolution of gut symbionts and host [4-6]. Despite clear evolutionary patterns
      in the gut microbiota of termites [7], a consensus on how microbial communities
      were assembled during termite diversification has yet to be reached. Although
      some studies have concluded that vertical transmission has played a major role
      [8, 9], others indicate that diet and gut microenvironment have been the primary 
      determinants shaping microbial communities in termite guts [7, 10]. To address
      this issue, we examined the gut microbiota of 94 termite species, through 16S
      rRNA metabarcoding. We analyzed the phylogeny of 211 bacterial lineages obtained 
      from termite guts, including their closest relatives from other environments,
      which were identified using BLAST. The results provided strong evidence for
      rampant horizontal transfer of gut bacteria between termite host lineages.
      Although the majority of termite-derived phylotypes formed large monophyletic
      groups, indicating high levels of niche specialization, numerous other clades
      were interspersed with bacterial lineages from the guts of other animals. Our
      results indicate that "mixed-mode" transmission, which combines
      colony-to-offspring vertical transmission with horizontal colony-to-colony
      transfer, has been the primary driving force shaping the gut microbiota of
      termites.

AB  - The length of myelin sheaths affects conduction speed along axons and information
      propagation. It has recently become clear that myelin may be adaptively modified 
      to modulate circuit function, implying that length remodeling of myelin sheaths
      should occur. However, direct evidence for such events is lacking. We have
      investigated how myelination patterns are formed, maintained, and remodeled using
      long-term imaging and myelin ablation in zebrafish. We demonstrate that length
      differences between myelin sheaths are established by rapid and variable growth
      within 3 days after their formation, independently of their time of formation,
      and even along discontinuously myelinated axons. Afterward, sheaths continue
      extending at similar rates to compensate for overall animal growth. In
      consequence, once axon myelination patterns are established, they are maintained 
      over long periods of time. We tested whether mature myelin sheaths can remodel by
      removing individual sheaths from single axons by targeted ablation. Remarkably,
      extensive changes in sheath length and number occurred, which frequently restored
      the original myelination pattern. Our results show that axons can control myelin 
      growth and remodeling, and we provide evidence for a homeostatic control of axon 
      myelination patterns by maintenance and remodeling of myelin sheath length, with 
      implications for circuit development, function, and repair.

AB  - Real-world value often depends on subtle, continuously variable visual cues
      specific to particular object categories, like the tailoring of a suit, the
      condition of an automobile, or the construction of a house. Here, we used
      microelectrode recording in behaving monkeys to test two possible mechanisms for 
      category-specific value-cue processing: (1) previous findings suggest that
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) identifies object categories, and based on category
      identity, PFC could use top-down attentional modulation to enhance visual
      processing of category-specific value cues, providing signals to PFC for
      calculating value, and (2) a faster mechanism would be first-pass visual
      processing of category-specific value cues, immediately providing the necessary
      visual information to PFC. This, however, would require learned mechanisms for
      processing the appropriate cues in a given object category. To test these
      hypotheses, we trained monkeys to discriminate value in four letter-like stimulus
      categories. Each category had a different, continuously variable shape cue that
      signified value (liquid reward amount) as well as other cues that were
      irrelevant. Monkeys chose between stimuli of different reward values. Consistent 
      with the first-pass hypothesis, we found early signals for category-specific
      value cues in area TE (the final stage in monkey ventral visual pathway)
      beginning 81 ms after stimulus onset-essentially at the start of TE responses.
      Task-related activity emerged in lateral PFC approximately 40 ms later and
      consisted mainly of category-invariant value tuning. Our results show that, for
      familiar, behaviorally relevant object categories, high-level ventral pathway
      cortex can implement rapid, first-pass processing of category-specific value
      cues.

AB  - Few studies have "quantitatively" probed how adaptive mutations result in
      increased fitness. Even in simple microbial evolution experiments, with full
      knowledge of the underlying mutations and specific growth conditions, it is
      challenging to determine where within a growth-saturation cycle those fitness
      gains occur. A common implicit assumption is that most benefits derive from an
      increased exponential growth rate. Here, we instead show that, in batch serial
      transfer experiments, adaptive mutants' fitness gains can be dominated by
      benefits that are accrued in one growth cycle, but not realized until the next
      growth cycle. For thousands of evolved clones (most with only a single mutation),
      we systematically varied the lengths of fermentation, respiration, and stationary
      phases to assess how their fitness, as measured by barcode sequencing, depends on
      these phases of the growth-saturation-dilution cycles. These data revealed that, 
      whereas all adaptive lineages gained similar and modest benefits from
      fermentation, most of the benefits for the highest fitness mutants came instead
      from the time spent in respiration. From monoculture and high-resolution pairwise
      fitness competition experiments for a dozen of these clones, we determined that
      the benefits "accrued" during respiration are only largely "realized" later as a 
      shorter duration of lag phase in the following growth cycle. These results reveal
      hidden complexities of the adaptive process even under ostensibly simple
      evolutionary conditions, in which fitness gains can accrue during time spent in a
      growth phase with little cell division, and reveal that the memory of those gains
      can be realized in the subsequent growth cycle.

AB  - Animals rely on olfaction to navigate through complex olfactory landscapes, but
      the mechanisms that allow an animal to encode the spatial structure of an odorous
      environment remain unclear. To acquire information about the spatial distribution
      of an odorant, animals may rely on bilateral olfactory organs and compare side
      differences of odor intensity and timing [1-6] or may perform spatial and
      temporal signal integration of subsequent samplings [7]. The American cockroach
      can efficiently locate a source of sex pheromone even after the removal of one
      antenna, suggesting that bilateral comparison is not a prerequisite for odor
      localization in this species [8, 9]. Cognate olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)
      originating from different locations on the flagellum, but bearing the same
      olfactory receptor, converge onto the same glomerulus within the antennal lobe,
      which is thought to result in a loss of spatial information. Here, we identified 
      12 types of pheromone-responsive projection neurons (PNs), each with spatially
      tuned receptive field. The combination of (1) the antennotopic organization of
      OSNs terminals and (2) the stereotyped compartmentalization of PNs' dendritic
      arborization within the macroglomerulus (MG), allows encoding the spatial
      position of the pheromone. Furthermore, each PN type innervates a different
      compartment of the mushroom body, providing the means for encoding spatial
      olfactory information along the olfactory circuit. Finally, MG PNs exhibit both
      excitatory and inhibitory spatial receptive fields and modulate their responses
      based on changes in stimulus geometry. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism for 
      encoding information on the spatial distribution of a pheromone, expanding both
      our understanding of odor coding and of the strategies insects adopt to localize 
      a sexual mate.

AB  - Stereopsis is the ability to estimate distance based on the different views seen 
      in the two eyes [1-5]. It is an important model perceptual system in neuroscience
      and a major area of machine vision. Mammalian, avian, and almost all machine
      stereo algorithms look for similarities between the luminance-defined images in
      the two eyes, using a series of computations to produce a map showing how depth
      varies across the scene [3, 4, 6-14]. Stereopsis has also evolved in at least one
      invertebrate, the praying mantis [15-17]. Mantis stereopsis is presumed to be
      simpler than vertebrates' [15, 18], but little is currently known about the
      underlying computations. Here, we show that mantis stereopsis uses a
      fundamentally different computational algorithm from vertebrate stereopsis-rather
      than comparing luminance in the two eyes' images directly, mantis stereopsis
      looks for regions of the images where luminance is changing. Thus, while there is
      no evidence that mantis stereopsis works at all with static images, it
      successfully reveals the distance to a moving target even in complex visual
      scenes with targets that are perfectly camouflaged against the background in
      terms of texture. Strikingly, these insects outperform human observers at judging
      stereoscopic distance when the pattern of luminance in the two eyes does not
      match. Insect stereopsis has thus evolved to be computationally efficient while
      being robust to poor image resolution and to discrepancies in the pattern of
      luminance between the two eyes. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Nervous systems display intriguing patterns of sexual dimorphisms across the
      animal kingdom, but the mechanisms that generate such dimorphisms remain poorly
      characterized. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a number of neurons
      present in both sexes are synaptically connected to one another in a sexually
      dimorphic manner as a result of sex-specific synaptic pruning and maintenance
      [1-3]. We define here a mechanism for the male-specific maintenance of the
      synaptic connections of the phasmid sensory neuron PHB and its male-specific
      target, the sex-shared AVG interneuron. We show that the C. elegans Netrin
      ortholog UNC-6, signaling through its cognate receptor UNC-40/DCC and the
      CED-5/DOCK180 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is both required and sufficient
      for male-specific synaptic maintenance. The dimorphism of unc-6 activity is
      brought about by sex-specific regulation of unc-6 transcription. Although unc-6
      is transcribed in the AVG neuron of males and hermaphrodites during juvenile
      stages, unc-6 expression is downregulated in AVG in hermaphrodites during sexual 
      maturation but is maintained during sexual maturation of males. unc-6
      downregulation in hermaphrodites is conferred by the master regulator of
      hermaphrodite sexual identity, the Gli/CI homolog TRA-1, which antagonizes the
      non-sex-specific function of the LIM homeobox gene lin-11, a terminal selector
      and activator of unc-6 in AVG. Preventing the downregulation of unc-6 in AVG of
      hermaphrodites through ectopic expression of unc-6 in transgenic animals results 
      in the maintenance of the PHB>AVG synapses in hermaphrodites. Taken together,
      intersectional transcriptional regulation of unc-6/Netrin is required and
      sufficient to cell autonomously pattern sexually dimorphic synapses.

AB  - Understanding neural representations of behavioral routines is critical for
      understanding complex behavior in health and disease. We demonstrate here that
      accentuated activity of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) at the beginning and
      end of such behavioral repertoires is a supraordinate representation specifically
      marking previously rewarded behavioral sequences independent of the individual
      movements making up the behavior. We recorded spike activity in the striatum and 
      primary motor cortex as individual rats learned specific rewarded lever-press
      sequences, each one unique to a given rat. Motor cortical neurons mainly
      responded in relation to specific movements regardless of their sequence of
      occurrence. By contrast, striatal SPN populations in each rat fired
      preferentially at the initiation and termination of its acquired sequence.
      Critically, the SPNs did not exhibit this bracketing signal when the same rats
      performed unreinforced sequences containing the same sub-movements that were
      present in their acquired sequence. Thus, the SPN activity was specifically
      related to a given repetitively reinforced movement sequence. This striatal
      beginning-and-end activity did not appear to be dependent on motor cortical
      inputs. However, strikingly, simultaneously recorded fast-spiking striatal
      interneurons (FSIs) showed equally selective but inverse firing patterns: they
      fired in between the initiation and termination of the acquired sequences. These 
      findings suggest that the striatum contains networks of neurons representing
      acquired sequences of behavior at a level of abstraction higher than that of the 
      individual movements making up the sequence. We propose that such SPN-FSI
      networks of the striatum could underlie the acquisition of chunked behavioral
      units.

AB  - For humans, there appears to be a clear link between general intelligence and
      self-control behavior, such as sustained delay of gratification [1-9].
      Chimpanzees also delay gratification [10-12] and can be given tests of general
      intelligence (g) [13-15], but these two constructs have never been compared
      within the same sample of nonhuman animals. We presented 40 chimpanzees with the 
      hybrid delay task (HDT) [16, 17], which measures inter-temporal choices and the
      capacity for sustained delay of gratification, and the primate cognitive test
      battery (PCTB), which measures g in chimpanzees [13-15]. Importantly, none of the
      sub-tasks in the PCTB directly assesses self-control or other forms of behavioral
      inhibition. Rather, they assess areas of physical cognition (e.g., quantity
      discrimination) or social cognition (e.g., gaze following). In three phases of
      testing, we consistently found that the strongest relation was between chimpanzee
      g scores and efficiency in the HDT. Chimpanzee g was not most closely related to 
      the proportion of trials the chimpanzees chose to try to wait for delayed
      rewards, but rather most closely related to how good they were at waiting for
      those rewards when they chose to do so. We also found the same strong relation
      between HDT efficiency and those factors in the PCTB that loaded most strongly on
      chimpanzee g. These results highlight that, as with humans, there is a strong
      relation between chimpanzees' self-control and overall intelligence-a relation
      that likely reflects the role of successful inhibitory control during cognitive
      processing of information and intelligent decision-making.

AB  - A central difficulty facing study of the origin of life on Earth is evaluating
      the relevance of different proposed prebiotic scenarios. Perhaps the most
      established feature of the origin of life was the progression through an RNA
      World, a prebiotic stage dominated by functional RNA. We use the appearance of
      proteins in the RNA World to understand the prebiotic milieu and develop a
      criterion to evaluate proposed synthetic scenarios. Current consensus suggests
      that the earliest amino acids of the genetic code were anionic or small
      hydrophobic or polar amino acids. However, the ability to interact with the RNA
      World would have been a crucial feature of early proteins. To determine which
      amino acids would be important for the RNA World, we analyze non-biological
      protein-aptamer complexes in which the RNA or DNA is the result of in vitro
      evolution. This approach avoids confounding effects of biological context and
      evolutionary history. We use bioinformatic analysis and molecular dynamics
      simulations to characterize these complexes. We find that positively charged and 
      aromatic amino acids are over-represented whereas small hydrophobic amino acids
      are under-represented. Binding enthalpy is found to be primarily electrostatic,
      with positively charged amino acids contributing cooperatively to binding
      enthalpy. Arginine dominates all modes of interaction at the interface. These
      results suggest that proposed prebiotic syntheses must be compatible with
      cationic amino acids, particularly arginine or a biophysically similar amino
      acid, in order to be relevant to the invention of protein by the RNA World.

AB  - Cyanobacteria were the ultimate ancestor of all plastids and, for much of Earth's
      history, the only source of biogenic oxygen and a major source of fixed carbon
      and nitrogen. One cyanobacterial clade, subsections IV+V, is characterized by
      multicellularity and cell differentiation, with many members bearing specialized 
      nitrogen-fixing (or diazotrophic) heterocysts and encysting akinetes [1-3].
      Molecular clock estimates of the divergence time of this clade are highly
      variable, ranging from approximately 2,000 Ma (mega-annum) [4-9] to approximately
      500 Ma [10]. The older estimates are invariably calibrated by putative akinete
      fossils from Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic rocks around 2,100-1,400 Ma [3, 11,
      12]. However, the interpretation of these fossils as akinetes has been questioned
      [13], and the next oldest akinete and heterocyst fossils are approximately 410 Ma
      [14]. Thus, the scarcity of reliable heterocystous cyanobacterial fossils
      significantly hampers our understanding of the evolution of complex
      multicellularity among cyanobacteria, their role in regulating geochemical cycles
      in the geological past, and our ability to calibrate cyanobacterial molecular
      clocks. Here, we report Tonian ( approximately 1,000-720 Ma) filamentous
      cyanobacteria that are characterized by large cells, binary fission (for filament
      elongation), hormogonia (for asexual reproduction and dispersal), probable
      akinetes (for survival in adverse conditions), and by implication, diazotrophic
      heterocysts. The new fossils provide a minimum age calibration on the divergence 
      of subsections IV+V and place a firm constraint on the evolution of akinetes and 
      heterocysts.

AB  - Head direction (HD) cells are neurons found in an extended cortical and
      subcortical network that signal the orientation of an animal's head relative to
      its environment [1-3]. They are a fundamental component of the wider circuit of
      spatially responsive hippocampal formation neurons that make up the neural
      cognitive map of space [4]. During post-natal development, HD cells are the first
      among spatially modulated neurons in the hippocampal circuit to exhibit mature
      firing properties [5, 6], but before eye opening, HD cell responses in rat pups
      have low directional information and are directionally unstable [7, 8]. Using
      Bayesian decoding of HD cell ensemble activity recorded in the anterodorsal
      thalamic nucleus (ADN), we characterize this instability and identify its source:
      under-signaling of angular head velocity, which incompletely shifts the
      directional signal in proportion to head turns. We find evidence that geometric
      cues (the corners of a square environment) can be used to mitigate this
      under-signaling and, thereby, stabilize the directional signal even before eye
      opening. Crucially, even when directional firing cannot be stabilized, ensembles 
      of unstable HD cells show short-timescale (1-10 s) temporal and spatial couplings
      consistent with an adult-like HD network. The HD network is widely modeled as a
      continuous attractor whose output is one coherent activity peak, updated during
      movement by angular head velocity signals and anchored by landmark cues [9-11].
      Our findings present strong evidence for this model, and they demonstrate that
      the required network circuitry is in place and functional early during
      development, independent of reference to landmark information.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors that lyse virally infected 
      and tumorigenic cells through the formation of an immunological synapse. Actin
      remodeling at the lytic immunological synapse is a critical requirement for
      multiple facets of cytotoxic function. Activating receptor and integrin signaling
      leads to the regulated turnover and remodeling of actin, which is required for
      adhesion, sustained receptor signaling, and ultimately exocytosis. NK cells
      undergo lytic granule exocytosis in hypodense regions of a pervasive actin
      network. Although these requirements have been well demonstrated, neither the
      dynamic regulation of synaptic actin nor its specific function, however, has been
      determined at a nanoscale level. Here, live-cell super-resolution microscopy
      demonstrates nanoscale filamentous actin dynamism in NK cell lytic granule
      secretion. Following cell spreading, the overall content of the branched actin
      network at an immune synapse is stable over time and contains branched actin
      fibers and discrete actin foci. Similar actin architecture is generated in
      cytolytic T cells, although the timescale differs from that of NK cells.
      Individual filament displacement leads to stochastic clearance formation and
      disappearance, which are independent of lytic granule positioning. Actin dynamism
      is dependent upon branched network formation mediated by Arp2/3 and contractility
      generated by myosin IIA. Importantly, the use of small-molecule inhibitors
      demonstrates that actin dynamism is ultimately needed for granule secretion.
      Thus, we describe a requirement for nanoscale actin fiber rearrangement in
      generating the complex actin architecture that enables lytic granule secretion.

AB  - Hallucinations, a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, 
      are known to depend on excessive striatal dopamine. However, an underlying
      cognitive mechanism linking dopamine dysregulation and the experience of
      hallucinatory percepts remains elusive. Bayesian models explain perception as an 
      optimal combination of prior expectations and new sensory evidence, where
      perceptual distortions such as illusions and hallucinations may occur if prior
      expectations are afforded excessive weight. Such excessive weight of prior
      expectations, in turn, could stem from a gain-control process controlled by
      neuromodulators such as dopamine. To test for such a dopamine-dependent
      gain-control mechanism of hallucinations, we studied unmedicated patients with
      schizophrenia with varying degrees of hallucination severity and healthy
      individuals using molecular imaging with a pharmacological manipulation of
      dopamine, structural imaging, and a novel task designed to measure illusory
      changes in the perceived duration of auditory stimuli under different levels of
      uncertainty. Hallucinations correlated with a perceptual bias, reflecting
      disproportional gain on expectations under uncertainty. This bias could be
      pharmacologically induced by amphetamine, strongly correlated with striatal
      dopamine release, and related to cortical volume of the dorsal anterior
      cingulate, a brain region involved in tracking environmental uncertainty. These
      findings outline a novel dopamine-dependent mechanism for perceptual modulation
      in physiological conditions and further suggest that this mechanism may confer
      vulnerability to hallucinations in hyper-dopaminergic states underlying
      psychosis.

AB  - The lateral habenula has been widely studied for its contribution in generating
      reward-related behaviors [1, 2]. We have found that this nucleus plays an
      unexpected role in the sedative actions of the general anesthetic propofol. The
      lateral habenula is a glutamatergic, excitatory hub that projects to multiple
      targets throughout the brain, including GABAergic and aminergic nuclei that
      control arousal [3-5]. When glutamate release from the lateral habenula in mice
      was genetically blocked, the ability of propofol to induce sedation was greatly
      diminished. In addition to this reduced sensitivity to propofol, blocking output 
      from the lateral habenula caused natural non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to
      become highly fragmented, especially during the rest ("lights on") period. This
      fragmentation was largely reversed by the dual orexinergic antagonist almorexant.
      We conclude that the glutamatergic output from the lateral habenula is permissive
      for the sedative actions of propofol and is also necessary for the consolidation 
      of natural sleep.

AB  - In its natural habitat, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encounters a plethora
      of other organisms, including many that are pathogenic [1, 2]. The study of
      interactions between C. elegans and various pathogens has contributed to
      characterizing key mechanisms of innate immunity [2-4]. However, how C. elegans
      recognizes different pathogens to mount pathogen-specific immune responses
      remains still largely unknown [3, 5-8]. Expanding the range of known C.
      elegans-infecting pathogens and characterizing novel pathogen-specific immune
      responses are key steps toward answering this question. We report here that the
      oomycete Myzocytiopsis humicola is a natural pathogen of C. elegans, and we
      describe its infection strategy. We identify a new host immune response to
      pathogen exposure that involves induction of members of a previously
      uncharacterized gene family encoding chitinase-like (CHIL) proteins. We
      demonstrate that this response is highly specific against M. humicola and
      antagonizes the infection. We propose that CHIL proteins may diminish the ability
      of the oomycete to infect by hindering pathogen attachment to the host cuticle.
      This work expands our knowledge of natural eukaryotic pathogens of C. elegans and
      introduces a new pathosystem to address how animal hosts recognize and respond to
      oomycete infections.

AB  - The prevalence of reciprocal cooperation in non-human animals is hotly debated
      [1, 2]. Part of this dispute rests on the assumption that reciprocity means
      paying like with like [3]. However, exchanges between social partners may involve
      different commodities and services. Hitherto, there is no experimental evidence
      that animals other than primates exchange different commodities among
      conspecifics based on the decision rules of direct reciprocity. Here, we show
      that Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) apply direct reciprocity rules when
      exchanging two different social services: food provisioning and allogrooming.
      Focal rats were made to experience partners either cooperating or non-cooperating
      in one of the two commodities. Afterward, they had the opportunity to reciprocate
      favors by the alternative service. Test rats traded allogrooming against food
      provisioning, and vice versa, thereby acting by the rules of direct reciprocity. 
      This might indicate that reciprocal altruism among non-human animals is much more
      widespread than currently assumed.

AB  - The circadian clock drives daily rhythms of many plant physiological responses,
      providing a competitive advantage that improves plant fitness and survival rates 
      [1-5]. Whereas multiple environmental cues are predicted to regulate the plant
      clock function, most studies focused on understanding the effects of light and
      temperature [5-8]. Increasing evidence indicates a significant role of
      plant-pathogen interactions on clock regulation [9, 10], but the underlying
      mechanisms remain elusive. In Arabidopsis, the clock function largely relies on a
      transcriptional feedback loop between morning (CCA1 and LHY)- and evening
      (TOC1)-expressed transcription factors [6-8]. Here, we focused on these core
      components to investigate the Arabidopsis clock regulation using a unique biotic 
      stress approach. We found that a single-leaf Pseudomonas syringae infection
      systemically lengthened the period and reduced the amplitude of circadian rhythms
      in distal uninfected tissues. Remarkably, the low-amplitude phenotype observed
      upon infection was recapitulated by a transient treatment with the
      defense-related phytohormone salicylic acid (SA), which also triggered a
      significant clock phase delay. Strikingly, despite SA-modulated circadian
      rhythms, we revealed that the master regulator of SA signaling, NPR1 [11, 12],
      antagonized clock responses triggered by both SA treatment and P. syringae. In
      contrast, we uncovered that the NADPH oxidase RBOHD [13] largely mediated the
      aforementioned clock responses after either SA treatment or the bacterial
      infection. Altogether, we demonstrated novel and unexpected roles for SA, NPR1,
      and redox signaling in clock regulation by P. syringae and revealed a previously 
      unrecognized layer of systemic clock regulation by locally perceived
      environmental cues.

AB  - Combining several satellite-based tracking technologies with big data methods and
      machine learning, fisheries experts can now efficiently monitor the entirety of
      the oceans and ensure that legal limits and protected areas are respected.
      Observing our planet from space is also proving a fruitful approach in other
      areas of conservation, ecology and climate research. Michael Gross reports.

AB  - In their 2015 Current Biology paper, Streby et al.[1] reported that Golden-winged
      Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera), which had just migrated to their breeding
      location in eastern Tennessee, performed a facultative and up to ">1,500 km
      roundtrip" to the Gulf of Mexico to avoid a severe tornadic storm. From
      light-level geolocator data, wherein geographical locations are estimated via the
      timing of sunrise and sunset, Streby et al.[1] concluded that the warblers had
      evacuated their breeding area approximately 24 hours before the storm and
      returned about five days later. The authors presented this finding as evidence
      that migratory birds avoid severe storms by temporarily moving long-distances.
      However, the tracking method employed by Streby et al.[1] is prone to
      considerable error and uncertainty. Here, we argue that this interpretation of
      the data oversteps the limits of the used tracking technique. By calculating the 
      expected geographical error range for the tracked birds, we demonstrate that the 
      hypothesized movements fell well within the geolocators' inherent error range for
      this species and that such deviations in latitude occur frequently even if
      individuals remain stationary.

TI  - Multi-level Crowding and the Paradox of Object Recognition in Clutter.

AB  - In everyday life, we are constantly surrounded by complex and cluttered scenes.
      In such cluttered environments, visual perception is primarily limited by
      crowding, the deleterious influence of nearby objects on object recognition. For 
      the past several decades, visual crowding was assumed to occur at a single stage,
      only between low-level features or object parts, thus dismantling, destroying, or
      filtering object information. A large and converging body of evidence has
      demonstrated that this assumption is false: crowding occurs at multiple stages of
      visual analysis, and information passes through crowding at each of these stages.
      This converging empirical evidence points to a seeming paradox: crowding happens 
      at multiple levels, which would seem to impair object recognition, and yet visual
      information at each of those levels is maintained intact and influences
      subsequent higher-level visual processing. Thus, while crowding impairs the
      access we have to visual information at many levels, it does not impair the
      representation of that information. The resolution of this paradox reveals how
      the visual system strikes a balance between the limits of object selection and
      the desire to represent multiple levels of visual information throughout
      cluttered scenes. Understanding crowding is therefore key to resolving the
      relationship between the richness of object and scene representations and the
      limits of conscious object recognition.

AB  - The bright yellow, green and red feathers of parrots depend on unique pigments
      termed 'psittacofulvins'. The discovery of a gene underlying psittacofulvin
      colouration shows that this evolutionary innovation was achieved by co-opting an 
      existing gene into feather development.

AB  - Mixed-acid fermentation generates H2 and CO2 from formate. As shown in a recent
      study, the formate oxidation reaction can be driven backwards when sufficiently
      high partial pressures of the gases are applied, suggesting potentially
      interesting biotechnological applications.

AB  - Lisovski et al.[1] describe the widely recognized limitations of light-level
      geolocator data for identifying short-distance latitudinal movements, recommend
      that caution be used when interpreting such data, intimated that we did not use
      such caution and argued that environmental shading likely explained the
      Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) movements described in our 2015
      report [2]. Lisovski et al.[1] conclude that the bird movements we reported could
      not be disentangled from estimation error in stationary animals caused by
      environmental shading. We argue that, to the contrary, these hypotheses can
      easily be disentangled because the premise that environmental shading caused
      synchronous and parallel error among geolocators is false. With their assertion
      that our location estimates could be biased by >3,500 km on a day with no
      observable local sources of shading, Lisovski et al.[1] have taken a position of 
      incredulity toward all geolocator-based animal movement data published to date.

AB  - Land plants differentiate germ cells in the haploid gametophyte. In flowering
      plants, a generative cell is specified as a precursor that subsequently divides
      into two sperm cells in the developing male gametophyte, pollen. Generative cell 
      specification requires cell-cycle control and microtubule-dependent nuclear
      relocation (reviewed in [1-3]). However, the generative cell fate determinant and
      its evolutionary origin are still unknown. In bryophytes, gametophytes produce
      eggs and sperm in multicellular reproductive organs called archegonia and
      antheridia, respectively, or collectively called gametangia. Given the
      monophyletic origin of land plants [4-6], evolutionarily conserved mechanisms may
      play key roles in these diverse reproductive processes. Here, we showed that a
      single member of the subfamily VIIIa of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
      transcription factors in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha primarily
      accumulated in the initial cells and controlled their development into
      gametangia. We then demonstrated that an Arabidopsis thaliana VIIIa bHLH
      transiently accumulated in the smaller daughter cell after an asymmetric division
      of the meiosis-derived microspore and was required for generative cell
      specification redundantly with its paralog. Furthermore, these A. thaliana VIIIa 
      bHLHs were functionally replaceable by the M. polymorpha VIIIa bHLH. These
      findings suggest the VIIIa bHLH proteins as core regulators for reproductive
      development, including germ cell differentiation, since an early stage of land
      plant evolution.

TI  - Genetic Regulation of the 2D to 3D Growth Transition in the Moss Physcomitrella
      patens.

AB  - One of the most important events in the history of life on earth was the
      colonization of land by plants; this transition coincided with and was most
      likely enabled by the evolution of 3-dimensional (3D) growth. Today, the diverse 
      morphologies exhibited across the terrestrial biosphere arise from the
      differential regulation of 3D growth processes during development. In many
      plants, 3D growth is initiated during the first few divisions of the zygote, and 
      therefore, the genetic basis cannot be dissected because mutants do not survive. 
      However, in mosses, which are representatives of the earliest land plants, 3D
      shoot growth is preceded by a 2D filamentous phase that can be maintained
      indefinitely. Here, we used the moss Physcomitrella patens to identify genetic
      regulators of the 2D to 3D transition. Mutant screens yielded individuals that
      could only grow in 2D, and through an innovative strategy that combined somatic
      hybridization with bulk segregant analysis and genome sequencing, the causative
      mutation was identified in one of them. The NO GAMETOPHORES 1 (NOG1) gene, which 
      encodes a ubiquitin-associated protein, is present only in land plant genomes. In
      mutants that lack PpNOG1 function, transcripts encoding 3D-promoting PpAPB
      transcription factors [1] are significantly reduced, and apical initial cells
      specified for 3D growth are not formed. PpNOG1 acts at the earliest identified
      stage of the 2D to 3D transition, possibly through degradation of proteins that
      suppress 3D growth. The acquisition of NOG1 function in land plants could thus
      have enabled the evolution and development of 3D morphology.

AB  - Stomata are leaf pores that regulate CO2 uptake and evapotranspirational water
      loss. By controlling CO2 uptake, stomata impact on photosynthesis and dry matter 
      accumulation. The regulation of evapotranspiration is equally important because
      it impacts on nutrient accumulation and leaf cooling and enables the plant to
      limit water loss during drought [1]. Our work centers on stomatal closure [2-6]. 
      This involves loss of potassium from the guard cell by a two-step process. Salt
      is released across the plasma membrane via anion channels such as SLAC1 [7-9] and
      depolarization-activated channels such as GORK [10, 11], with the net result that
      cations and anions exit guard cells. However, this critically depends on K(+)
      release from the vacuole; with approximately 160 and 100 mM K(+) in cytoplasm and
      vacuole of open guard cells [12], vacuolar K(+) efflux is driven by the negative 
      tonoplast potential, and this expels K(+) from the vacuole via tonoplast K(+)
      channels like TPK1. In all, guard cell salt release leads to a loss of turgor
      that brings about stomatal closure. First, we show that the TPK1 vacuolar K(+)
      channel is important for abscisic acid (ABA)- and CO2-mediated stomatal closure. 
      Second, we reveal that, during ABA- and CO2-mediated closure, TPK1 is
      phosphorylated and activated by the KIN7 receptor-like protein kinase (RLK),
      which co-expresses in the tonoplast and plasma membrane. The net result is K(+)
      release from the vacuole. Taken together, our work reveals new components
      involved in guard cell signaling and describes a new mechanism potentially
      involved in fine-tuning ABA- and CO2-induced stomatal closure.

AB  - Bacteriocytes are insect cells harboring symbiotic bacteria that are required by 
      their insect host and are transmitted vertically via the female ovary [1]. In
      most insect groups, the bacteria are released from the bacteriocytes and
      transferred to the ovary [2, 3], but in whiteflies, maternal bacteriocytes
      migrate to each egg [4-6], where they have been reported to lyse, releasing the
      symbionts [1]. To investigate bacteriocyte inheritance in whiteflies further, we 
      applied microsatellite genotyping and genomic analysis to a genetically diverse
      population of Bemisia tabaci, and we observed the fate of the bacteriocyte in
      embryos. Surprisingly, the microsatellite profile of the bacteriocytes was
      uniform, and insect cross experiments demonstrated that the bacteriocytes have a 
      stable genotype that differs from the genotype of the insect head (which lacks
      bacteriocytes). Comparative genomic analysis indicates that genomes of the
      bacteriocyte and whitefly head are distinct. Interestingly, the bacterioyte
      genome contains the canonical arthropod telomere repeats TTAGG, and the
      bacteriocytes express telomere maintenance genes that may underlie cellular
      immortality in animal cells [7]. Microscopy observations confirmed that a single 
      bacteriocyte transmitted to each egg is retained and divides once just before egg
      hatch, yielding two bacteriocytes in the neonate insect. These data demonstrate
      the maternal inheritance of an absolutely required somatic insect cell, violating
      the developmental separation of germline and soma [8, 9]. Future investigation on
      the mechanism and phylogenetic distribution of maternally inherited bacteriocytes
      will shed light on the developmental origins and evolutionary diversification of 
      bacteriocytes [10] and the processes underlying cellular immortality [11].

AB  - Perceptual constancy-identifying surfaces and objects across large image
      changes-remains an important challenge for visual neuroscience [1-8]. Liquids are
      particularly challenging because they respond to external forces in complex,
      highly variable ways, presenting an enormous range of images to the visual
      system. To achieve constancy, the brain must perform a causal inference [9-11]
      that disentangles the liquid's viscosity from external factors-like gravity and
      object interactions-that also affect the liquid's behavior. Here, we tested
      whether the visual system estimates viscosity using "midlevel" features [12-14]
      that respond more to viscosity than other factors. Observers reported the
      perceived viscosity of simulated liquids ranging from water to molten glass
      exhibiting diverse behaviors (e.g., pouring, stirring). A separate group of
      observers rated the same animations for 20 midlevel 3D shape and motion features.
      Applying factor analysis to the feature ratings reveals that a weighted
      combination of four underlying factors (distribution, irregularity,
      rectilinearity, and dynamics) predicted perceived viscosity very well across this
      wide range of contexts (R(2) = 0.93). Interestingly, observers unknowingly
      ordered their midlevel judgments according to the one common factor across
      contexts: variation in viscosity. Principal component analysis reveals that
      across the features, the first component lines up almost perfectly with the
      viscosity (R(2) = 0.96). Our findings demonstrate that the visual system achieves
      constancy by representing stimuli in a multidimensional feature space-based on
      complementary, midlevel features-which successfully cluster very different
      stimuli together and tease similar stimuli apart, so that viscosity can be read
      out easily.

AB  - Insects use different parts of their body to cling to mating partners, to catch
      prey, or to defend themselves, in most cases the mouthparts or the legs. However,
      in 400 million years of evolution [1, 2], specialized devices were independently 
      acquired in several groups to adopt these tasks, as for instance modified legs in
      mantids, assassin bugs or stick insects [3-5], or clasping antennae of the
      globular springtails [6]. So far, no known species used the neck region between
      the head and thorax in one of these functional contexts. Here we describe females
      of daggerCaputoraptor elegans, a very unusual, presumably predacious insect
      discovered in approximately 100-million-year-old [7] Burmese amber. Based on
      several morphological features, we conclude that this species lived in the
      foliage of trees or bushes. A unique feature of the new taxon is a scissor-like
      mechanism formed by wing-like extensions on the posterior head and corresponding 
      serrated edges of the dorsal sclerite of the first thoracic segment. Based on the
      specific structure of the apparatus, we conclude that it was probably used by
      females to hold on to males during copulation. A defensive or prey-catching
      function appears less likely. A similar mechanism did not evolve in any other
      known known group of extant or extinct insects.

AB  - The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is the signature signaling domain of
      Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their adaptors, serving as a scaffold for the
      assembly of protein complexes for innate immune signaling [1, 2]. TIR domain
      proteins are also expressed in plants, where they mediate disease resistance [3, 
      4], and in bacteria, where they have been associated with virulence [5-9]. In
      pursuing our work on axon degeneration [10], we made the surprising discovery
      that the TIR domain of SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1), a TLR
      adaptor protein, has enzymatic activity [11]. Upon axon injury, the SARM1 TIR
      domain cleaves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), destroying this
      essential metabolic co-factor to trigger axon destruction [11, 12]. Whereas
      current studies of TIR domains focus on their scaffolding function, our findings 
      with SARM1 inspired us to ask whether this enzymatic activity is the primordial
      function of the TIR domain. Here we show that ancestral prokaryotic TIR domains
      constitute a new family of NADase enzymes. Using purified proteins from a
      cell-free translation system, we find that TIR domain proteins from both bacteria
      and archaea cleave NAD(+) into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose (ADPR), with catalytic
      cleavage executed by a conserved glutamic acid. A subset of bacterial and
      archaeal TIR domains generates a non-canonical variant cyclic ADPR (cADPR)
      molecule, and the full-length TIR domain protein from pathogenic Staphylococcus
      aureus induces NAD(+) loss in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that the
      primordial function of the TIR domain is the enzymatic cleavage of NAD(+) and
      establish TIR domain proteins as a new class of metabolic regulatory enzymes.

AB  - The cell fate decision leading to gametogenesis requires the convergence of
      multiple signals on the promoter of a master regulator. In fission yeast,
      starvation-induced signaling leads to the transcriptional induction of the ste11 
      gene, which encodes the central inducer of mating and gametogenesis, known as
      sporulation. We find that the long intergenic non-coding (linc) RNA rse1 is
      transcribed divergently upstream of the ste11 gene. During vegetative growth,
      rse1 directly recruits a Mug187-Lid2-Set1 complex that mediates cis repression at
      the ste11 promoter through SET3C-dependent histone deacetylation. The absence of 
      rse1 bypasses the starvation-induced signaling and induces gametogenesis in the
      presence of nutrients. Our data reveal that the remodeling of chromatin through
      ncRNA scaffolding of repressive complexes that is observed in higher eukaryotes
      is a conserved, likely very ancient mechanism for tight control of cell
      differentiation.

AB  - The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) is a protein complex
      that is essential for the post-translational import of nuclear-encoded
      mitochondrial proteins. Among its subunits, TOM70 and TOM20 are only transiently 
      associated with the core complex, suggesting their possible additional roles
      within the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Here, by using different mammalian
      cell lines, we demonstrate that TOM70, but not TOM20, clusters in distinct OMM
      foci, frequently overlapping with sites in which the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      contacts mitochondria. Functionally, TOM70 depletion specifically impairs
      inositol trisphosphates (IP3)-linked ER to mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer. This
      phenomenon is dependent on the capacity of TOM70 to interact with IP3-receptors
      and favor their functional recruitment close to mitochondria. Importantly, the
      reduced constitutive Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria, observed in TOM70-depleted 
      cells, dampens mitochondrial respiration, affects cell bioenergetics, induces
      autophagy, and inhibits proliferation. Our data reveal a hitherto unexpected role
      for TOM70 in pro-survival ER-mitochondria communication, reinforcing the view
      that the ER-mitochondria signaling platform is a key regulator of cell fate.

AB  - Humans use music for a variety of social functions: we sing to accompany dance,
      to soothe babies, to heal illness, to communicate love, and so on. Across animal 
      taxa, vocalization forms are shaped by their functions, including in humans.
      Here, we show that vocal music exhibits recurrent, distinct, and cross-culturally
      robust form-function relations that are detectable by listeners across the globe.
      In Experiment 1, internet users (n = 750) in 60 countries listened to brief
      excerpts of songs, rating each song's function on six dimensions (e.g., "used to 
      soothe a baby"). Excerpts were drawn from a geographically stratified
      pseudorandom sample of dance songs, lullabies, healing songs, and love songs
      recorded in 86 mostly small-scale societies, including hunter-gatherers,
      pastoralists, and subsistence farmers. Experiment 1 and its analysis plan were
      pre-registered. Despite participants' unfamiliarity with the societies
      represented, the random sampling of each excerpt, their very short duration (14
      s), and the enormous diversity of this music, the ratings demonstrated accurate
      and cross-culturally reliable inferences about song functions on the basis of
      song forms alone. In Experiment 2, internet users (n = 1,000) in the United
      States and India rated three contextual features (e.g., gender of singer) and
      seven musical features (e.g., melodic complexity) of each excerpt. The songs'
      contextual features were predictive of Experiment 1 function ratings, but musical
      features and the songs' actual functions explained unique variance in function
      ratings. These findings are consistent with the existence of universal links
      between form and function in vocal music.

AB  - Animals have evolved a wide diversity of aggressive behavior often based upon the
      careful monitoring of other individuals. Bacteria are also capable of aggression,
      with many species using toxins to kill or inhibit their competitors. Like
      animals, bacteria also have systems to monitor others during antagonistic
      encounters, but how this translates into behavior remains poorly understood.
      Here, we use colonies of Escherichia coli carrying colicin-encoding plasmids as a
      model for studying antagonistic behavior. We show that in the absence of threat, 
      dispersed cells with low reproductive value produce colicin toxins spontaneously,
      generating efficient pre-emptive attacks. Cells can also respond conditionally to
      toxins released by clonemates via autoinduction or other genotypes via
      competition sensing. The strength of both pre-emptive and responsive attacks
      varies widely between strains. We demonstrate that this variability occurs easily
      through mutation by rationally engineering strains to recapitulate the diversity 
      in naturally occurring strategies. Finally, we discover that strains that can
      detect both competitors and clonemates are capable of massive coordinated attacks
      on competing colonies. This collective behavior protects established colonies
      from competitors, mirroring the evolution of alarm calling in the animal world.

AB  - How mosquitoes determine which individuals to bite has important epidemiological 
      consequences. This choice is not random; most mosquitoes specialize in one or a
      few vertebrate host species, and some individuals in a host population are
      preferred over others. Mosquitoes will also blood feed from other hosts when
      their preferred is no longer abundant, but the mechanisms mediating these shifts 
      between hosts, and preferences for certain individuals within a host species,
      remain unclear. Here, we show that olfactory learning may contribute to Aedes
      aegypti mosquito biting preferences and host shifts. Training and testing to
      scents of humans and other host species showed that mosquitoes can aversively
      learn the scent of specific humans and single odorants and learn to avoid the
      scent of rats (but not chickens). Using pharmacological interventions, RNAi, and 
      CRISPR gene editing, we found that modification of the dopamine-1 receptor
      suppressed their learning abilities. We further show through combined
      electrophysiological and behavioral recordings from tethered flying mosquitoes
      that these odors evoke changes in both behavior and antennal lobe (AL) neuronal
      responses and that dopamine strongly modulates odor-evoked responses in AL
      neurons. Not only do these results provide direct experimental evidence that
      olfactory learning in mosquitoes can play an epidemiological role, but
      collectively, they also provide neuroanatomical and functional demonstration of
      the role of dopamine in mediating this learning-induced plasticity, for the first
      time in a disease vector insect.

AB  - Due to their periodic nature, neural oscillations might represent an optimal
      "tool" for the processing of rhythmic stimulus input [1-3]. Indeed, the alignment
      of neural oscillations to a rhythmic stimulus, often termed phase entrainment,
      has been repeatedly demonstrated [4-7]. Phase entrainment is central to current
      theories of speech processing [8-10] and has been associated with successful
      speech comprehension [11-17]. However, typical manipulations that reduce speech
      intelligibility (e.g., addition of noise and time reversal [11, 12, 14, 16, 17]) 
      could destroy critical acoustic cues for entrainment (such as "acoustic edges"
      [7]). Hence, the association between phase entrainment and speech intelligibility
      might only be "epiphenomenal"; i.e., both decline due to the same manipulation,
      without any causal link between the two [18]. Here, we use transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS [19]) to manipulate the phase lag between
      neural oscillations and speech rhythm while measuring neural responses to
      intelligible and unintelligible vocoded stimuli with sparse fMRI. We found that
      this manipulation significantly modulates the BOLD response to intelligible
      speech in the superior temporal gyrus, and the strength of BOLD modulation is
      correlated with a phasic modulation of performance in a behavioral task.
      Importantly, these findings are absent for unintelligible speech and during sham 
      stimulation; we thus demonstrate that phase entrainment has a specific, causal
      influence on neural responses to intelligible speech. Our results not only
      provide an important step toward understanding the neural foundation of human
      abilities at speech comprehension but also suggest new methods for enhancing
      speech perception that can be explored in the future.

AB  - For cell division, negatively charged chromatin, in which nucleosome fibers (10
      nm fibers) are irregularly folded [1-5], must be condensed into chromosomes and
      segregated. While condensin and other proteins are critical for organizing
      chromatin into the appropriate chromosome shape [6-17], free divalent cations
      such as Mg(2+) and Ca(2+), which condense chromatin or chromosomes in vitro
      [18-28], have long been considered important, especially for local condensation, 
      because the nucleosome fiber has a net negative charge and is by itself stretched
      like "beads on a string" by electrostatic repulsion. For further folding, other
      positively charged factors are required to decrease the charge and repulsion
      [29]. However, technical limitations to measure intracellular free divalent
      cations, but not total cations [30], especially Mg(2+), have prevented us from
      elucidating their function. Here, we developed a Forster resonance energy
      transfer (FRET)-based Mg(2+) indicator that monitors free Mg(2+) dynamics
      throughout the cell cycle. By combining this indicator with Ca(2+) [31] and
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [32] indicators, we demonstrate that the levels of
      free Mg(2+), but not Ca(2+), increase during mitosis. The Mg(2+) increase is
      coupled with a decrease in ATP, which is normally bound to Mg(2+) in the cell
      [33]. ATP inhibited Mg(2+)-dependent chromatin condensation in vitro. Chelating
      Mg(2+) induced mitotic cell arrest and chromosome decondensation, while ATP
      reduction had the opposite effect. Our results suggest that ATP-bound Mg(2+) is
      released by ATP hydrolysis and contributes to mitotic chromosome condensation
      with increased rigidity, suggesting a novel regulatory mechanism for higher-order
      chromatin organization by the intracellular Mg(2+)-ATP balance.

AB  - Avoiding distraction by conspicuous but irrelevant stimuli is critical to
      accomplishing daily tasks. Regions of prefrontal cortex control attention by
      enhancing the representation of task-relevant information in sensory cortex,
      which can be measured in modulation of both single neurons and event-related
      electrical potentials (ERPs) on the cranial surface [1, 2]. When irrelevant
      information is particularly conspicuous, it can distract attention and interfere 
      with the selection of behaviorally relevant information. Such distraction can be 
      minimized via top-down control [3-5], but the cognitive and neural mechanisms
      giving rise to this control over distraction remain uncertain and debated [6-9]. 
      Bridging neurophysiology to electrophysiology, we simultaneously recorded neurons
      in prefrontal cortex and ERPs over extrastriate visual cortex to track the
      processing of salient distractors during a visual search task. Critically, when
      the salient distractor was successfully ignored, but not otherwise, we observed
      robust suppression of salient distractor representations. Like target selection, 
      the distractor suppression was observed in prefrontal cortex before it appeared
      over extrastriate cortical areas. Furthermore, all prefrontal neurons that showed
      suppression of the task-irrelevant distractor also contributed to selecting the
      target. This suggests a common prefrontal mechanism is responsible for both
      selecting task-relevant and suppressing task-irrelevant information in sensory
      cortex. Taken together, our results resolve a long-standing debate over the
      mechanisms that prevent distraction, and provide the first evidence directly
      linking suppressed neural firing in prefrontal cortex with surface ERP measures
      of distractor suppression.

AB  - People struggle to name odors [1-4]. This has been attributed to a diminution of 
      olfaction in trade-off to vision [5-10]. This presumption has been challenged
      recently by data from the hunter-gatherer Jahai who, unlike English speakers,
      find odors as easy to name as colors [4]. Is the superior olfactory performance
      among the Jahai because of their ecology (tropical rainforest), their language
      family (Aslian), or because of their subsistence (they are hunter-gatherers)? We 
      provide novel evidence from the hunter-gatherer Semaq Beri and the
      non-hunter-gatherer (swidden-horticulturalist) Semelai that subsistence is the
      critical factor. Semaq Beri and Semelai speakers-who speak closely related
      languages and live in the tropical rainforest of the Malay Peninsula-took part in
      a controlled odor- and color-naming experiment. The swidden-horticulturalist
      Semelai found odors much more difficult to name than colors, replicating the
      typical Western finding. But for the hunter-gatherer Semaq Beri odor naming was
      as easy as color naming, suggesting that hunter-gatherer olfactory cognition is
      special.

AB  - During wakefulness, pupil diameter can reflect changes in attention, vigilance,
      and cortical states. How pupil size relates to cortical activity during sleep,
      however, remains unknown. Pupillometry during natural sleep is inherently
      challenging since the eyelids are usually closed. Here, we present a novel
      head-fixed sleep paradigm in combination with infrared back-illumination
      pupillometry (iBip) allowing robust tracking of pupil diameter in sleeping mice. 
      We found that pupil size can be used as a reliable indicator of sleep states and 
      that cortical activity becomes tightly coupled to pupil size fluctuations during 
      non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Pharmacological blocking experiments
      indicate that the observed pupil size changes during sleep are mediated via the
      parasympathetic system. We furthermore found that constrictions of the pupil
      during NREM episodes might play a protective role for stability of sleep depth.
      These findings reveal a fundamental relationship between cortical activity and
      pupil size, which has so far been hidden behind closed eyelids.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) displays an exceptional degree of structural genomic
      diversity [1, 2]. In addition, variation in gene expression further contributes
      to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity and plasticity of maize. This study
      provides a systematic investigation on how distantly related homozygous maize
      inbred lines affect the transcriptomic plasticity of their highly heterozygous F1
      hybrids. The classical dominance model of heterosis explains the superiority of
      hybrid plants by the complementation of deleterious parental alleles by superior 
      alleles of the second parent at many loci [3]. Genes active in one inbred line
      but inactive in another represent an extreme instance of allelic diversity
      defined as single-parent expression [4]. We observed on average approximately
      1,000 such genes in all inbred line combinations during primary root development.
      These genes consistently displayed expression complementation (i.e., activity) in
      their hybrid progeny. Consequently, extreme expression complementation is a
      general mechanism that results on average in approximately 600 additionally
      active genes and their encoded biological functions in hybrids. The modern maize 
      genome is complemented by a set of non-syntenic genes, which emerged after the
      separation of the maize and sorghum lineages and lack syntenic orthologs in any
      other grass species [5]. We demonstrated that non-syntenic genes are the driving 
      force of gene expression complementation in hybrids. Among those, the highly
      diversified families of bZIP and bHLH transcription factors [6] are
      systematically overrepresented. In summary, extreme gene expression
      complementation extensively shapes the transcriptomic plasticity of maize hybrids
      and might therefore be one factor controlling the developmental plasticity of
      hybrids.

AB  - The hippocampal theta rhythm is critical for learning and memory. New research
      demonstrates that theta oscillations in freely moving humans are similar in
      frequency and function to those observed in rodents and are modulated by movement
      speed and exploratory behavior.

AB  - Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are threatened primarily by habitat loss and
      human-elephant conflict. In addition to establishing protected areas and
      corridors for wildlife, empowering farmers to protect their crops is crucial for 
      Asian elephant conservation [1,2]. Elephants can habituate to artificial
      deterrents, hence natural biological alternatives are of great interest [2,3].
      African elephants (Loxodonta africana) avoid African honey bees (Apis mellifera
      scutellata), inspiring 'beehive fences' as a successful means of small-scale crop
      protection [4,5]. Here, we used a recording of a disturbed hive of
      cavity-dwelling Asian honey bees (Apis cerana indica) and conducted sound
      playbacks to 120 wild elephants in 28 different groups resting under trees in Uda
      Walawe National Park in Sri Lanka. Elephants responded by moving significantly
      further away from their resting site in bee playback trials compared to controls.
      Elephants also increased vocalization rates, as well as investigative and
      reassurance behaviours in response to bee sounds, but did not display dusting or 
      headshaking behaviour.

AB  - Life in caves means life in perpetual darkness. This has two dramatic effects on 
      animals: it eliminates the need to see and reduces the availability of food as
      there is no local photosynthesis. Food availability for cave dwellers is often
      seasonal, episodic or unscheduled. Like other cave animals, fish species adapted 
      for cave life exhibit a suite of sensory, morphological, physiological and
      behavioral traits that are shared among species from phylogenetically distant
      families. Most cave fishes are entirely or partially blind. The most extreme of
      them, the obligatory cave-dwelling fish that spend their entire life in caves,
      are the subject of this primer. At present, over 200 such cavefish species have
      been described, and all of them have evolved independently from surface
      ancestors. Thus, each cavefish species is a replicate of the same natural
      experiment, testing the evolutionary response of a sighted surface fish to the
      absence of light and the limitations on food in a subterranean environment. The
      evolutionary responses converge on loss of eyes and pigmentation and the
      augmentation of other senses, such as taste, smell or mechanosensation, as well
      as a more efficient metabolism, changes in feeding behavior, altered activity
      levels, loss of circadian rhythmicity and increased wakefulness. However, not all
      of these troglomorphic traits are present in every cavefish species.

AB  - Annelida is one of the most speciose ( approximately 17,000 species) and
      ecologically successful phyla. Key to this success is their flexible body plan
      with metameric trunk segments and bipartite heads consisting of a prostomium
      bearing sensory structures and a peristomium containing the mouth. The
      flexibility of this body plan has traditionally proven problematic for
      reconstructing the evolutionary relationships within the Annelida. Although
      recent phylogenies have focused on resolving the interrelationships of the crown 
      group [1-3], many questions remain regarding the early evolution of the annelid
      body plan itself, including the origin of the head [4]. Here we describe an
      abundant and exceptionally well-preserved polychaete with traces of putative
      neural and vascular tissues for the first time in a fossilized annelid. Up to
      three centimeters in length, Kootenayscolex barbarensis gen. et sp. nov. is
      described based on more than 500 specimens from Marble Canyon [5] and several
      specimens from the original Burgess Shale site (both in British Columbia,
      Canada). K. barbarensis possesses biramous parapodia along the trunk, bearing
      similar elongate and thin notochaetae and neurochaetae. A pair of large palps and
      one median antenna project from the anteriormost dorsal margin of the prostomium.
      The mouth-bearing peristomium bears neuropodial chaetae, a condition that is also
      inferred in Canadia and Burgessochaeta from the Burgess Shale, suggesting a
      chaetigorous origin for the peristomial portion of the head and a secondary loss 
      of peristomial parapodia and chaetae in modern polychaetes.

AB  - Animals react rapidly to external stimuli, such as an approaching predator, but
      in other circumstances, they seem to act spontaneously, without any obvious
      external trigger. How do the neural processes mediating the execution of
      reflexive and spontaneous actions differ? We studied this question in tethered,
      flying Drosophila. We found that silencing a large but genetically defined set of
      non-motor neurons virtually eliminates spontaneous flight turns while preserving 
      the tethered flies' ability to perform two types of visually evoked turns,
      demonstrating that, at least in flies, these two modes of action are almost
      completely dissociable.

TI  - SMC1alpha Substitutes for Many Meiotic Functions of SMC1beta but Cannot Protect
      Telomeres from Damage.

AB  - The cohesin complex is built upon the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, and mammalian
      meiocytes feature two variants of SMC1 named SMC1alpha and SMC1beta. It is
      unclear why these two SMC1 variants have evolved. To determine unique versus
      redundant functions of SMC1beta, we asked which of the known functions of
      SMC1beta can be fulfilled by SMC1alpha. Smc1alpha was expressed under control of 
      the Smc1beta promoter in either wild-type or SMC1beta-deficient mice. No effect
      was seen in the former. However, several major phenotypes of SMC1beta-deficient
      spermatocytes were rescued by SMC1alpha. We observed extended development before 
      apoptosis and restoration of axial element and synaptonemal complex lengths,
      chromosome synapsis, sex body formation, processing of DNA double-strand breaks, 
      and formation of MLH1 recombination foci. This supports the concept that the
      quantity rather than the specific quality of cohesin complexes is decisive for
      meiotic chromosome architecture. It also suggests plasticity in complex
      composition, because to replace SMC1beta in many functions, SMC1alpha has to more
      extensively associate with other cohesins. The cells did not complete meiosis but
      died to the latest at the pachytene-to-diplotene transition. Telomere aberrations
      known from Smc1beta(-/-) mice persisted, and DNA damage response and repair
      proteins accumulated there regardless of expression of SMC1alpha. Thus, whereas
      SMC1alpha can substitute for SMC1beta in many functions, the protection of
      telomere integrity requires SMC1beta.

AB  - Anthropogenically released CO2 accumulates in the global carbon cycle and is
      anticipated to imbalance global carbon fluxes [1]. For example, increased
      atmospheric CO2 induces a net air-to-sea flux where the oceans take up large
      amounts of atmospheric CO2 (i.e., ocean acidification [2-5]). Research on ocean
      acidification is ongoing, and studies have demonstrated the consequences for
      ecosystems and organismal biology with major impacts on marine food webs,
      nutrient cycles, overall productivity, and biodiversity [6-9]. Yet, surprisingly 
      little is known about the impact of anthropogenically caused CO2 on freshwater
      systems due to their more complex biogeochemistry. The current consensus, yet
      lacking data evidence, is that anthropogenic CO2 does indeed affect freshwater
      carbon hydrogeochemistry, causing increased pCO2 in freshwater bodies [10-13]. We
      analyzed long-term data from four freshwater reservoirs and observed a continuous
      pCO2 increase associated with a decrease in pH, indicating that not only the
      oceans but also inland waters are accumulating CO2. We tested the effect of
      pCO2-dependent freshwater acidification using the cosmopolite crustacean Daphnia.
      For general validity, control pCO2-levels were based on the present global pCO2
      average. Treatments were selected with very high pCO2 levels, assuming a
      continuous non-linear increase of pCO2, reflecting worst-case-scenario future
      pCO2 levels. Such levels of elevated pCO2 reduced the ability of Daphnia to sense
      its predators and form adequate inducible defenses. We furthermore determined
      that pCO2 and not the resulting reduction in pH impairs predator perception. If
      pCO2 alters chemical communication between freshwater species, this perturbs
      intra- and interspecific information transfer, which may affect all trophic
      levels.

      Photoperiod-Responsive Growth in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Plants coordinate their growth and development with the environment through
      integration of circadian clock and photosensory pathways. In Arabidopsis
      thaliana, rhythmic hypocotyl elongation in short days (SD) is enhanced at dawn by
      the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING
      FACTORS (PIFs) directly inducing expression of growth-related genes [1-6]. PIFs
      accumulate progressively during the night and are targeted for degradation by
      active phytochromes in the light, when growth is reduced. Although PIF proteins
      are also detected during the day hours [7-10], their growth-promoting activity is
      inhibited through unknown mechanisms. Recently, the core clock components and
      transcriptional repressors PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS PRR9/7/5 [11, 12], negative
      regulators of hypocotyl elongation [13, 14], were described to associate to G
      boxes [15], the DNA motifs recognized by the PIFs [16, 17], suggesting that PRR
      and PIF function might converge antagonistically to regulate growth. Here we
      report that PRR9/7/5 and PIFs physically interact and bind to the same promoter
      region of pre-dawn-phased, growth-related genes, and we identify the
      transcription factor CDF5 [18, 19] as target of this interplay. In SD, CDF5
      expression is sequentially repressed from morning to dusk by PRRs and induced
      pre-dawn by PIFs. Consequently, CDF5 accumulates specifically at dawn, when it
      induces cell elongation. Our findings provide a framework for recent TIMING OF
      CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1/PRR1) data [5, 20] and reveal that the long described
      circadian morning-to-midnight waves of the PRR transcriptional repressors (PRR9, 
      PRR7, PRR5, and TOC1) [21] jointly gate PIF activity to dawn to prevent
      overgrowth through sequential regulation of common PIF-PRR target genes such as
      CDF5.

AB  - Many cooperative species form internally diverse social groups in which
      individual fitness depends significantly on group-level productivity from
      cooperation [1-4]. For such species, selection is expected to often disfavor
      within-group diversity that reduces cooperative productivity [5, 6]. While
      diversity within social groups is known to enhance productivity in some animals
      [7-9], diversity within natural groups of social microbes is largely unexamined
      in this regard. Cells of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus respond to
      starvation by constructing multicellular fruiting bodies within each of which a
      subpopulation of cells transforms into stress-resistant spores [10]. Fruiting
      bodies isolated from soil often harbor substantial endemic diversity [11] that
      is, nonetheless, lower than between-group diversity, which increases with
      distance from millimeter to global scales [12-14]. We show that M. xanthus clones
      isolated from the same fruiting body often collectively produce more viable
      spores in chimeric groups than expected from sporulation in genetically
      homogeneous groups. In contrast, chimerism among clones derived from different
      fruiting bodies tends to reduce group productivity, and it does so increasingly
      as a function of spatial distance between fruiting-body sample sites. For one
      fruiting body examined in detail, chimeric synergy-a positive quantitative effect
      of chimerism on group productivity-is distributed broadly across an interaction
      network rather than limited to a few interactions. We propose that these results 
      strengthen the plausibility of the hypothesis that selection may operate not only
      within Myxococcus groups, but also between kin groups to disfavor within-group
      variation that reduces productivity while allowing some forms of diversity that
      generate chimeric synergy to persist.

AB  - Microtubule and actin filament molecular motors such as kinesin-1 and myosin-Ic
      (Myo1c) transport and remodel membrane-bound vesicles; however, it is unclear how
      they coordinate to accomplish these tasks. We introduced kinesin-1- and
      Myo1c-bound giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) into a micropatterned in vitro
      cytoskeletal matrix modeled after the subcellular architecture where vesicular
      sorting and membrane remodeling are observed. This array was composed of sparse
      microtubules intersecting regions dense with actin filaments, and revealed that
      Myo1c-dependent tethering of GUVs enabled kinesin-1-driven membrane deformation
      and tubulation. Membrane remodeling at actin/microtubule intersections was
      modulated by lipid composition and the addition of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs-domain
      (BAR-domain) proteins endophilin or FCH-domain-only (FCHo). Myo1c not only
      tethered microtubule-transported cargo, but also transported, deformed, and
      tubulated GUVs along actin filaments in a lipid-composition- and
      BAR-protein-responsive manner. These results suggest a mechanism for actin-based 
      involvement in vesicular transport and remodeling of intracellular membranes, and
      implicate lipid composition as a key factor in determining whether vesicles will 
      undergo transport, deformation, or tubulation driven by opposing actin and
      microtubule motors and BAR-domain proteins.

AB  - Thermomorphogenesis is defined as the suite of morphological changes that
      together are likely to contribute to adaptive growth acclimation to usually
      elevated ambient temperature [1, 2]. While many details of warmth-induced signal 
      transduction are still elusive, parallels to light signaling recently became
      obvious (reviewed in [3]). It involves photoreceptors that can also sense changes
      in ambient temperature [3-5] and act, for example, by repressing protein activity
      of the central integrator of temperature information PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING
      FACTOR 4 (PIF4 [6]). In addition, PIF4 transcript accumulation is tightly
      controlled by the evening complex member EARLY FLOWERING 3 [7, 8]. According to
      the current understanding, PIF4 activates growth-promoting genes directly but
      also via inducing auxin biosynthesis and signaling, resulting in cell elongation.
      Based on a mutagenesis screen in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants
      with defects in temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation, we show here that both 
      PIF4 and auxin function depend on brassinosteroids. Genetic and pharmacological
      analyses place brassinosteroids downstream of PIF4 and auxin. We found that
      brassinosteroids act via the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1
      (BZR1), which accumulates in the nucleus at high temperature, where it induces
      expression of growth-promoting genes. Furthermore, we show that at elevated
      temperature BZR1 binds to the promoter of PIF4, inducing its expression. These
      findings suggest that BZR1 functions in an amplifying feedforward loop involved
      in PIF4 activation. Although numerous negative regulators of PIF4 have been
      described, we identify BZR1 here as a true temperature-dependent positive
      regulator of PIF4, acting as a major growth coordinator.

AB  - Compass orientation is central to the control of animal movement from the scale
      of local food-caching movements around a familiar area in parids [1] and corvids 
      [2, 3] to the first autumn vector navigation of songbirds embarking on
      long-distance migration [4-6]. In the study of diurnal birds, where the homing
      pigeon, Columba livia, has been the main model, a time-compensated sun compass
      [7] is central to the two-step map-and-compass process of navigation from
      unfamiliar places, as well as guiding movement via a representation of familiar
      area landmarks [8-12]. However, its use by an actively navigating wild bird is
      yet to be shown. By phase shifting an animal's endogenous clock, known as
      clock-shifting [13-15], sun-compass use can be demonstrated when the animal
      incorrectly consults the sun's azimuthal position while homing after experimental
      displacement [15-17]. By applying clock-shift techniques at the nest of a wild
      bird during natural incubation, we show here that an oceanic navigator-the Manx
      shearwater, Puffinus puffinus-incorporates information from a time-compensated
      sun compass during homeward guidance to the breeding colony after displacement.
      Consistently with homing pigeons navigating within their familiar area [8, 9, 11,
      18], we find that the effect of clock shift, while statistically robust, is
      partial in nature, possibly indicating the incorporation of guidance from
      landmarks into movement decisions.

      Resistance in the Brown Planthopper.

AB  - Gene duplication is a major source of genetic variation that has been shown to
      underpin the evolution of a wide range of adaptive traits [1, 2]. For example,
      duplication or amplification of genes encoding detoxification enzymes has been
      shown to play an important role in the evolution of insecticide resistance [3-5].
      In this context, gene duplication performs an adaptive function as a result of
      its effects on gene dosage and not as a source of functional novelty [3, 6-8].
      Here, we show that duplication and neofunctionalization of a cytochrome P450,
      CYP6ER1, led to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the brown planthopper.
      Considerable genetic variation was observed in the coding sequence of CYP6ER1 in 
      populations of brown planthopper collected from across Asia, but just two
      sequence variants are highly overexpressed in resistant strains and metabolize
      imidacloprid. Both variants are characterized by profound amino-acid alterations 
      in substrate recognition sites, and the introduction of these mutations into a
      susceptible P450 sequence is sufficient to confer resistance. CYP6ER1 is
      duplicated in resistant strains with individuals carrying paralogs with and
      without the gain-of-function mutations. Despite numerical parity in the genome,
      the susceptible and mutant copies exhibit marked asymmetry in their expression
      with the resistant paralogs overexpressed. In the primary resistance-conferring
      CYP6ER1 variant, this results from an extended region of novel sequence upstream 
      of the gene that provides enhanced expression. Our findings illustrate the
      versatility of gene duplication in providing opportunities for functional and
      regulatory innovation during the evolution of an adaptive trait.

AB  - Neural oscillations are ubiquitously observed in cortical activity, and are
      widely believed to be crucial for mediating transmission of information across
      the cortex. Yet, the neural phenomena contributing to each oscillation band, and 
      their effect on information coding and transmission, are largely unknown. Here,
      we investigated whether individual frequency bands specifically reflect changes
      in the concentrations of dopamine, an important neuromodulator, and how dopamine 
      affects oscillatory information processing. We recorded the local field potential
      (LFP) at different depths of primary visual cortex (V1) in anesthetized monkeys
      (Macaca mulatta) during spontaneous activity and during visual stimulation with
      Hollywood movie clips while pharmacologically mimicking dopaminergic
      neuromodulation by systemic injection of L-DOPA (a metabolic precursor of
      dopamine). We found that dopaminergic neuromodulation had marked effects on both 
      spontaneous and movie-evoked neural activity. During spontaneous activity,
      dopaminergic neuromodulation increased the power of the LFP specifically in the
      [19-38 Hz] band, suggesting that the power of endogenous visual cortex
      oscillations in this band can be used as a robust marker of dopaminergic
      neuromodulation. Moreover, dopamine increased visual information encoding over
      all frequencies during movie stimulation. The information increase due to
      dopamine was prominent in the supragranular layers of cortex that project to
      higher cortical areas and in the gamma [50-100 Hz] band that has been previously 
      implicated in mediating feedforward information transfer. These results thus
      individuate new neural mechanisms by which dopamine may promote the readout of
      relevant sensory information by strengthening the transmission of information
      from primary to higher areas.

AB  - An important concept in ethology is that complex behaviors can be constructed
      from a set of basic motor patterns. Identifying the set of patterns available to 
      an animal is key to making quantitative descriptions of behavior that reflect the
      underlying motor system organization. We addressed these questions in zebrafish
      larvae, which swim in bouts that are naturally segmented in time. We developed a 
      robust and general purpose clustering method (clusterdv) to ensure accurate
      identification of movement clusters and applied it to a dataset consisting of
      millions of swim bouts, captured at high temporal resolution from a comprehensive
      set of behavioral contexts. We identified a set of thirteen basic swimming
      patterns that are used flexibly in various combinations across different
      behavioral contexts and show that this classification can be used to dissect the 
      sensorimotor transformations underlying larval social behavior and hunting.
      Furthermore, using the same approach at different levels in the behavioral
      hierarchy, we show that the set of swim bouts are themselves constructed from a
      basic set of tail movements and that bouts are executed in sequences specific to 
      different behaviors.

AB  - Mouse oocyte maturation, fertilization, and reprogramming occur in the absence of
      transcription, and thus, changes in mRNA levels and translation rate are
      regulated through post-transcriptional mechanisms [1]. Surprisingly, microRNA
      function, which is a major form of post-transcriptional regulation, is absent
      during this critical period of mammalian development [2, 3]. Here, we
      investigated the mechanisms underlying the global suppression of microRNA
      activity. In both mouse and frogs, microRNA function was active in growing
      oocytes but then absent during oocyte maturation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of
      mouse oocytes uncovered that the microRNA effector protein AGO2 is predominantly 
      expressed as an alternative isoform that encodes a truncated protein lacking all 
      of the known essential domains. Full-length Ago2 as well as the related
      Argonautes (Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4) were lowly expressed in maturing mouse oocytes.
      Reintroduction of full-length AGO2 together with an exogenous microRNA in either 
      mouse or frog oocytes restored translational repression of a target reporter.
      However, levels of endogenous transcripts remained unchanged. Consistent with a
      lack of microRNA activity, analysis of transcripts with alternative
      polyadenylation sites showed increased stability of transcripts with a longer 3' 
      UTR during oocyte maturation. Redundant mechanisms protecting endogenous
      transcripts and the conserved loss of microRNA activity suggest a strong
      selection for suppressing microRNA function in vertebrate oocytes.

AB  - Humans closely monitor others' cooperative relationships [1, 2]. Children and
      adults willingly incur costs to reward helpers and punish non-helpers-even as
      bystanders [3-5]. Already by 3 months, infants favor individuals that they
      observe helping others [6-8]. This early-emerging prosocial preference may be a
      derived motivation that accounts for many human forms of cooperation that occur
      beyond dyadic interactions and are not exhibited by other animals [9, 10]. As the
      most socially tolerant nonhuman ape [11-17] (but see [18]), bonobos (Pan
      paniscus) provide a powerful phylogenetic test of whether this trait is derived
      in humans. Bonobos are more tolerant than chimpanzees, can flexibly obtain food
      through cooperation, and voluntarily share food in captivity and the wild, even
      with strangers [11-17] (but see [18]). Their neural architecture exhibits a suite
      of characteristics associated with greater sensitivity to others [19, 20], and
      their sociality is hypothesized to have evolved due to selection against male
      aggression [21-23]. Here we show in four experiments that bonobos discriminated
      agents based on third-party interactions. However, they did not exhibit the human
      preference for helpers. Instead, they reliably favored a hinderer that obstructed
      another agent's goal (experiments 1-3). In a final study (experiment 4), bonobos 
      also chose a dominant individual over a subordinate. Bonobos' interest in
      hinderers may reflect attraction to dominant individuals [24]. A preference for
      helpers over hinderers may therefore be derived in humans, supporting the
      hypothesis that prosocial preferences played a central role in the evolution of
      human development and cooperation.

      Mitochondrial Size and Clearance.

AB  - The clearance of mitochondria by autophagy, mitophagy, is important for cell and 
      organism health [1], and known to be regulated by ubiquitin. During Drosophila
      intestine development, cells undergo a dramatic reduction in cell size and
      clearance of mitochondria that depends on autophagy, the E1 ubiquitin-activating 
      enzyme Uba1, and ubiquitin [2]. Here we screen a collection of putative
      ubiquitin-binding domain-encoding genes for cell size reduction and autophagy
      phenotypes. We identify the endosomal sorting complex required for transport
      (ESCRT) components TSG101 and Vps36, as well as the novel gene Vps13D. Vps13D is 
      an essential gene that is necessary for autophagy, mitochondrial size, and
      mitochondrial clearance in Drosophila. Interestingly, a similar mitochondrial
      phenotype is observed in VPS13D mutant human cells. The ubiquitin-associated
      (UBA) domain of Vps13D binds K63 ubiquitin chains, and mutants lacking the UBA
      domain have defects in mitochondrial size and clearance and exhibit
      semi-lethality, highlighting the importance of Vps13D ubiquitin binding in both
      mitochondrial health and development. VPS13D mutant cells possess phosphorylated 
      DRP1 and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) as well as DRP1 association with
      mitochondria, suggesting that VPS13D functions downstream of these known
      regulators of mitochondrial fission. In addition, the large Vps13D mitochondrial 
      and cell size phenotypes are suppressed by decreased mitochondrial fusion gene
      function. Thus, these results provide a previously unknown link between
      ubiquitin, mitochondrial size regulation, and autophagy.

AB  - Birds seem to use a light-dependent, radical-pair-based magnetic compass. In
      vertebrates, cryptochromes are the only class of proteins that form radical pairs
      upon photo-excitation. Therefore, they are currently the only candidate proteins 
      for light-dependent magnetoreception. Cryptochrome 4 (Cry4) is particularly
      interesting because it has only been found in vertebrates that use a magnetic
      compass. However, its structure and localization within the retina has remained
      unknown. Here, we sequenced night-migratory European robin (Erithacus rubecula)
      Cry4 from the retina and predicted the currently unresolved structure of the
      erCry4 protein, which suggests that erCry4 should bind Flavin. We also found that
      Cry1a, Cry1b, and Cry2 mRNA display robust circadian oscillation patterns,
      whereas Cry4 shows only a weak circadian oscillation. When we compared the
      relative mRNA expression levels of the cryptochromes during the spring and autumn
      migratory seasons relative to the non-migratory seasons in European robins and
      domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), the Cry4 mRNA expression level in European
      robin retinae, but not in chicken retinae, is significantly higher during the
      migratory season compared to the non-migratory seasons. Cry4 protein is
      specifically expressed in the outer segments of the double cones and
      long-wavelength single cones in European robins and chickens. A localization of
      Cry4 in double cones seems to be ideal for light-dependent magnetoreception.
      Considering all of the data presented here, especially including its localization
      within the European robin retina, its likely binding of Flavin, and its increased
      expression during the migratory season in the migratory bird but not in chicken, 
      Cry4 could be the magnetoreceptive protein.

AB  - The size of all cells, from bacteria to vertebrates, is proportional to the
      growth rate set by nutrient availability, but the underlying mechanisms are
      unknown. Here, we show that nutrients modulate cell size and growth rate via the 
      TORC2 signaling network in budding yeast. An important function of the TORC2
      network is to modulate synthesis of ceramide lipids, which play roles in
      signaling. TORC2-dependent control of ceramide signaling strongly influences both
      cell size and growth rate. Thus, cells that cannot make ceramides fail to
      modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrients. PP2A
      associated with the Rts1 regulatory subunit (PP2A(Rts1)) is embedded in a
      feedback loop that controls TORC2 signaling and helps set the level of TORC2
      signaling to match nutrient availability. Together, the data suggest a model in
      which growth rate and cell size are mechanistically linked by ceramide-dependent 
      signals arising from the TORC2 network.

AB  - Speech is crucial for communication in everyday life. Speech-brain entrainment,
      the alignment of neural activity to the slow temporal fluctuations (envelope) of 
      acoustic speech input, is a ubiquitous element of current theories of speech
      processing. Associations between speech-brain entrainment and acoustic speech
      signal, listening task, and speech intelligibility have been observed repeatedly.
      However, a methodological bottleneck has prevented so far clarifying whether
      speech-brain entrainment contributes functionally to (i.e., causes) speech
      intelligibility or is merely an epiphenomenon of it. To address this
      long-standing issue, we experimentally manipulated speech-brain entrainment
      without concomitant acoustic and task-related variations, using a brain
      stimulation approach that enables modulating listeners' neural activity with
      transcranial currents carrying speech-envelope information. Results from two
      experiments involving a cocktail-party-like scenario and a listening situation
      devoid of aural speech-amplitude envelope input reveal consistent effects on
      listeners' speech-recognition performance, demonstrating a causal role of
      speech-brain entrainment in speech intelligibility. Our findings imply that
      speech-brain entrainment is critical for auditory speech comprehension and
      suggest that transcranial stimulation with speech-envelope-shaped currents can be
      utilized to modulate speech comprehension in impaired listening conditions.

AB  - The family Rhinocerotidae with many species spread around the world was a
      distinct feature of the global Pleistocene fauna, but most of these species are
      now extinct. Three of the five surviving species are critically endangered, due
      to habitat loss and a surge in criminal hunting for horns. To save these iconic
      species, conservation science will have to apply all methods at its disposal,
      from population management through to advanced genomics and forensics. Michael
      Gross reports.

AB  - No two individuals are exactly alike. More than a simple platitude, this
      observation reflects the fundamentally stochastic nature of biological systems.
      The term 'stochastic' describes features that cannot be predicted a priori from
      readily measurable variables. In the dichotomous framework in which biological
      variation arises from genetic or environmental effects, stochastic effects are
      classified as environmental because they are not passed on to offspring - any
      non-heritable cause is, by definition, environmental. But non-heritable effects
      can be subdivided into those which can be predicted from measurable variables,
      and those that cannot. These latter effects are stochastic.

AB  - The mammalian hippocampus is important for normal memory function, particularly
      memory for places and events. Place cells, neurons within the hippocampus that
      have spatial receptive fields, represent information about an animal's position. 
      During periods of rest, but also during active task engagement, place cells
      spontaneously recapitulate past trajectories. Such 'replay' has been proposed as 
      a mechanism necessary for a range of neurobiological functions, including systems
      memory consolidation, recall and spatial working memory, navigational planning,
      and reinforcement learning. Focusing mainly, but not exclusively, on work
      conducted in rodents, we describe the methodologies used to analyse replay and
      review evidence for its putative roles. We identify outstanding questions as well
      as apparent inconsistencies in existing data, making suggestions as to how these 
      might be resolved. In particular, we find support for the involvement of replay
      in disparate processes, including the maintenance of hippocampal memories and
      decision making. We propose that the function of replay changes dynamically
      according to task demands placed on an organism and its current level of arousal.

AB  - In August 2017, the Bolivian government passed a contentious law downgrading the 
      legal protection of the Isiboro-Secure National Park and Indigenous Territory
      (TIPNIS, for its Spanish acronym), the ancestral homeland of four lowland
      indigenous groups and one of Bolivia's most iconic protected areas. Due to its
      strategic position straddling the Andes and Amazonia, TIPNIS represents not only 
      a key biodiversity hotspot in Bolivia, but one of the most biodiverse regions on 
      Earth, harboring exceptional levels of endemism and globally important
      populations of megafauna, as well as protecting substantial topographic
      complexity likely to support both wildlife migration and species range shifts in 
      response to climate change [1]. The new law, set to authorize the construction of
      a deeply-contested road through the core of the park, has reopened one of the
      highest profile socio-environmental conflicts in Latin America. Roads in tropical
      forests often lead to habitat conversion, and indeed within TIPNIS more than 58% 
      of deforestation is concentrated 5 km or less away from existing roads. It,
      therefore, seems very likely that the planned road will magnify the current scale
      and pace of deforestation in TIPNIS, underscoring the urgent need for revisiting 
      the road plans.

AB  - Black and white rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis and Ceratotherium simum) are iconic 
      African species that are classified by the International Union for the
      Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Critically Endangered and Near Threatened
      (http://www.iucnredlist.org/), respectively [1]. At the end of the 19(th)
      century, Southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) numbers had
      declined to fewer than 50 animals in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi region of the
      KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa, mainly due to uncontrolled hunting 
      [2,3]. Efforts by the Natal Parks Board facilitated an increase in population to 
      over 20,000 in 2015 through aggressive conservation management [2]. Black
      rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) populations declined from several hundred thousand 
      in the early 19(th) century to approximately 65,000 in 1970 and to approximately 
      2,400 by 1995 [1] with subsequent genetic reduction, also due to hunting, land
      clearances and later poaching [4]. In South Africa, rhinoceros poaching incidents
      have increased from 13 in 2007 to 1,215 in 2014 [1]. This has occurred despite
      strict trade bans on rhinoceros products and strict enforcement in recent years.

AB  - Climate change affects species and ecosystems around the globe [1]. The impacts
      of rising temperature are particularly pertinent in species with
      temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), where the sex of an individual is 
      determined by incubation temperature during embryonic development [2]. In sea
      turtles, the proportion of female hatchlings increases with the incubation
      temperature. With average global temperature predicted to increase 2.6 degrees C 
      by 2100 [3], many sea turtle populations are in danger of high egg mortality and 
      female-only offspring production. Unfortunately, determining the sex ratios of
      hatchlings at nesting beaches carries both logistical and ethical complications. 
      However, sex ratio data obtained at foraging grounds provides information on the 
      amalgamation of immature and adult turtles hatched from different nesting beaches
      over many years. Here, for the first time, we use genetic markers and a
      mixed-stock analysis (MSA), combined with sex determination through laparoscopy
      and endocrinology, to link male and female green turtles foraging in the Great
      Barrier Reef (GBR) to the nesting beach from which they hatched. Our results show
      a moderate female sex bias (65%-69% female) in turtles originating from the
      cooler southern GBR nesting beaches, while turtles originating from warmer
      northern GBR nesting beaches were extremely female-biased (99.1% of juvenile,
      99.8% of subadult, and 86.8% of adult-sized turtles). Combining our results with 
      temperature data show that the northern GBR green turtle rookeries have been
      producing primarily females for more than two decades and that the complete
      feminization of this population is possible in the near future.

AB  - The temporal dynamics that characterize sleep are difficult to capture outside
      the sleep laboratory. Therefore, longitudinal studies and big-data approaches
      assessing sleep dynamics are lacking. Here, we present the first large-scale
      analysis of human sleep dynamics in real life by making use of longitudinal wrist
      movement recordings of >16,000 sleep bouts from 573 subjects. Through non-linear 
      conversion of locomotor activity to "Locomotor Inactivity During Sleep" (LIDS),
      movement patterns are exposed that directly reflect ultradian sleep cycles and
      replicate the dynamics of laboratory sleep parameters. Our current analyses
      indicate no sex differences in LIDS-derived sleep dynamics, whereas especially
      age but also shift work have pronounced effects, specifically on decline rates
      and ultradian amplitude. In contrast, ultradian period and phase emerged as
      remarkably stable across the tested variables. Our approach and results provide
      the necessary quantitative sleep phenotypes for large field studies and outcome
      assessments in clinical trials.

AB  - Spatial control of exocytosis underlies polarized cell morphogenesis. In
      rod-shaped fission yeast, exocytic vesicles are conveyed along the actin
      cytoskeleton by myosin V motors toward growing cell ends [1, 2], the major sites 
      for exocytosis. However, actomyosin-based vesicle delivery is dispensable for
      polarized secretion and cylindrical cell shape of fission yeast [3]. Thus,
      additional mechanisms should function in the spatial confinement of exocytosis.
      Here we report a novel role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM)
      contacts in restricting exocytic sites for polarized fission yeast morphogenesis.
      We show that fission yeast cells deficient in both ER-PM contacts and
      actomyosin-based secretory vesicle transport display aberrant globular cell shape
      due to delocalized exocytosis. By artificially manipulating the strength and
      extent of ER-PM contacts in wild-type and mutant cells that exhibit induced
      ectopic exocytosis, we demonstrate that exocytosis and ER-PM contact formation
      are spatially incompatible. Furthermore, extensive ER-PM junctions at the
      non-growing lateral cell cortex prevent the PM from exocytic vesicle tethering
      and hence attenuate growth potential at cell sides. We thus propose that ER-PM
      contacts function as a new morphogenetic module by limiting exocytosis to growing
      cell tips in fission yeast. A similar mechanism could apply to other cell types
      with prominent ER-PM contacts.

AB  - How do stunning functional innovations evolve from unspecialized progenitors?
      This puzzle is particularly acute for ultrafast movements of appendages in
      arthropods as diverse as shrimps [1], stomatopods [2], insects [3-6], and spiders
      [7]. For example, the spectacular snapping claws of alpheid shrimps close so fast
      ( approximately 0.5 ms) that jetted water creates a cavitation bubble and an
      immensely powerful snap upon bubble collapse [1]. Such extreme movements depend
      on (1) an energy-storage mechanism (e.g., some kind of spring) and (2) a latching
      mechanism to release stored energy quickly [8]. Clearly, rapid claw closure must 
      have evolved before the ability to snap, but its evolutionary origins are
      unknown. Unearthing the functional mechanics of transitional stages is therefore 
      essential to understand how such radical novel abilities arise [9-11]. We
      reconstructed the evolutionary history of shrimp claw form and function by
      sampling 114 species from 19 families, including two unrelated families within
      which snapping evolved independently (Alpheidae and Palaemonidae) [12, 13]. Our
      comparative analyses, using micro-computed tomography (microCT) and confocal
      imaging, high-speed video, and kinematic experiments with select 3D-printed scale
      models, revealed a previously unrecognized "slip joint" in non-snapping shrimp
      claws. This slip joint facilitated the parallel evolution of a novel
      energy-storage and cocking mechanism-a torque-reversal joint-an apparent
      precondition for snapping. Remarkably, these key functional transitions between
      ancestral (simple pinching) and derived (snapping) claws were achieved by minute 
      differences in joint structure. Therefore, subtle changes in form appear to have 
      facilitated wholly novel functional change in a saltational manner. VIDEO

AB  - Hydrogen-dependent reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid offers a promising 
      route to greenhouse gas sequestration, carbon abatement technologies, hydrogen
      transport and storage, and the sustainable generation of renewable chemical
      feedstocks [1]. The most common approach to performing direct hydrogenation of
      CO2 to formate is to use chemical catalysts in homogeneous or heterogeneous
      reactions [2]. An alternative approach is to use the ability of living organisms 
      to perform this reaction biologically. However, although CO2 fixation pathways
      are widely distributed in nature, only a few enzymes have been described that
      have the ability to perform the direct hydrogenation of CO2 [3-5]. The formate
      hydrogenlyase (FHL) enzyme from Escherichia coli normally oxidizes formic acid to
      carbon dioxide and couples that reaction directly to the reduction of protons to 
      molecular hydrogen [6]. In this work, the reverse reaction of FHL is unlocked. It
      is established that FHL can operate as a highly efficient hydrogen-dependent
      carbon dioxide reductase when gaseous CO2 and H2 are placed under pressure (up to
      10 bar). Using intact whole cells, the pressurized system was observed to rapidly
      convert 100% of gaseous CO2 to formic acid, and >500 mM formate was observed to
      accumulate in solution. Harnessing the reverse reaction has the potential to
      allow the versatile E. coli system to be employed as an exciting new carbon
      capture technology or as a cell factory dedicated to formic acid production,
      which is a commodity in itself as well as a feedstock for the synthesis of other 
      valued chemicals.

AB  - Particularly socially influential individuals are present in many groups [1-8],
      but it is unclear whether their emergence is determined by their social influence
      versus the social susceptibility of others [9]. The social spider Stegodyphus
      dumicola shows regional variation in apparent leader-follower dynamics. We use
      this variation to evaluate the relative contributions of leader social influence 
      versus follower social susceptibility in driving this social order. Using
      chimeric colonies that combine potential leaders and followers, we discover that 
      leader-follower dynamics emerge from the site-specific social susceptibility of
      followers. We further show that the presence of leaders increases colony survival
      in environments where leader-follower dynamics occur. Thus, leadership is driven 
      by the "social susceptibility" of the population majority, rather than the social
      influence of key group members.

TI  - Tension-Induced Error Correction and Not Kinetochore Attachment Status Activates 
      the SAC in an Aurora-B/C-Dependent Manner in Oocytes.

AB  - Cell division with partitioning of the genetic material should take place only
      when paired chromosomes named bivalents (meiosis I) or sister chromatids (mitosis
      and meiosis II) are correctly attached to the bipolar spindle in a
      tension-generating manner. For this to happen, the spindle assembly checkpoint
      (SAC) checks whether unattached kinetochores are present, in which case anaphase 
      onset is delayed to permit further establishment of attachments. Additionally,
      microtubules are stabilized when they are attached and under tension. In mitosis,
      attachments not under tension activate the so-named error correction pathway
      depending on Aurora B kinase substrate phosphorylation. This leads to microtubule
      detachments, which in turn activates the SAC [1-3]. Meiotic divisions in
      mammalian oocytes are highly error prone, with severe consequences for fertility 
      and health of the offspring [4, 5]. Correct attachment of chromosomes in meiosis 
      I leads to the generation of stretched bivalents, but-unlike mitosis-not to
      tension between sister kinetochores, which co-orient. Here, we set out to address
      whether reduction of tension applied by the spindle on bioriented bivalents
      activates error correction and, as a consequence, the SAC. Treatment of oocytes
      in late prometaphase I with Eg5 kinesin inhibitor affects spindle tension, but
      not attachments, as we show here using an optimized protocol for confocal
      imaging. After Eg5 inhibition, bivalents are correctly aligned but less
      stretched, and as a result, Aurora-B/C-dependent error correction with
      microtubule detachment takes place. This loss of attachments leads to SAC
      activation. Crucially, SAC activation itself does not require Aurora B/C kinase
      activity in oocytes.

AB  - Higher and lower cortical areas in the visual hierarchy are reciprocally
      connected [1]. Although much is known about how feedforward pathways shape
      receptive field properties of visual neurons, relatively little is known about
      the role of feedback pathways in visual processing. Feedback pathways are thought
      to carry top-down signals, including information about context (e.g.,
      figure-ground segmentation and surround suppression) [2-5], and feedback has been
      demonstrated to sharpen orientation tuning of neurons in the primary visual
      cortex (V1) [6, 7]. However, the response characteristics of feedback neurons
      themselves and how feedback shapes V1 neurons' tuning for other features, such as
      spatial frequency (SF), remain largely unknown. Here, using a retrograde virus,
      targeted electrophysiological recordings, and optogenetic manipulations, we show 
      that putatively feedback neurons in layer 5 (hereafter "L5 feedback") in higher
      visual areas, AL (anterolateral area) and PM (posteromedial area), display
      distinct visual properties in awake head-fixed mice. AL L5 feedback neurons
      prefer significantly lower SF (mean: 0.04 cycles per degree [cpd]) compared to PM
      L5 feedback neurons (0.15 cpd). Importantly, silencing AL L5 feedback reduced
      visual responses of V1 neurons preferring low SF (mean change in firing rate:
      -8.0%), whereas silencing PM L5 feedback suppressed responses of
      high-SF-preferring V1 neurons (-20.4%). These findings suggest that feedback
      connections from higher visual areas convey distinctly tuned visual inputs to V1 
      that serve to boost V1 neurons' responses to SF. Such like-to-like functional
      organization may represent an important feature of feedback pathways in sensory
      systems and in the nervous system in general.

AB  - Intracellular protein gradients underlie essential cellular and developmental
      processes, but the mechanisms by which they are established are incompletely
      understood. During the asymmetric division of the C. elegans zygote, the
      RNA-binding protein MEX-5 forms an anterior-rich cytoplasmic gradient that causes
      the RNA-binding protein POS-1 to form an opposing, posterior-rich gradient. We
      demonstrate that the polo-like kinase PLK-1 mediates the repulsive coupling
      between MEX-5 and POS-1 by increasing the mobility of POS-1 in the anterior.
      PLK-1 is enriched in the anterior cytoplasm and phosphorylates POS-1, which is
      both necessary and sufficient to increase POS-1 mobility. Regulation of POS-1
      mobility depends on both the interaction between PLK-1 and MEX-5 and between
      MEX-5 and RNA, suggesting that MEX-5 may recruit PLK-1 to RNA in the anterior.
      The low concentration of MEX-5/PLK-1 in the posterior cytoplasm provides a
      permissive environment for the retention of POS-1, which depends on POS-1 RNA
      binding. Our findings describe a novel reaction/diffusion mechanism in which the 
      asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic PLK-1 couples two RNA-binding protein
      gradients, thereby partitioning the cytoplasm.

      Separation before Nuclear Envelope Breakdown.

AB  - Centrosomes [1, 2] play a central role during spindle assembly in most animal
      cells [3]. In early mitosis, they organize two symmetrical microtubule arrays
      that upon separation define the two poles of the forming spindle. Centrosome
      separation is tightly regulated [4, 5], occurring through partially redundant
      mechanisms that rely on the action of microtubule-based dynein and kinesin motors
      and the actomyosin system [6]. While centrosomes can separate in prophase or in
      prometaphase after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), prophase centrosome
      separation optimizes spindle assembly and minimizes the occurrence of abnormal
      chromosome attachments that could end in aneuploidy [7, 8]. Prophase centrosome
      separation relies on the activity of Eg5/KIF11, a mitotic kinesin [9] that
      accumulates around centrosomes in early mitosis under the control of CDK1 and the
      Nek9/Nek6/7 kinase module [10-17]. Here, we show that Eg5 localization and
      centrosome separation in prophase depend on the nuclear microtubule-associated
      protein TPX2 [18], a pool of which localizes to the centrosomes before NEBD. This
      localization involves RHAMM/HMMR [19] and the kinase Nek9 [20], which
      phosphorylates TPX2 nuclear localization signal (NLS) preventing its interaction 
      with importin and nuclear import. The pool of centrosomal TPX2 in prophase has a 
      critical role for both microtubule aster organization and Eg5 localization, and
      thereby for centrosome separation. Our results uncover an unsuspected role for
      TPX2 before NEBD and define a novel regulatory mechanism for centrosome
      separation in prophase. They furthermore suggest NLS phosphorylation as a novel
      regulatory mechanism for spindle assembly factors controlled by the importin/Ran 
      system.

AB  - Three key steps in meiosis allow diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes:
      (1) homologous chromosomes (homologs) pair and undergo crossovers; (2) homologs
      segregate to opposite poles; and (3) sister chromatids segregate to opposite
      poles. The XX/XO sex determination system found in many nematodes [1] facilitates
      the study of meiosis because variation is easily recognized [2-4]. Here we show
      that meiotic segregation of X chromosomes in the trioecious nematode Auanema
      rhodensis [5] varies according to sex (hermaphrodite, female, or male) and type
      of gametogenesis (oogenesis or spermatogenesis). In this species, XO males
      exclusively produce X-bearing sperm [6, 7]. The unpaired X precociously separates
      into sister chromatids, which co-segregate with the autosome set to generate a
      functional haplo-X sperm. The other set of autosomes is discarded into a residual
      body. Here we explore the X chromosome behavior in female and hermaphrodite
      meioses. Whereas X chromosomes segregate following the canonical pattern during
      XX female oogenesis to yield haplo-X oocytes, during XX hermaphrodite oogenesis
      they segregate to the first polar body to yield nullo-X oocytes. Thus, crosses
      between XX hermaphrodites and males yield exclusively male progeny. During
      hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, the sister chromatids of the X chromosomes
      separate during meiosis I, and homologous X chromatids segregate to the
      functional sperm to create diplo-X sperm. Given these intra-species,
      intra-individual, and intra-gametogenesis variations in the meiotic program, A.
      rhodensis is an ideal model for studying the plasticity of meiosis and how it can
      be modulated.

AB  - Sensory systems balance stability and plasticity to optimize stimulus
      representations in dynamic environments. We studied these processes in the
      olfactory system of adult zebrafish. Activity patterns evoked by repeated odor
      stimulation were measured by multiphoton calcium imaging in the olfactory bulb
      (OB) and in telencephalic area Dp, the homolog of olfactory cortex. Whereas odor 
      responses in the OB were highly reproducible, responses of Dp neurons adapted
      over trials and exhibited substantial variability that could be attributed to
      ongoing activity and to systematic changes in neuronal representations following 
      each stimulus. An NMDA receptor antagonist did not affect the magnitude of odor
      responses but strongly reduced the variability and experience-dependent
      modification of odor responses in Dp. As a consequence, odor representations
      became stable over trials. These results demonstrate that odor representations in
      higher brain areas are continuously modified by experience, supporting the view
      that olfactory processing is inseparable from memory, even in the absence of
      reinforcement.

TI  - Patterns of Genomic Variation in the Opportunistic Pathogen Candida glabrata
      Suggest the Existence of Mating and a Secondary Association with Humans.

AB  - Candida glabrata is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that ranks as the second
      most common cause of systemic candidiasis. Despite its genus name, this yeast is 
      more closely related to the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae than to other
      Candida pathogens, and hence its ability to infect humans is thought to have
      emerged independently. Moreover, C. glabrata has all the necessary genes to
      undergo a sexual cycle but is considered an asexual organism due to the lack of
      direct evidence of sexual reproduction. To reconstruct the recent evolution of
      this pathogen and find footprints of sexual reproduction, we assessed genomic and
      phenotypic variation across 33 globally distributed C. glabrata isolates. We
      cataloged extensive copy-number variation, which particularly affects genes
      encoding cell-wall-associated proteins, including adhesins. The observed level of
      genetic variation in C. glabrata is significantly higher than that found in
      Candida albicans. This variation is structured into seven deeply divergent
      clades, which show recent geographical dispersion and large within-clade genomic 
      and phenotypic differences. We show compelling evidence of recent admixture
      between differentiated lineages and of purifying selection on mating genes, which
      provides the first evidence for the existence of an active sexual cycle in this
      yeast. Altogether, our data point to a recent global spread of previously
      genetically isolated populations and suggest that humans are only a secondary
      niche for this yeast.

AB  - Visual objects contain rich local high-order patterns such as curvature, corners,
      and junctions. In the standard hierarchical model of visual object recognition,
      V1 neurons were commonly assumed to code local orientation components of those
      high-order patterns. Here, by using two-photon imaging in awake macaques and
      systematically characterizing V1 neuronal responses to an extensive set of
      stimuli, we found a large percentage of neurons in the V1 superficial layer
      responded more strongly to complex patterns, such as corners, junctions, and
      curvature, than to their oriented line or edge components. Our results suggest
      that those individual V1 neurons could play the role in detecting local
      high-order visual patterns in the early stage of object recognition hierarchy.

AB  - The vertebrate extinction rate over the past century is approximately 22-100
      times greater than background extinction rates [1], and large mammals are
      particularly at risk [2, 3]. Quaternary megafaunal extinctions have been
      attributed to climate change [4], overexploitation [5], or a combination of the
      two [6]. Rhinoceroses (Family: Rhinocerotidae) have a rich fossil history replete
      with iconic examples of climate-induced extinctions [7], but current pressures
      threaten to eliminate this group entirely. The Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus 
      sumatrensis) is among the most imperiled mammals on earth. The 2011 population
      was estimated at </=216 wild individuals [8], and currently the species is
      extirpated, or nearly so, throughout the majority of its former range [8-12].
      Understanding demographic history is important in placing current population
      status into a broader ecological and evolutionary context. Analysis of the
      Sumatran rhinoceros genome reveals extreme changes in effective population size
      throughout the Pleistocene. Population expansion during the early to middle
      Pleistocene was followed by decline. Ecological niche modeling indicated that
      changing climate most likely played a role in the decline of the Sumatran
      rhinoceros, as less suitable habitat on an emergent Sundaland corridor isolated
      Sumatran rhinoceros populations. By the end of the Pleistocene, the Sundaland
      corridor was submerged, and populations were fragmented and consequently reduced 
      to low Holocene levels from which they would never recover. Past events denuded
      the Sumatran rhinoceros of genetic diversity through population decline,
      fragmentation, or some combination of the two and most likely made the species
      even more susceptible to later exploitation and habitat loss. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Connections between the protein kinases that function within complex cell
      polarity networks are poorly understood. Rod-shaped fission yeast cells grow in a
      highly polarized manner, and genetic screens have identified many protein
      kinases, including the CaMKK-like Ssp1 and the MARK/PAR-1 family kinase Kin1,
      that are required for polarized growth and cell shape, but their functional
      mechanisms and connections have been unknown [1-5]. We found that Ssp1 promotes
      cell polarity by phosphorylating the activation loop of Kin1. Kin1 regulates cell
      polarity and cytokinesis through unknown mechanisms [4-7]. We performed a
      large-scale phosphoproteomic screen and found that Kin1 phosphorylates itself and
      Pal1 to promote growth at cell tips, and these proteins are interdependent for
      localization to growing cell tips. Additional Kin1 substrates for cell polarity
      and cytokinesis (Tea4, Mod5, Cdc15, and Cyk3) were also phosphorylated by a
      second kinase, the DYRK family member Pom1 [8]. Kin1 and Pom1 were enriched at
      opposite ends of growing cells, and they phosphorylated largely non-overlapping
      sites on shared substrates. Combined inhibition of both Kin1and Pom1 led to
      synthetic defects in their shared substrates Cdc15 and Cyk3, confirming a
      non-redundant functional connection through shared substrates. These findings
      uncover a new Ssp1-Kin1 signaling pathway, and define its functional and
      mechanistic connection with Pom1 signaling for cell polarity and cytokinesis.
      These kinases are conserved in many eukaryotes including humans, suggesting that 
      similar connections and mechanisms might operate in a broad range of cells.

AB  - Improperly attached chromosomes activate the mitotic checkpoint that arrests cell
      division before anaphase. Cells can maintain an arrest for several hours but
      eventually will resume proliferation, a process we refer to as adaptation.
      Whether adapting cells bypass an active block or whether the block has to be
      removed to resume proliferation is not clear. Likewise, it is not known whether
      all cells of a genetically homogeneous population are equally capable to adapt.
      Here, we show that the mitotic checkpoint is operational when yeast cells adapt
      and that each cell has the same propensity to adapt. Our results are consistent
      with a model of the mitotic checkpoint where adaptation is driven by random
      fluctuations of APC/C(Cdc20), the molecular species inhibited by the checkpoint. 
      Our data provide a quantitative framework for understanding how cells overcome a 
      constant stimulus that halts cell cycle progression.

AB  - Brain-computer interfaces have seen an increase in popularity due to their
      potential for direct neuroprosthetic applications for amputees and disabled
      individuals. Supporting this promise, animals-including humans-can learn even
      arbitrary mapping between the activity of cortical neurons and movement of
      prosthetic devices [1-4]. However, the performance of neuroprosthetic device
      control has been nowhere near that of limb control in healthy individuals,
      presenting a dire need to improve the performance. One potential limitation is
      the fact that previous work has not distinguished diverse cell types in the
      neocortex, even though different cell types possess distinct functions in
      cortical computations [5-7] and likely distinct capacities to control
      brain-computer interfaces. Here, we made a first step in addressing this issue by
      tracking the plastic changes of three major types of cortical inhibitory neurons 
      (INs) during a neuron-pair operant conditioning task using two-photon imaging of 
      IN subtypes expressing GCaMP6f. Mice were rewarded when the activity of the
      positive target neuron (N+) exceeded that of the negative target neuron (N-)
      beyond a set threshold. Mice improved performance with all subtypes, but the
      strategies were subtype specific. When parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs were
      targeted, the activity of N- decreased. However, targeting of somatostatin (SOM)-
      and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing INs led to an increase of the 
      N+ activity. These results demonstrate that INs can be individually modulated in 
      a subtype-specific manner and highlight the versatility of neural circuits in
      adapting to new demands by using cell-type-specific strategies.

AB  - Lysosomal membrane permeabilization or lysosomal rupture is recognized as a
      common and severe stress condition relevant for infection, cellular degeneration 
      and cancer. However, the cellular response mechanisms that protect cells from the
      consequences of lysosomal damage and ensure lysosomal quality control and
      homeostasis have only recently been explored. Key elements of this response
      involve the specific sensing of the damage followed by extensive modification of 
      the organelles with ubiquitin to mark them for clearance by selective
      macroautophagy, termed lysophagy. Efficient lysophagy is ensured by additional
      layers of regulation, including modulation by the ubiquitin-directed AAA-ATPase
      VCP/p97. Lysophagy shares many features with mitophagy, the macroautophagic
      removal of damaged mitochondria. This review aims to gather available data from
      different fields and to define the key steps necessary for sensing and subsequent
      clearance of damaged lysosomes. We conclude with a discussion of disease
      implications with a focus on neurodegeneration.

AB  - In our recent Current Biology paper [1], we describe an ocean warming experiment 
      in which we manipulated the temperature of panels set on the seafloor to provide 
      a realistic and relevant indication of how benthic communities may change under
      future ocean warming. We describe increases in growth associated with warming by 
      1 degrees C, with growth rates up to doubled in some species. The definition of
      Q10 is a measure of the temperature sensitivity of an enzymatic reaction rate or 
      a physiological process due to an increase by 10 degrees C; doubling of growth
      rates with a 1 degrees C change gives Q10s around 1,000. In his correspondence,
      Jaap van der Meer [2] questions our methods and provides alternative analyses
      which lead him to conclude that our observed increases in growth rate were in
      fact much lower and in accordance with previous studies from temperate zones. We 
      provide justification for our use of absolute growth rate, justification for not 
      using instantaneous growth rate (or a measure of growth in proportion to previous
      growth) and encourage the on-going discussion of how to measure and compare
      growth rates.

AB  - In a recent paper in Current Biology, Ashton et al.[1] describe the results of
      what they call the first ever experiment in which benthic assemblages are warmed 
      to ecologically relevant levels in situ. West of the Antarctic peninsula, the
      authors employed heated settlement panels and studied the settlement and growth
      of pioneering species over a 5-month period at ambient temperature and at 1
      degrees C and 2 degrees C above ambient. Such ocean temperature increases are
      expected within the next 50-100 years. They claim that the two most dominant
      species doubled their growth rate already at an increase of 1 degrees C. They
      further state that this implies Q10 coefficients around 1,000, which is much
      higher than anticipated. This unpredicted result should, according to the
      authors, critically change our thinking of how polar communities might respond to
      ocean warming. Indeed, such extreme Q10 coefficients are a surprising result, and
      not in accordance with more than a century of laboratory or field research in
      temperate zones. Here, I will show that the claim is unsubstantiated and that the
      observed in situ growth-rate response to temperature of these Antarctic species
      is much weaker than claimed, and not very different from previous work in the
      temperate zone.

AB  - In flowering plants, two pairs of gametes participate in double fertilization.
      One of the two sperm delivered by the pollen tube (PT) fuses with the egg cell to
      form the zygote, whereas the second unites with the central cell to produce the
      endosperm [1]. Most animal species prevent polyspermy through a transient, fast
      block established by the depolarization of the egg membrane within milliseconds
      after encountering the first sperm, followed by a slow block generated through
      enzymatic changes in the extracellular matrix surrounding the egg [2]. Although
      in vitro fertilization experiments suggest that the maize zygote starts cell wall
      deposition within 30 seconds after fusion with a sperm [3], thereby preventing
      further fertilization events, it is unknown whether plant gametes prevent
      polyspermy by a fast block. Here, using a genetic approach, the absence of a fast
      block preventing polyspermy in the maize central cell is demonstrated. A putative
      polyspermy event involving the egg indicates the existence of tri-parental
      individuals, which may provide an alternative route to polyploidy, distinct from 
      the one involving unreduced gametes.

      Expression and Time of Axon Initiation.

AB  - Many networks throughout the nervous system are organized into topographic maps, 
      where the positions of neuron cell bodies in the projecting field correspond with
      the positions of their axons in the target field. Previous studies of topographic
      map development show evidence for spatial patterning mechanisms, in which
      molecular determinants expressed across the projecting and target fields are
      matched directly in a point-to-point mapping process. Here, we describe a novel
      temporal mechanism of topographic map formation that depends on spatially
      regulated differences in the timing of axon outgrowth and functions in parallel
      with spatial point-to-point mapping mechanisms. We focus on the vagus motor
      neurons, which are topographically arranged in both mammals and fish. We show
      that cell position along the anterior-posterior axis of hindbrain rhombomere 8
      determines expression of hox5 genes, which are expressed in posterior, but not
      anterior, vagus motor neurons. Using live imaging and transplantation in
      zebrafish embryos, we additionally reveal that axon initiation is delayed in
      posterior vagus motor neurons independent of neuron birth time. We show that hox5
      expression directs topographic mapping without affecting time of axon outgrowth
      and that time of axon outgrowth directs topographic mapping without affecting
      hox5 expression. The vagus motor neuron topographic map is therefore determined
      by two mechanisms that act in parallel: a hox5-dependent spatial mechanism akin
      to classic mechanisms of topographic map formation and a novel axon
      outgrowth-dependent temporal mechanism in which time of axon formation is
      spatially regulated to direct axon targeting.

AB  - Hominins have been making tools for over three million years [1], yet the
      earliest known hooked tools appeared as recently as 90,000 years ago [2]. Hook
      innovation is likely to have boosted our ancestors' hunting and fishing
      efficiency [3], marking a major transition in human technological evolution. The 
      New Caledonian crow is the only non-human animal known to craft hooks in the wild
      [4, 5]. Crows manufacture hooked stick tools in a multi-stage process, involving 
      the detachment of a branch from suitable vegetation; "sculpting" of a terminal
      hook from the nodal joint; and often additional adjustments, such as length
      trimming, shaft bending, and bark stripping [4, 6, 7]. Although tools made by a
      given population share key design features [4, 6, 8], they vary appreciably in
      overall shape and hook dimensions. Using wild-caught, temporarily captive crows, 
      we experimentally investigated causes and consequences of variation in hook-tool 
      morphology. We found that bird age, manufacture method, and raw-material
      properties influenced tool morphology, and that hook geometry in turn affected
      crows' foraging efficiency. Specifically, hook depth varied with both detachment 
      technique and plant rigidity, and deeper hooks enabled faster prey extraction in 
      the provided tasks. Older crows manufactured tools of distinctive shape, with
      pronounced shaft curvature and hooks of intermediate depth. Future work should
      explore the interactive effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tool
      production and deployment. Our study provides a quantitative assessment of the
      drivers and functional significance of tool shape variation in a non-human
      animal, affording valuable comparative insights into early hominin tool crafting 
      [9].

AB  - Sauropterygia, a successful clade of marine reptiles abundant in aquatic
      ecosystems of the Mesozoic, inhabited nearshore to pelagic habitats over >180
      million years of evolutionary history [1]. Aquatic vertebrates experience strong 
      buoyancy forces that allow movement in a three-dimensional environment, resulting
      in structural convergences such as flippers and fish-like bauplans [2, 3], as
      well as convergences in the sensory systems. We used computed tomographic scans
      of 19 sauropterygian species to determine how the transition to pelagic
      lifestyles influenced the evolution of the endosseous labyrinth, which houses the
      vestibular sensory organ of balance and orientation [4]. Semicircular canal
      geometries underwent distinct changes during the transition from nearshore
      Triassic sauropterygians to the later, pelagic plesiosaurs. Triassic
      sauropterygians have dorsoventrally compact, anteroposteriorly elongate
      labyrinths, resembling those of crocodylians. In contrast, plesiosaurs have
      compact, bulbous labyrinths, sharing some features with those of sea turtles.
      Differences in relative labyrinth size among sauropterygians correspond to
      locomotory differences: bottom-walking [5, 6] placodonts have proportionally
      larger labyrinths than actively swimming taxa (i.e., all other sauropterygians). 
      Furthermore, independent evolutionary origins of short-necked, large-headed
      "pliosauromorph" body proportions among plesiosaurs coincide with reductions of
      labyrinth size, paralleling the evolutionary history of cetaceans [7].
      Sauropterygian labyrinth evolution is therefore correlated closely with both
      locomotory style and body proportions, and these changes are consistent with
      isolated observations made previously in other marine tetrapods. Our study
      presents the first virtual reconstructions of plesiosaur endosseous labyrinths
      and the first large-scale, quantitative study detailing the effects of
      increasingly aquatic lifestyles on labyrinth morphology among marine reptiles.

AB  - Climate change has been implicated as driving shifts of hybridizing species'
      range limits [1, 2]. Whether and how much hybrid zones move depends on the
      relative fitness of hybridzing species under changing conditions [3, 4]. However,
      fitness is rarely linked to both climatic conditions and movement of hybrid
      zones, such that the relationship between climate change and hybrid zone dynamics
      remains tenuous [5]. Here we report how interactions between climate (seasonal
      precipitation) and competitor densities result in steep differentials in
      survival, which in turn drive hybrid zone movement for two woodrat species
      (Neotoma fuscipes and N. macrotis) in central California, USA. Using 6 years of
      capture-mark-recapture data, we found that the smaller-bodied species, N.
      macrotis, and hybrids had survival advantages over the larger-bodied N. fuscipes 
      in the contact region during dry winters and wet springs. This pattern of
      differential survival, with N. macrotis having a consistent advantage over N.
      fuscipes during our study period, matched the spatial dynamics of the hybrid
      zone, which moved steadily north into N. fuscipes territory, with its estimated
      center moving approximately 150 m north in 6 years. Our findings provide a unique
      demonstration of range movements emerging from a complex interplay between
      climate and competition. Although all study site areas experienced the same
      climatic conditions, competitive effects created a complex spatial pattern of
      survival differentials, which in turn influenced hybrid zone movement.
      Characterization of fitness differentials derived from replicated demographic
      studies of contact regions between competitors should greatly improve our ability
      to understand and forecast climate-driven range dynamics.

AB  - Sleep is an essential and evolutionarily conserved behavioral state whose
      regulation remains poorly understood. To identify genes that regulate vertebrate 
      sleep, we recently performed a genetic screen in zebrafish, and here we report
      the identification of neuropeptide Y (NPY) as both necessary for normal daytime
      sleep duration and sufficient to promote sleep. We show that overexpression of
      NPY increases sleep, whereas mutation of npy or ablation of npy-expressing
      neurons decreases sleep. By analyzing sleep architecture, we show that NPY
      regulates sleep primarily by modulating the length of wake bouts. To determine
      how NPY regulates sleep, we tested for interactions with several systems known to
      regulate sleep, and provide anatomical, molecular, genetic, and pharmacological
      evidence that NPY promotes sleep by inhibiting noradrenergic signaling. These
      data establish NPY as an important vertebrate sleep/wake regulator and link NPY
      signaling to an established arousal-promoting system.

AB  - Humans use spatial representations to structure abstract concepts [1]. One of the
      most well-known examples is the "mental number line"-the propensity to imagine
      numbers oriented in space [2, 3]. Human infants [4, 5], children [6, 7], adults
      [8], and nonhuman animals [9, 10] associate small numbers with the left side of
      space and large numbers with the right. In humans, cultural artifacts, such as
      the direction of reading and writing, modulate the directionality of this
      representation, with right-to-left reading cultures associating small numbers
      with right and large numbers with left [11], whereas the opposite association
      permeates left-to-right reading cultures [8]. Number-space mapping plays a
      central role in human mathematical concepts [12], but its origins remain unclear:
      is it the result of an innate bias or does it develop after birth? Infant humans 
      are passively exposed to a spatially coded environment, so experience and culture
      could underlie the mental number line. To rule out this possibility, we tested
      neonates' responses to small or large auditory quantities paired with geometric
      figures presented on either the left or right sides of the screen. We show that
      0- to 3-day-old neonates associate a small quantity with the left and a large
      quantity with the right when the multidimensional stimulus contains discrete
      numerical information, providing evidence that representations of number are
      associated to an oriented space at the start of postnatal life, prior to
      experience with language, culture, or with culture-specific biases.

AB  - The insect wing is a key evolutionary innovation that was essential for insect
      diversification. Yet despite its importance, there is still debate about its
      evolutionary origins. Two main hypotheses have been proposed: the paranotal
      hypothesis, which suggests that wings evolved as an extension of the dorsal
      thorax, and the gill-exite hypothesis, which proposes that wings were derived
      from a modification of a pre-existing branch at the dorsal base (subcoxa) of the 
      leg. Here, we address this question by studying how wing fates are initially
      specified during Drosophila embryogenesis, by characterizing a cis-regulatory
      module (CRM) from the snail (sna) gene, sna-DP (for dorsal primordia). sna-DP
      specifically marks the early primordia for both the wing and haltere,
      collectively referred to as the DP. We found that the inputs that activate sna-DP
      are distinct from those that activate Distalless, a marker for leg fates.
      Further, in genetic backgrounds in which the leg primordia are absent, the DP are
      still partially specified. However, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that 
      cells from the early leg primordia contribute to both ventral and dorsal
      appendage fates. Together, these results suggest that the wings of Drosophila
      have a dual developmental origin: two groups of cells, one ventral and one more
      dorsal, give rise to the mature wing. We suggest that the dual developmental
      origins of the wing may be a molecular remnant of the evolutionary history of
      this appendage, in which cells of the subcoxa of the leg coalesced with dorsal
      outgrowths to evolve a dorsal appendage with motor control.

TI  - The Mitotic Function of Augmin Is Dependent on Its Microtubule-Associated Protein
      Subunit EDE1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - The augmin complex plays an essential role in microtubule (MT)-dependent MT
      nucleation by recruiting the gamma-tubulin complex to MT walls to generate new
      MTs [1]. The complex contains eight subunits (designated AUG) including AUG8,
      which is an MT-associated protein (MAP). When this complex is isolated from
      etiolated seedlings consisting of primarily interphase cells in Arabidopsis
      thaliana, AUG8 is an integral component [2]. EDE1 (Endosperm DEfective 1) is
      homologous to AUG8 [3]. Here, we demonstrate that EDE1, but not AUG8, is
      associated with acentrosomal spindle and phragmoplast MT arrays in patterns
      indistinguishable from those of the AUG1-7 subunits and the gamma-tubulin complex
      proteins (GCPs) that exhibit biased localization toward MT minus ends. Consistent
      with this colocalization, EDE1 directly interacts with AUG6 in vivo. Moreover, a 
      partial loss-of-function mutation, ede1-1, compromises the localization of augmin
      and gamma-tubulin on the spindle and phragmoplast MT arrays and leads to serious 
      distortions in spindle MT remodeling during mitosis. However, mitosis continues
      even when kinetochore fibers are not obviously discernable, and cytokinesis takes
      place following the formation of elongated bipolar phragmoplast MT arrays in the 
      mutant. Hence, we conclude that the mitotic function of augmin is dependent on
      its MAP subunit EDE1, which cannot be replaced by AUG8, and that the
      cell-cycle-dependent function of augmin can be differentially regulated by
      employing distinct MAP subunits. Our results also illustrate that plant cells can
      respond flexibly to serious challenges of compromised MT-dependent MT nucleation 
      to complete mitosis and cytokinesis.

AB  - The relationships at the root of the animal tree have proven difficult to
      resolve, with the current debate focusing on whether sponges (phylum Porifera) or
      comb jellies (phylum Ctenophora) are the sister group of all other animals [1-5].
      The choice of evolutionary models seems to be at the core of the problem because 
      Porifera tends to emerge as the sister group of all other animals
      ("Porifera-sister") when site-specific amino acid differences are modeled (e.g., 
      [6, 7]), whereas Ctenophora emerges as the sister group of all other animals
      ("Ctenophora-sister") when they are ignored (e.g., [8-11]). We show that two key 
      phylogenomic datasets that previously supported Ctenophora-sister [10, 12]
      display strong heterogeneity in amino acid composition across sites and taxa and 
      that no routinely used evolutionary model can adequately describe both forms of
      heterogeneity. We show that data-recoding methods [13-15] reduce compositional
      heterogeneity in these datasets and that models accommodating site-specific amino
      acid preferences can better describe the recoded datasets. Increased model
      adequacy is associated with significant topological changes in support of
      Porifera-sister. Because adequate modeling of the evolutionary process that
      generated the data is fundamental to recovering an accurate phylogeny [16-20],
      our results strongly support sponges as the sister group of all other animals and
      provide further evidence that Ctenophora-sister represents a tree reconstruction 
      artifact. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Newborn infants display strong nociceptive behavior in response to tissue
      damaging stimuli, and this is accompanied by nociceptive activity generated in
      subcortical and cortical areas of the brain [1, 2]. In the absence of verbal
      report, these nociceptive responses are used as measures of pain sensation in
      newborn humans, as they are in animals [3, 4]. However, many infants are raised
      in a physiologically stressful environment, and little is known about the effect 
      of background levels of stress upon their pain responses. In adults, acute
      physiological stress causes hyperalgesia [5-7], and increased background stress
      increases pain [8-10], but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to
      infants. Here we have simultaneously measured nociceptive behavior, brain
      activity, and levels of physiological stress in a sample of 56 newborn human
      infants aged 36-42 weeks. Salivary cortisol (hypothalamic pituitary axis), heart 
      rate variability (sympathetic adrenal medullary system), EEG event-related
      potentials (nociceptive cortical activity), and facial expression (behavior) were
      acquired in individual infants following a clinically required heel lance. We
      show that infants with higher levels of stress exhibit larger amplitude cortical 
      nociceptive responses, but this is not reflected in their behavior. Furthermore, 
      while nociceptive behavior and cortical activity are normally correlated, this
      relationship is disrupted in infants with high levels of physiological stress.
      Brain activity evoked by noxious stimulation is therefore enhanced by stress, but
      this cannot be deduced from observation of pain behavior. This may be important
      in the prevention of adverse effects of early repetitive pain on brain
      development.

AB  - Which factors shape animals' migration movements across large geographical
      scales, how different migratory strategies emerge between populations, and how
      these may affect population dynamics are central questions in the field of animal
      migration [1] that only large-scale studies of migration patterns across a
      species' range can answer [2]. To address these questions, we track the migration
      of 270 Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, a red-listed, declining seabird,
      across their entire breeding range. We investigate the role of demographic,
      geographical, and environmental variables in driving spatial and behavioral
      differences on an ocean-basin scale by measuring puffins' among-colony
      differences in migratory routes and day-to-day behavior (estimated with
      individual daily activity budgets and energy expenditure). We show that
      competition and local winter resource availability are important drivers of
      migratory movements, with birds from larger colonies or with poorer local winter 
      conditions migrating further and visiting less-productive waters; this in turn
      led to differences in flight activity and energy expenditure. Other behavioral
      differences emerge with latitude, with foraging effort and energy expenditure
      increasing when birds winter further north in colder waters. Importantly, these
      ocean-wide migration patterns can ultimately be linked with breeding performance:
      colony productivity is negatively associated with wintering latitude, population 
      size, and migration distance, which demonstrates the cost of competition and
      migration on future breeding and the link between non-breeding and breeding
      periods. Our results help us to understand the drivers of animal migration and
      have important implications for population dynamics and the conservation of
      migratory species.

AB  - A central challenge in biology is to understand how innate behaviors evolve
      between closely related species. One way to elucidate how differences arise is to
      compare the development of behavior in species with distinct adult traits [1].
      Here, we report that Peromyscus polionotus is strikingly precocious with regard
      to burrowing behavior, but not other behaviors, compared to its sister species P.
      maniculatus. In P. polionotus, burrows were excavated as early as 17 days of age,
      whereas P. maniculatus did not build burrows until 10 days later. Moreover, the
      well-known differences in burrow architecture between adults of these species-P. 
      polionotus adults excavate long burrows with an escape tunnel, whereas P.
      maniculatus dig short, single-tunnel burrows [2-4]-were intact in juvenile
      burrowers. To test whether this juvenile behavior is influenced by early-life
      environment, we reciprocally cross-fostered pups of both species. Fostering did
      not alter the characteristic burrowing behavior of either species, suggesting
      that these differences are genetic. In backcross hybrids, we show that precocious
      burrowing and adult tunnel length are genetically correlated and that a P.
      polionotus allele linked to tunnel length variation in adults is also associated 
      with precocious onset of burrowing in juveniles, suggesting that the same genetic
      region-either a single gene with pleiotropic effects or linked genes-influences
      distinct aspects of the same behavior at these two life stages. These results
      raise the possibility that genetic variants affect behavioral drive (i.e.,
      motivation) to burrow and thereby affect both the developmental timing and adult 
      expression of burrowing behavior.

AB  - Tensile forces regulate epithelial homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms
      behind this regulation are poorly understood. Using structured illumination
      microscopy and proximity ligation assays, we show that the tight junction protein
      ZO-1 exists in stretched and folded conformations within epithelial cells,
      depending on actomyosin-generated force. We also show that ZO-1 and ZO-2 regulate
      the localization of the transcription factor DbpA and the tight junction membrane
      protein occludin in a manner that depends on the organization of the actin
      cytoskeleton, myosin-II activity, and substrate stiffness, resulting in
      modulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, barrier function, and cyst
      morphogenesis. Pull-down experiments show that interactions between N-terminal
      (ZPSG) and C-terminal domains of ZO-1 prevent binding of DbpA to the ZPSG,
      suggesting that force-dependent intra-molecular interactions regulate ZPSG
      binding to ligands within cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments also suggest
      that ZO-1 heterodimerization with ZO-2 promotes the stretched conformation and
      ZPSG interaction with ligands. Magnetic tweezers single-molecule experiments
      suggest that pN-scale tensions ( approximately 2-4 pN) are sufficient to maintain
      the stretched conformation of ZO-1, while keeping its structured domains intact, 
      and that 5-20 pN force is required to disrupt the interaction between the extreme
      C-terminal and the ZPSG domains of ZO-1. We propose that tensile forces regulate 
      epithelial homeostasis by activating ZO proteins through stretching, to control
      the junctional recruitment and downstream signaling of their interactors.

AB  - Considerable evidence implicates the basal ganglia in interval timing, yet the
      underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a novel behavioral task, we
      demonstrate that head-fixed mice can be trained to show the key features of
      timing behavior within a few sessions. Single-trial analysis of licking behavior 
      reveals stepping dynamics with variable onset times, which is responsible for the
      canonical Gaussian distribution of timing behavior. Moreover, the duration of
      licking bouts decreased as mice became sated, showing a strong motivational
      modulation of licking bout initiation and termination. Using optogenetics, we
      examined the role of the basal ganglia output in interval timing. We stimulated a
      pathway important for licking behavior, the GABAergic output projections from the
      substantia nigra pars reticulata to the deep layers of the superior colliculus.
      We found that stimulation of this pathway not only cancelled licking but also
      delayed the initiation of anticipatory licking for the next interval in a
      frequency-dependent manner. By combining quantitative behavioral analysis with
      optogenetics in the head-fixed setup, we established a new approach for studying 
      the neural basis of interval timing.

AB  - Virtually all plastid (chloroplast) genomes are circular double-stranded DNA
      molecules, typically between 100 and 200 kb in size and encoding circa 80-250
      genes. Exceptions to this universal plastid genome architecture are very few and 
      include the dinoflagellates, where genes are located on DNA minicircles. Here we 
      report on the highly deviant chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae,
      which is entirely fragmented into hairpin chromosomes. Short- and long-read
      high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that the chloroplast genes
      of Boodlea composita are encoded on 1- to 7-kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally 
      high GC content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two
      protein-coding genes and conserved non-coding regions putatively involved in
      replication and/or expression. We propose that these contigs correspond to linear
      single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin
      chromosomes. The Boodlea chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their
      corresponding orthologs, and display an alternative genetic code. The origin of
      this highly deviant chloroplast genome most likely occurred before the emergence 
      of the Cladophorales, and coincided with an elevated transfer of chloroplast
      genes to the nucleus. A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA
      molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes, and highlights unexpected variation 
      in plastid genome architecture.

AB  - The theta rhythm-a slow (6-12 Hz) oscillatory component of the local field
      potential-plays a critical role in spatial navigation and memory by coordinating 
      the activity of neuronal ensembles within the medial temporal lobe (MTL).
      Although theta has been extensively studied in freely moving rodents, its
      presence in humans has been elusive and primarily investigated in stationary
      subjects. Here we used a unique clinical opportunity to examine theta within the 
      human MTL during untethered, real-world ambulatory movement. We recorded
      intracranial electroencephalographic activity from participants chronically
      implanted with the wireless NeuroPace responsive neurostimulator (RNS) and
      tracked their motion with sub-millimeter precision. Our data revealed that
      movement-related theta oscillations indeed exist in humans, such that theta power
      is significantly higher during movement than immobility. Unlike in rodents,
      however, theta occurs in short bouts, with average durations of approximately 400
      ms, which are more prevalent during fast versus slow movements. In a rare
      opportunity to study a congenitally blind participant, we found that both the
      prevalence and duration of theta bouts were increased relative to the sighted
      participants. These results provide critical support for conserved
      neurobiological characteristics of theta oscillations during ambulatory spatial
      navigation, while highlighting some fundamental differences across species in
      these oscillations between humans and rodents.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that not only coordinates
      local and systemic immune responses [1, 2] but also regulates neuronal functions.
      Most prominently, glia-derived TNF-alpha has been shown to regulate homeostatic
      synaptic scaling [3-6], but TNF-alpha-null mice exhibited no apparent cognitive
      or emotional abnormalities. Instead, we found a TNF-alpha-dependent
      intergenerational effect, as mothers with a deficit in TNF-alpha programmed their
      offspring to exhibit low innate fear. Cross-fostering and conditional knockout
      experiments indicated that a TNF-alpha deficit in the maternal brain, rather than
      in the hematopoietic system, and during gestation was responsible for the
      low-fear offspring phenotype. The level of innate fear governs the balance
      between exploration/foraging and avoidance of predators and is thus fundamentally
      important in adaptation, fitness, and survival [7]. Because maternal exercise and
      activity are known to reduce both brain TNF-alpha [8] and offspring innate fear
      [9], whereas maternal stress has been reported to increase brain TNF-alpha [10]
      and offspring fear and anxiety [11, 12], maternal brain TNF-alpha may report
      environmental conditions to promote offspring behavioral adaptation to their
      anticipated postnatal environment.

AB  - The vast majority of bacterial diversity lies within phylum-level lineages called
      "candidate phyla," which lack isolated representatives and are poorly understood.
      These bacteria are surprisingly abundant in the oral cavity of marine mammals. We
      employed a genome-resolved metagenomic approach to recover and characterize
      genomes and functional potential from microbes in the oral gingival sulcus of two
      bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We detected organisms from 24 known
      bacterial phyla and one archaeal phylum. We also recovered genomes from two
      deep-branching, previously uncharacterized phylum-level lineages (here named
      "Candidatus Delphibacteria" and "Candidatus Fertabacteria"). The Delphibacteria
      lineage is found in both managed and wild dolphins; its metabolic profile
      suggests a capacity for denitrification and a possible role in dolphin health. We
      uncovered a rich diversity of predicted Cas9 proteins, including the two longest 
      predicted Cas9 proteins to date. Notably, we identified the first type II
      CRISPR-Cas systems encoded by members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Using
      their spacer sequences, we subsequently identified and assembled a complete
      Saccharibacteria phage genome. These findings underscore the immense microbial
      diversity and functional potential that await discovery in previously unexplored 
      environments.

AB  - Among the different types of cytoskeletal components, microtubules arguably
      accumulate the greatest diversity of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
      Acetylation of lysine 40 (K40) of alpha-tubulin has received particular attention
      because it is the only tubulin PTM to be found in the lumen of microtubules: most
      other tubulin PTMs are found at the outer surface of the microtubule. As a
      consequence, the enzyme catalyzing K40 acetylation needs to penetrate the narrow 
      microtubule lumen to find its substrate. Acetylated microtubules have been
      considered to be stable, long-lived microtubules; however, until recently, there 
      was little information about whether the longevity of these microtubules is the
      cause or the consequence of acetylation. Current advances suggest that this PTM
      helps the microtubule lattice to cope with mechanical stress, thus facilitating
      microtubule self-repair. These observations now shed new light on the structural 
      integrity of microtubules, as well as on the mechanisms and biological functions 
      of tubulin acetylation. Here, we discuss recent insights into how acetylation is 
      generated in the lumen of microtubules, and how this 'hidden' PTM can control the
      properties and functions of microtubules.

AB  - Efficient targeting of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the endoplasmic
      reticulum to the inner nuclear membrane depends on nucleotide hydrolysis. A new
      study shows that this dependence reflects critical actions of the atlastin family
      of GTPases in maintaining the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum network.

AB  - Greater access to social information is a proposed benefit of group living [1].
      However, individuals vary in the quantity and quality of information they provide
      [2], and prior knowledge about signaller reliability is likely important when
      receivers decide how to respond [3]. While dispersal causes regular changes in
      group membership [4], no experimental work has investigated social-information
      provision and use in this context. We studied sentinel behaviour following
      immigration in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula)
      [5]; sentinels (raised guards) use various vocalisations to provide social
      information [5,6]. Recent immigrants acted as sentinels rarely and significantly 
      less often than residents, limiting their role as social-information providers.
      Even when recent immigrants acted as social-information providers, foragers
      responded to them less than they did to residents. Several months after arrival, 
      immigrants had increased sentinel contributions, and foragers no longer responded
      differently to sentinel activity by former immigrants and residents. Our results 
      raise questions about the assumed social-information benefits associated with
      increased group size.

AB  - Considerable research in cognitive science, neuroscience, and developmental
      science has revealed that the temporal, spatial, and numerical features of a

      the prominent hypothesis that time, space, and number are processed by a 'common 
      magnitude system', which represents these dimensions via the same unit of
      magnitude [3,4]. According to current theorizing, the parietal cortex mediates
      this system [4]. To test the species generality and neuroanatomical foundations
      of this hypothesis, we asked whether space-time interactions can be observed in
      birds. Unlike mammals, birds lack a cortex [5,6]; rather, they possess a
      neuron-dense pallium that is organized in clusters, in contrast to the laminar
      structure of the mammalian cortex [7]. Despite these striking neuroanatomical
      disparities, we observed reliable space-time interactions in pigeons. Our
      findings suggest that common magnitude systems are more widespread among animals 
      than previously believed and need not be cortically dependent in all species.

AB  - Overfishing and ocean warming are drastically altering the community composition 
      and size structure of marine ecosystems, eliminating large bodied species [1].
      Against a backdrop of such environmental change, the heaviest of all bony fish,
      the ocean sunfish (Mola mola), seems an improbable survivor. Indeed this indolent
      giant is killed globally as bycatch, and is listed as 'Vulnerable'[2]. We
      undertook the most extensive aerial surveys of sunfish ever conducted and found
      surprisingly high abundances off the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Western
      Europe. With up to 475 individuals per 100 km(2), these figures are one order of 
      magnitude higher than abundance estimates for other areas [3-5]. Using
      bioenergetic modelling, we estimate that each sunfish requires 71 kg day(-1) of
      jellyfish, a biomass intake more than an order of magnitude greater than
      predicted for a similarly sized teleost. Scaled up to the population level, this 
      equates to a remarkable 20,774 tonnes day(-1) of predated jellyfish across our
      study area in summer. Sunfish abundance may be facilitated by overfishing and
      ocean warming, which together cause reduced predation of sunfish by sharks and
      elevated jellyfish biomass. Our combined survey and bioenergetic data provide the
      first-ever estimate of spatialized ocean sunfish daily food requirements, and
      stress the importance of this species as a global indicator for the 'rise of
      slime'. This hypothesis posits that, in an overfished world ocean exposed to
      global warming, gelatinous zooplankton should flourish, to the detriment of other
      mesotrophic species such as small pelagic fish, causing irreversible trophic
      cascades as well as a series of other environmental and economic issues.

AB  - Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a neuromodulatory technique in which
      low voltage constant or alternating currents are applied to the human brain via
      scalp electrodes. The basic idea of tES is that the application of weak currents 
      can interact with neural processing, modify plasticity and entrain brain
      networks, and that this in turn can modify behaviour. The technique is now widely
      employed in basic and translational research, and increasingly is also used
      privately in sport, the military and recreation. The proposed capacity to augment
      recovery of brain function, by promoting learning and facilitating plasticity,
      has motivated a burgeoning number of clinical trials in a wide range of disorders
      of the nervous system.

AB  - Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes typically mate only once with one male in their
      lifetime, a behavior known as "monandry" [1]. This single mating event provisions
      the female with sufficient sperm to fertilize the >500 eggs she will produce
      during her approximately 4- to 6-week lifespan in the laboratory [2]. Successful 
      mating induces lifetime refractoriness to subsequent insemination by other males,
      enforcing the paternity of the first male [3-5]. Ae. aegypti mate in flight near 
      human hosts [6], and females become refractory to remating within seconds [1, 3, 
      4], suggesting the existence of a rapid mechanism to prevent female remating. In 
      this study, we implicate HP-I, an Aedes- and male-specific peptide transferred to
      females [7], and its cognate receptor in the female, NPYLR1 [8], in rapid
      enforcement of paternity. HP-I mutant males were ineffective in enforcing
      paternity when a second male was given access to the female within 1 hr. NPYLR1
      mutant females produced mixed paternity offspring at high frequency, indicating
      acceptance of multiple mates. Synthetic HP-I injected into wild-type, but not
      NPYLR1 mutant, virgins reduced successful matings. Asian tiger mosquito (Ae.
      albopictus) HP-I peptides potently activated Ae. aegypti NPYLR1. Invasive Ae.
      albopictus males are known to copulate with and effectively sterilize Ae. aegypti
      females by causing them to reject future mates [9]. Cross-species transfer of
      sperm and active seminal fluid proteins including HP-I may contribute to this
      phenomenon. This signaling system promotes rapid paternity enforcement within Ae.
      aegypti but may promote local extinction in areas where they compete with Ae.
      albopictus.

AB  - Some forms of associative learning require only a single experience to create a
      lasting memory [1, 2]. In contrast, perceptual learning often requires extensive 
      practice within a day for performance to improve across days [3, 4]. This
      suggests that the requisite practice for durable perceptual learning is
      integrated throughout each day. If the total amount of daily practice is the only
      important variable, then a practice break within a day should not disrupt
      across-day improvement. To test this idea, we trained human listeners on an
      auditory frequency-discrimination task over multiple days and compared the
      performance of those who engaged in a single continuous practice session each day
      [4] with those who were given a 30-min break halfway through each practice
      session. Continuous practice yielded significant perceptual learning [4]. In
      contrast, practice with a rest break led to no improvement, indicating that the
      integration process had decayed within 30 min. In a separate experiment, a 30-min
      practice break also disrupted durable learning on a non-native phonetic
      classification task. These results suggest that practice trials are integrated up
      to a learning threshold within a transient memory store before they are sent en
      masse into a memory that lasts across days. Thus, the oft cited benefits of
      distributed over massed training [5, 6] may arise from different mechanisms
      depending on whether the breaks occur before or after a learning threshold has
      been reached. Trial integration could serve as an early gatekeeper to plasticity,
      helping to ensure that longer-lasting changes are only made when deemed
      worthwhile.

AB  - Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, is a bacterium associated with
      wild rodents and their fleas. Historically it was responsible for three
      pandemics: the Plague of Justinian in the 6(th) century AD, which persisted until
      the 8(th) century [1]; the renowned Black Death of the 14(th) century [2, 3],
      with recurrent outbreaks until the 18(th) century [4]; and the most recent 19(th)
      century pandemic, in which Y. pestis spread worldwide [5] and became endemic in
      several regions [6]. The discovery of molecular signatures of Y. pestis in
      prehistoric Eurasian individuals and two genomes from Southern Siberia suggest
      that Y. pestis caused some form of disease in humans prior to the first
      historically documented pandemic [7]. Here, we present six new European Y. pestis
      genomes spanning the Late Neolithic to the Bronze Age (LNBA; 4,800 to 3,700
      calibrated years before present). This time period is characterized by major
      transformative cultural and social changes that led to cross-European networks of
      contact and exchange [8, 9]. We show that all known LNBA strains form a single
      putatively extinct clade in the Y. pestis phylogeny. Interpreting our data within
      the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence that suggests an increase in
      human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the early
      spread of Y. pestis: the pathogen may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia
      following an expansion of people from the steppe, persisted within Europe until
      the mid-Bronze Age, and moved back toward Central Eurasia in parallel with human 
      populations.

AB  - The terminal stages of neuronal degeneration and death in neurodegenerative
      diseases remain elusive. Autophagy is an essential catabolic process frequently
      failing in neurodegeneration. Selective autophagy routes have recently emerged,
      including nucleophagy, defined as degradation of nuclear components by autophagy.
      Here, we show that, in a mouse model for the polyglutamine disease
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), progressive acquirement of an
      ataxic phenotype is linked to severe cerebellar cellular pathology, characterized
      by nuclear degeneration through nucleophagy-based LaminB1 degradation and
      excretion. We find that canonical autophagy is stalled in DRPLA mice and in human
      fibroblasts from patients of DRPLA. This is evidenced by accumulation of p62 and 
      downregulation of LC3-I/II conversion as well as reduced Tfeb expression. Chronic
      autophagy blockage in several conditions, including DRPLA and Vici syndrome, an
      early-onset autolysosomal pathology, leads to the activation of alternative
      clearance pathways including Golgi membrane-associated and nucleophagy-based
      LaminB1 degradation and excretion. The combination of these alternative pathways 
      and canonical autophagy blockade, results in dramatic nuclear pathology with
      disruption of the nuclear organization, bringing about terminal cell atrophy and 
      degeneration. Thus, our findings identify a novel progressive mechanism for the
      terminal phases of neuronal cell degeneration and death in human
      neurodegenerative diseases and provide a link between autophagy block, activation
      of alternative pathways for degradation, and excretion of cellular components.

AB  - The mouse retina contains a single type of horizontal cell, a GABAergic
      interneuron that samples from all cone photoreceptors within reach and modulates 
      their glutamatergic output via parallel feedback mechanisms. Because horizontal
      cells form an electrically coupled network, they have been implicated in global
      signal processing, such as large-scale contrast enhancement. Recently, it has
      been proposed that horizontal cells can also act locally at the level of
      individual cone photoreceptors. To test this possibility physiologically, we used
      two-photon microscopy to record light stimulus-evoked Ca(2+) signals in cone axon
      terminals and horizontal cell dendrites as well as glutamate release in the outer
      plexiform layer. By selectively stimulating the two mouse cone opsins with green 
      and UV light, we assessed whether signals from individual cones remain isolated
      within horizontal cell dendritic tips or whether they spread across the dendritic
      arbor. Consistent with the mouse's opsin expression gradient, we found that the
      Ca(2+) signals recorded from dendrites of dorsal horizontal cells were dominated 
      by M-opsin and those of ventral horizontal cells by S-opsin activation. The
      signals measured in neighboring horizontal cell dendritic tips varied markedly in
      their chromatic preference, arguing against global processing. Rather, our
      experimental data and results from biophysically realistic modeling support the
      idea that horizontal cells can process cone input locally, extending the
      classical view of horizontal cell function. Pharmacologically removing horizontal
      cells from the circuitry reduced the sensitivity of the cone signal to low
      frequencies, suggesting that local horizontal cell feedback shapes the temporal
      properties of cone output.

AB  - Biological predispositions in vocal learning have been proposed to underlie
      commonalities in vocal sequences, including for speech and birdsong, but cultural
      propagation could also account for such commonalities [1-4]. Songbirds such as
      the zebra finch learn the sequencing of their acoustic elements ("syllables")
      during development [5-8]. Zebra finches are not constrained to learn a specific
      sequence of syllables, but significant consistencies in the positioning and
      sequencing of syllables have been observed between individuals within populations
      and between populations [8-10]. To reveal biological predispositions in vocal
      sequence learning, we individually tutored juvenile zebra finches with randomized
      and unbiased sequences of syllables and analyzed the extent to which birds
      produced common sequences. In support of biological predispositions, birds
      tutored with randomized sequences produced songs with striking similarities.
      Birds preferentially started and ended their song sequence with particular
      syllables, consistently positioned shorter and higher frequency syllables in the 
      middle of their song, and sequenced their syllables such that pitch alternated
      across adjacent syllables. These patterns are reminiscent of those observed in
      normally tutored birds, suggesting that birds "creolize" aberrant sequence inputs
      to produce normal sequence outputs. Similar patterns were also observed for
      syllables that were not used for tutoring (i.e., unlearned syllables), suggesting
      that motor biases could contribute to sequence learning biases. Furthermore,
      zebra finches spontaneously produced acoustic patterns that are commonly observed
      in speech and music, suggesting that sensorimotor processes that are shared
      across a wide range of vertebrates could underlie these patterns in humans.

TI  - Homing Ants Get Confused When Nest Cues Are Also Route Cues.

AB  - The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis inhabits the salt pans of Tunisia. Individual
      ants leave the nest for foraging trips that can cover distances of more than
      1,500 m [1]. Homing ants use path integration [2, 3], but they also rely on
      visual [4] and olfactory [5] nest-defining cues to locate the nest entrance.
      However, nest cues can become ambiguous when they are ubiquitous in the
      environment. Here we show how ants behave during the nest search when the same
      cues occur at the nest and along the route. Homing ants focused their search
      narrowly around a visual or olfactory cue that in training they had experienced
      only at the nest. However, when ants were trained to the same cue not only at the
      nest but also repeatedly along the foraging route, they later exhibited a less
      focused search around the cue. This uncertainty was eliminated when ants had a
      composite cue at the nest that consisted of two components, one unique to the
      nest and another that also occurred along the route. Here, the ants focused their
      search on that part of the binary blend that was presented only at the nest and
      ignored the other, ubiquitous component. Ants thus not only seem to be able to
      pinpoint their nest by following learned visual and olfactory cues, but also take
      into account which cues uniquely specify the nest and which, due to their
      ubiquity, are less informative and so less reliable. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - To coordinate epithelial architecture with proliferation, cell polarity proteins 
      undergo extensive remodeling during cell division [1-3]. A dramatic example of
      polarity remodeling occurs in proliferative basal cells of mammalian epidermis
      whereupon cell division, transmembrane planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins are
      removed from the cell surface via bulk endocytosis [4]. PCP proteins form
      intercellular complexes, linked by Celsr1-mediated homophilic adhesion, that
      coordinate polarity non-autonomously between cells [5, 6]. Thus, the mitotic
      reorganization of PCP proteins must alter not only proteins intrinsic to the
      dividing cell but also their interacting partners on neighboring cells. Here, we 
      show that intercellular Celsr1 complexes that connect dividing cells with their
      neighbors remain intact during mitotic internalization, resulting in an uptake of
      Celsr1 protein from interphase neighbors. Trans-internalized Celsr1 carries with 
      it additional core PCP proteins, including the posteriorly enriched Fz6 and
      anteriorly enriched Vangl2. Cadherin-mediated homophilic adhesion is necessary
      for trans-endocytosis, and adhesive junctional PCP complexes appear to be
      destined for degradation upon internalization. Surprisingly, whereas Fz6 and
      Vangl2 both internalize in trans, Vangl2 proteins intrinsic to the dividing cell 
      remain associated with the plasma membrane. Persistent Vangl2 stabilizes Celsr1
      and impedes its internalization, suggesting that dissociation of Vangl2 from
      Celsr1 is a prerequisite for Celsr1 endocytosis. These results demonstrate an
      unexpected transfer of PCP complexes between neighbors and suggest that the
      Vangl2 population that persists at the membrane during cell division could serve 
      as an internal cue for establishing PCP in new daughter cells.

TI  - Fbxl4 Serves as a Clock Output Molecule that Regulates Sleep through Promotion of
      Rhythmic Degradation of the GABAA Receptor.

AB  - The timing of sleep is tightly governed by the circadian clock, which contains a 
      negative transcriptional feedback loop and synchronizes the physiology and
      behavior of most animals to daily environmental oscillations. However, how the
      circadian clock determines the timing of sleep is largely unclear. In vertebrates
      and invertebrates, the status of sleep and wakefulness is modulated by the
      electrical activity of pacemaker neurons that are circadian regulated and
      suppressed by inhibitory GABAergic inputs. Here, we showed that Drosophila GABAA 
      receptors undergo rhythmic degradation in arousal-promoting large ventral lateral
      neurons (lLNvs) and their expression level in lLNvs displays a daily oscillation.
      We also demonstrated that the E3 ligase Fbxl4 promotes GABAA receptor
      ubiquitination and degradation and revealed that the transcription of fbxl4 in
      lLNvs is CLOCK dependent. Finally, we demonstrated that Fbxl4 regulates the
      timing of sleep through rhythmically reducing GABA sensitivity to modulate the
      excitability of lLNvs. Our study uncovered a critical molecular linkage between
      the circadian clock and the electrical activity of pacemaker neurons and
      demonstrated that CLOCK-dependent Fbxl4 expression rhythmically downregulates
      GABAA receptor level to increase the activity of pacemaker neurons and promote
      wakefulness.

AB  - The origin of eukaryotic cells represents a key transition in cellular evolution 
      and is closely tied to outstanding questions about mitochondrial endosymbiosis
      [1, 2]. For example, gene-rich mitochondrial genomes are thought to be indicative
      of an ancient divergence, but this relies on unexamined assumptions about
      endosymbiont-to-host gene transfer [3-5]. Here, we characterize Ancoracysta
      twista, a new predatory flagellate that is not closely related to any known
      lineage in 201-protein phylogenomic trees and has a unique morphology, including 
      a novel type of extrusome (ancoracyst). The Ancoracysta mitochondrion has a
      gene-rich genome with a coding capacity exceeding that of all other eukaryotes
      except the distantly related jakobids and Diphylleia, and it uniquely possesses
      heterologous, nucleus-, and mitochondrion-encoded cytochrome c maturase systems. 
      To comprehensively examine mitochondrial genome reduction, we also assembled
      mitochondrial genomes from picozoans and colponemids and re-annotated existing
      mitochondrial genomes using hidden Markov model gene profiles. This revealed over
      a dozen previously overlooked mitochondrial genes at the level of eukaryotic
      supergroups. Analysis of trends over evolutionary time demonstrates that gene
      transfer to the nucleus was non-linear, that it occurred in waves of exponential 
      decrease, and that much of it took place comparatively early, massively
      independently, and with lineage-specific rates. This process has led to
      differential gene retention, suggesting that gene-rich mitochondrial genomes are 
      not a product of their early divergence. Parallel transfer of mitochondrial genes
      and their functional replacement by new nuclear factors are important in models
      for the origin of eukaryotes, especially as major gaps in our knowledge of
      eukaryotic diversity at the deepest level remain unfilled.

AB  - Regulation of chromatin structure is critical for brain development and function.
      However, the involvement of chromatin dynamics in neurodegeneration is less well 
      understood. Here we find, launching from Drosophila models of amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, that TDP-43 impairs the induction of
      multiple key stress genes required to protect from disease by reducing the
      recruitment of the chromatin remodeler Chd1 to chromatin. Chd1 depletion robustly
      enhances TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration and promotes the formation of stress
      granules. Conversely, upregulation of Chd1 restores nucleosomal dynamics,
      promotes normal induction of protective stress genes, and rescues stress
      sensitivity of TDP-43-expressing animals. TDP-43-mediated impairments are
      conserved in mammalian cells, and, importantly, the human ortholog CHD2
      physically interacts with TDP-43 and is strikingly reduced in level in temporal
      cortex of human patient tissue. These findings indicate that TDP-43-mediated
      neurodegeneration causes impaired chromatin dynamics that prevents appropriate
      expression of protective genes through compromised function of the chromatin
      remodeler Chd1/CHD2. Enhancing chromatin dynamics may be a treatment approach to 
      amyotrophic lateral scleorosis (ALS)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

AB  - Many behavioral measures of visual perception fluctuate continually in a rhythmic
      manner, reflecting the influence of endogenous brain oscillations, particularly
      theta ( approximately 4-7 Hz) and alpha ( approximately 8-12 Hz) rhythms [1-3].
      However, it is unclear whether these oscillations are unique to vision or whether
      auditory performance also oscillates [4, 5]. Several studies report no
      oscillatory modulation in audition [6, 7], while those with positive findings
      suffer from confounds relating to neural entrainment [8-10]. Here, we used a
      bilateral pitch-identification task to investigate rhythmic fluctuations in
      auditory performance separately for the two ears and applied signal detection
      theory (SDT) to test for oscillations of both sensitivity and criterion (changes 
      in decision boundary) [11, 12]. Using uncorrelated dichotic white noise to induce
      a phase reset of oscillations, we demonstrate that, as with vision, both auditory
      sensitivity and criterion showed strong oscillations over time, at different
      frequencies: approximately 6 Hz (theta range) for sensitivity and approximately 8
      Hz (low alpha range) for criterion, implying distinct underlying sampling
      mechanisms [13]. The modulation in sensitivity in left and right ears was in
      antiphase, suggestive of attention-like mechanisms sampling alternatively from
      the two ears.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a highly prevalent reading disorder affecting about
      5%-10% of children [1]. It is characterized by slow and/or inaccurate word
      recognition skills as well as by poor spelling and decoding abilities [2]. Partly
      due to technical challenges with investigating subcortical sensory structures,
      current research on dyslexia in humans by and large focuses on the cerebral
      cortex [3-7]. These studies found that dyslexia is typically associated with
      functional and structural alterations of a distributed left-hemispheric cerebral 
      cortex network (e.g., [8, 9]). However, findings from animal models and post
      mortem studies in humans suggest that dyslexia might also be associated with
      structural alterations in subcortical sensory pathways [10-14] (reviewed in [7]).
      Whether these alterations also exist in dyslexia in vivo and how they relate to
      dyslexia symptoms is currently unknown. Here, we used ultra-high-resolution
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and probabilistic
      tractography to investigate the structural connections of the visual sensory
      pathway in dyslexia in vivo. We discovered that individuals with dyslexia have
      reduced structural connections in the direct pathway between the left visual
      thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]) and left middle temporal area V5/MT, 
      but not between the left LGN and left primary visual cortex. In addition, left
      V5/MT-LGN connectivity strength correlated with rapid naming abilities-a key
      deficit in dyslexia [15]. These findings provide the first evidence of specific
      structural alterations in the connections between the sensory thalamus and cortex
      in developmental dyslexia. The results challenge current standard models and
      provide novel evidence for the importance of cortico-thalamic interactions in
      explaining dyslexia.

AB  - Certain genes show more rapid reactivation for several generations following
      repression, a conserved phenomenon called epigenetic transcriptional memory.
      Following previous growth in galactose, GAL gene transcriptional memory confers a
      strong fitness benefit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapting to growth in
      galactose for up to 8 generations. A genetic screen for mutants defective for GAL
      gene memory revealed new insights into the molecular mechanism, adaptive
      consequences, and evolutionary history of memory. A point mutation in the Gal1
      co-activator that disrupts the interaction with the Gal80 inhibitor specifically 
      and completely disrupted memory. This mutation confirms that cytoplasmically
      inherited Gal1 produced during previous growth in galactose directly interferes
      with Gal80 repression to promote faster induction of GAL genes. This mitotically 
      heritable mode of regulation is recently evolved; in a diverged Saccharomyces
      species, GAL genes show constitutively faster activation due to genetically
      encoded basal expression of Gal1. Thus, recently diverged species utilize either 
      epigenetic or genetic strategies to regulate the same molecular mechanism. The
      screen also revealed that the central domain of the Gal4 transcription factor
      both regulates the stochasticity of GAL gene expression and potentiates stronger 
      GAL gene activation in the presence of Gal1. The central domain is critical for
      GAL gene transcriptional memory; Gal4 lacking the central domain fails to
      potentiate GAL gene expression and is unresponsive to previous Gal1 expression.

AB  - Mutually beneficial interactions between species (mutualisms) shaped the
      evolution of eukaryotes and remain critical to the survival of species globally
      [1, 2]. Theory predicts that hosts should pass mutualist symbionts to their
      offspring (vertical transmission) [3-8]. However, offspring acquire symbionts
      from the environment in a surprising number of species (horizontal acquisition)
      [9-12]. A classic example of this paradox is the reef-building corals, in which
      71% of species horizontally acquire algal endosymbionts [9]. An untested
      hypothesis explaining this paradox suggests that horizontal acquisition allows
      offspring to avoid symbiont-induced harm early in life. We reconstructed the
      evolution of symbiont transmission across 252 coral species and detected
      evolutionary transitions consistent with costs of vertical transmission among
      broadcast spawners, whose eggs tend to be positively buoyant and aggregate at the
      sea surface. Broadcasters with vertical transmission produce eggs with traits
      that favor reduced buoyancy (less wax ester lipid) and rapid development to the
      swimming stage (small egg size), both of which decrease the amount of time
      offspring spend at the sea surface. Wax ester provisioning decreased after
      vertically transmitting species evolved brooding from broadcasting, indicating
      that reduced buoyancy evolves only when offspring bear symbionts. We conclude
      that horizontal acquisition protects offspring from damage caused by high light
      and temperatures near the sea surface while providing benefits from enhanced
      fertilization and outcrossing. These findings help explain why modes of symbiont 
      transmission and reproduction are strongly associated in corals and highlight
      benefits of delaying mutualist partnerships, offering an additional hypothesis
      for the pervasiveness of this theoretically paradoxical strategy.

AB  - The macromolecular kinetochore functions to generate interactions between
      chromosomal DNA and spindle microtubules [1]. To facilitate chromosome movement
      and segregation, kinetochores must maintain associations with both growing and
      shrinking microtubule ends. It is critical to define the proteins and their
      properties that allow kinetochores to associate with dynamic microtubules. The
      kinetochore-localized human Ska1 complex binds to microtubules and tracks with
      depolymerizing microtubule ends [2]. We now demonstrate that the Ska1 complex
      also autonomously tracks with growing microtubule ends in vitro, a key property
      that would allow this complex to act at kinetochores to mediate persistent
      associations with dynamic microtubules. To define the basis for Ska1 complex
      interactions with dynamic microtubules, we investigated the tubulin-binding
      properties of the Ska1 microtubule binding domain. In addition to binding to the 
      microtubule lattice and dolastatin-induced protofilament-like structures, we
      demonstrate that the Ska1 microtubule binding domain can associate with soluble
      tubulin heterodimers and promote assembly of oligomeric ring-like tubulin
      structures. We generated mutations on distinct surfaces of the Ska1 microtubule
      binding domain that disrupt binding to soluble tubulin but do not prevent
      microtubule binding. These mutants display compromised microtubule tracking
      activity in vitro and result in defective chromosome alignment and mitotic
      progression in cells using a CRISPR/Cas9-based replacement assay. Our work
      supports a model in which multiple surfaces of Ska1 interact with diverse tubulin
      substrates to associate with dynamic microtubule polymers and facilitate optimal 
      chromosome segregation.

AB  - Navigation can be achieved using different strategies from simple beaconing to
      complex map-based movement [1-4]. Bats display remarkable navigation
      capabilities, ranging from nightly commutes of several kilometers and up to
      seasonal migrations over thousands of kilometers [5]. Many bats have been
      suggested to fly along fixed routes termed "flyways," when flying from their
      roost to their foraging sites [6]. Flyways commonly stretch along linear
      landscape elements such as tree lines, hedges, or rivers [7]. When flying along a
      flyway, bats must estimate the distance they have traveled in order to determine 
      when to turn. This can be especially challenging when moving along a repetitive
      landscape. Some bats, like Kuhl's pipistrelles, which we studied here, have
      limited vision [8] and were suggested to rely on bio-sonar for navigation. These 
      bats could therefore estimate distance using three main sensory-navigation
      strategies, all of which we have examined: acoustic flow, acoustic landmarks, or 
      path integration. We trained bats to fly along a linear flyway and land on a
      platform. We then tested their behavior when the platform was removed under
      different manipulations, including changing the acoustic flow, moving the start
      point, and adding wind. We found that bats do not require acoustic flow, which
      was hypothesized to be important for their navigation [9-15], and that they can
      perform the task without landmarks. Our results suggest that Kuhl's pipistrelles 
      use internal self-motion cues-also known as path integration-rather than external
      information to estimate flight distance for at least dozens of meters when
      navigating along linear flyways.

      example is the rectangular arena reorientation task, where subjects commonly
      confuse opposite but geometrically identical corners [1]. Until recently, little 
      was known about how environmental geometry shapes spatial representations in a
      neurobehavioral context [2] (although see [3]). In the present study, we asked:
      Under what circumstances does the internal cognitive map predict behavior? And
      when does it fail to do so? To this end, we developed a variant of the classical 
      reorientation task that allows for investigation of temporal dynamics of
      reorientation. We recorded head-direction (HD) cells and grid cells in the medial
      entorhinal cortex (MEC) of rats before, during, and after performing the task.
      MEC cells showed a bimodal response of being either aligned or rotated, relative 
      to the free-foraging open-field sessions. Alignment was remarkably stable between
      disorientations and indicative of corner choice as a function of current and past
      alignment of spatial representations. Accordingly, when the cells showed
      consistent and properly aligned readout across multiple trials, behavioral
      choices were better predicted by HD and grid cell readout, with a probability of 
      more than 70%. This was not the case when the cells did not show a stable
      consistent readout. Our findings indicate that entorhinal spatial representations
      predict corner choice, contingent on the stability and reliability of their
      readout. This work sets the stage for further studies on the link between the
      reliability of the neuronal signal and behavior, with implications for many brain
      systems in many organisms.

AB  - Considerable advances in our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of
      rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep have occurred over the past decade. Much of this
      progress can be attributed to the development of new neuroscience tools that have
      enabled high-precision interrogation of brain circuitry linked with REM sleep
      control, in turn revealing how REM sleep mechanisms themselves impact processes
      such as sensorimotor function. This review is intended to update the general
      scientific community about the recent mechanistic, functional and conceptual
      developments in our current understanding of REM sleep biology and pathobiology. 
      Specifically, this review outlines the historical origins of the discovery of REM
      sleep, the diversity of REM sleep expression across and within species, the
      potential functions of REM sleep (e.g., memory consolidation), the neural
      circuits that control REM sleep, and how dysfunction of REM sleep mechanisms
      underlie debilitating sleep disorders such as REM sleep behaviour disorder and
      narcolepsy.

AB  - Transmembrane proteins are sorted from endosomes to avoid lysosomal degradation. 
      A recent study has identified a new multimeric complex called retriever that is
      essential for recycling numerous cell-surface cargoes from endosomes and is
      structurally and functionally related to the well-characterised retromer complex.

AB  - Organs are made from cells whose individual growth rates differ, yet the final
      shape of organs is highly robust. A new mechanics-based system is proposed to
      physically restrain cells that grow more than their neighbours, buffering their
      influence on organ size and shape.

      and co-workers propose that acquisition of viral sequences in the host genome
      gives rise to anti-sense, anti-viral piRNAs. Such sequences can be regarded as
      both a genomic archive of past infections and as an armour of potential heritable
      memory.

AB  - Electrical synapses are emerging as complex structures, consisting of gap
      junction-forming connexin proteins and also multiple scaffolding and regulatory
      protein components, which were assumed to be symmetrically organized across these
      synapses; however, new findings reveal their synaptic asymmetry.

AB  - In their comment, Vinken and Vogels [1] take issue with our claim [2] that "IT
      neurons encode long-term, latent probabilistic information about stimulus
      occurrence". They offer a biologically plausible model of our findings, which
      they argue is based on neuronal fatigue. However, like our account, their model
      includes latent variables that are modulated slowly with stimulus probability;
      models without such latent processes, such as those based on temporally local
      fatigue effects, cannot explain our findings. Although we share their desire for 
      more clarity about the mechanisms underlying visual expectation, and appreciate
      their thoughtful critique, we argue here that their comment mostly restates our
      findings with a more complex model and alternative terminology.

AB  - In predictive coding theory, the brain is conceptualized as a prediction machine 
      that constantly constructs and updates expectations of the sensory environment
      [1]. In the context of this theory, Bell et al.[2] recently studied the effect of
      the probability of task-relevant stimuli on the activity of macaque inferior
      temporal (IT) neurons and observed a reduced population response to expected
      faces in face-selective neurons. They concluded that "IT neurons encode
      long-term, latent probabilistic information about stimulus occurrence",
      supporting predictive coding. They manipulated expectation by the frequency of
      face versus fruit stimuli in blocks of trials. With such a design, stimulus
      repetition is confounded with expectation. As previous studies showed that IT
      neurons decrease their response with repetition [3], such adaptation (or
      repetition suppression), instead of expectation suppression as assumed by the
      authors, could explain their effects. The authors attempted to control for this
      alternative interpretation with a multiple regression approach. Here we show by
      using simulation that adaptation can still masquerade as expectation effects
      reported in [2]. Further, the results from the regression model used for most
      analyses cannot be trusted, because the model is not uniquely defined.

AB  - The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti forms aerial swarms that serve as mating 
      aggregations [1]. Despite lacking the remarkable collective order of other animal
      ensembles, such as fish and birds [2], the kinematic properties of these swarms
      bear the hallmarks of local interaction and global cohesion [3,4]. However, the
      mechanisms responsible for collective behaviour in mosquitoes are not well
      understood. Mosquitoes use their antennae as hearing organs to locate and
      interact with one another via the frequencies of sounds generated by their
      beating wings [5]. Acoustic detection and recognition are known to mediate copula
      formation in opposite-sex pairs [6], but have not been investigated in larger
      groups. By recording the flight tones of multiple, tethered, male Ae. aegypti, we
      test the hypothesis that acoustic signalling is a determinant of swarm morphology
      and present the first compelling evidence that flight tone interactions between
      males drive observed group coherence in the frequency domain. We find that group 
      size critically affects collective and individual acoustic traits: cohesive
      acoustic behaviours emerge in groups of more than six male mosquitoes, occurring 
      to a greater degree than predicted in the absence of interaction. Importantly,
      acoustic interactions between multiple males differ from those reported
      previously for same-sex pairs [7,8]. Our findings enable future research
      targeting key behavioural and reproductive aspects of the biology of mosquitoes
      of epidemiological importance.

AB  - Lateralized behaviors benefit individuals by increasing task efficiency in
      foraging and anti-predator behaviors [1-4]. The conventional lateralization
      paradigm suggests individuals are left or right lateralized, although the
      direction of this laterality can vary for different tasks (e.g. foraging or
      predator inspection/avoidance). By fitting tri-axial movement sensors to blue
      whales (Balaenoptera musculus), and by recording the direction and size of their 
      rolls during lunge feeding events, we show how these animals differ from such a
      paradigm. The strength and direction of individuals' lateralization were related 
      to where and how the whales were feeding in the water column. Smaller rolls
      (</=180 degrees ) predominantly occurred at depth (>70 m), with whales being more
      likely to rotate clockwise around their longest axis (right lateralized). Larger 
      rolls (>180 degrees ), conversely, occurred more often at shallower depths (<70
      m) and were more likely to be performed anti-clockwise (left lateralized). More
      acrobatic rolls are typically used to target small, less dense krill patches near
      the water's surface [5,6], and we posit that the specialization of lateralized
      feeding strategies may enhance foraging efficiency in environments with
      heterogeneous prey distributions.

AB  - What is a habit? One problem with the concept of habit has been that virtually
      everyone has their own ideas of what is meant by such a term. Whilst not
      eschewing folk psychology, it is useful to re-examine dictionary definitions of
      'habit'. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines habit as "a settled or regular 
      tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up" and also "an
      automatic reaction to a specific situation". The latter, reassuringly, is not too
      far from what has come to be known as stimulus-response theory.

      Formation.

AB  - The basement membrane (BM) is a thin layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) beneath 
      nearly all epithelial cell types that is critical for cellular and tissue
      function. It is composed of numerous components conserved among all bilaterians
      [1]; however, it is unknown how all of these components are generated and
      subsequently constructed to form a fully mature BM in the living animal. Although
      BM formation is thought to simply involve a process of self-assembly [2], this
      concept suffers from a number of logistical issues when considering its
      construction in vivo. First, incorporation of BM components appears to be
      hierarchical [3-5], yet it is unclear whether their production during
      embryogenesis must also be regulated in a temporal fashion. Second, many BM
      proteins are produced not only by the cells residing on the BM but also by
      surrounding cell types [6-9], and it is unclear how large, possibly insoluble
      protein complexes [10] are delivered into the matrix. Here we exploit our ability
      to live image and genetically dissect de novo BM formation during Drosophila
      development. This reveals that there is a temporal hierarchy of BM protein
      production that is essential for proper component incorporation. Furthermore, we 
      show that BM components require secretion by migrating macrophages (hemocytes)
      during their developmental dispersal, which is critical for embryogenesis.
      Indeed, hemocyte migration is essential to deliver a subset of ECM components
      evenly throughout the embryo. This reveals that de novo BM construction requires 
      a combination of both production and distribution logistics allowing for the
      timely delivery of core components.

TI  - Event Boundaries Trigger Rapid Memory Reinstatement of the Prior Events to
      Promote Their Representation in Long-Term Memory.

AB  - Although everyday experiences unfold continuously over time, shifts in context,
      or event boundaries, can influence how those events come to be represented in
      memory [1-4]. Specifically, mnemonic binding across sequential representations is
      more challenging at context shifts, such that successful temporal associations
      are more likely to be formed within than across contexts [1, 2, 5-9]. However, in
      order to preserve a subjective sense of continuity, it is important that the
      memory system bridge temporally adjacent events, even if they occur in seemingly 
      distinct contexts. Here, we used pattern similarity analysis to scalp
      electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during a sequential learning task [2, 3]
      in humans and showed that the detection of event boundaries triggered a rapid
      memory reinstatement of the just-encoded sequence episode. Memory reactivation
      was detected rapidly ( approximately 200-800 ms from the onset of the event
      boundary) and was specific to context shifts that were preceded by an event
      sequence with episodic content. Memory reinstatement was not observed during the 
      sequential encoding of events within an episode, indicating that memory
      reactivation was induced specifically upon context shifts. Finally, the degree of
      neural similarity between neural responses elicited during sequence encoding and 
      at event boundaries correlated positively with participants' ability to later
      link across sequences of events, suggesting a critical role in binding temporally
      adjacent events in long-term memory. Current results shed light onto the neural
      mechanisms that promote episodic encoding not only for information within the
      event, but also, importantly, in the ability to link across events to create a
      memory representation of continuous experience.

AB  - Where one looks within their environment constrains one's visual experiences,
      directly affects cognitive, emotional, and social processing [1-4], influences
      learning opportunities [5], and ultimately shapes one's developmental path. While
      there is a high degree of similarity across individuals with regard to which
      features of a scene are fixated [6-8], large individual differences are also
      present, especially in disorders of development [9-13], and clarifying the
      origins of these differences is essential to understand the processes by which
      individuals develop within the complex environments in which they exist and
      interact. Toward this end, a recent paper [14] found that "social visual
      engagement"-namely, gaze to eyes and mouths of faces-is strongly influenced by
      genetic factors. However, whether genetic factors influence gaze to complex
      visual scenes more broadly, impacting how both social and non-social scene
      content are fixated, as well as general visual exploration strategies, has yet to
      be determined. Using a behavioral genetic approach and eye tracking data from a
      large sample of 11-year-old human twins (233 same-sex twin pairs; 51%
      monozygotic, 49% dizygotic), we demonstrate that genetic factors do indeed
      contribute strongly to eye movement patterns, influencing both one's general
      tendency for visual exploration of scene content, as well as the precise
      moment-to-moment spatiotemporal pattern of fixations during viewing of complex
      social and non-social scenes alike. This study adds to a now growing set of
      results that together illustrate how genetics may broadly influence the process
      by which individuals actively shape and create their own visual experiences.

AB  - A landmark of developmental biology is the production of reproducible shapes,
      through stereotyped morphogenetic events. At the cell level, growth is often
      highly heterogeneous, allowing shape diversity to arise. Yet, how can
      reproducible shapes emerge from such growth heterogeneity? Is growth
      heterogeneity filtered out? Here, we focus on rapidly growing trichome cells in
      the Arabidopsis sepal, a reproducible floral organ. We show via computational
      modeling that rapidly growing cells may distort organ shape. However, the
      cortical microtubule alignment along growth-derived maximal tensile stress in
      adjacent cells would mechanically isolate rapidly growing cells and limit their
      impact on organ shape. In vivo, we observed such microtubule response to stress
      and consistently found no significant effect of trichome number on sepal shape in
      wild-type and lines with trichome number defects. Conversely, modulating the
      microtubule response to stress in katanin and spiral2 mutant made sepal shape
      dependent on trichome number, suggesting that, while mechanical signals are
      propagated around rapidly growing cells, the resistance to stress in adjacent
      cells mechanically isolates rapidly growing cells, thus contributing to organ
      shape reproducibility.

AB  - In his book on sexual selection, Darwin [1] devoted equal space to non-vocal and 
      vocal communication in birds. Since then, vocal communication has become a model 
      for studies of neurobiology, learning, communication, evolution, and conservation
      [2, 3]. In contrast, non-vocal "instrumental music," as Darwin called it, has
      only recently become subject to sustained inquiry [4, 5]. In particular,
      outstanding work reveals how feathers, often highly modified, produce distinctive
      sounds [6-9], and suggests that these sounds have evolved at least 70 times, in
      many orders [10]. It remains to be shown, however, that such sounds are signals
      used in communication. Here we show that crested pigeons (Ochyphaps lophotes)
      signal alarm with specially modified wing feathers. We used video and
      feather-removal experiments to demonstrate that the highly modified 8(th) primary
      wing feather (P8) produces a distinct note during each downstroke. The sound
      changes with wingbeat frequency, so that birds fleeing danger produce wing sounds
      with a higher tempo. Critically, a playback experiment revealed that only if P8
      is present does the sound of escape flight signal danger. Our results therefore
      indicate, nearly 150 years after Darwin's book, that modified feathers can be
      used for non-vocal communication, and they reveal an intrinsically reliable alarm
      signal.

      Cicadas.

AB  - When a free-living bacterium transitions to a host-beneficial endosymbiotic
      lifestyle, it almost invariably loses a large fraction of its genome [1, 2]. The 
      resulting small genomes often become stable in size, structure, and coding
      capacity [3-5], as exemplified by Sulcia muelleri, a nutritional endosymbiont of 
      cicadas. Sulcia's partner endosymbiont, Hodgkinia cicadicola, similarly remains
      co-linear in some cicadas diverged by millions of years [6, 7]. But in the
      long-lived periodical cicada Magicicada tredecim, the Hodgkinia genome has split 
      into dozens of tiny, gene-sparse circles that sometimes reside in distinct
      Hodgkinia cells [8]. Previous data suggested that all other Magicicada species
      harbor complex Hodgkinia populations, but the timing, number of origins, and
      outcomes of the splitting process were unknown. Here, by sequencing Hodgkinia
      metagenomes from the remaining six Magicicada and two sister species, we show
      that each Magicicada species harbors Hodgkinia populations of at least 20 genomic
      circles. We find little synteny among the 256 Hodgkinia circles analyzed except
      between the most closely related cicada species. Gene phylogenies show multiple
      Hodgkinia lineages in the common ancestor of Magicicada and its closest known
      relatives but that most splitting has occurred within Magicicada and has given
      rise to highly variable Hodgkinia gene dosages among species. These data show
      that Hodgkinia genome degradation has proceeded down different paths in different
      Magicicada species and support a model of genomic degradation that is stochastic 
      in outcome and nonadaptive for the host. These patterns mirror the genomic
      instability seen in some mitochondria.

AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya, 
      and Zika virus. Understanding the mechanisms underlying mosquito immunity could
      provide new tools to control arbovirus spread. Insects exploit two different RNAi
      pathways to combat viral and transposon infection: short interfering RNAs
      (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) [1, 2]. Endogenous viral elements
      (EVEs) are sequences from non-retroviral viruses that are inserted into the
      mosquito genome and can act as templates for the production of piRNAs [3, 4].
      EVEs therefore represent a record of past infections and a reservoir of potential
      immune memory [5]. The large-scale organization of EVEs has been difficult to
      resolve with short-read sequencing because they tend to integrate into repetitive
      regions of the genome. To define the diversity, organization, and function of
      EVEs, we took advantage of the contiguity associated with long-read sequencing to
      generate a high-quality assembly of the Ae. aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line
      genome, an important and widely used model system. We show EVEs are acquired
      through recombination with specific classes of long terminal repeat (LTR)
      retrotransposons and organize into large loci (>50 kbp) characterized by high LTR
      density. These EVE-containing loci have increased density of piRNAs compared to
      similar regions without EVEs. Furthermore, we detected EVE-derived piRNAs
      consistent with a targeted processing of persistently infecting virus genomes. We
      propose that comparisons of EVEs across mosquito populations may explain
      differences in vector competence, and further study of the structure and function
      of these elements in the genome of mosquitoes may lead to epidemiological
      interventions.

AB  - Ciliary microtubules (MTs) are extensively decorated with post-translational
      modifications (PTMs), such as glutamylation of tubulin tails. PTMs and tubulin
      isotype diversity act as a "tubulin code" that regulates cytoskeletal stability
      and the activity of MT-associated proteins such as kinesins. We previously showed
      that, in C. elegans cilia, the deglutamylase CCPP-1 affects ciliary
      ultrastructure, localization of the TRP channel PKD-2 and the kinesin-3 KLP-6,
      and velocity of the kinesin-2 OSM-3/KIF17, whereas a cell-specific alpha-tubulin 
      isotype regulates ciliary ultrastructure, intraflagellar transport, and ciliary
      functions of extracellular vesicle (EV)-releasing neurons. Here we examine the
      role of PTMs and the tubulin code in the ciliary specialization of EV-releasing
      neurons using genetics, fluorescence microscopy, kymography, electron microscopy,
      and sensory behavioral assays. Although the C. elegans genome encodes five
      tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) glutamylases, only ttll-11 specifically
      regulates PKD-2 localization in EV-releasing neurons. In EV-releasing cephalic
      male (CEM) cilia, TTLL-11 and the deglutamylase CCPP-1 regulate remodeling of 9+0
      MT doublets into 18 singlet MTs. Balanced TTLL-11 and CCPP-1 activity fine-tunes 
      glutamylation to control the velocity of the kinesin-2 OSM-3/KIF17 and kinesin-3 
      KLP-6 without affecting the intraflagellar transport (IFT) kinesin-II. TTLL-11 is
      transported by ciliary motors. TTLL-11 and CCPP-1 are also required for the
      ciliary function of releasing bioactive EVs, and TTLL-11 is itself a novel EV
      cargo. Therefore, MT glutamylation, as part of the tubulin code, controls ciliary
      specialization, ciliary motor-based transport, and ciliary EV release in a living
      animal. We suggest that cell-specific control of MT glutamylation may be a
      conserved mechanism to specialize the form and function of cilia.

AB  - Profilin is an abundant actin monomer-binding protein with critical actin
      regulatory roles in vivo [1, 2]. However, profilin also influences microtubule
      dynamics in cells, which may be mediated in part through its interactions with
      formins that in turn bind microtubules [3, 4]. Specific residues on human
      profilin-1 (PFN1) are mutated in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) [5, 6]. However, the observation that some ALS-linked PFN1 mutants fail to 
      alter cellular actin organization or dynamics [5-8] or in vitro actin-monomer
      affinity [9] has been perplexing, given that profilin is best understood as an
      actin regulator. Here, we investigated direct effects of profilin on microtubule 
      dynamics and whether ALS-linked mutations in PFN1 disrupt such functions. We
      found that human, fly, and yeast profilin homologs all directly enhance
      microtubule growth rate by several-fold in vitro. Microtubule stimulatory effects
      were unaffected by mutations in the canonical actin- or poly-proline-binding
      sites of profilin. Instead, microtubule activities depended on specific surface
      residues on profilin mutated in ALS patients. Furthermore, microtubule effects
      were attenuated by increasing concentrations of actin monomers, suggesting
      competition between actin and microtubules for binding profilin. Consistent with 
      these biochemical observations, a 2-fold increase in the expression level of
      wild-type PFN1, but not the ALS-linked PFN1 mutants, increased microtubule growth
      rates in cells. Together, these results demonstrate that profilin directly
      enhances the growth rate of microtubules. They further suggest that ALS-linked
      mutations in PFN1 may perturb cellular microtubule dynamics and/or the
      coordination between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, leading to motor
      neuron degeneration.

AB  - Neuronal synaptic connections are either chemical or electrical, and these two
      types of synapses work together to dynamically define neural circuit function
      [1]. Although we know a great deal about the molecules that support chemical
      synapse formation and function, we know little about the macromolecular complexes
      that regulate electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are created by gap
      junction (GJ) channels that provide direct ionic communication between neurons
      [2]. Although they are often molecularly and functionally symmetric, recent work 
      has found that pre- and postsynaptic neurons can contribute different GJ-forming 
      proteins, creating molecularly asymmetric channels that are correlated with
      functional asymmetry at the synapse [3, 4]. Associated with the GJs are
      structures observed by electron microscopy termed the electrical synapse density 
      (ESD) [5]. The ESD has been suggested to be critical for the formation and
      function of the electrical synapse, yet the biochemical makeup of these
      structures is poorly understood. Here we find that electrical synapse formation
      in vivo requires an intracellular scaffold called Tight Junction Protein 1b
      (Tjp1b). Tjp1b is localized to the electrical synapse, where it is required for
      the stabilization of the GJs and for electrical synapse function. Strikingly, we 
      find that Tjp1b protein localizes and functions asymmetrically, exclusively on
      the postsynaptic side of the synapse. Our findings support a novel model of
      electrical synapse molecular asymmetry at the level of an intracellular scaffold 
      that is required for building the electrical synapse. We propose that such ESD
      asymmetries could be used by all nervous systems to support molecular and
      functional asymmetries at electrical synapses.

AB  - Six extant species of non-human great apes are currently recognized: Sumatran and
      Bornean orangutans, eastern and western gorillas, and chimpanzees and bonobos
      [1]. However, large gaps remain in our knowledge of fine-scale variation in
      hominoid morphology, behavior, and genetics, and aspects of great ape taxonomy
      remain in flux. This is particularly true for orangutans (genus: Pongo), the only
      Asian great apes and phylogenetically our most distant relatives among extant
      hominids [1]. Designation of Bornean and Sumatran orangutans, P. pygmaeus
      (Linnaeus 1760) and P. abelii (Lesson 1827), as distinct species occurred in 2001
      [1, 2]. Here, we show that an isolated population from Batang Toru, at the
      southernmost range limit of extant Sumatran orangutans south of Lake Toba, is
      distinct from other northern Sumatran and Bornean populations. By comparing
      cranio-mandibular and dental characters of an orangutan killed in a human-animal 
      conflict to those of 33 adult male orangutans of a similar developmental stage,
      we found consistent differences between the Batang Toru individual and other
      extant Ponginae. Our analyses of 37 orangutan genomes provided a second line of
      evidence. Model-based approaches revealed that the deepest split in the
      evolutionary history of extant orangutans occurred approximately 3.38 mya between
      the Batang Toru population and those to the north of Lake Toba, whereas both
      currently recognized species separated much later, about 674 kya. Our combined
      analyses support a new classification of orangutans into three extant species.
      The new species, Pongo tapanuliensis, encompasses the Batang Toru population, of 
      which fewer than 800 individuals survive. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Robustness in biology is the stability of phenotype under diverse genetic and/or 
      environmental perturbations. The circadian clock has remarkable stability of
      period and phase that-unlike other biological oscillators-is maintained over a
      wide range of conditions. Here, we show that the high fidelity of the circadian
      system stems from robust degradation of the clock protein PERIOD. We show that
      PERIOD degradation is regulated by a balance between ubiquitination and
      deubiquitination, and that disruption of this balance can destabilize the clock. 
      In mice with a loss-of-function mutation of the E3 ligase gene beta-Trcp2, the
      balance of PERIOD degradation is perturbed and the clock becomes dramatically
      unstable, presenting a unique behavioral phenotype unlike other circadian mutant 
      animal models. We believe that our data provide a molecular explanation for how
      circadian phases, such as wake-sleep onset times, can become unstable in humans, 
      and we present a unique mouse model to study human circadian disorders with
      unstable circadian rhythm phases.

AB  - Etiolated growth in darkness or the irreversible transition to photomorphogenesis
      in the light engages alternative developmental programs operating across all
      organs of a plant seedling. Dark-grown Arabidopsis de-etiolated by zinc (dez)
      mutants exhibit morphological, cellular, metabolic, and transcriptional
      characteristics of light-grown seedlings. We identify the causal mutation in
      TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE encoding a putative acyl transferase. Pectin acetylation
      is decreased in dez, as previously found in the reduced wall acetylation2-3
      mutant, shown here to phenocopy dez. Moreover, pectin of dez is excessively
      methylesterified. The addition of very short fragments of homogalacturonan,
      tri-galacturonate, and tetra-galacturonate, restores skotomorphogenesis in
      dark-grown dez and similar mutants, suggesting that the mutants are unable to
      generate these de-methylesterified pectin fragments. In combination with genetic 
      data, we propose a model of spatiotemporally separated photoreceptive and
      signal-responsive cell types, which contain overlapping subsets of the regulatory
      network of light-dependent seedling development and communicate via a
      pectin-derived dark signal.

AB  - Maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is crucial for organismal
      health. Disruption of proteostasis can lead to the accumulation of protein
      aggregates, which are associated with aging and many human diseases such as
      Alzheimer's disease [1-3]. Through analysis of the C. elegans host response to
      intracellular infection, we describe here a novel response pathway that enhances 
      proteostasis capacity and appears to act in parallel to well-studied proteostasis
      pathways. These findings are based on analysis of the transcriptional response to
      infection by the intracellular pathogen Nematocida parisii [4]. The response to
      N. parisii is strikingly similar to the response to infection by the Orsay virus,
      another natural intracellular pathogen of C. elegans, and is distinct from
      responses to extracellular pathogen infection [4-6]. We have therefore named this
      common transcriptional response the intracellular pathogen response (IPR), and it
      includes upregulation of several predicted ubiquitin ligase complex components
      such as the cullin cul-6. Through a forward genetic screen we found pals-22, a
      gene of previously unknown function, to be a repressor of the cul-6/cullin gene
      and other IPR gene expression. Interestingly, pals-22 mutants have increased
      thermotolerance and reduced levels of stress-induced polyglutamine aggregates,
      likely due to upregulated IPR gene expression. We found the enhanced stress
      resistance of pals-22 mutants to be dependent on cul-6, suggesting that pals-22
      mutants have increased activity of a CUL-6/cullin-containing ubiquitin ligase
      complex. pals-22 mutant phenotypes appear independent of the well-studied heat
      shock and insulin signaling pathways, indicating that the IPR is a distinct
      pathway that protects animals from proteotoxic stress.

      Ventrolateral Neurons to Drive Rhythmic Behavior in Drosophila.

AB  - In Drosophila, the circadian clock is comprised of transcriptional feedback loops
      that control rhythmic gene expression responsible for daily rhythms in
      physiology, metabolism, and behavior. The core feedback loop, which employs
      CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) activators and PERIOD-TIMELESS (PER-TIM) repressors to
      drive rhythmic transcription peaking at dusk, is required for circadian
      timekeeping and overt behavioral rhythms. CLK-CYC also activates an interlocked
      feedback loop, which uses the PAR DOMAIN PROTEIN 1epsilon (PDP1epsilon) activator
      and the VRILLE (VRI) repressor to drive rhythmic transcription peaking at dawn.
      Although Pdp1epsilon mutants disrupt activity rhythms without eliminating clock
      function, whether vri is required for clock function and/or output is not known. 
      Using a conditionally inactivatable transgene to rescue vri developmental
      lethality, we show that clock function persists after vri inactivation but that
      activity rhythms are abolished. The inactivation of vri disrupts multiple output 
      pathways thought to be important for activity rhythms, including PDF accumulation
      and arborization rhythms in the small ventrolateral neuron (sLNv) dorsal
      projection. These results demonstrate that vri acts as a key regulator of clock
      output and suggest that the primary function of the interlocked feedback loop in 
      Drosophila is to drive rhythmic transcription required for overt rhythms.

AB  - Size is a universally defining characteristic of all living cells and tissues and
      is intrinsically linked with cell genotype, growth, and physiology. Many
      mutations have been identified to alter cell size, but pleiotropic effects have
      largely hampered our ability to probe how cell size specifically affects
      fundamental cellular properties, such as DNA content and intracellular
      localization. To systematically interrogate the impact of cell morphology on
      bacterial physiology, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to enrich a
      library of hundreds of Escherichia coli mutants in the essential cytoskeletal
      protein MreB for subtle changes in cell shape, cumulatively spanning
      approximately 5-fold variation in average cell volume. Critically, pleiotropic
      effects in the mutated library are most likely minimized because only one gene
      was mutated and because growth rate was unaffected, thereby allowing us to query 
      the general effects of morphology on cellular physiology over a large range of
      cell sizes with high resolution. We discovered linear scaling of the abundance of
      DNA and the key division protein FtsZ with cell volume, a strong dependency of
      sensitivity to specific antibiotics on cell width, and a simple correlation
      between MreB localization pattern and cell width. Our systematic, quantitative
      approach reveals complex and dynamic links between bacterial morphology and
      physiology and should be generally applicable for probing size-related
      genotype-phenotype relationships.

AB  - While present-day taxa are valuable proxies for understanding the biology of
      extinct species, it is also crucial to examine physical remains in order to
      obtain a more comprehensive view of their behavior, social structure, and life
      histories [1, 2]. For example, information on demographic parameters such as age 
      distribution and sex ratios in fossil assemblages can be used to accurately infer
      socioecological patterns (e.g., [3]). Here we use genomic data to determine the
      sex of 98 woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) specimens in order to infer
      social and behavioral patterns in the last 60,000 years of the species'
      existence. We report a significant excess of males among the identified samples
      (69% versus 31%; p < 0.0002). We argue that this male bias among mammoth remains 
      is best explained by males more often being caught in natural traps that favor
      preservation. We hypothesize that this is a consequence of social structure in
      proboscideans, which is characterized by matriarchal hierarchy and sex
      segregation. Without the experience associated with living in a matriarchal
      family group, or a bachelor group with an experienced bull, young or solitary
      males may have been more prone to die in natural traps where good preservation is
      more likely.

TI  - Optogenetic Blockade of Dopamine Transients Prevents Learning Induced by Changes 
      in Reward Features.

AB  - Prediction errors are critical for associative learning [1, 2]. Transient changes
      in dopamine neuron activity correlate with positive and negative reward
      prediction errors and can mimic their effects [3-15]. However, although causal
      studies show that dopamine transients of 1-2 s are sufficient to drive learning
      about reward, these studies do not address whether they are necessary (but see
      [11]). Further, the precise nature of this signal is not yet fully established.
      Although it has been equated with the cached-value error signal proposed to
      support model-free reinforcement learning, cached-value errors are typically
      confounded with errors in the prediction of reward features [16]. Here, we used
      optogenetic and transgenic approaches to prevent transient changes in midbrain
      dopamine neuron activity during the critical error-signaling period of two
      unblocking tasks. In one, learning was unblocked by increasing the number of
      rewards, a manipulation that induces errors in predicting both value and reward
      features. In another, learning was unblocked by switching from one to another
      equally valued reward, a manipulation that induces errors only in reward feature 
      prediction. Preventing dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area from firing
      for 5 s beginning before and continuing until after the changes in reward
      prevented unblocking of learning in both tasks. A similar duration suppression
      did not induce extinction when delivered during an expected reward, indicating
      that it did not act independently as a negative prediction error. This result
      suggests that dopamine transients play a general role in error signaling rather
      than being restricted to only signaling errors in value.

AB  - Mitochondria are best known for their role in the generation of ATP by aerobic
      respiration. Yet, research in the past half century has shown that they perform a
      much larger suite of functions and that these functions can vary substantially
      among diverse eukaryotic lineages. Despite this diversity, all mitochondria
      derive from a common ancestral organelle that originated from the integration of 
      an endosymbiotic alphaproteobacterium into a host cell related to Asgard Archaea.
      The transition from endosymbiotic bacterium to permanent organelle entailed a
      massive number of evolutionary changes including the origins of hundreds of new
      genes and a protein import system, insertion of membrane transporters,
      integration of metabolism and reproduction, genome reduction, endosymbiotic gene 
      transfer, lateral gene transfer and the retargeting of proteins. These changes
      occurred incrementally as the endosymbiont and the host became integrated.
      Although many insights into this transition have been gained, controversy
      persists regarding the nature of the original endosymbiont, its initial
      interactions with the host and the timing of its integration relative to the
      origin of other features of eukaryote cells. Since the establishment of the
      organelle, proteins have been gained, lost, transferred and retargeted as
      mitochondria have specialized into the spectrum of functional types seen across
      the eukaryotic tree of life.

AB  - Many previous studies have shown that rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae), including
      the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whale (B. physalus), sei whale (B.
      borealis), Bryde's whale (B. edeni), minke whale (B. acutorostrata), and humpback
      whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), employ a strategy called lunge feeding to capture
      a large amount of krill and/or fish for nourishment [1]. Lunge feeding entails a 
      high energetic cost due to the drag created by an open mouth at high speeds
      [1,2]. In the upper Gulf of Thailand, Bryde's whales, which feed on small fish
      species [3], predominantly anchovies, demonstrated a range of feeding behaviors
      such as oblique, vertical, and lateral lunging. Moreover, they displayed a novel 
      head-lifting feeding behavior characterized by holding the vertical posture for
      several seconds with an open mouth at the water surface. This study describes the
      head-lifting feeding by Bryde's whales, which is distinct from the typical lunge 
      feeding of rorqual whales. Whales showing this behavior were observed on 58
      occasions, involving 31 whales and including eight adult-calf pairs. Whales
      caught their prey using a series of coordinated movements: (i) lifting the head
      above the water with a closed mouth, (ii) opening the mouth until the lower jaw
      contacted the sea surface, which created a current of water flowing into the
      mouth, (iii) holding their position for several seconds, (iv) waiting for the
      prey to enter the mouth, and (v) closing the mouth and engulfing the prey
      underwater (Figure 1A-F, Movie S1 in Supplemental Information published with this
      article online). When a whale kept its upper jaw above the sea surface, many
      anchovies in the targeted shoal appeared to lose orientation and flowed passively
      into the mouth of the whale by the current created by the lower mandible breaking
      the surface of the water. We measured the duration of feeding events when the
      whales had a wide-open mouth mostly above the sea surface. The mean and maximum
      feeding durations were 14.5 +/- 5.4 (SD; n = 58 events) and 32 s, respectively.
      Deployment of animal-borne data loggers yielded approximately 44 minutes of
      recordings from a single whale. The acceleration data showed that stroke rates,
      including tail beat and whole-body movements during feeding, were faster
      (approximately 0.7 s cycle) than during a cruising swim (approximately 3 s cycle)
      (Figure 1G). The swimming speed was lower than that in the stall speed (0.2 m
      s(-1)) of the device during the feeding phase, suggesting that thrust force was
      used to hold the head up and to stabilize body posture (Figure 1G). Stable
      positioning using the fluke and flipper was confirmed by video data for both the 
      downward and upward direction of the whale (Figure S1). According to the visual
      and behavioral data, we named the head-lifting feeding as 'tread-water feeding'. 
      Generally, all species of baleen whale, including rorqual whales, show active
      chasing and feeding, i.e., skimming, suction, and engulfing with lunging [1].
      Tread-water feeding is considered passive feeding as compared with other feeding 
      behaviors because the whales do not swim forward in pursuit of prey during the
      period from mouth opening to closing, and although they need thrust force to
      stabilize their posture, the head does not actively move. To the best of our
      knowledge, this discovery of tread-water feeding in Bryde's whales represents the
      first report of passive feeding in baleen whales, which indicates their flexible 
      capacity to modify their foraging strategy in relation to variable environments.

AB  - Wildlife migration is a spectacular phenomenon [1]. Studies using telemetry -
      tracking devices attached on free-living animals - have shown that large
      topographic barriers and obstacles, such as oceans and deserts, elicit extreme
      feats of migration [2]. Overcoming the challenges of these obstacles might
      require experience and skill that young individuals lack [2-5]. Further, younger,
      inexperienced animals might determine their migration routes using navigation
      strategies different from those of older animals [6-9], but our knowledge of how 
      orientation mechanisms and experience drive migration strategy is limited. We
      have studied how experienced (adults) and inexperienced (first-time migrating
      fledglings) streaked shearwaters (Calonectris leucomelas) approach the challenge 
      of migration using animal-borne tracking devices. The study birds migrate from a 
      colony on the north of a large topographic barrier, Honshu Island, Japan.
      Shearwaters use a wind- and wave-based flight pattern-dynamic soaring-to extract 
      energy for highly efficient travel over oceans [10]. We therefore expected that
      shearwaters migrating southward from the colony would make substantial detours to
      avoid any landmasses. We found that migrating adults followed one of two paths
      that detour around landmasses that hinder direct southerly migration. In
      contrast, inexperienced fledglings followed a straight course in a south-oriented
      direction that forced them to complete a trans-mountain journey, suggesting that 
      the birds rely on an innate compass. Thus, we suggest that fledglings would
      eventually override the simple compass navigation, which appears to be the
      primary driver for their extreme migration, before being able to interact
      appropriately with the marine environment.

AB  - The liver is a critical hub for numerous physiological processes. These include
      macronutrient metabolism, blood volume regulation, immune system support,
      endocrine control of growth signaling pathways, lipid and cholesterol
      homeostasis, and the breakdown of xenobiotic compounds, including many current
      drugs. Processing, partitioning, and metabolism of macronutrients provide the
      energy needed to drive the aforementioned processes and are therefore among the
      liver's most critical functions. Moreover, the liver's capacities to store
      glucose in the form of glycogen, with feeding, and assemble glucose via the
      gluconeogenic pathway, in response to fasting, are critical. The liver oxidizes
      lipids, but can also package excess lipid for secretion to and storage in other
      tissues, such as adipose. Finally, the liver is a major handler of protein and
      amino acid metabolism as it is responsible for the majority of proteins secreted 
      in the blood (whether based on mass or range of unique proteins), the processing 
      of amino acids for energy, and disposal of nitrogenous waste from protein
      degradation in the form of urea metabolism. Over the course of evolution this
      array of hepatic functions has been consolidated in a single organ, the liver,
      which is conserved in all vertebrates. Developmentally, this organ arises as a
      result of a complex differentiation program that is initiated by exogenous signal
      gradients, cellular localization cues, and an intricate hierarchy of
      transcription factors. These processes that are fully developed in the mature
      liver are imperative for life. Liver failure from any number of sources (e.g.
      viral infection, overnutrition, or oncologic burden) is a global health problem. 
      The goal of this primer is to concisely summarize hepatic functions with respect 
      to macronutrient metabolism. Introducing concepts critical to liver development, 
      organization, and physiology sets the stage for these functions and serves to
      orient the reader. It is important to emphasize that insight into hepatic
      pathologies and potential therapeutic avenues to treat these conditions requires 
      an understanding of the development and physiology of specialized hepatic
      functions.

AB  - Mesothelioma is a fatal tumor of the pleura and is strongly associated with
      asbestos exposure. The molecular mechanisms underlying the long latency period of
      mesothelioma and driving carcinogenesis are unknown. Moreover, late diagnosis
      means that mesothelioma research is commonly focused on end-stage disease.
      Although disruption of the CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF) locus has been reported in
      end-stage disease, information is lacking on the status of this key tumor
      suppressor gene in pleural lesions preceding mesothelioma. Manufactured carbon
      nanotubes (CNTs) are similar to asbestos in terms of their fibrous shape and
      biopersistent properties and thus may pose an asbestos-like inhalation hazard.
      Here we show that instillation of either long CNTs or long asbestos fibers into
      the pleural cavity of mice induces mesothelioma that exhibits common key
      pro-oncogenic molecular events throughout the latency period of disease
      progression. Sustained activation of pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, increased 
      proliferation, and oxidative DNA damage form a common molecular signature of
      long-CNT- and long-asbestos-fiber-induced pathology. We show that
      hypermethylation of p16/Ink4a and p19/Arf in CNT- and asbestos-induced
      inflammatory lesions precedes mesothelioma; this results in silencing of Cdkn2a
      (Ink4a/Arf) and loss of p16 and p19 protein, consistent with epigenetic
      alterations playing a gatekeeper role in cancer. In end-stage mesothelioma,
      silencing of p16/Ink4a is sustained and deletion of p19/Arf is detected,
      recapitulating human disease. This study addresses the long-standing question of 
      which early molecular changes drive carcinogenesis during the long latency period
      of mesothelioma development and shows that CNT and asbestos pose a similar health
      hazard.

AB  - The origins and genetic affinity of the aboriginal inhabitants of the Canary
      Islands, commonly known as Guanches, are poorly understood. Though radiocarbon
      dates on archaeological remains such as charcoal, seeds, and domestic animal
      bones suggest that people have inhabited the islands since the 5(th) century BCE 
      [1-3], it remains unclear how many times, and by whom, the islands were first
      settled [4, 5]. Previously published ancient DNA analyses of uniparental genetic 
      markers have shown that the Guanches carried common North African Y chromosome
      markers (E-M81, E-M78, and J-M267) and mitochondrial lineages such as U6b, in
      addition to common Eurasian haplogroups [6-8]. These results are in agreement
      with some linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological data indicating an
      origin from a North African Berber-like population [1, 4, 9]. However, to date
      there are no published Guanche autosomal genomes to help elucidate and directly
      test this hypothesis. To resolve this, we generated the first genome-wide
      sequence data and mitochondrial genomes from eleven archaeological Guanche
      individuals originating from Gran Canaria and Tenerife. Five of the individuals
      (directly radiocarbon dated to a time transect spanning the 7(th)-11(th)
      centuries CE) yielded sufficient autosomal genome coverage (0.21x to 3.93x) for
      population genomic analysis. Our results show that the Guanches were genetically 
      similar over time and that they display the greatest genetic affinity to extant
      Northwest Africans, strongly supporting the hypothesis of a Berber-like origin.
      We also estimate that the Guanches have contributed 16%-31% autosomal ancestry to
      modern Canary Islanders, here represented by two individuals from Gran Canaria.

AB  - The ecology of microbes frequently involves the mixing of entire communities
      (community coalescence), for example, flooding events, host excretion, and soil
      tillage [1, 2], yet the consequences of this process for community structure and 
      function are poorly understood [3-7]. Recent theory suggests that a community,
      due to coevolution between constituent species, may act as a partially cohesive
      unit [8-11], resulting in one community dominating after community coalescence.
      This dominant community is predicted to be the one that uses resources most
      efficiently when grown in isolation [11]. We experimentally tested these
      predictions using methanogenic communities, for which efficient resource use,
      quantified by methane production, requires coevolved cross-feeding interactions
      between species [12]. After propagation in laboratory-scale anaerobic digesters, 
      community composition (determined from 16S rRNA sequencing) and methane
      production of mixtures of communities closely resembled that of the single most
      productive community grown in isolation. Analysis of each community's
      contribution toward the final mixture suggests that certain combinations of taxa 
      within a community might be co-selected as a result of coevolved interactions. As
      a corollary of these findings, we also show that methane production increased
      with the number of inoculated communities. These findings are relevant to the
      understanding of the ecological dynamics of natural microbial communities, as
      well as demonstrating a simple method of predictably enhancing microbial
      community function in biotechnology, health, and agriculture [13].

      Change.

AB  - Animals with dietary specializations can be used to link climate to specific
      ecological drivers of endangerment. Only two mammals, the giant panda (Ailuropoda
      melanoleuca) in Asia and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) in Madagascar,
      consume the nutritionally poor and mechanically challenging culm or trunk of
      woody bamboos [1-3]. Even though the greater bamboo lemur is critically
      endangered, paleontological evidence shows that it was once broadly distributed
      [4, 5]. Here, integrating morphological, paleontological, and ecological
      evidence, we project the effects of climate change on greater bamboo lemurs. Both
      the giant panda and the greater bamboo lemur are shown to share diagnostic dental
      features indicative of a bamboo diet, thereby providing an ecometric indicator
      [6, 7] of diet preserved in the fossil record. Analyses of bamboo feeding in
      living populations show that bamboo culm is consumed only during the dry season
      and that the greater bamboo lemur is currently found in regions with the shortest
      dry season. In contrast, paleontological localities of the greater bamboo lemurs 
      have the longest dry seasons. Future projections show that many present-day
      greater bamboo lemur populations will experience prolonged dry seasons similar to
      those of the localities where only fossils of the greater bamboo lemur are found.
      Whereas abundant foods such as bamboo allow feeding specialists to thrive, even a
      moderate change in seasonality may outstrip the capacity of greater bamboo lemurs
      to persist on their mechanically demanding food source. Coupling known changes in
      species distribution with high-resolution ecological and historical data helps to
      identify extinction risks.

AB  - Value-based decision-making involves an assessment of the value of items
      available and the actions required to obtain them. The basal ganglia are highly
      implicated in action selection and goal-directed behavior [1-4], and the striatum
      in particular plays a critical role in arbitrating between competing choices
      [5-9]. Previous work has demonstrated that neural activity in the caudate nucleus
      is modulated by task-relevant action values [6, 8]. Nonetheless, how value is
      represented and maintained in the striatum remains unclear since decision-making 
      in these tasks relied on spatially lateralized responses, confounding the ability
      to generalize to a more abstract choice task [6, 8, 9]. Here, we investigate
      striatal value representations by applying caudate electrical stimulation in
      macaque monkeys (n = 3) to bias decision-making in a task that divorces the value
      of a stimulus from motor action. Electrical microstimulation is known to induce
      neural plasticity [10, 11], and caudate microstimulation in primates has been
      shown to accelerate associative learning [12, 13]. Our results indicate that
      stimulation paired with a particular stimulus increases selection of that
      stimulus, and this effect was stimulus dependent and action independent. The
      modulation of choice behavior using microstimulation was best modeled as
      resulting from changes in stimulus value. Caudate neural recordings (n = 1) show 
      that changes in value-coding neuron activity are stimulus value dependent. We
      argue that caudate microstimulation can differentially increase stimulus values
      independent of action, and unilateral manipulations of value are sufficient to
      mediate choice behavior. These results support potential future applications of
      microstimulation to correct maladaptive plasticity underlying dysfunctional
      decision-making related to neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB  - In model bacteria, such as E. coli and B. subtilis, regulation of cell-cycle
      progression and cellular organization achieves consistency in cell size,
      replication dynamics, and chromosome positioning [1-3]. Mycobacteria elongate and
      divide asymmetrically, giving rise to significant variation in cell size and
      elongation rate among closely related cells [4, 5]. Given the physical asymmetry 
      of mycobacteria, the models that describe coordination of cellular organization
      and cell-cycle progression in model bacteria are not directly translatable [1, 2,
      6-8]. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy and fluorescent reporters of DNA
      replication and chromosome positioning to examine the coordination of growth,
      division, and chromosome dynamics at a single-cell level in Mycobacterium
      smegmatis (M. smegmatis) and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). 
      By analyzing chromosome and replisome localization, we demonstrated that
      chromosome positioning is asymmetric and proportional to cell size. Furthermore, 
      we found that cellular asymmetry is maintained throughout the cell cycle and is
      not established at division. Using measurements and stochastic modeling of
      mycobacterial cell size and cell-cycle timing in both slow and fast growth
      conditions, we found that well-studied models of cell-size control are
      insufficient to explain the mycobacterial cell cycle. Instead, we showed that
      mycobacterial cell-cycle progression is regulated by an unprecedented mechanism
      involving parallel adders (i.e., constant growth increments) that start at
      replication initiation. Together, these adders enable mycobacterial populations
      to regulate cell size, growth, and heterogeneity in the face of varying
      environments.

AB  - During epithelial cell proliferation, planar alignment of the mitotic spindle
      allows the daughter cells to stay within the epithelium. Previous work has
      identified cortical cues that regulate spindle orientation and the division axis 
      [1, 2]. One such cue is cortical Pins (LGN in vertebrates) [3-6], which recruits 
      the conserved Mud/NuMA protein and the dynein/dynactin complex to the cortex. The
      dynein/dynactin motor complex pulls astral microtubules to orient the spindle.
      Cortical Pins can therefore dictate the division axis. In addition to cortical
      cues, cell shape can also serve as a division orientation cue [7-9]. Here, we
      investigated the interplay between cortical cues and cell shape in a
      proliferating tissue. We analyzed division orientation in the first mitotic
      divisions of the early Drosophila embryo, where groups of epithelial cells
      synchronously divide. Using chemical inhibitors, knockdowns, and mutants with
      known deficits in motor activity, we showed that the myosin 2 motor is required
      to orient cell division in the plane of a columnar epithelium. Disrupting myosin 
      activity caused the division axis to orient perpendicular to the epithelial
      plane. This effect was independent of Pins cortical localization, which became
      uncoupled from spindle orientation. Instead, myosin motor activity was required
      for the formation of the actomyosin cortex and for cell rounding upon mitotic
      entry. We propose that mitotic cell rounding in columnar epithelia allows cells
      to properly interpret cortical cues that orient the spindle. In the absence of
      mitotic rounding, geometric cues imposed by tight cell packing prevail and cells 
      divide along their long apical-basal axis.

TI  - Countershading and Stripes in the Theropod Dinosaur Sinosauropteryx Reveal
      Heterogeneous Habitats in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota.

AB  - Countershading is common across a variety of lineages and ecological time [1-4]. 
      A dark dorsum and lighter ventrum helps to mask the three-dimensional shape of
      the body by reducing self-shadowing and decreasing conspicuousness, thus helping 
      to avoid detection by predators and prey [1, 2, 4, 5]. The optimal countershading
      pattern is dictated by the lighting environment, which is in turn dependent upon 
      habitat [1, 3, 5, 6]. With the discovery of fossil melanin [7, 8], it is possible
      to infer original color patterns from fossils, including countershading [3, 9,
      10]. Applying these principles, we describe the pattern of countershading in the 
      diminutive theropod dinosaur Sinosauropteryx from the Early Cretaceous Jehol
      Biota of Liaoning, China. From reconstructions based on exceptional fossils, the 
      color pattern is compared to predicted optimal countershading transitions based
      on 3D reconstructions of the animal's abdomen, imaged in different lighting
      environments. Reconstructed patterns match well with those predicted for animals 
      living in open habitats. Jehol is presumed to have been a predominantly closed
      forested environment [3, 11, 12], but our results indicate a more heterogeneous
      range of habitats. Sinosauropteryx is also shown to exhibit a "bandit mask," a
      common pattern in many living vertebrates, particularly birds, that serves
      multiple functions including camouflage [13-18]. Sinosauropteryx therefore shows 
      multiple color pattern features likely related to the habitat in which it lived. 
      Our results show how reconstructing the color of extinct animals can inform on
      their ecologies beyond what may be obvious from skeletal remains alone. VIDEO

AB  - Granule cells (GCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) play an important role in odor
      information processing. Although they have been classified into various
      neurochemical subtypes, the functional roles of these subtypes remain unknown. We
      used in vivo two-photon Ca(2+) imaging combined with cell-type-specific
      identification of GCs in the mouse OB to examine whether functionally distinct GC
      subtypes exist in the bulbar network. We showed that half of GCs express
      Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (CaMKIIalpha(+)) and that
      these neurons are preferentially activated by olfactory stimulation. The higher
      activity of CaMKIIalpha(+) neurons is due to the weaker inhibitory input that
      they receive compared to their CaMKIIalpha-immunonegative (CaMKIIalpha(-))
      counterparts. In line with these functional data, immunohistochemical analyses
      showed that 75%-90% of GCs expressing the immediate early gene cFos are
      CaMKIIalpha(+) in naive animals and in mice that have been exposed to a novel
      odor and go/no-go operant conditioning, or that have been subjected to long-term 
      associative memory and spontaneous habituation/dishabituation odor discrimination
      tasks. On the other hand, a perceptual learning task resulted in increased
      activation of CaMKIIalpha(-) cells. Pharmacogenetic inhibition of CaMKIIalpha(+) 
      GCs revealed that this subtype is involved in habituation/dishabituation and
      go/no-go odor discrimination, but not in perceptual learning. In contrast,
      pharmacogenetic inhibition of GCs in a subtype-independent manner affected
      perceptual learning. Our results indicate that functionally distinct populations 
      of GCs exist in the OB and that they play distinct roles during different odor
      tasks.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variations of neurogenesis are thought to account for the
      evolution of brain shape. In the dorsal telencephalon (pallium) of vertebrates,
      it remains unresolved which ancestral neurogenesis mode prefigures the highly
      divergent cytoarchitectures that are seen in extant species. To gain insight into
      this question, we developed genetic tools to generate here the first
      4-dimensional (3D + birthdating time) map of pallium construction in the adult
      teleost zebrafish. Using a Tet-On-based genetic birthdating strategy, we identify
      a "sequential stacking" construction mode where neurons derived from the
      zebrafish pallial germinal zone arrange in outside-in, age-related layers from a 
      central core generated during embryogenesis. We obtained no evidence for overt
      radial or tangential neuronal migrations. Cre-lox-mediated tracing, which
      included following Brainbow clones, further demonstrates that this process is
      sustained by the persistent neurogenic activity of individual pallial neural stem
      cells (NSCs) from embryo to adult. Together, these data demonstrate that the
      spatiotemporal control of NSC activity is an important driver of the
      macroarchitecture of the zebrafish adult pallium. This simple mode of pallium
      construction shares distinct traits with pallial genesis in mammals and
      non-mammalian amniotes such as birds or reptiles, suggesting that it may
      exemplify the basal layout from which vertebrate pallial architectures were
      elaborated.

AB  - Bacteria can generate benefits for themselves and their kin by living in
      multicellular, matrix-enclosed communities, termed biofilms, which are
      fundamental to microbial ecology and the impact bacteria have on the environment,
      infections, and industry [1-6]. The advantages of the biofilm mode of life
      include increased stress resistance and access to concentrated nutrient sources
      [3, 7, 8]. However, there are also costs associated with biofilm growth,
      including the metabolic burden of biofilm matrix production, increased resource
      competition, and limited mobility inside the community [9-11]. The
      decision-making strategies used by bacteria to weigh the costs between remaining 
      in a biofilm or actively dispersing are largely unclear, even though the
      dispersal transition is a central aspect of the biofilm life cycle and critical
      for infection transmission [12-14]. Using a combination of genetic and novel
      single-cell imaging approaches, we show that Vibrio cholerae integrates dual
      sensory inputs to control the dispersal response: cells use the general stress
      response, which can be induced via starvation, and they also integrate
      information about the local cell density and molecular transport conditions in
      the environment via the quorum sensing apparatus. By combining information from
      individual (stress response) and collective (quorum sensing) avenues of sensory
      input, biofilm-dwelling bacteria can make robust decisions to disperse from large
      biofilms under distress, while preventing premature dispersal when biofilm
      populations are small. These insights into triggers and regulators of biofilm
      dispersal are a key step toward actively inducing biofilm dispersal for
      technological and medical applications, and for environmental control of
      biofilms.

AB  - The C4 photosynthetic pathway accounts for approximately 25% of primary
      productivity on the planet despite being used by only 3% of species. Because C4
      plants are higher yielding than C3 plants, efforts are underway to introduce the 
      C4 pathway into the C3 crop rice. This is an ambitious endeavor; however, the C4 
      pathway evolved from C3 on multiple independent occasions over the last 30
      million years, and steps along the trajectory are evident in extant species. One 
      approach toward engineering C4 rice is to recapitulate this trajectory, one of
      the first steps of which was a change in leaf anatomy. The transition from C3 to 
      so-called "proto-Kranz" anatomy requires an increase in organelle volume in
      sheath cells surrounding leaf veins. Here we induced chloroplast and
      mitochondrial development in rice vascular sheath cells through constitutive
      expression of maize GOLDEN2-LIKE genes. Increased organelle volume was
      accompanied by the accumulation of photosynthetic enzymes and by increased
      intercellular connections. This suite of traits reflects that seen in
      "proto-Kranz" species, and, as such, a key step toward engineering C4 rice has
      been achieved.

TI  - Genetic Coupling of Female Mate Choice with Polygenic Ecological Divergence
      Facilitates Stickleback Speciation.

AB  - Ecological speciation with gene flow is widespread in nature [1], but it presents
      a conundrum: how are associations between traits under divergent natural
      selection and traits that contribute to assortative mating maintained?
      Theoretical models suggest that genetic mechanisms inhibiting free recombination 
      between loci underlying these two types of traits (hereafter, "genetic coupling")
      can facilitate speciation [2-4]. Here, we perform a direct test for genetic
      coupling by mapping both divergent traits and female mate choice in a classic
      model of ecological speciation: sympatric benthic and limnetic threespine
      stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). By measuring mate choice in F2 hybrid
      females, we allowed for recombination between loci underlying assortative mating 
      and those under divergent ecological selection. In semi-natural mating arenas in 
      which females had access to both benthic and limnetic males, we found that F2
      females mated with males similar to themselves in body size and shape. In
      addition, we found two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with female mate
      choice that also predicted female morphology along the benthic-limnetic trait
      axis. Furthermore, a polygenic genetic model that explains adaptation to
      contrasting benthic and limnetic feeding niches [5] also predicted F2 female mate
      choice. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that genetic coupling 
      of assortative mating with traits under divergent ecological selection helps
      maintain species in the face of gene flow, despite a polygenic basis for
      adaptation to divergent environments.

AB  - Saber-toothed cats (Machairodontinae) are among the most widely recognized
      representatives of the now largely extinct Pleistocene megafauna. However, many
      aspects of their ecology, evolution, and extinction remain uncertain. Although
      ancient-DNA studies have led to huge advances in our knowledge of these aspects
      of many other megafauna species (e.g., mammoths and cave bears), relatively few
      ancient-DNA studies have focused on saber-toothed cats [1-3], and they have been 
      restricted to short fragments of mitochondrial DNA. Here we investigate the
      evolutionary history of two lineages of saber-toothed cats (Smilodon and
      Homotherium) in relation to living carnivores and find that the Machairodontinae 
      form a well-supported clade that is distinct from all living felids. We present
      partial mitochondrial genomes from one S. populator sample and three Homotherium 
      sp. samples, including the only Late Pleistocene Homotherium sample from Eurasia 
      [4]. We confirm the identification of the unique Late Pleistocene European fossil
      through ancient-DNA analyses, thus strengthening the evidence that Homotherium
      occurred in Europe over 200,000 years later than previously believed. This in
      turn forces a re-evaluation of its demography and extinction dynamics. Within the
      Machairodontinae, we find a deep divergence between Smilodon and Homotherium (
      approximately 18 million years) but limited diversity between the American and
      European Homotherium specimens. The genetic data support the hypothesis that all 
      Late Pleistocene (or post-Villafrancian) Homotherium should be considered a
      single species, H. latidens, which was previously proposed based on morphological
      data [5, 6].

AB  - Sensory and motor skills can be improved with training, but learning is often
      restricted to practice stimuli. As an exception, training on closed-loop (CL)
      sensorimotor interfaces, such as action video games and musical instruments, can 
      impart a broad spectrum of perceptual benefits. Here we ask whether computerized 
      CL auditory training can enhance speech understanding in levels of background
      noise that approximate a crowded restaurant. Elderly hearing-impaired subjects
      trained for 8 weeks on a CL game that, like a musical instrument, challenged them
      to monitor subtle deviations between predicted and actual auditory feedback as
      they moved their fingertip through a virtual soundscape. We performed our study
      as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by training other
      subjects in an auditory working-memory (WM) task. Subjects in both groups
      improved at their respective auditory tasks and reported comparable expectations 
      for improved speech processing, thereby controlling for placebo effects. Whereas 
      speech intelligibility was unchanged after WM training, subjects in the CL
      training group could correctly identify 25% more words in spoken sentences or
      digit sequences presented in high levels of background noise. Numerically, CL
      audiomotor training provided more than three times the benefit of our subjects'
      hearing aids for speech processing in noisy listening conditions. Gains in speech
      intelligibility could be predicted from gameplay accuracy and baseline inhibitory
      control. However, benefits did not persist in the absence of continuing practice.
      These studies employ stringent clinical standards to demonstrate that perceptual 
      learning on a computerized audio game can transfer to "real-world" communication 
      challenges.

AB  - Many animals use the visual motion generated by traveling straight-the
      translatory optic flow-to successfully navigate obstacles: near objects appear
      larger and to move more quickly than distant objects. Flies are expert at
      navigating cluttered environments, and while their visual processing of rotatory 
      optic flow is understood in exquisite detail, how they process translatory optic 
      flow remains a mystery. We present novel cell types that have local motion
      receptive fields matched to translation self-motion, the vertical translation
      (VT) cells. One of these, the VT1 cell, encodes self-motion in the
      forward-sideslip direction and fires action potentials in spike bursts as well as
      single spikes. We show that the spike burst coding is size and speed-tuned and is
      selectively modulated by motion parallax-the relative motion experienced during
      translation. These properties are spatially organized, so that the cell is most
      excited by clutter rather than isolated objects. When the fly is presented with a
      simulation of flying past an elevated object, the spike burst activity is
      modulated by the height of the object, and the rate of single spikes is
      unaffected. When the moving object alone is experienced, the cell is weakly
      driven. Meanwhile, the VT2-3 cells have motion receptive fields matched to the
      lift axis. In conjunction with previously described horizontal cells, the VT
      cells have properties well suited to the visual navigation of clutter and to
      encode the fly's movements along near cardinal axes of thrust, lift, and forward 
      sideslip.

AB  - The basic architecture of the mammalian neocortex is remarkably similar across
      species. Pallial structures in the reptilian brain are considered amniote
      precursors of mammalian neocortex, whereas pallia of anamniotes ("lower"
      vertebrates) have been deemed largely insignificant with respect to homology.
      Here, we examine the cytoarchitecture of the lateral pallium in the lamprey, the 
      phylogenetically oldest group of extant vertebrates. We reveal a three-layered
      structure with similar excitatory cell types as in the mammalian cortex and
      GABAergic interneurons. The ventral parts are sensory areas receiving
      monosynaptic thalamic input that can be activated from the optic nerve, whereas
      the dorsal parts contain motor areas with efferent projections to the brainstem, 
      receiving oligosynaptic thalamic input. Both regions receive monosynaptic
      olfactory input. This three-layered "primordial" lamprey lateral pallium has
      evolved most features of the three-layered reptilian cortices and is thereby a
      precursor of the six-layered "neo" cortex with a long-standing evolutionary
      precedent (some 500 million years ago).

TI  - Late rDNA Condensation Ensures Timely Cdc14 Release and Coordination of Mitotic
      Exit Signaling with Nucleolar Segregation.

AB  - The nucleolus plays a pivotal role in multiple key cellular processes. An
      illustrative example is the regulation of mitotic exit in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae through the nucleolar sequestration of the Cdc14 phosphatase. The
      peculiar structure of the nucleolus, however, has also its drawbacks. The
      repetitive nature of the rDNA gives rise to cohesion-independent linkages whose
      resolution in budding yeast requires the Cdc14-dependent inhibition of rRNA
      transcription, which facilitates condensin accessibility to this locus. Thus, the
      rDNA condenses and segregates later than most other yeast genomic regions. Here, 
      we show that defective function of a small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle
      (snoRNP) assembly factor facilitates condensin accessibility to the rDNA and
      induces nucleolar hyper-condensation. Interestingly, this increased compaction of
      the nucleolus interferes with the proper release of Cdc14 from this organelle.
      This observation provides an explanation for the delayed rDNA condensation in
      budding yeast, which is necessary to efficiently coordinate timely Cdc14 release 
      and mitotic exit with nucleolar compaction and segregation.

AB  - It is projected that 25 million km of new paved roads will be developed globally 
      by 2050 - enough to encircle the planet more than 600 times. Roughly 90% of new
      roads will be built in developing nations, frequently in tropical and subtropical
      regions with high biodiversity and environmental values. Many developing nations 
      are borrowing from international lenders or negotiating access to their natural
      resources in order to expand their transportation infrastructure. Given the
      unprecedented pace and extent of these initiatives, it is vital to thoroughly
      assess the potential consequences of large-scale road and highway projects. In
      appropriate contexts and locales, new roads can promote sizeable economic and
      social benefits. If poorly planned or implemented, however, new roads can provoke
      serious cost overruns, corruption and environmental impacts, while generating
      sparse economic benefits and intense social and political conflict. Using
      examples from developing nations, we identify risks that can hinder road projects
      in wet and dry tropical environments. Such risks, we assert, are often
      inadequately considered by project proponents, evaluators and the general public,
      creating a systematic tendency to overestimate project benefits while
      understating project risks. A more precautionary approach is needed to reduce
      risks while maximizing benefits of new road projects in the tropics.

AB  - Engineering organisms for biotechnology applications requires knowledge of their 
      essential genes and associated regulatory networks. A new study of methylotrophic
      metabolism in Methylobacterium reveals essentiality of the unregulated,
      off-pathway phosphoribulokinase gene and an unexpected key regulatory role for
      its product ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

      moving panoramas, but switch overwhelmingly to quick, intermittent body saccades 
      when following narrow bars. This suggests insect brains trigger distinct flight
      patterns to stabilize gaze for different tasks.

AB  - Postnatal size changes in most vertebrates are unidirectional and finite once the
      individual reaches full size [1]. In rare cases, changes of body length may occur
      in response to harsh environmental conditions. Such reactionary changes are
      distinct from seasonal, often anticipatory morphological changes, such as the
      reversible size change of some adult bird brains [2]. A unique pattern of
      profound anatomical change known as Dehnel's phenomenon has been described for
      the body, skull and brain size of red-toothed shrews and some mustelids [3-5].
      The seasonal 20% decrease and 15% re-growth of the most common proxy, braincase
      height, were documented at population level from extracted skulls post-mortem.
      Quantifying intra-individual change had so far been methodologically prohibitive.
      Here, we followed the intra-individual change in skull size and body mass
      throughout the full cycle in wild recaptured shrews (Sorex araneus). Using X-ray 
      images we showed that individuals decreased the size of their braincases in
      anticipation of winter by an average of 15.3%. Braincases then partially regrew
      in spring by 9.3%. Body mass decreased by 17.6% and then dramatically increased
      by 83.4% in spring. Thus, we demonstrate that the dramatic changes incurred by
      Dehnel's phenomenon occur in the individual's bone and other tissues.

AB  - Rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2)from fossil fuel combustion is acidifying
      our oceans [1,2]. This acidification is expected to have negative effects on
      calcifying animals because it affects their ability to build shells [3,4].
      However, the effects of ocean acidification in natural environments, subject to
      ecological and evolutionary processes (such as predation, competition, and
      adaptation), is uncertain [5,6]. These processes may buffer, or even reverse, the
      direct, short-term effects principally measured in laboratory experiments (for
      example, [6]). Here we describe the discovery of marine snails living at a
      shallow-water CO2 vent in the southwest Pacific, an environment 30 times more
      acidic than normal seawater (Figure 1). By measuring the chemical fingerprints
      locked within the shell material, we show that these snails have a restricted
      range of movement, which suggests that they live under these conditions for their
      entire lives. The existence of these snails demonstrates that calcifying animals 
      can build their shells under the acidic and corrosive conditions caused by
      extreme CO2 enrichment. This unforeseen capacity, whether driven by ecological or
      adaptive processes, is key to understanding whether calcifying life may survive a
      high-CO2 future.

AB  - Sleepwalkers' complex nocturnal behaviors have inspired fictional characters from
      Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth to Polidori's Vampyre to Cesare, the homicidal
      somnambulist in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Yet although the underlying
      pathophysiology of sleepwalking, i.e. the partial arousal from slow-wave sleep,
      is today well-documented, the detailed sensorimotor mechanisms permitting
      locomotion and further complex behaviors to occur outside of conscious control
      remain poorly understood [1]. Further, the paroxysmal character, nocturnal
      pattern, and spontaneous onset have made it nigh on impossible to study
      somnambulism behaviorally during wakefulness. The goal-directed walking paradigm 
      reported here, based on full-body motion capture and virtual reality feedback,
      directly addresses this issue and provides unique insights into the functional
      mechanisms of this common parasomnia: sleepwalkers exhibited improved movement
      automation and a stronger dissociation between locomotor control and awareness
      than matched controls when challenged with a cognitive load. Our data therefore
      suggest that behavioral markers exist in awake sleepwalkers, characterized by
      their ability to perform complex locomotor actions in the absence of full
      consciousness. Our findings are important as they firmly link sleepwalking to the
      neuroscience of motor control and motor awareness and may complement formal
      diagnosis procedures (normally requiring time, cost-intensive sleep studies and
      polysomnographic recordings).

AB  - Cells have to organize their complex biochemistry to regulate their metabolism
      and respond to changes in the environment. Traditionally, intracellular
      organization has been associated with compartments that are surrounded by lipid
      membranes. However, in recent years, phase transitions have emerged as a novel
      form of cellular organization. Phase transition is a physical process whereby a
      substance changes from one physical state to another. Examples are provided by
      the freezing of water into ice (liquid to solid) or the heating of water to
      generate water vapor (liquid to gas).

      Visual Working Memory.

AB  - An emerging view suggests that spatial position is an integral component of
      working memory (WM), such that non-spatial features are bound to locations
      regardless of whether space is relevant [1, 2]. For instance, past work has shown
      that stimulus position is spontaneously remembered when non-spatial features are 
      stored. Item recognition is enhanced when memoranda appear at the same location
      where they were encoded [3-5], and accessing non-spatial information elicits
      shifts of spatial attention to the original position of the stimulus [6, 7].
      However, these findings do not establish that a persistent, active representation
      of stimulus position is maintained in WM because similar effects have also been
      documented following storage in long-term memory [8, 9]. Here we show that the
      spatial position of the memorandum is actively coded by persistent neural
      activity during a non-spatial WM task. We used a spatial encoding model in
      conjunction with electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements of oscillatory
      alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity to track active representations of spatial
      position. The position of the stimulus varied trial to trial but was wholly
      irrelevant to the tasks. We nevertheless observed active neural representations
      of the original stimulus position that persisted throughout the retention
      interval. Further experiments established that these spatial representations are 
      dependent on the volitional storage of non-spatial features rather than being a
      lingering effect of sensory energy or initial encoding demands. These findings
      provide strong evidence that online spatial representations are spontaneously
      maintained in WM-regardless of task relevance-during the storage of non-spatial
      features.

AB  - The origins and lifeways of the inhabitants of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), a remote
      island in the southeast Pacific Ocean, have been debated for generations.
      Archaeological evidence substantiates the widely accepted view that the island
      was first settled by people of Polynesian origin, as late as 1200 CE [1-4]. What 
      remains controversial, however, is the nature of events in the island's
      population history prior to the first historic contact with Europeans in 1722 CE.
      Purported contact between Rapa Nui and South America is particularly contentious,
      and recent studies have reported genetic evidence for Native American admixture
      in present-day indigenous inhabitants of Rapa Nui [5-8]. Statistical modeling has
      suggested that this genetic contribution might have occurred prior to European
      contact [6]. Here we directly test the hypothesis that the Native American
      admixture of the current Rapa Nui population predates the arrival of Europeans
      with a paleogenomic analysis of five individual samples excavated from Ahu Nau
      Nau, Anakena, dating to pre- and post-European contact, respectively. Complete
      mitochondrial genomes and low-coverage autosomal genomes show that the analyzed
      individuals fall within the genetic diversity of present-day and ancient
      Polynesians, and we can reject the hypothesis that any of these individuals had
      substantial Native American ancestry. Our data thus suggest that the Native
      American ancestry in contemporary Easter Islanders was not present on the island 
      prior to European contact and may thus be due to events in more recent history.

AB  - The voice is the most direct link we have to others' minds, allowing us to
      communicate using a rich variety of speech cues [1, 2]. This link is particularly
      critical early in life as parents draw infants into the structure of their
      environment using infant-directed speech (IDS), a communicative code with unique 
      pitch and rhythmic characteristics relative to adult-directed speech (ADS) [3,
      4]. To begin breaking into language, infants must discern subtle statistical
      differences about people and voices in order to direct their attention toward the
      most relevant signals. Here, we uncover a new defining feature of IDS: mothers
      significantly alter statistical properties of vocal timbre when speaking to their
      infants. Timbre, the tone color or unique quality of a sound, is a spectral
      fingerprint that helps us instantly identify and classify sound sources, such as 
      individual people and musical instruments [5-7]. We recorded 24 mothers'
      naturalistic speech while they interacted with their infants and with adult
      experimenters in their native language. Half of the participants were English
      speakers, and half were not. Using a support vector machine classifier, we found 
      that mothers consistently shifted their timbre between ADS and IDS. Importantly, 
      this shift was similar across languages, suggesting that such alterations of
      timbre may be universal. These findings have theoretical implications for
      understanding how infants tune in to their local communicative environments.
      Moreover, our classification algorithm for identifying infant-directed timbre has
      direct translational implications for speech recognition technology.

TI  - Disruption of Core Planar Cell Polarity Signaling Regulates Renal Tubule
      Morphogenesis but Is Not Cystogenic.

AB  - Oriented cell division (OCD) and convergent extension (CE) shape developing renal
      tubules, and their disruption has been associated with polycystic kidney disease 
      (PKD) genes, the majority of which encode proteins that localize to primary
      cilia. Core planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling controls OCD and CE in other
      contexts, leading to the hypothesis that disruption of PCP signaling interferes
      with CE and/or OCD to produce PKD. Nonetheless, the contribution of PCP to
      tubulogenesis and cystogenesis is uncertain, and two major questions remain
      unanswered. Specifically, the inference that mutation of PKD genes interferes
      with PCP signaling is untested, and the importance of PCP signaling for
      cystogenic PKD phenotypes has not been examined. We show that, during
      proliferative stages, PCP signaling polarizes renal tubules to control OCD.
      However, we find that, contrary to the prevailing model, PKD mutations do not
      disrupt PCP signaling but instead act independently and in parallel with PCP
      signaling to affect OCD. Indeed, PCP signaling that is normally downregulated
      once development is completed is retained in cystic adult kidneys. Disrupting PCP
      signaling results in inaccurate control of tubule diameter, a tightly regulated
      parameter with important physiological ramifications. However, we show that
      disruption of PCP signaling is not cystogenic. Our results suggest that
      regulating tubule diameter is a key function of PCP signaling but that loss of
      this control does not induce cysts.

AB  - There has been growing interest in transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS), a non-invasive technique purported to modulate neural activity via weak, 
      externally applied electric fields. Although some promising preliminary data have
      been reported for applications ranging from stroke rehabilitation to cognitive
      enhancement, little is known about how tDCS affects the human brain, and some
      studies have concluded that it may have no effect at all. Here, we describe a
      macaque model of tDCS that allows us to simultaneously examine the effects of
      tDCS on brain activity and behavior. We find that applying tDCS to right
      prefrontal cortex improves monkeys' performance on an associative learning task. 
      While firing rates do not change within the targeted area, tDCS does induce large
      low-frequency oscillations in the underlying tissue. These oscillations alter
      functional connectivity, both locally and between distant brain areas, and these 
      long-range changes correlate with tDCS's effects on behavior. Together, these
      results are consistent with the idea that tDCS leads to widespread changes in
      brain activity and suggest that it may be a valuable method for cheaply and
      non-invasively altering functional connectivity in humans.

AB  - The Bruce effect refers to pregnancy termination in recently pregnant female
      rodents upon exposure to unfamiliar males [1]. This event occurs in specific
      combinations of laboratory mouse strains via the vomeronasal system [2, 3];
      however, the responsible chemosensory signals have not been fully identified.
      Here we demonstrate that the male pheromone exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1
      (ESP1) is one of the key factors that causes pregnancy block. Female mice
      exhibited high pregnancy failure rates upon encountering males that secreted
      different levels of ESP1 compared to the mated male. The effect was not observed 
      in mice that lacked the ESP1 receptor, V2Rp5, which is expressed in vomeronasal
      sensory neurons. Prolactin surges in the blood after mating, which are essential 
      for maintaining luteal function, were suppressed by ESP1 exposure, suggesting
      that a neuroendocrine mechanism underlies ESP1-mediated pregnancy failure. The
      single peptide pheromone ESP1 conveys not only maleness to promote female
      receptivity but also the males' characteristics to facilitate memorization of the
      mating partner.

AB  - Calcium carbonate platforms produced by reef-building stony corals over geologic 
      time are pervasive features around the world [1]; however, the mechanism by which
      these organisms produce the mineral is poorly understood (see review by [2]). It 
      is generally assumed that stony corals precipitate calcium carbonate
      extracellularly as aragonite in a calcifying medium between the calicoblastic
      ectoderm and pre-existing skeleton, separated from the overlying seawater [2].
      The calicoblastic ectoderm produces extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, secreted
      to the calcifying medium [3-6], which appear to provide the nucleation,
      alteration, elongation, and inhibition mechanisms of the biomineral [7] and
      remain occluded and preserved in the skeleton [8-10]. Here we show in cell
      cultures of the stony coral Stylophora pistillata that calcium is concentrated in
      intracellular pockets that are subsequently exported from the cell where a
      nucleation process leads to the formation of extracellular aragonite crystals.
      Analysis of the growing crystals by lattice light-sheet microscopy suggests that 
      the crystals elongate from the cells' surfaces outward.

AB  - Abiotic stresses impact negatively on plant growth, profoundly affecting yield
      and quality of crops. Although much is known about plant responses, very little
      is understood at the molecular level about the initial sensing of environmental
      stress. In plants, hypoxia (low oxygen, which occurs during flooding) is directly
      sensed by the Cys-Arg/N-end rule pathway of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,
      through oxygen-dependent degradation of group VII Ethylene Response Factor
      transcription factors (ERFVIIs) via amino-terminal (Nt-) cysteine [1, 2]. Using
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), we show that the
      pathway regulates plant responses to multiple abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis,
      genetic analyses revealed that response to these stresses is controlled by N-end 
      rule regulation of ERFVII function. Oxygen sensing via the Cys-Arg/N-end rule in 
      higher eukaryotes is linked through a single mechanism to nitric oxide (NO)
      sensing [3, 4]. In plants, the major mechanism of NO synthesis is via NITRATE
      REDUCTASE (NR), an enzyme of nitrogen assimilation [5]. Here, we identify a
      negative relationship between NR activity and NO levels and stabilization of an
      artificial Nt-Cys substrate and ERFVII function in response to environmental
      changes. Furthermore, we show that ERFVIIs enhance abiotic stress responses via
      physical and genetic interactions with the chromatin-remodeling ATPase BRAHMA. We
      propose that plants sense multiple abiotic stresses through the Cys-Arg/N-end
      rule pathway either directly (via oxygen sensing) or indirectly (via NO sensing
      downstream of NR activity). This single mechanism can therefore integrate
      environment and response to enhance plant survival.

AB  - By at least 45,000 years before present, anatomically modern humans had spread
      across Eurasia [1-3], but it is not well known how diverse these early
      populations were and whether they contributed substantially to later people or
      represent early modern human expansions into Eurasia that left no surviving
      descendants today. Analyses of genome-wide data from several ancient individuals 
      from Western Eurasia and Siberia have shown that some of these individuals have
      relationships to present-day Europeans [4, 5] while others did not contribute to 
      present-day Eurasian populations [3, 6]. As contributions from Upper Paleolithic 
      populations in Eastern Eurasia to present-day humans and their relationship to
      other early Eurasians is not clear, we generated genome-wide data from a
      40,000-year-old individual from Tianyuan Cave, China, [1, 7] to study his
      relationship to ancient and present-day humans. We find that he is more related
      to present-day and ancient Asians than he is to Europeans, but he shares more
      alleles with a 35,000-year-old European individual than he shares with other
      ancient Europeans, indicating that the separation between early Europeans and
      early Asians was not a single population split. We also find that the Tianyuan
      individual shares more alleles with some Native American groups in South America 
      than with Native Americans elsewhere, providing further support for population
      substructure in Asia [8] and suggesting that this persisted from 40,000 years ago
      until the colonization of the Americas. Our study of the Tianyuan individual
      highlights the complex migration and subdivision of early human populations in
      Eurasia.

AB  - Situated at the furthest northeastern edge of Canada, the island of Newfoundland 
      (approximately 110,000 km(2)) and Labrador (approximately 295,000 km(2)) today
      constitute a province characterized by abundant natural resources but low
      population density. Both landmasses were covered by the Laurentide ice sheet
      during the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years before present [YBP]); after the
      glacier retreated, ice patches remained on the island until ca. 9,000 calibrated 
      (cal) YBP [1]. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples, whose ancestors had trekked some
      5,000 km from the west coast, arrived approximately 10,000 cal YBP in Labrador
      and ca. 6,000 cal YBP in Newfoundland [2, 3]. Differential features in material
      culture indicate at least three settlement episodes by distinct cultural groups, 
      including the Maritime Archaic, Palaeoeskimo, and Beothuk. Newfoundland has
      remained home to indigenous peoples until present day with only one apparent
      hiatus (3,400-2,800 YBP). This record suggests abandonment, severe constriction, 
      or local extinction followed by subsequent immigrations from single or multiple
      source populations, but the specific dynamics and the cultural and biological
      relationships, if any, among these successive peoples remain enigmatic [4]. By
      examining the mitochondrial genome diversity and isotopic ratios of 74 ancient
      remains in conjunction with the archaeological record, we have provided
      definitive evidence for the genetic discontinuity between the maternal lineages
      of these populations. This northeastern margin of North America appears to have
      been populated multiple times by distinct groups that did not share a recent
      common ancestry, but rather one much deeper in time at the entry point into the
      continent.

AB  - The Lord Howe Island stick insect, Dryococelus australis, was once common on the 
      island but was driven to extinction after the arrival of ship rats in the early
      20(th) century [1, 2]. It was thought to be extinct for decades, until a tiny
      population of similar-looking stick insects was discovered 20 km away, on the
      islet of Ball's Pyramid, in 2001 [2]. Individuals from this population are
      currently being reared in Australia and elsewhere in the world, with the eventual
      goal of recolonizing Lord Howe Island [3]. Recent surveys of the wild population 
      on Ball's Pyramid suggest that it is among the world's rarest species. However,
      there are significant morphological differences between Ball's Pyramid and museum
      specimens, and there has never been a genetic confirmation of the rediscovered
      population's species identity. Because Dryococelus is monotypic, there are also
      no known extant relatives for comparison. Using shotgun genomic data from the
      Ball's Pyramid population, we assembled a draft genome and the complete
      mitochondrial genome. We found that the genome is massive, over 4 Gb in size, and
      is most likely hexaploid. We re-sequenced mitochondrial genomes from historic
      museum specimens collected on Lord Howe Island before the extinction event.
      Sequence divergence between the two populations is less than 1% and is within the
      range of intraspecific differences between the museum specimens, suggesting that 
      they are conspecific and that D. australis has successfully evaded extinction so 
      far. This work highlights the importance of museum collections for taxonomic
      validation in the context of ongoing conservation efforts.

AB  - Appropriate choice about delayed reward is fundamental to the survival of
      animals. Although animals tend to prefer immediate reward, delaying gratification
      is often advantageous. The dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic neurons have long been 
      implicated in the processing of delayed reward, but it has been unclear whether
      or when their activity causally directs choice. Here, we transiently augmented or
      reduced the activity of DR serotonergic neurons, while mice decided between
      differently delayed rewards as they performed a novel odor-guided intertemporal
      choice task. We found that these manipulations, precisely targeted at the
      decision point, were sufficient to bidirectionally influence impulsive choice.
      The manipulation specifically affected choices with more difficult trade-off.
      Similar effects were observed when we manipulated the serotonergic projections to
      the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We propose that DR serotonergic neurons preempt
      reward delays at the decision point and play a critical role in suppressing
      impulsive choice by regulating decision trade-off.

AB  - Experiences during early development can influence neuronal functions and
      modulate adult behaviors [1, 2]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
      long-term behavioral effects of these early experiences are not fully understood.
      The C. elegans ascr#3 (asc-DeltaC9; C9) pheromone triggers avoidance behavior in 
      adult hermaphrodites [3-7]. Here, we show that hermaphrodites that are briefly
      exposed to ascr#3 immediately after birth exhibit increased ascr#3-specific
      avoidance as adults, indicating that ascr#3-experienced animals form a
      long-lasting memory or imprint of this early ascr#3 exposure [8]. ascr#3
      imprinting is mediated by increased synaptic activity between the ascr#3-sensing 
      ADL neurons and their post-synaptic SMB motor neuron partners via increased
      expression of the odr-2 glycosylated phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked signaling 
      gene in the SMB neurons. Our study suggests that the memory for early ascr#3
      experience is imprinted via alteration of activity of a single synaptic
      connection, which in turn shapes experience-dependent plasticity in adult ascr#3 
      responses.

AB  - Nuclear movement is critical for developmental events, cell polarity, and
      migration and is usually mediated by linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton
      (LINC) complexes connecting the nucleus to cytoskeletal elements. Compared to
      active nuclear movement, relatively little is known about homeostatic positioning
      of nuclei, including whether it is an active process. To explore homeostatic
      nuclear positioning, we developed a method to displace nuclei in adherent cells
      using centrifugal force. Nuclei displaced by centrifugation rapidly recentered by
      mechanisms that depended on cell context. In cell monolayers with wounds oriented
      orthogonal to the force, nuclei were displaced toward the front and back of the
      cells on the two sides of the wound. Nuclei recentered from both positions, but
      at different rates and with different cytoskeletal linkage mechanisms. Rearward
      recentering was actomyosin, nesprin-2G, and SUN2 dependent, whereas forward
      recentering was microtubule, dynein, nesprin-2G, and SUN1 dependent. Nesprin-2G
      engaged actin through its N terminus and microtubules through a novel dynein
      interacting site near its C terminus. Both activities were necessary to maintain 
      nuclear position in uncentrifuged cells. Thus, even when not moving, nuclei are
      actively maintained in position by engaging the cytoskeleton through the LINC
      complex.

AB  - Episodic memories are information-rich, often multisensory events that rely on
      binding different elements [1]. The elements that will constitute a memory
      episode are processed in specialized but distinct brain modules. The binding of
      these elements is most likely mediated by fast-acting long-term potentiation
      (LTP), which relies on the precise timing of neural activity [2]. Theta
      oscillations in the hippocampus orchestrate such timing as demonstrated by animal
      studies in vitro [3, 4] and in vivo [5, 6], suggesting a causal role of theta
      activity for the formation of complex memory episodes, but direct evidence from
      humans is missing. Here, we show that human episodic memory formation depends on 
      phase synchrony between different sensory cortices at the theta frequency. By
      modulating the luminance of visual stimuli and the amplitude of auditory stimuli,
      we directly manipulated the degree of phase synchrony between visual and auditory
      cortices. Memory for sound-movie associations was significantly better when the
      stimuli were presented in phase compared to out of phase. This effect was
      specific to theta (4 Hz) and did not occur in slower (1.7 Hz) or faster (10.5 Hz)
      frequencies. These findings provide the first direct evidence that episodic
      memory formation in humans relies on a theta-specific synchronization mechanism.

AB  - Life originated in the sea and evolved its early metabolic pathways in water [1, 
      2]. Nevertheless, activities of organisms on land have influenced and enriched
      marine ecosystems with oxygen and nutrients for billions of years [3-7]. In
      contrast to the history of species diversity in the sea and on land [8-10] and
      the flows of resources within and between these two realms [11], little is known 
      about the times and places of origin of major metabolic and ecological
      innovations during the Phanerozoic. Many innovations among multicellular
      organisms originated in the sea during or before the Cambrian, including
      predation and most of its variations, biomineralization, colonial or clonal
      growth, bioerosion, deposit feeding, bioturbation by animals, communication at a 
      distance by vision and olfaction, photosymbiosis, chemosymbiosis, suspension
      feeding, osmotrophy, internal fertilization, jet propulsion, undulatory
      locomotion, and appendages for movement. Activity is less constrained in air than
      in the denser, more viscous medium of water [9, 12-14]. I therefore predict that 
      high-performance metabolic and ecological innovations should predominantly
      originate on land after the Ordovician once organisms had conquered the
      challenges of life away from water and later appeared in the sea, either in
      marine-colonizing clades or by arising separately in clades that never left the
      sea. In support of this hypothesis, I show that 11 of 13 major post-Ordovician
      innovations appeared first or only on land. This terrestrial locus of innovation 
      cannot be explained by the Cretaceous to recent expansion of diversity on land.
      It reveals one of several irreversible shifts in the history of life.

AB  - Path integration is a widespread navigational strategy in which directional
      changes and distance covered are continuously integrated on an outward journey,
      enabling a straight-line return to home. Bees use vision for this task-a
      celestial-cue-based visual compass and an optic-flow-based visual odometer-but
      the underlying neural integration mechanisms are unknown. Using intracellular
      electrophysiology, we show that polarized-light-based compass neurons and
      optic-flow-based speed-encoding neurons converge in the central complex of the
      bee brain, and through block-face electron microscopy, we identify potential
      integrator cells. Based on plausible output targets for these cells, we propose a
      complete circuit for path integration and steering in the central complex, with
      anatomically identified neurons suggested for each processing step. The resulting
      model circuit is thus fully constrained biologically and provides a functional
      interpretation for many previously unexplained architectural features of the
      central complex. Moreover, we show that the receptive fields of the newly
      discovered speed neurons can support path integration for the holonomic motion
      (i.e., a ground velocity that is not precisely aligned with body orientation)
      typical of bee flight, a feature not captured in any previously proposed model of
      path integration. In a broader context, the model circuit presented provides a
      general mechanism for producing steering signals by comparing current and desired
      headings-suggesting a more basic function for central complex connectivity, from 
      which path integration may have evolved.

AB  - Tissue morphogenesis relies on the production of active cellular forces.
      Understanding how such forces are mechanically converted into cell shape changes 
      is essential to our understanding of morphogenesis. Here, we use myosin II
      pulsatile activity during Drosophila embryogenesis to study how transient forces 
      generate irreversible cell shape changes. Analyzing the dynamics of junction
      shortening and elongation resulting from myosin II pulses, we find that long
      pulses yield less reversible deformations, typically a signature of dissipative
      mechanics. This is consistent with a simple viscoelastic description, which we
      use to model individual shortening and elongation events. The model predicts that
      dissipation typically occurs on the minute timescale, a timescale commensurate
      with that of force generation by myosin II pulses. We test this estimate by
      applying time-controlled forces on junctions with optical tweezers. Finally, we
      show that actin turnover participates in dissipation, as reducing it
      pharmacologically increases the reversibility of contractile events. Our results 
      argue that active junctional deformation is stabilized by actin-dependent
      dissipation. Hence, tissue morphogenesis requires coordination between force
      generation and dissipation.

AB  - The origin of animals, one of the major transitions in evolution, remains
      mysterious. Many key aspects of animal evolution can be reconstructed by
      comparing living species within a robust phylogenetic framework. However,
      uncertainty remains regarding the evolutionary relationships between two ancient 
      animal lineages - sponges and ctenophores - and the remaining animal phyla.
      Comparative morphology and some phylogenomic analyses support the view that
      sponges represent the sister lineage to the rest of the animals, while other
      phylogenomic analyses support ctenophores, a phylum of carnivorous, gelatinous
      marine organisms, as the sister lineage. Here, we explore why different studies
      yield different answers and discuss the implications of the two alternative
      hypotheses for understanding the origin of animals. Reconstruction of ancient
      evolutionary radiations is devilishly difficult and will likely require broader
      sampling of sponge and ctenophore genomes, improved analytical strategies and
      critical analyses of the phylogenetic distribution and molecular mechanisms
      underlying apparently conserved traits. Rather than staking out positions in
      favor of the ctenophores-sister or the sponges-sister hypothesis, we submit that 
      research programs aimed at understanding the biology of the first animals should 
      instead embrace the uncertainty surrounding early animal evolution in their
      experimental designs.

AB  - Formins polymerize actin filaments for the cytokinetic contractile ring. Using in
      vitro reconstitution of fission yeast contractile ring precursor nodes containing
      formins and myosin, a new study shows that formin-mediated polymerization is

      result that has broad implications for cellular mechanosensing.

AB  - During seed development, an important transfer of nutrients occurs between the
      seed coat and the embryo. A new study reveals that, for inorganic phosphate (Pi),
      this function is transiently performed by PHO1, a protein associated previously
      with Pi loading into the xylem.

AB  - The pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata, is the most enigmatic living whale.
      Little is known about its ecology and behaviour, but unusual specialisations of
      visual pigments [1], mitochondrial tRNAs [2], and postcranial anatomy [3] suggest
      a lifestyle different from that of other extant whales. Geographically, Caperea
      represents the only major baleen whale lineage entirely restricted to the
      Southern Ocean. Caperea-like fossils, the oldest of which date to the Late
      Miocene, are exceedingly rare and likewise limited to the Southern Hemisphere
      [4], despite a more substantial history of fossil sampling north of the equator. 
      Two new Pleistocene fossils now provide unexpected evidence of a brief and
      relatively recent period in geological history when Caperea occurred in the
      Northern Hemisphere (Figure 1A,B).

AB  - Desert biological soil crusts (BSC), among the harshest environments on Earth,
      are formed by the adhesion of soil particles to polysaccharides excreted mainly
      by filamentous cyanobacteria (see [1] and references therein). These species are 
      the main primary producers in this habitat where they cope with various stressors
      including frequent hydration-dehydration cycles. Water is mainly provided as
      early-morning dew, followed by dehydration with rising temperatures and declining
      relative humidity. Earlier studies focused on community structure and
      cyanobacterial activities in various BSCs [1,2]. They identified genes present in
      dehydration-tolerant, but not -sensitive cyanobacteria [3], and suggested that
      abiotic conditions during natural dehydration (Figure 1A) are critical for the
      recovery upon rewetting. Inability of Leptolyngbya ohadii, which is abundant in
      the BSC examined here, to recover after rapid desiccation (Figure 1B) [4]
      suggested that the cells must prepare themselves toward forthcoming dehydration, 
      but the nature of the signal involved was unknown. We show here that the rising
      dawn illumination, perceived by photo-sensors, serves as the signal inciting
      BSC-inhabiting cyanobacteria to prepare for forthcoming dehydration. L. ohadii
      filaments were exposed to simulated natural conditions from the morning of
      October 14(th) 2009, using our environmental chamber that enables accurate
      reproduction of BSC environment [4] (Supplemental Figure S1A). Samples were
      withdrawn at specific time points (Figure 1A), followed by RNA extraction and
      global transcript profiling (accession PRJNA391854). Four hours of dehydration
      led to up-regulation of 567 genes and down-regulation of 1597 (by more than
      2-fold). Since BSC-inhabiting organisms have not been used as genetic models, the
      functions of 3258 (43.5% of the 7487 L. ohadii genes [3]) are unknown.
      Nevertheless, a pronounced rise in transcript levels of genes involved in carbon 
      metabolism, transport, osmolyte production, energy dissipation and other cellular
      activities was observed. On the other hand, a declining transcript abundance for 
      genes involved in light harvesting, photosynthetic metabolism, protein
      biosynthesis, cell division and other pathways was detected. The analysis
      unraveled clear distinctions between early- and late-responding genes.
      Supplemental Table S1 lists the 40 strongest differentially expressed genes
      verified by RT-qPCR and used in further analyses.

AB  - Centrioles are small barrel-shaped structures that form centrosomes and cilia
      [1]. Centrioles assemble around a central cartwheel comprising the Sas-6 and
      Ana2/STIL proteins. The amino termini of nine Sas-6 dimers form a central hub of 
      approximately 12 nm radius from which nine dimer spokes radiate, placing the
      Sas-6 carboxyl termini at the outer edge of the approximately 60 nm radius
      cartwheel [2]. Several centriole proteins are distributed in a toroid around the 
      cartwheel, and super-resolution light microscopy studies have measured the
      average radii of these approximately 100-200 nm radius toroids with a 'precision'
      - or standard deviation (s.d. or 1sigma) - of +/- approximately 10-40 nm. The
      organization of Ana2/STIL within the cartwheel, however, has not been resolvable.
      Here, we develop methods to calculate the average toroidal radius of centriolar
      proteins in the approximately 20-60 nm range with a s.d. of just +/-
      approximately 4-5 nm, revealing that the amino and carboxyl termini of Ana2 are
      located in the outer cartwheel region.

AB  - Maeterlinck did not mean to suggest that honeybees rival humans in intelligence -
      rather he saw in the bee a qualitatively different form of intelligence, tailored
      to the challenges of a profoundly different kind of society and lifestyle.
      Insects are strange "aliens from inner space", with sensory and cognitive worlds 
      wholly different from our own. The 19(th) century discovery that ants can detect 
      ultraviolet light triggered a golden age in the exploration of the diversity of
      sensory systems of insects (and indeed other animals), identifying such abilities
      as magnetic compasses, electrosensitivity, polarization vision, and peculiar
      locations for sense organs such as the infrared sensors on the abdomens of some
      beetles or photoreceptors on the genitalia of some butterflies. Could insect
      minds be equally strange and diverse?

AB  - During the late 1940s and 1950s, a pseudo-scientific concept based on
      Marxist-Leninist ideology became internationally known as 'Lysenkoism'.
      Lysenkoism was a neo-Lamarckian idea, claiming that in crop plants, such as
      wheat, environmental influences are heritable via all cells of the organism.
      Lysenkoism was applied to agriculture during the Stalin era with disastrous
      consequences. Despite the triumphs of modern genetics, and the disproval of
      Lysenkoism, recent years have seen a 're-thinking' of this doctrine in Russia.
      This disturbing pro-Lysenko movement, which is accompanied by a growing sympathy 
      for Stalin, claims to have its scientific roots in modern epigenetics,
      specifically the heritability of variation by mechanisms other than changes in
      DNA sequence. Based on recent research on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,
      its is clear that Lysenkoism has nothing to do with heritable 'epigenetic'
      modifications. Biologists should defend science against ideological and political
      interferences.

TI  - Rates of Molecular Evolution Suggest Natural History of Life History Traits and a
      Post-K-Pg Nocturnal Bottleneck of Placentals.

AB  - Life history and behavioral traits are often difficult to discern from the fossil
      record, but evolutionary rates of genes and their changes over time can be
      inferred from extant genomic data. Under the neutral theory, molecular
      evolutionary rate is a product of mutation rate and the proportion of neutral
      mutations [1, 2]. Mutation rates may be shared across the genome, whereas
      proportions of neutral mutations vary among genes because functional constraints 
      vary. By analyzing evolutionary rates of 1,185 genes in a phylogeny of 89
      mammals, we extracted historical profiles of functional constraints on these
      rates in the form of gene-branch interactions. By applying a novel statistical
      approach to these profiles, we reconstructed the history of ten discrete traits
      related to activity, diet, and social behaviors. Our results indicate that the
      ancestor of placental mammals was solitary, seasonally breeding, insectivorous,
      and likely nocturnal. The results suggest placental diversification began 10-20
      million years before the K-Pg boundary (66 million years ago), with some
      ancestors of extant placental mammals becoming diurnal and adapted to different
      diets. However, from the Paleocene to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT, 33.9 
      mya), we detect a post-K-Pg nocturnal bottleneck where all ancestral lineages of 
      extant placentals were nocturnal. Although diurnal placentals may have existed
      during the elevated global temperatures of the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
      [3], we hypothesize that diurnal placentals were selectively extirpated during or
      after the global cooling of the EOT, whereas some nocturnal lineages survived due
      to preadaptations to cold environments [4].

AB  - Humans are intrinsically social animals, forming enduring affiliative bonds [1]. 
      However, a striking minority with psychopathic traits, who present with violent
      and antisocial behaviors, tend to value other people only insofar as they
      contribute to their own advancement [2, 3]. Extant research has addressed the
      neurocognitive processes associated with aggression in such individuals, but we
      know remarkably little about processes underlying their atypical social
      affiliation. This is surprising, given the importance of affiliation and bonding 
      in promoting social order and reducing aggression [4, 5]. Human laughter engages 
      brain areas that facilitate social reciprocity and emotional resonance,
      consistent with its established role in promoting affiliation and social cohesion
      [6-8]. We show that, compared with typically developing boys, those at risk for
      antisocial behavior in general (irrespective of their risk of psychopathy)
      display reduced neural response to laughter in the supplementary motor area, a
      premotor region thought to facilitate motor readiness to join in during social
      behavior [9-11]. Those at highest risk for developing psychopathy additionally
      show reduced neural responses to laughter in the anterior insula. This region is 
      implicated in auditory-motor processing and in linking action tendencies with
      emotional experience and subjective feelings [10, 12, 13]. Furthermore, this same
      group reports reduced desire to join in with the laughter of others-a behavioral 
      profile in part accounted for by the attenuated anterior insula response. These
      findings suggest that atypical processing of laughter could represent a novel
      mechanism that impoverishes social relationships and increases risk for
      psychopathy and antisocial behavior.

AB  - There is increasing interest in how the phase of local oscillatory activity
      within a brain area determines the long-range functional connectivity of that
      area. For example, increasing convergent evidence from a range of methodologies
      suggests that beta (20 Hz) oscillations may play a vital role in the function of 
      the motor system [1-5]. The "communication through coherence" hypothesis posits
      that the precise phase of coherent oscillations in network nodes is a determinant
      of successful communication between them [6, 7]. Here we set out to determine
      whether oscillatory activity in the beta band serves to support this theory
      within the cortical motor network in vivo. We combined non-invasive transcranial 
      alternating-current stimulation (tACS) [8-12] with resting-state functional MRI
      (fMRI) [13] to follow both changes in local activity and long-range connectivity,
      determined by inter-areal blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlation,
      as a proxy for communication in the human cortex. Twelve healthy subjects
      participated in three fMRI scans with 20 Hz, 5 Hz, or sham tACS applied
      separately on each scan. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at beta
      frequency has previously been shown to increase local activity in the beta band
      [14] and to modulate long-range connectivity within the default mode network
      [15]. We demonstrated that beta-frequency tACS significantly changed the
      connectivity pattern of the stimulated primary motor cortex (M1), without
      changing overall local activity or network connectivity. This finding is
      supported by a simple phase-precession model, which demonstrates the plausibility
      of the results and provides emergent predictions that are consistent with our
      empirical findings. These findings therefore inform our understanding of how
      local oscillatory activity may underpin network connectivity.

AB  - Area prostriata is a cortical area at the fundus of the calcarine sulcus,
      described anatomically in humans [1-5] and other primates [6-9]. It is lightly
      myelinated and lacks the clearly defined six-layer structure evident throughout
      the cerebral cortex, with a thinner layer 4 and thicker layer 2 [10],
      characteristic of limbic cortex [11]. In the marmoset and rhesus monkey, area
      prostriata has cortical connections with MT+ [12], the cingulate motor cortex
      [8], the auditory cortex [13], the orbitofrontal cortex, and the frontal polar
      cortices [14]. Here we use functional magnetic resonance together with a
      wide-field projection system to study its functional properties in humans. With
      population receptive field mapping [15], we show that area prostriata has a
      complete representation of the visual field, clearly distinct from the adjacent
      area V1. As in the marmoset, the caudal-dorsal border of human
      prostriata-abutting V1-represents the far peripheral visual field, with
      eccentricities decreasing toward its rostral boundary. Area prostriata responds
      strongly to very fast motion, greater than 500 degrees /s. The functional
      properties of area prostriata suggest that it may serve to alert the brain
      quickly to fast visual events, particularly in the peripheral visual field.

TI  - Nesprin-1alpha-Dependent Microtubule Nucleation from the Nuclear Envelope via
      Akap450 Is Necessary for Nuclear Positioning in Muscle Cells.
PG  - 2999-3009.e9

AB  - The nucleus is the main microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in muscle cells due 
      to the accumulation of centrosomal proteins and microtubule (MT) nucleation
      activity at the nuclear envelope (NE) [1-4]. The relocalization of centrosomal
      proteins, including Pericentrin, Pcm1, and gamma-tubulin, depends on Nesprin-1,
      an outer nuclear membrane (ONM) protein that connects the nucleus to the
      cytoskeleton via its N-terminal region [5-7]. Nesprins are also involved in the
      recruitment of kinesin to the NE and play a role in nuclear positioning in
      skeletal muscle cells [8-12]. However, a function for MT nucleation from the NE
      in nuclear positioning has not been established. Using the proximity-dependent
      biotin identification (BioID) method [13, 14], we found several centrosomal
      proteins, including Akap450, Pcm1, and Pericentrin, whose association with
      Nesprin-1alpha is increased in differentiated myotubes. We show that
      Nesprin-1alpha recruits Akap450 to the NE independently of kinesin and that
      Akap450, but not other centrosomal proteins, is required for MT nucleation from
      the NE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism is disrupted in
      congenital muscular dystrophy patient myotubes carrying a nonsense mutation
      within the SYNE1 gene (23560 G>T) encoding Nesprin-1 [15, 16]. Finally, using
      computer simulation and cell culture systems, we provide evidence for a role of
      MT nucleation from the NE on nuclear spreading in myotubes. Our data thus reveal 
      a novel function for Nesprin-1alpha/Nesprin-1 in nuclear positioning through
      recruitment of Akap450-mediated MT nucleation activity to the NE.

      Inheritance.

AB  - Retrotransposons are a pervasive class of mobile elements present in the genomes 
      of virtually all forms of life [1, 2]. In metazoans, these are preferentially
      active in the germline, which, in turn, mounts defenses that restrain their
      activity [3, 4]. Here we report that certain classes of retrotransposons ensure
      transgenerational inheritance by invading presumptive germ cells before they are 
      formed. Using sensitized Drosophila and zebrafish models, we found that diverse
      classes of retrotransposons migrate to the germ plasm, a specialized region of
      the oocyte that prefigures germ cells and specifies the germline of descendants
      in the fertilized egg. In Drosophila, we found evidence for a "stowaway" model,
      whereby Tahre retroelements traffic to the germ plasm by mimicking oskar RNAs and
      engaging the Staufen-dependent active transport machinery. Consistent with this, 
      germ plasm determinants attracted retroelement RNAs even when these components
      were ectopically positioned in bipolar oocytes. Likewise, vertebrate
      retrotransposons similarly migrated to the germ plasm in zebrafish oocytes.
      Together, these results suggest that germ plasm targeting represents a fitness
      strategy adopted by some retrotransposons to ensure transgenerational
      propagation.

AB  - The functional variety in neuronal composition of an adult brain is established
      during development. Recent studies proposed that interactions between genetic
      intrinsic programs and external cues are necessary to generate proper neural
      diversity [1]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental
      process are still poorly understood. Three main subtypes of Drosophila mushroom
      body (MB) neurons are sequentially generated during development and provide a
      good example of developmental neural plasticity [2]. Our present data propose
      that the environmentally controlled steroid hormone ecdysone functions as a
      regulator of early-born MB neuron fate during larval-pupal transition. We found
      that the BTB-zinc finger factor Chinmo acts upstream of ecdysone signaling to
      promote a neuronal fate switch. Indeed, Chinmo regulates the expression of the
      ecdysone receptor B1 isoform to mediate the production of gamma and alpha'beta'
      MB neurons. In addition, we provide genetic evidence for a regulatory negative
      feedback loop driving the alpha'beta' to alphabeta MB neuron transition in which 
      ecdysone signaling in turn controls microRNA let-7 depression of Chinmo
      expression. Thus, our results uncover a novel interaction in the MB neural
      specification pathway for temporal control of neuronal identity by interplay
      between an extrinsic hormonal signal and an intrinsic transcription factor
      cascade.

TI  - Actin Turnover in Lamellipodial Fragments.

AB  - Actin turnover is the central driving force underlying lamellipodial motility.
      The molecular components involved are largely known, and their properties have
      been studied extensively in vitro. However, a comprehensive picture of actin
      turnover in vivo is still missing. We focus on fragments from fish epithelial
      keratocytes, which are essentially stand-alone motile lamellipodia. The geometric
      simplicity of the fragments and the absence of additional actin structures allow 
      us to characterize the spatiotemporal lamellipodial actin organization with
      unprecedented detail. We use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching,
      fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and extraction experiments to show that
      about two-thirds of the lamellipodial actin diffuses in the cytoplasm with nearly
      uniform density, whereas the rest forms the treadmilling polymer network. Roughly
      a quarter of the diffusible actin pool is in filamentous form as diffusing
      oligomers, indicating that severing and debranching are important steps in the
      disassembly process generating oligomers as intermediates. The remaining
      diffusible actin concentration is orders of magnitude higher than the in vitro
      actin monomer concentration required to support the observed polymerization
      rates, implying that the majority of monomers are transiently kept in a
      non-polymerizable "reserve" pool. The actin network disassembles and reassembles 
      throughout the lamellipodium within seconds, so the lamellipodial network
      turnover is local. The diffusible actin transport, on the other hand, is global: 
      actin subunits typically diffuse across the entire lamellipodium before
      reassembling into the network. This combination of local network turnover and
      global transport of dissociated subunits through the cytoplasm makes actin
      transport robust yet rapidly adaptable and amenable to regulation.

TI  - Distinct Roles of Ventromedial versus Ventrolateral Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons
      in Reward-Oriented Behavior.

AB  - The ventral striatum (VS) is a key brain center regulating reward-oriented
      behavior [1-4]. The VS can be anatomically divided into medial (VMS) and lateral 
      (VLS) portions based on cortical input patterns. The VMS receives inputs from
      medial pallium-originated limbic structures (e.g., the medial prefrontal cortex
      [mPFC]), and the VLS receives inputs from the lateral pallium-originated areas
      (e.g., the insula) [5, 6]. This anatomical feature led us to hypothesize a
      functional segregation within the VS in terms of the regulation of
      reward-oriented behavior. Here, we engineered a fiber photometry system [4] and
      monitored population-level Ca(2+) activities of dopamine D2-receptor-expressing
      medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), one of the major cell types in the striatum,
      during a food-seeking discrimination task. We found that VLS D2-MSNs were
      activated at the time of cue presentation. In stark contrast, VMS D2-MSNs were
      inhibited at this time point. Optogenetic counteraction of those changes in the
      VLS and VMS impaired action initiation and increased responding toward
      non-rewarded cues, respectively. During lever-press reversal training, VMS
      inhibition at the time of cue presentation temporarily ceased and optogenetic
      activation of VMS D2-MSNs facilitated acquisition of the new contingency. These
      data indicate that the opposing inhibition and excitation in VMS and VLS are
      important for selecting and initiating a proper action in a reward-oriented
      behavior. We propose distinct subregional roles within the VS in the execution of
      successful reward-oriented behavior.

TI  - PHO1 Exports Phosphate from the Chalazal Seed Coat to the Embryo in Developing

AB  - Seed production requires the transfer of nutrients from the maternal seed coat to
      the filial endosperm and embryo. Because seed coat and filial tissues are
      symplasmically isolated, nutrients arriving in the seed coat via the phloem must 
      be exported to the apoplast before reaching the embryo. Proteins implicated in
      the transfer of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the seed coat to the embryo are
      unknown despite seed P content being an important agronomic trait. Here we show
      that the Arabidopsis Pi exporters PHO1 and PHOH1 are expressed in the chalazal
      seed coat (CZSC) of developing seeds. PHO1 is additionally expressed in
      developing ovules. Phosphorus (P) content and Pi flux between the seed coat and
      embryo were analyzed in seeds from grafts between WT roots and scions from either
      pho1, phoh1, or the pho1 phoh1 double mutant. Whereas P content and distribution 
      between the seed coat and embryo in fully mature dry seeds of these mutants are
      similar to the WT, at the mature green stage of seed development the seed coat of
      the pho1 and pho1 phoh1 mutants, but not of the phoh1 mutant, retains
      approximately 2-fold more P than its WT control. Expression of PHO1 under a
      CZSC-specific promoter complemented the seed P distribution phenotype of the pho1
      phoh1 double mutant. CZSC-specific down-expression of PHO1 also recapitulated the
      seed P distribution phenotype of pho1. Together, these experiments show that PHO1
      expression in the CZSC is important for the transfer of P from the seed coat to
      the embryo in developing seeds.

TI  - Single-Neuron Correlates of Conscious Perception in the Human Medial Temporal
      Lobe.

AB  - The neuronal mechanisms giving rise to conscious perception remain largely
      elusive [1]. It is known that the strength of single-neuron activity correlates
      with conscious perception, especially in anterior regions of the ventral pathway 
      in non-human primates [2-4] and in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) [5, 6].
      It is unclear, however, whether single-neuron correlates of conscious perception 
      are characterized solely by the magnitude of neuronal responses, and whether the 
      correlates of perception are equally prominent across different regions of the
      human MTL. While recording from 2,735 neurons in 21 neurosurgical patients during
      40 experimental sessions, we created experimental conditions in which otherwise
      identical visual stimuli are sometimes seen and sometimes not detected at all by 
      means of the attentional blink, i.e., the phenomenon that the second of two
      target stimuli in close succession often goes unnoticed to conscious perception
      [7]. Remarkably, responses to unseen versus seen stimuli were delayed and
      temporally more dispersed, in addition to being attenuated in firing rate. This
      finding suggests precise timing of neuronal responses as a novel candidate
      physiological marker of conscious perception. In addition, we found modulation of
      neuronal response timing and strength in response to seen versus unseen stimuli
      to increase along an anatomical gradient from the posterior to the anterior MTL. 
      Our results thus map out the neuronal correlates of conscious perception in the
      human MTL both in time and in space.

AB  - Asexual reproduction in animals, though rare, is the main or exclusive mode of
      reproduction in some long-lived lineages. The longevity of asexual clades may be 
      correlated with the maintenance of heterozygosity by mechanisms that rearrange
      genomes and reduce recombination. Asexual species thus provide an opportunity to 
      gain insight into the relationship between molecular changes, genome
      architecture, and cellular processes. Here we report the genome sequence of the
      parthenogenetic nematode Diploscapter pachys with only one chromosome pair. We
      show that this unichromosomal architecture is shared by a long-lived clade of
      asexual nematodes closely related to the genetic model organism Caenorhabditis
      elegans. Analysis of the genome assembly reveals that the unitary chromosome
      arose through fusion of six ancestral chromosomes, with extensive rearrangement
      among neighboring regions. Typical nematode telomeres and telomeric
      protection-encoding genes are lacking. Most regions show significant
      heterozygosity; homozygosity is largely concentrated to one region and attributed
      to gene conversion. Cell-biological and molecular evidence is consistent with the
      absence of key features of meiosis I, including synapsis and recombination. We
      propose that D. pachys preserves heterozygosity and produces diploid embryos
      without fertilization through a truncated meiosis. As a prelude to functional
      studies, we demonstrate that D. pachys is amenable to experimental manipulation
      by RNA interference.

AB  - Caveolae introduce flask-shaped convolutions into the plasma membrane and help to
      protect the plasma membrane from damage under stretch forces. The protein
      components that form the bulb of caveolae are increasingly well characterized,
      but less is known about the contribution of proteins that localize to the
      constricted neck. Here we make extensive use of multiple CRISPR/Cas9-generated
      gene knockout and knockin cell lines to investigate the role of Eps15 Homology
      Domain (EHD) proteins at the neck of caveolae. We show that EHD1, EHD2, and EHD4 
      are recruited to caveolae. Recruitment of the other EHDs increases markedly when 
      EHD2, which has been previously detected at caveolae, is absent. Construction of 
      knockout cell lines lacking EHDs 1, 2, and 4 confirms this apparent functional
      redundancy. Two striking sets of phenotypes are observed in EHD1,2,4 knockout
      cells: (1) the characteristic clustering of caveolae into higher-order assemblies
      is absent; and (2) when the EHD1,2,4 knockout cells are subjected to prolonged
      cycles of stretch forces, caveolae are destabilized and the plasma membrane is
      prone to rupture. Our data identify the first molecular components that act to
      cluster caveolae into a membrane ultrastructure with the potential to extend
      stretch-buffering capacity and support a revised model for the function of EHDs
      at the caveolar neck.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents premature sister chromatid
      separation during mitosis. Phosphorylation of unattached kinetochores by the Mps1
      kinase promotes recruitment of SAC machinery that catalyzes assembly of the SAC
      effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). The SAC protein Bub3 is a
      phospho-amino acid adaptor that forms structurally related stable complexes with 
      functionally distinct paralogs named Bub1 and BubR1. A short motif ("loop") of
      Bub1, but not the equivalent loop of BubR1, enhances binding of Bub3 to
      kinetochore phospho-targets. Here, we asked whether the BubR1 loop directs Bub3
      to different phospho-targets. The BubR1 loop is essential for SAC function and
      cannot be removed or replaced with the Bub1 loop. BubR1 loop mutants bind Bub3
      and are normally incorporated in MCC in vitro but have reduced ability to inhibit
      the MCC target anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), suggesting that BubR1:Bub3
      recognition and inhibition of APC/C requires phosphorylation. Thus, small
      sequence differences in Bub1 and BubR1 direct Bub3 to different phosphorylated
      targets in the SAC signaling cascade.

AB  - It has long been accepted that differential radial thickening of guard cells
      plays an important role in the turgor-driven shape changes required for stomatal 
      pore opening to occur [1-4]. This textbook description derives from an original
      interpretation of structure rather than measurement of mechanical properties.
      Here we show, using atomic force microscopy, that although mature guard cells
      display a radial gradient of stiffness, this is not present in immature guard
      cells, yet young stomata show a normal opening response. Finite element modeling 
      supports the experimental observation that radial stiffening plays a very limited
      role in stomatal opening. In addition, our analysis reveals an unexpected
      stiffening of the polar regions of the stomata complexes, both in Arabidopsis and
      other plants, suggesting a widespread occurrence. Combined experimental data
      (analysis of guard cell wall epitopes and treatment of tissue with cell wall
      digesting enzymes, coupled with bioassay of guard cell function) plus modeling
      lead us to propose that polar stiffening reflects a mechanical, pectin-based
      pinning down of the guard cell ends, which restricts increase of stomatal complex
      length during opening. This is predicted to lead to an improved response
      sensitivity of stomatal aperture movement with respect to change of turgor
      pressure. Our results provide new insight into the mechanics of stomatal
      function, both negating an established view of the importance of radial
      thickening and providing evidence for a significant role for polar stiffening.
      Improved stomatal performance via altered cell-wall-mediated mechanics is likely 
      to be of evolutionary and agronomic significance.

AB  - The flattening of leaves to form broad blades is an important adaptation that
      maximizes photosynthesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this
      process remains unclear. The WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes WOX1 and PRS
      are expressed in the leaf marginal domain to enable leaf flattening, but the
      nature of WOX expression establishment remains elusive. Here, we report that
      adaxial-expressed MONOPTEROS (MP) and abaxial-enriched auxin together act as
      positional cues for patterning the WOX domain. MP directly binds to the WOX1 and 
      PRS promoters and activates their expression. Furthermore, redundant
      abaxial-enriched ARF repressors suppress WOX1 and PRS expression, also through
      direct binding. In particular, we show that ARF2 is redundantly required with
      ARF3 and ARF4 to maintain the abaxial identity. Taken together, these findings
      explain how adaxial-abaxial polarity patterns the mediolateral axis and
      subsequent lateral expansion of leaves.

AB  - Like many visually active animals, including humans, flies generate both smooth
      and rapid saccadic movements to stabilize their gaze. How rapid body saccades and
      smooth movement interact for simultaneous object pursuit and gaze stabilization
      is not understood. We directly observed these interactions in magnetically
      tethered Drosophila free to rotate about the yaw axis. A moving bar elicited
      sustained bouts of saccades following the bar, with surprisingly little smooth
      movement. By contrast, a moving panorama elicited robust smooth movement
      interspersed with occasional optomotor saccades. The amplitude, angular velocity,
      and torque transients of bar-fixation saccades were finely tuned to the speed of 
      bar motion and were triggered by a threshold in the temporal integral of the bar 
      error angle rather than its absolute retinal position error. Optomotor saccades
      were tuned to the dynamics of panoramic image motion and were triggered by a
      threshold in the integral of velocity over time. A hybrid control model based on 
      integrated motion cues simulates saccade trigger and dynamics. We propose a novel
      algorithm for tuning fixation saccades in flies.

AB  - Transgene expression from the plastid (chloroplast) genome provides unique
      advantages, including high levels of foreign protein accumulation, convenient
      transgene stacking in operons, and increased biosafety due to exclusion of
      plastids from pollen transmission [1, 2]. However, applications in biotechnology 
      and synthetic biology are severely restricted by the very small number of plant
      species whose plastid genomes currently can be transformed [3, 4]. Here we report
      a simple method for the introduction of useful plastid transgenes into
      non-transformable species. The transgenes tested comprised a synthetic operon
      encoding three components of a biosynthetic pathway for producing the high-value 
      ketocarotenoid astaxanthin in the plastids of the cigarette tobacco, Nicotiana
      tabacum. Transplastomic N. tabacum plants accumulated astaxanthin to up to 1% of 
      the plants' dry weight. We then used grafting, a procedure recently shown to
      facilitate horizontal genome transfer between plants [5-7], to let the transgenic
      chloroplast genome move across the graft junction from N. tabacum plants into
      plants of the nicotine-free tree species Nicotiana glauca. Transplastomic N.
      glauca trees expressing the synthetic pathway were recovered at high frequency,
      thus providing a straightforward method for extension of the transplastomic
      technology to new species.

AB  - Do all animals sleep? Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a
      growing body of evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1-5].
      Here we show that sleep is also present in Cnidaria [6-8], an earlier-branching
      metazoan lineage. Cnidaria and Ctenophora are the first metazoan phyla to evolve 
      tissue-level organization and differentiated cell types, such as neurons and
      muscle [9-15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into a non-centralized radially
      symmetric nerve net [11, 13, 15-17] that nevertheless shares fundamental
      properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic
      transmission, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15-20]. It was reported that 
      cnidarian soft corals [21] and box jellyfish [22, 23] exhibit periods of
      quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting us to ask whether
      sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish
      Cassiopea spp. displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform
      long-term behavioral tracking. Monitoring of Cassiopea pulsing activity for
      consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral quiescence at night that is
      rapidly reversible, as well as a delayed response to stimulation in the quiescent
      state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, Cassiopea exhibited decreased
      activity and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent
      day, consistent with homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together,
      these results indicate that Cassiopea has a sleep-like state, supporting the
      hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to the emergence
      of a centralized nervous system.

AB  - European culture traces its history back to the ancient Greek civilisations,
      while Christianity and Judaism have their roots in the populations on the eastern
      shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Genome studies of several Bronze Age individuals 
      from each of these regions have now probed the genetic roots of early
      civilisations, revealing both migration and continuity in both cases. Michael

AB  - European eels (Anguilla anguilla) migrate between the southwestern Sargasso Sea
      and the European and Mediterranean coasts. In a recent paper in Current Biology, 
      Naisbett-Jones et al.[1] claim to "provide the first evidence that they [eels]
      derive positional information from the Earth's magnetic field" and that this
      information guides their migration. The evidence reported by Naisbett-Jones et
      al.[1] in support of this conclusion was derived from eels collected in the
      Severn River (UK), approximately 50 km upstream of the estuary (i.e. not "in the 
      Severn Estuary" as stated by the authors). Eels collected this far into rivers
      are benthic and fully adapted to freshwater; that is, they are late-stage glass
      eels ( approximately 2 years old), not the pelagic leptocephalus (larval) life
      stage that actually undertakes the trans-Atlantic migration. The entire
      interpretive framework for the Naisbett-Jones et al.[1] study rests on the
      assumption that the behaviour of these late-stage freshwater glass eels, and
      their responses to magnetic fields, can be used as a proxy for the responses of
      eel leptocephali. The authors present no evidence in support of this key
      assumption.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an astonishing flurry of studies demonstrating that
      some bird species show higher-order cognitive processes on par with primates
      [1-3]. As birds have no neocortex, cortical processing cannot be a requirement
      for higher order cognition [1,4]. Although birds have more neurons than expected 
      from their small brain weights [5], their absolute neuron count is still lower
      compared to cortical neuron numbers of primates. How, then, is it possible that
      pigeons reach performance levels in, for example, abstract numerical competence
      and orthographic processing, that are comparable to that of macaques [6]? While
      the subpallium is very similar, the organization of the pallium differs
      tremendously between birds and mammals [1]; moreover, the avian pallium is
      characterized by small, extremely tightly packed neurons [5]. It is conceivable
      that signal processing could be faster in such a brain as a result of a higher
      speed of propagation of activation between neighboring assemblies, resulting in
      faster switch times between neighboring networks and neuronal representations of 
      behavioral goals. This is important, as behavioral goals in real-life situations 
      are often achieved by a series of sub-tasks [7,8], and especially when sub-tasks 
      supersede each other and show little overlap in processing resources, neocortical
      (pallial) structures are involved [7,8]. We now report that pigeons are on par
      with humans when a task demands simultaneous processing resources; importantly,
      pigeons show faster responses than humans when sub-tasks are separated such that 
      fast switches between processes are required.

AB  - Patients lying in a vegetative state present severe impairments of consciousness 
      [1] caused by lesions in the cortex, the brainstem, the thalamus and the white
      matter [2]. There is agreement that this condition may involve disconnections in 
      long-range cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical pathways [3]. Hence, in the
      vegetative state cortical activity is 'deafferented' from subcortical modulation 
      and/or principally disrupted between fronto-parietal regions. Some patients in a 
      vegetative state recover while others persistently remain in such a state. The
      neural signature of spontaneous recovery is linked to increased thalamo-cortical 
      activity and improved fronto-parietal functional connectivity [3]. The likelihood
      of consciousness recovery depends on the extent of brain damage and patients'
      etiology, but after one year of unresponsive behavior, chances become low [1].
      There is thus a need to explore novel ways of repairing lost consciousness. Here 
      we report beneficial effects of vagus nerve stimulation on consciousness level of
      a single patient in a vegetative state, including improved behavioral
      responsiveness and enhanced brain connectivity patterns.

AB  - Most organisms consist of two cell lineages - somatic cells and germ cells. The
      former are required for the current generation, and the latter create offspring. 
      Male and female germ cells are usually produced during spermatogenesis and
      oogenesis, which take place in the testis and the ovary, respectively.
      Spermatogenesis involves the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells into
      spermatocytes via mitotic cell division and the production of haploid spermatids 
      from the tetraploid primary spermatocytes via meiotic cell division. Spermatids
      subsequently give rise to spermatozoa in the final phase of spermatogenesis,
      called spermiogenesis. These fundamental steps, where mitotic proliferation
      precedes meiosis during spermatogenesis, are observed in a wide variety of
      organisms. However, developing a comprehensive understanding of the cell biology 
      and genetics of spermatogenesis is difficult for most species because it occurs
      within a complex testicular environment characterized by the intimate association
      of developing sperm with accessory cells. In this Primer, we summarize the
      processes of spermatogenesis occurring in two pivotal model animals - mouse and
      Caenorhabditis elegans - and compare them to consider which important features
      might be evolutionarily conserved.

AB  - During animal development, cell-fate-specific changes in gene expression can
      modify the material properties of a tissue and drive tissue morphogenesis. While 
      mechanistic insights into the genetic control of tissue-shaping events are
      beginning to emerge, how tissue morphogenesis and mechanics can reciprocally
      impact cell-fate specification remains relatively unexplored. Here we review
      recent findings reporting how multicellular morphogenetic events and their
      underlying mechanical forces can feed back into gene regulatory pathways to
      specify cell fate. We further discuss emerging techniques that allow for the
      direct measurement and manipulation of mechanical signals in vivo, offering
      unprecedented access to study mechanotransduction during development. Examination
      of the mechanical control of cell fate during tissue morphogenesis will pave the 
      way to an integrated understanding of the design principles that underlie robust 
      tissue patterning in embryonic development.

AB  - The sensations of sound, acceleration and touch are mediated by
      mechanotransduction channels, which convert mechanical stimuli into electrical
      responses. The structure of one such channel, NOMPC, was recently solved by
      cryo-EM, revealing a bundle of helices that may act as coiled springs to transmit
      the forces that open the channel.

AB  - Our recent study [1] in Current Biology used a magnetic displacement experiment
      and simulations in an ocean circulation model to provide evidence that young
      European eels possess a 'magnetic map' that can aid their marine migration. Our
      results support two major conclusions: first, young eels distinguish among
      magnetic fields corresponding to locations across their marine range; second, for
      the fields that elicited significantly non-random orientation, swimming in the
      experimentally observed direction from the corresponding locations would increase
      entrainment in the Gulf Stream system. In their critique, Durif et al.[2] seem to
      conflate the separate and potentially independent 'map step' and 'compass step'
      of animal navigation. In the map step, an animal derives positional information
      to select a direction, whereas in the compass step the animal maintains that
      heading [3,4]. Our experiment was designed such that differences in eel
      orientation among treatments would indicate an ability to use the magnetic field 
      as a map; the compass cue(s) used by eels was not investigated.

AB  - The core planar polarity pathway coordinates epithelial cell polarity during
      animal development, and loss of its activity gives rise to a range of defects,
      from aberrant morphogenetic cell movements to failure to correctly orient
      structures, such as hairs and cilia. The core pathway functions via a mechanism
      involving segregation of its protein components to opposite cells ends, where
      they form asymmetric intracellular complexes that couple cell-cell polarity. This
      segregation is a self-organizing process driven by feedback interactions between 
      the core proteins themselves. Despite intense efforts, the molecular pathways
      underlying feedback have proven difficult to elucidate using conventional genetic
      approaches. Here we investigate core protein function during planar polarization 
      of the Drosophila wing by combining quantitative measurements of protein dynamics
      with loss-of-function genetics, mosaic analysis, and temporal control of gene
      expression. Focusing on the key core protein Frizzled, we show that its stable
      junctional localization is promoted by the core proteins Strabismus, Dishevelled,
      Prickle, and Diego. In particular, we show that the stabilizing function of
      Prickle on Frizzled requires Prickle activity in neighboring cells. Conversely,
      Prickle in the same cell has a destabilizing effect on Frizzled. This
      destabilizing activity is dependent on the presence of Dishevelled and blocked in
      the absence of Dynamin and Rab5 activity, suggesting an endocytic mechanism.
      Overall, our approach reveals for the first time essential in vivo stabilizing
      and destabilizing interactions of the core proteins required for
      self-organization of planar polarity.

AB  - During cell division, the mitotic kinesin-5 Eg5 generates most of the force
      required to separate centrosomes during spindle assembly. However, Kif15, another
      mitotic kinesin, can replace Eg5 function, permitting mammalian cells to acquire 
      resistance to Eg5 poisons. Unlike Eg5, the mechanism by which Kif15 generates
      centrosome separation forces is unknown. Here we investigated the mechanical
      properties and force generation capacity of Kif15 at the single-molecule level
      using optical tweezers. We found that the non-motor microtubule-binding tail
      domain interacts with the microtubule's E-hook tail with a rupture force higher
      than the stall force of the motor. This allows Kif15 dimers to productively and
      efficiently generate forces that could potentially slide microtubules apart.
      Using an in vitro optical trapping and fluorescence assay, we found that Kif15
      slides anti-parallel microtubules apart with gradual force buildup while parallel
      microtubule bundles remain stationary with a small amount of antagonizing force
      generated. A stochastic simulation shows the essential role of Kif15's tail
      domain for load storage within the Kif15-microtubule system. These results
      suggest a mechanism for how Kif15 rescues bipolar spindle assembly.

AB  - Electric eels have been the subject of investigation and curiosity for centuries 
      [1]. They use high voltage to track [2] and control [3] prey, as well as to
      exhaust prey by causing involuntary fatigue through remote activation of prey
      muscles [4]. But their most astonishing behavior is the leaping attack, during
      which eels emerge from the water to directly electrify a threat [5, 6]. This
      unique defense has reportedly been used against both horses [7] and humans [8].
      Yet the dynamics of the circuit that develops when a living animal is contacted
      and the electrical power transmitted to the target have not been directly
      investigated. In this study, the electromotive force and circuit resistances that
      develop during an eel's leaping behavior were determined. Next, the current that 
      passed through a human subject during the attack was measured. The results
      allowed each variable in the equivalent circuit to be estimated. Findings can be 
      extrapolated to a range of different eel sizes that might be encountered in the
      wild. Despite the comparatively small size of the eel used in this study,
      electrical currents in the target peaked at 40-50 mA, greatly exceeding
      thresholds for nociceptor activation reported for both humans [9] and horses [10,
      11]. No subjective sensation of involuntary tetanus was reported, and aversive
      sensations were restricted to the affected limb. Results suggest that the main
      purpose of the leaping attack is to strongly deter potential eel predators by
      briefly causing intense pain. Apparently a strong offense is the eel's best
      defense.

AB  - Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the 
      species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often
      overlooked the influence of intraspecific trait variation, which can profoundly
      alter community dynamics [1]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce
      intraspecific trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size
      structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more
      with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect 
      population and community stability, increasing variability in population and
      community biomass [2-6], reducing productivity [7-10] and life-history diversity 
      in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration 
      [4, 11-16]. Here, we quantified the extent of age truncation in 63 fished
      populations across five ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of
      fish in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals
      in the oldest age classes decreased significantly in 79% to 97% of populations
      (compared to historical or unfished values, respectively), and the magnitude of
      decline was greater than 90% in 32% to 41% of populations. The pervasiveness and 
      intensity of age truncation indicates that fishing is likely reducing the
      stability of many marine communities. Our findings suggest that more emphasis
      should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of fishing on age
      truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit fishing on all
      except a narrow range of fish sizes, and rotational harvesting.

AB  - Robust progression through the cell-division cycle depends on the precisely
      ordered phosphorylation of hundreds of different proteins by cyclin-dependent
      kinases (CDKs) and other kinases. The order of CDK substrate phosphorylation
      depends on rising CDK activity, coupled with variations in substrate affinities
      for different CDK-cyclin complexes and the opposing phosphatases [1-4]. Here, we 
      address the ordering of substrate phosphorylation by a second major cell-cycle
      kinase, Cdc7-Dbf4 or Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK). The primary function of DDK is 
      to initiate DNA replication by phosphorylating the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase
      [5-7]. DDK also phosphorylates the cohesin acetyltransferase Eco1 [8]. Sequential
      phosphorylations of Eco1 by CDK, DDK, and Mck1 create a phosphodegron that is
      recognized by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(Cdc4). DDK, despite being activated in
      early S phase, does not phosphorylate Eco1 to trigger its degradation until late 
      S phase [8]. DDK associates with docking sites on loaded Mcm double hexamers at
      unfired replication origins [9, 10]. We hypothesized that these docking
      interactions sequester limiting amounts of DDK, delaying Eco1 phosphorylation by 
      DDK until replication is complete. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that 
      overproduction of DDK leads to premature Eco1 degradation. Eco1 degradation also 
      occurs prematurely if Mcm complex loading at origins is prevented by depletion of
      Cdc6, and Eco1 is stabilized if loaded Mcm complexes are prevented from firing by
      a Cdc45 mutant. We propose that the timing of Eco1 phosphorylation, and
      potentially that of other DDK substrates, is determined in part by sequestration 
      of DDK at unfired replication origins during S phase.

TI  - Hormonal Signaling Cascade during an Early-Adult Critical Period Required for
      Courtship Memory Retention in Drosophila.

AB  - Formation and expression of memories are critical for context-dependent decision 
      making. In Drosophila, a courting male rejected by a mated female subsequently
      courts less avidly when paired with a virgin female, a behavioral modification
      attributed to "courtship memory." Here we show the critical role of hormonal
      state for maintenance of courtship memory. Ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) is
      essential for courtship memory through regulation of juvenile hormone (JH) levels
      in adult males. Reduction of JH levels via silencing of ETH signaling genes
      impairs short-term courtship memory, a phenotype rescuable by the JH analog
      methoprene. JH-deficit-induced memory impairment involves rapid decay rather than
      failure of memory acquisition. A critical period governs memory performance
      during the first 3 days of adulthood. Using sex-peptide-expressing "pseudo-mated"
      trainers, we find that robust courtship memory elicited in the absence of
      aversive chemical mating cues also is dependent on ETH-JH signaling. Finally, we 
      find that JH acts through dopaminergic neurons and conclude that an
      ETH-JH-dopamine signaling cascade is required during a critical period for
      promotion of social-context-dependent memory.

AB  - Spectacular examples of cooperative behavior emerge among a variety of animals
      and may serve critical roles in fitness [1, 2]. However, the rules governing such
      behavior have been difficult to elucidate [2]. Drosophila larvae are known to
      socially aggregate [3, 4] and use vision, mechanosensation, and gustation to
      recognize each other [5-8]. We describe here a model experimental system of
      cooperative behavior involving Drosophila larvae. While foraging in liquid food, 
      larvae are observed to align themselves and coordinate their movements in order
      to drag a common air cavity and dig deeper. Large-scale cooperation is required
      to maintain contiguous air contact across the posterior breathing spiracles. On
      the basis of a directed genetic screen we find that vision plays a key role in
      cluster dynamics. Our experiments show that blind larvae form fewer clusters and 
      dig less efficiently than wild-type and that socially isolated larvae behave as
      if they were blind. Furthermore, we observed that blind and socially isolated
      larvae do not integrate effectively into wild-type clusters. Behavioral data
      indicate that vision and social experience are required to coordinate precise
      movements between pairs of larvae, therefore increasing the degree of
      cooperativity within a cluster. Hence, we hypothesize that vision and social
      experience allow Drosophila larvae to assemble cooperative digging groups leading
      to more effective feeding and potential evasion of predators. Most importantly,
      these results indicate that control over membership of such a cooperative group
      can be regulated.

AB  - Localized extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is thought to stabilize the
      cleavage furrow and maintain cell shape during cytokinesis [1-14]. This
      remodeling is spatiotemporally coordinated with a cytoskeletal structure
      pertaining to a kingdom of life, for example the FtsZ ring in bacteria [15], the 
      phragmoplast in plants [16], and the actomyosin ring in fungi and animals [17,
      18]. Although the cytoskeletal structures have been analyzed extensively, the
      mechanisms of ECM remodeling remain poorly understood. In the budding yeast
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ECM remodeling refers to sequential formations of the
      primary and secondary septa that are catalyzed by chitin synthase-II (Chs2) and
      chitin synthase-III (the catalytic subunit Chs3 and its activator Chs4),
      respectively [18, 19]. Surprisingly, both Chs2 and Chs3 are delivered to the
      division site at the onset of cytokinesis [6, 20]. What keeps Chs3 inactive until
      secondary septum formation remains unknown. Here, we show that Hof1 binds to the 
      Sel1-like repeats (SLRs) of Chs4 via its F-BAR domain and inhibits Chs3-mediated 
      chitin synthesis during cytokinesis. In addition, Hof1 is required for rapid
      accumulation as well as efficient removal of Chs4 at the division site. This
      study uncovers a mechanism by which Hof1 controls timely activation of Chs3
      during cytokinesis and defines a novel interaction and function for the conserved
      F-BAR domain and SLR that are otherwise known for their abilities to bind
      membrane lipids [21, 22] and scaffold protein complex formation [23].

AB  - Visual and vestibular signals are the primary sources of sensory information for 
      self-motion. Conflict among these signals can be seriously debilitating,
      resulting in vertigo [1], inappropriate postural responses [2], and motion,
      simulator, or cyber sickness [3-8]. Despite this significance, the mechanisms
      mediating conflict detection are poorly understood. Here we model conflict
      detection simply as crossmodal discrimination with benchmark performance limited 
      by variabilities of the signals being compared. In a series of psychophysical
      experiments conducted in a virtual reality motion simulator, we measure these
      variabilities and assess conflict detection relative to this benchmark. We also
      examine the impact of eye movements on visual-vestibular conflict detection. In
      one condition, observers fixate a point that is stationary in the simulated
      visual environment by rotating the eyes opposite head rotation, thereby nulling
      retinal image motion. In another condition, eye movement is artificially
      minimized via fixation of a head-fixed fixation point, thereby maximizing retinal
      image motion. Visual-vestibular integration performance is also measured, similar
      to previous studies [9-12]. We observe that there is a tradeoff between
      integration and conflict detection that is mediated by eye movements. Minimizing 
      eye movements by fixating a head-fixed target leads to optimal integration but
      highly impaired conflict detection. Minimizing retinal motion by fixating a
      scene-fixed target improves conflict detection at the cost of impaired
      integration performance. The common tendency to fixate scene-fixed targets during
      self-motion [13] may indicate that conflict detection is typically a higher
      priority than the increase in precision of self-motion estimation that is
      obtained through integration.

AB  - Although it has long been clear that cells actively regulate their size, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation have remained poorly understood. 
      In budding yeast, cell size primarily modulates the duration of the cell-division
      cycle by controlling the G1/S transition known as Start. We have recently shown
      that the rate of progression through Start increases with cell size, because cell
      growth dilutes the cell-cycle inhibitor Whi5 in G1. Recent phenomenological
      studies in yeast and bacteria have shown that these cells add an approximately
      constant volume during each complete cell cycle, independent of their size at
      birth. These results seem to be in conflict, as the phenomenological studies
      suggest that cells measure the amount they grow, rather than their size, and that
      size control acts over the whole cell cycle, rather than specifically in G1.
      Here, we propose an integrated model that unifies the adder phenomenology with
      the molecular mechanism of G1/S cell-size control. We use single-cell microscopy 
      to parameterize a full cell-cycle model based on independent control of pre- and 
      post-Start cell-cycle periods. We find that our model predicts the
      size-independent amount of cell growth during the full cell cycle. This suggests 
      that the adder phenomenon is an emergent property of the independent regulation
      of pre- and post-Start cell-cycle periods rather than the consequence of an
      underlying molecular mechanism measuring a fixed amount of growth.

AB  - All visual animals must decide whether approaching objects are a threat. Our
      current understanding of this process has identified a proximity-based mechanism 
      where an evasive maneuver is triggered when a looming stimulus passes a subtended
      visual angle threshold. However, some escape strategies are more costly than
      others, and so it would be beneficial to additionally encode the level of threat 
      conveyed by the predator's approach rate to select the most appropriate response.
      Here, using naturalistic rates of looming visual stimuli while simultaneously
      monitoring escape behavior and the recruitment of multiple reticulospinal
      neurons, we find that larval zebrafish do indeed perform a calibrated assessment 
      of threat. While all fish generate evasive maneuvers at the same subtended visual
      angle, lower approach rates evoke slower, more kinematically variable escape
      responses with relatively long latencies as well as the unilateral recruitment of
      ventral spinal projecting nuclei (vSPNs) implicated in turning. In contrast,
      higher approach rates evoke faster, more kinematically stereotyped responses with
      relatively short latencies, as well as bilateral recruitment of vSPNs and
      unilateral recruitment of giant fiber neurons in fish and amphibians called
      Mauthner cells. In addition to the higher proportion of more costly,
      shorter-latency Mauthner-active responses to greater perceived threats, we
      observe a higher incidence of freezing behavior at higher approach rates. Our
      results provide a new framework to understand how behavioral flexibility is
      grounded in the appropriate balancing of trade-offs between fast and slow
      movements when deciding to respond to a visually perceived threat.

AB  - The endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria and plastids more than 1 Ga ago
      profoundly impacted eukaryote evolution. At the heart of understanding organelle 
      evolution is the re-arrangement of the endosymbiont proteome into a
      host-controlled organellar proteome. However, early stages in this process as
      well as the timing of events that underlie organelle integration remain poorly
      understood. The amoeba Paulinella chromatophora contains cyanobacterium-derived
      photosynthetic organelles, termed "chromatophores," that were acquired more
      recently (around 100 Ma ago). To explore the re-arrangement of an organellar
      proteome during its integration into a eukaryotic host cell, here we
      characterized the chromatophore proteome by protein mass spectrometry.
      Apparently, genetic control over the chromatophore has shifted substantially to
      the nucleus. Two classes of nuclear-encoded proteins-which differ in protein
      length-are imported into the chromatophore, most likely through independent
      pathways. Long imported proteins carry a putative, conserved N-terminal targeting
      signal, and many specifically fill gaps in chromatophore-encoded metabolic
      pathways or processes. Surprisingly, upon heterologous expression in a plant
      cell, the putative chromatophore targeting signal conferred chloroplast
      localization. This finding suggests common features in the protein import
      pathways of chromatophores and plastids, two organelles that evolved
      independently and more than 1 Ga apart from each other. By combining experimental
      data with in silico predictions, we provide a comprehensive catalog of almost 450
      nuclear-encoded, chromatophore-targeted proteins. Interestingly, most imported
      proteins seem to derive from ancestral host genes, suggesting that the
      re-targeting of nuclear-encoded proteins that resulted from endosymbiotic gene
      transfers plays only a minor role at the onset of chromatophore integration.

AB  - The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects
      widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in
      conflict with those of their hosts [1]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host
      of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a
      specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-kappaB-mediated 
      humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate 
      Lb eggs and embryos [2-5]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval
      blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles
      (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to wasps' successful parasitism of 
      Drosophila [6], but the composition of VLPs and their biotic nature have remained
      mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but 
      possess a pharmacopoeia of (1) the eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (2)
      immunity, and (3) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish
      Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence
      similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed
      analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface and spike-tip protein, p40, reveal
      similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD and IpaD of Gram-negative
      bacterial type-3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver
      virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs
      represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein 
      delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion
      systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties, we propose the 
      term mixed-strategy extracellular vesicle (MSEV) to replace VLP.

AB  - Even with great advances in machine vision, animals are still unmatched in their 
      ability to visually search complex scenes. Animals from bees [1, 2] to birds [3] 
      to humans [4-12] learn about the statistical relations in visual environments to 
      guide and aid their search for targets. Here, we investigate a novel manner in
      which humans utilize rapidly acquired information about scenes by guiding search 
      toward likely target sizes. We show that humans often miss targets when their
      size is inconsistent with the rest of the scene, even when the targets were made 
      larger and more salient and observers fixated the target. In contrast, we show
      that state-of-the-art deep neural networks do not exhibit such deficits in
      finding mis-scaled targets but, unlike humans, can be fooled by target-shaped
      distractors that are inconsistent with the expected target's size within the
      scene. Thus, it is not a human deficiency to miss targets when they are
      inconsistent in size with the scene; instead, it is a byproduct of a useful
      strategy that the brain has implemented to rapidly discount potential
      distractors.

AB  - The ubiquity of consistent inter-individual differences in behavior ("animal
      personalities") [1, 2] suggests that they might play a fundamental role in
      driving the movements and functioning of animal groups [3, 4], including their
      collective decision-making, foraging performance, and predator avoidance. Despite
      increasing evidence that highlights their importance [5-16], we still lack a
      unified mechanistic framework to explain and to predict how consistent
      inter-individual differences may drive collective behavior. Here we investigate
      how the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and foraging performance of
      groups can emerge from inter-individual differences by high-resolution tracking
      of known behavioral types in free-swimming stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
      shoals. We show that individual's propensity to stay near others, measured by a
      classic "sociability" assay, was negatively linked to swim speed across a range
      of contexts, and predicted spatial positioning and leadership within groups as
      well as differences in structure and movement dynamics between groups. In turn,
      this trait, together with individual's exploratory tendency, measured by a
      classic "boldness" assay, explained individual and group foraging performance.
      These effects of consistent individual differences on group-level states emerged 
      naturally from a generic model of self-organizing groups composed of individuals 
      differing in speed and goal-orientedness. Our study provides experimental and
      theoretical evidence for a simple mechanism to explain the emergence of
      collective behavior from consistent individual differences, including variation
      in the structure, leadership, movement dynamics, and functional capabilities of
      groups, across social and ecological scales. In addition, we demonstrate
      individual performance is conditional on group composition, indicating how social
      selection may drive behavioral differentiation between individuals.

AB  - Carboxylic acids are present in many foods, being especially abundant in fruits. 
      Yet, relatively little is known about how acids are detected by gustatory systems
      and whether they have a potential role in nutrition or provide other health
      benefits. Here we identify sour gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in tarsal taste
      sensilla of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that most tarsal sensilla harbor a
      sour GRN that is specifically activated by carboxylic and mineral acids but does 
      not respond to sweet- and bitter-tasting chemicals or salt. One pair of taste
      sensilla features two GRNs that respond only to a subset of carboxylic acids and 
      high concentrations of salt. All sour GRNs prominently express two Ionotropic
      Receptor (IR) genes, IR76b and IR25a, and we show that both these genes are
      necessary for the detection of acids. Furthermore, we establish that IR25a and
      IR76b are essential in sour GRNs of females for oviposition preference on
      acid-containing food. Our investigations reveal that acids activate a unique set 
      of taste cells largely dedicated to sour taste, and they indicate that both
      pH/proton concentration and the structure of carboxylic acids contribute to sour 
      GRN activation. Together, our studies provide new insights into the cellular and 
      molecular basis of sour taste.

AB  - Cephalopods, the group of animals including octopus, squid, and cuttlefish, have 
      remarkable ability to instantly modulate body coloration and patterns so as to
      blend into surrounding environments [1, 2] or send warning signals to other
      animals [3]. Reflectin is expressed exclusively in cephalopods, filling the
      lamellae of intracellular Bragg reflectors that exhibit dynamic iridescence and
      structural color change [4]. Here, we trace the possible origin of the reflectin 
      gene back to a transposon from the symbiotic bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio
      fischeri and report the hierarchical structural architecture of reflectin
      protein. Intrinsic self-assembly, and higher-order assembly tightly modulated by 
      aromatic compounds, provide insights into the formation of multilayer reflectors 
      in iridophores and spherical microparticles in leucophores and may form the basis
      of structural color change in cephalopods. Self-assembly and higher-order
      assembly in reflectin originated from a core repeating octapeptide (here named
      protopeptide), which may be from the same symbiotic bacteria. The origin of the
      reflectin gene and assembly features of reflectin protein are of considerable
      biological interest. The hierarchical structural architecture of reflectin and
      its domain and protopeptide not only provide insights for bioinspired photonic
      materials but also serve as unique "assembly tags" and feasible molecular
      platforms in biotechnology.

AB  - Sheet-forming Collagen IV is the main component of basement membranes, which are 
      planar polymers of extracellular matrix underlying epithelia and surrounding
      organs in all animals. Adipocytes in both insects and mammals are mesodermal in
      origin and often classified as mesenchymal. However, they form true tissues where
      cells remain compactly associated. Neither the mechanisms providing this
      tissue-level organization nor its functional significance are known. Here we show
      that discrete Collagen IV intercellular concentrations (CIVICs), distinct from
      basement membranes and thicker in section, mediate inter-adipocyte adhesion in
      Drosophila. Loss of these Collagen-IV-containing structures in the larval fat
      body caused intercellular gaps and disrupted continuity of the adipose tissue
      layer. We also found that Integrin and Syndecan matrix receptors attach
      adipocytes to CIVICs and direct their formation. Finally, we show that
      Integrin-mediated adhesion to CIVICs promotes normal adipocyte growth and
      prevents autophagy through Src-Pi3K-Akt signaling. Our results evidence a
      surprising non-basement membrane role of Collagen IV in non-epithelial tissue
      morphogenesis while demonstrating adhesion and signaling functions for these
      structures.

AB  - As sessile organisms, terrestrial plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to
      coordinate the growth and development of two distinct systems, the shoot and the 
      root, in response to environmental fluctuations. Adaptive systemic responses are 
      accomplished by shoot-root communication, which involves diverse long-distance
      signalling molecules. During the last few decades, various genetic, biochemical, 
      molecular, and grafting studies have identified multiple long-distance signalling
      molecules which are crucial for plants to adapt to external changes. In this
      minireview, the long-distance signals implicated in systemic responses to various
      environmental cues are discussed.

AB  - Plant shoots typically grow against the gravity vector to access light, whereas
      roots grow downward into the soil to take up water and nutrients. These
      gravitropic responses can be altered by developmental and environmental cues. In 
      this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern the gravitropism of 
      angiosperm roots, where a physical separation between sites for gravity sensing
      and curvature response has facilitated discovery. Gravity sensing takes place in 
      the columella cells of the root cap, where sedimentation of starch-filled
      plastids (amyloplasts) triggers a pathway that results in a relocalization to the
      lower side of the cell of PIN proteins, which facilitate efflux of the plant
      hormone auxin efflux. Consequently, auxin accumulates in the lower half of the
      root, triggering bending of the root tip at the elongation zone. We review our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control this process in primary
      roots, and discuss recent insights into the regulation of oblique growth in
      lateral roots and its impact on root-system architecture and soil exploration.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form associations with most land plants and
      facilitate nutrient uptake from the soil, with the plant receiving mineral
      nutrients from the fungus and in return providing the fungus with fixed carbon.
      This nutrient exchange takes place through highly branched fungal structures
      called arbuscules that are formed in cortical cells of the host root. Recent
      discoveries have highlighted the importance of fatty acids, in addition to
      sugars, acting as the form of fixed carbon transferred from the plant to the
      fungus and several studies have begun to elucidate the mechanisms that control
      the plant processes necessary for fungal colonisation and arbuscule development. 
      In this review, we analyse the mechanisms that allow arbuscule development and
      the processes necessary for nutrient exchange between the plant and the fungus.

AB  - The angiosperm flower develops through a modular programme which, although
      ancient and conserved, provides the flexibility that has allowed an almost
      infinite variety of floral forms to emerge. In this review, we explore the
      evolution of floral diversity, focusing on our recent understanding of the
      mechanistic basis of evolutionary change. We discuss the various ways in which
      flower size and floral organ size can be modified, the means by which flower
      shape and symmetry can change, and the ways in which floral organ position can be
      varied. We conclude that many challenges remain before we fully understand the
      ecological and molecular processes that facilitate the diversification of flower 
      structure.

AB  - Light is a vital resource for plants, which compete for it particularly in dense 
      communities. Plants have multiple photosensory receptors to detect the presence
      of competitors and thereby adjust their growth and developmental strategies
      accordingly. Broadly speaking, plants fall into two categories depending on their
      response to shading by leaves: shade tolerant or shade avoiding. Here, we
      describe the photoperception mechanisms and the growth responses elicited by the 
      neighboring vegetation in shade-avoiding plants, focusing on Arabidopsis
      thaliana, where these responses are best understood. The type of response depends
      on plant density, ranging from neighbor detection modulating growth in
      anticipation of future shading to the response to canopy shade where light
      resources are limiting. These diverse environments are sensed by various
      photoreceptors, and we will describe our current understanding of signal
      integration triggered by distinct light cues in diverse light conditions.

AB  - Plants are sessile organisms rooted in one place. The soil resources that plants 
      require are often distributed in a highly heterogeneous pattern. To aid foraging,
      plants have evolved roots whose growth and development are highly responsive to
      soil signals. As a result, 3D root architecture is shaped by myriad environmental
      signals to ensure resource capture is optimised and unfavourable environments are
      avoided. The first signals sensed by newly germinating seeds - gravity and light 
      - direct root growth into the soil to aid seedling establishment. Heterogeneous
      soil resources, such as water, nitrogen and phosphate, also act as signals that
      shape 3D root growth to optimise uptake. Root architecture is also modified
      through biotic interactions that include soil fungi and neighbouring plants. This
      developmental plasticity results in a 'custom-made' 3D root system that is best
      adapted to forage for resources in each soil environment that a plant colonises.

AB  - Plants can generate a spectacular array of complex shapes, many of which exhibit 
      elaborate curvature in three dimensions, illustrated for example by orchid
      flowers and pitcher-plant traps. All of these structures arise through
      differential growth. Recent findings provide fresh mechanistic insights into how 
      regional cell behaviours may lead to tissue deformations, including anisotropies 
      and curvatures, which shape growing volumes and sheets of cells. Here were review
      our current understanding of how genes, growth, mechanics, and evolution interact
      to generate diverse structures. We illustrate problems and approaches with the
      complex three-dimensional trap of the bladderwort, Utricularia gibba, to show how
      a multidisciplinary approach can be extended to new model systems to understand
      how diverse plant shapes can develop and evolve.

AB  - The study of organic form has a long and distinguished history going at least as 
      far back as Aristotle's Historia Anima lium, wherein he identified five basic
      biological processes that define the forms of animals (metabolism, temperature
      regulation, information processing, embryo development, and inheritance).
      Unfortunately, all of Aristotle's writings about plant forms are lost. We know of
      them only indirectly from his student Theophrastus's companion books,
      collectively called Historia Plantarum, wherein plant forms are categorized into 
      annual herbs, herbaceous perennials, shrubs, and trees. The study of plant forms 
      did not truly begin until the romantic poet and naturalist Goethe proposed the
      concept of a hypothetical 'Plant Archetype', declared "Alles ist Blatt", and
      first coined the word morphologie, which inspired the French anatomist Cuvier
      (who established the field of comparative morphology), the English naturalist
      Darwin (who saw his theory of evolution reinforced by it), and the Scottish
      mathematician D'Arcy Thompson (who attempted to quantify it).

AB  - The Neolithic Revolution brought about the transition from hunting and gathering 
      to sedentary societies, laying the foundation for the development of modern
      civilizations. The primary innovation that facilitated these changes was the
      domestication of plants and animals. In the case of plants, this involved the
      cultivation and selection of individuals with larger edible parts, easier
      harvesting, and decreased defenses, traits that allowed for the production of a
      food surplus and occupational specialization. Plant domestication is a process
      which started approximately 10,000 years ago and has thereafter been repeated
      independently in many locales around the world. Here, we offer a perspective that
      seeks to predict what factors influence the success of domestication, how many
      genes contributed to the process, where these genes originated and the
      implications for de novo domestication.

AB  - The peculiar morphologies of succulent plants have been variously considered as
      grotesque monstrosities and exotic curiosities, but succulents have always been
      perceived as unique. The succulent syndrome is considered to be one of the most
      remarkable examples of convergent evolution across the plant kingdom. Common to
      all succulents is the presence of large cells for water storage. However,
      cellular succulence can occur in any vegetative plant organ, with the level of
      succulence in roots, stems, and leaves being subject to a certain degree of
      evolutionary coordination. Furthermore, cellular succulence scales up to
      morphological succulence according to various anatomical schemes that confer
      contrasting functional characteristics. This means that succulence is associated 
      with a broad range of ecophysiological strategies and occurs in plants that have 
      evolved in many different environments.

AB  - Flowers are organized into concentric whorls of sepals, petals, stamens and
      carpels, with each of these floral organ types having a unique role in
      reproduction (Figure 1). Sepals enclose and protect the flower bud, while petals 
      can be large and showy so as to attract pollinators (or people!). Stamens produce
      pollen grains that contain male gametes, while the carpels contain the ovules
      that when fertilized will produce the seeds. While the size, shape, number and
      elaboration of each of these organ types can be quite different, the same general
      organization of four floral organ types arranged in concentric whorls exists
      across all flowering plant (angiosperm) species. As I shall explain in this
      Primer, the 'ABC model' is a simple and satisfying explanation for how this
      conserved floral architecture is genetically specified.

AB  - Leaves and flowers are arranged in regular patterns around the stem of a plant, a
      phenomenon known as phyllotaxis. Different arrangements occur, such as
      distichous, decussate or spiral (Figure 1). Most prevalent in nature are spirals 
      in which the average divergence angles between successive organs are close to
      137.5 degrees , the so-called 'golden angle'. It is this exact number that has
      given phyllotaxis its special flavor as a quantitative developmental problem, and
      over the centuries, it has enjoyed the attention of scientists far beyond botany.
      In the 1830s mathematicians described the spirals as they related to the
      Fibonacci numbers, and in the 1860s improved microscopes made it possible for
      botanists to observe the initiation of leaf and flower primordia in a diversity
      of plants. This descriptive work led to the conclusion that new organ primordia
      form in the first available space between existing primordia, a conclusion still 
      valid today. But how does it work? Ideas from the early 20(th) century suggested 
      that an inhibitor produced by existing primordia diffuses towards the shoot
      apical meristem: where the concentration of the inhibitor falls below a threshold
      value, an organ is initiated. Other models dating back to the 1870s have tried to
      explain phyllotactic patterning by applying the laws of mechanics. Such models
      went through a long period of marginal interest, but have experienced a
      remarkable renaissance over the past 20 years. In this Primer I will give a broad
      overview of phyllotaxis, its emergence from the shoot apical meristem, how auxin 
      and its transporter function as a 'pattern generator', and the role of tissue
      mechanics and computational modeling.

AB  - One of the extraordinary features of plants is their growth capacity. Depending
      on the species and the environment, body forms are manifold and, at the same
      time, constantly reshaped. An important basis of this plastic variation and
      life-long accumulation of biomass is radial growth. Here, we use this term to
      describe the ability to grow in girth by the formation of wood, bast and cork.
      The more technical term for radial growth is secondary growth, which
      distinguishes the process from primary growth taking place at the tips of stems
      and roots during plant elongation.

AB  - Reproduction is a critical time in plant life history. Therefore, genes affecting
      seed dormancy and germination are among those under strongest selection in
      natural plant populations. Germination terminates seed dispersal and thus
      influences the location and timing of plant growth. After seed shedding,
      germination can be prevented by a property known as seed dormancy. In practise,
      seeds are rarely either dormant or non-dormant, but seeds whose dormancy-inducing
      pathways are activated to higher levels will germinate in an ever-narrower range 
      of environments. Thus, measurements of dormancy must always be accompanied by
      analysis of environmental contexts in which phenotypes or behaviours are
      described. At its simplest, dormancy can be imposed by the formation of a simple 
      physical barrier around the seed through which gas exchange and the passage of
      water are prevented. Seeds featuring this so-called 'physical dormancy' often
      require either scarification or passage through an animal gut (replete with its
      associated digestive enzymes) to disrupt the barrier and permit germination. In
      other types of seeds with 'morphological dormancy' the embryo remains
      under-developed at maturity and a dormant phase exists as the embryo continues
      its growth post-shedding, eventually breaking through the surrounding tissues. By
      far, the majority of seeds exhibit 'physiological dormancy' - a quiescence
      program initiated by either the embryo or the surrounding endosperm tissues.
      Physiological dormancy uses germination-inhibiting hormones to prevent
      germination in the absence of the specific environmental triggers that promote
      germination. During and after germination, early seedling growth is supported by 
      catabolism of stored reserves of protein, oil or starch accumulated during seed
      maturation. These reserves support cell expansion, chloroplast development and
      root growth until photoauxotrophic growth can be resumed.

AB  - Land plants are called 'embryophytes' and thus, their collective name is defined 
      by their ability to form embryos. Indeed, embryogenesis is a widespread
      phenomenon in plants, and much of our diet is composed of embryos (just think of 
      grains, beans or nuts; Figure 1). However, in addition to embryos as a source of 
      nutrition, they are also a fascinating study object. Some of the most fundamental
      decisions on fate and identity, as well as patterning and morphogenesis, are
      taken during the first days of plant life. Yet, embryos are diverse in structure 
      and function, and embryogenesis in plants is by no means restricted to the zygote
      - the product of fertilization. In this Primer, we discuss the adventures of the 
      young plant. We will consider what it means to be a plant embryo and how to
      become one. We will next highlight how the study of early embryogenesis can
      reveal principles underlying oriented cell division and developmental pattern
      formation in plants.

AB  - Plants are able to generate large leaf surfaces that act as two-dimensional solar
      panels with a minimum investment in building material, thanks to a hydrostatic
      skeleton. This requires high intracellular pressures (up to 1 MPa), which depend 
      on the presence of strong cell walls. The walls of growing cells (also called
      primary walls), are remarkably able to reconcile extreme tensile strength (up to 
      100 MPa) with the extensibility necessary for growth. All walled organisms are
      confronted with this dilemma - the need to balance strength and extensibility -
      and bacteria, fungi and plants have evolved independent solutions to cope. In
      this Primer, we discuss how plant cells have solved this problem, allowing them
      to support often very large increases in volume and to develop a broad variety of
      shapes (Figure 1A,B,D). This shape variation reflects the targeted deposition of 
      wall material combined with local variations in cell-wall extensibility,
      processes that remain incompletely understood. Once the cell has reached its
      final size, it can lay down secondary wall layers, the composition and
      architecture of which are optimized to exert specific functions in different cell
      types (Figure 1E-G). Such functions include: providing mechanical support, for
      instance, for fibre cells in tree trunks or grass internodes; impermeabilising
      and strengthening vascular tissue to resist the negative pressure of the
      transpiration stream; increasing the surface area of the plasma membrane to
      facilitate solute exchange between cells (Figure 1C); or allowing important
      elastic deformation, for instance, to support the opening and closing of
      stomates. Specialized secondary walls, such as those constituting seed mucilage, 
      are stored in a dehydrated form in seedcoat epidermis cells and show rapid
      swelling upon hydration of the seed. Other walls, in particular in reserve
      tissues, can accommodate large amounts of storage polysaccharides, which can be
      easily mobilized as a carbon source. Here we will discuss some general principles
      underlying wall architecture and wall growth that have emerged from recent
      studies, as well as future questions for investigation (Box 1).

AB  - If we wander through the countryside, passing fields of wheat, it is apparent
      that this crop is reasonably short in stature and that the stems carry large
      ears. However, this was not always the case. If we take a look at depictions of
      wheat throughout history, we observe that wheat used to be fairly tall. It was
      not until the second half of the 20(th) century that dwarf wheat varieties
      started to dominate the agricultural landscape. Underlying this short stature are
      the Reduced height (Rht) genes, which encode DELLA proteins and which formed the 
      cornerstone of the Green Revolution.

AB  - On January 12(th) 1877, the Grim Reaper visited Wilhelm Hofmeister (Figure 1) for
      the last time. Having recently witnessed the death of a wife, two daughters, and 
      two sons (only two of his nine children survived him), the German botanist,
      perhaps succumbing to the weight of his own grief, suffered a series of strokes
      and then promptly died at the age of 52 in Lindenau, Germany. He has since faded 
      into the dusty annals of 19(th) century botany, his contributions to our
      knowledge about plants, how they come into being, develop and interact with their
      environment, mostly forgotten. In an ode to Hofmeister marking 100 years since
      his birth, Douglas Haughton Campbell of Stanford University, referring to
      Hofmeister's studies in comparative morphology, wrote, "...there is no question
      that Hofmeister's work will remain as probably the most brilliant contribution
      ever made to this fundamental department of botany" [1]. And in an essay
      published in Plant Physiology, Donald Kaplan and Todd Cooke went further still,
      writing, "Frederich Wilhelm Benedikt Hofmeister stands as one of the most
      remarkable figures in the history of botany and one who made fundamental
      contributions to all areas of plant biology" [2]. If that wasn't enough, Kaplan
      and Cooke added "In terms of native genius, he is certainly the peer of both
      Darwin and Mendel and may have even exceeded them in the breadth and depth of his
      talents."

      that an extracellular-matrix-based stiffness gradient in the Drosophila egg

AB  - The pha-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans was originally heralded as a master

      actually serves no role in development and instead is a component of a selfish

AB  - To introduce pits into a cell wall, plants depolymerize cortical microtubules,
      which prevents subsequent secondary cell wall thickening. A newly identified
      protein tethers microtubules to the plasma membrane and contains this breakdown
      to defined regions, thereby shaping these holes.

AB  - Biomedical research has exploited vital and other statistics (e.g., birth or
      death rates) for almost 200 years [1]. The Internet has become a rich source of
      digital databases, which are being used for many lines of research (e.g.,
      circadian and seasonal [2] or metabolism [3,4]). Internet-based studies generally
      investigate large populations while individual social media accounts are rarely
      used to analyse, for example, individual sleep-wake behaviour (e.g.,
      youtu.be/wBNcP-LkpfA). I therefore applied time series analyses, commonly used in
      circadian and sleep research, to approximately 12,000 tweets sent from a single
      Twitter account (@realdonaldtrump; December, 2014 to March, 2017). The account
      was clearly used by different individuals/groups launching tweets from various
      devices. Among these, the Android phone was the most consistent over the years.
      Its tweet activity peaked twice a day (early morning and late night), and both
      peaks showed a strong seasonality by tracking dawn.

      Repetition.

AB  - A central tenet of systems neuroscience is that the mammalian hippocampus
      provides a cognitive map of the environment. This view is supported by the
      finding of place cells, neurons whose firing is tuned to specific locations in an
      animal's environment, within this brain region. Recent work, however, has shown
      that these cells repeat their firing fields across visually identical maze
      compartments [1, 2]. This repetition is not observed if these compartments face
      different directions, suggesting that place cells use a directional input to
      differentiate otherwise similar local environments [3, 4]. A clear candidate for 
      this input is the head direction cell system. To test this, we disrupted the head
      direction cell system by lesioning the lateral mammillary nuclei and then
      recorded place cells as rats explored multiple, connected compartments, oriented 
      in the same or in different directions. As shown previously, we found that place 
      cells in control animals exhibited repeated fields in compartments arranged in
      parallel, but not in compartments facing different directions. In contrast, the
      place cells of animals with lesions of the head direction cell system exhibited
      repeating fields in both conditions. Thus, directional information provided by
      the head direction cell system appears essential for the angular disambiguation
      by place cells of visually identical compartments.

      Learning or Complex Neural Control.

AB  - The evolution of complex behavior is driven by the interplay of morphological
      specializations and neuromuscular control mechanisms [1-3], and it is often
      difficult to tease apart their respective contributions. Avian vocal learning and
      associated neural adaptations are thought to have played a major role in bird
      diversification [4-8], whereas functional significance of substantial
      morphological diversity of the vocal organ remains largely unexplored. Within the
      most species-rich order, Passeriformes, "tracheophones" are a suboscine group
      that, unlike their oscine sister taxon, does not exhibit vocal learning [9] and
      is thought to phonate with tracheal membranes [10, 11] instead of the two
      independent sources found in other passerines [12-14]. Here we show tracheophones
      possess three sound sources, two oscine-like labial pairs and the unique tracheal
      membranes, which collectively represent the largest described number of sound
      sources for a vocal organ. Birds with experimentally disabled tracheal membranes 
      were still able to phonate. Instead of the main sound source, the tracheal
      membranes constitute a morphological specialization, which, through interaction
      with bronchial labia, contributes to different acoustic features such as spectral
      complexity, amplitude modulation, and enhanced sound amplitude. In contrast,
      these same features arise in oscines from neuromuscular control of two labial
      sources [15-17]. These findings are supported by a modeling approach and provide 
      a clear example for how a morphological adaptation of the tracheophone vocal
      organ can generate specific, complex sound features. Morphological specialization
      therefore constitutes an alternative path in the evolution of acoustic diversity 
      to that of oscine vocal learning and complex neural control.

AB  - Theoretical studies suggest that many of the emergent properties associated with 
      multicellular systems arise already in small networks [1, 2]. However, the number
      of experimental models that can be used to explore collective dynamics in
      well-defined cell networks is still very limited. Here we focus on collective
      cell behavior in the female germline cyst in Drosophila melanogaster, a
      stereotypically wired network of 16 cells that grows by approximately 4 orders of
      magnitude with unequal distribution of volume among its constituents. We quantify
      multicellular growth with single-cell resolution and show that proximity to the
      oocyte, as defined on the network, is the principal factor that determines cell
      size; consequently, cells grow in groups. To rationalize this emergent pattern of
      cell sizes, we propose a tractable mathematical model that depends on
      intercellular transport on a cell lineage tree. In addition to correctly
      predicting the divergent pattern of cell sizes, this model reveals allometric
      growth of cells within the network, an emergent property of this system and a
      feature commonly associated with differential growth on an organismal scale [3].

AB  - Boundary domain genes, expressed within or around organ primordia, play a key
      role in the formation, shaping, and subdivision of planar plant organs, such as
      leaves. However, the role of boundary genes in formation of more elaborate 3D
      structures, which also derive from organ primordia, remains unclear. Here we
      analyze the role of the boundary domain gene CUPULIFORMIS (CUP) in formation of
      the ornate Antirrhinum flower shape. We show that CUP expression becomes cleared 
      from boundary subdomains between petal primordia, most likely contributing to
      formation of congenitally fused petals (sympetally) and modulation of growth at
      sinuses. At later stages, CUP is activated by dorsoventral genes in an
      intermediary region of the corolla. In contrast to its role at organ boundaries, 
      intermediary CUP activity leads to growth promotion rather than repression and
      formation of the palate, lip, and characteristic folds of the closed Antirrhinum 
      flower. Intermediary expression of CUP homologs is also observed in related
      sympetalous species, Linaria and Mimulus, suggesting that changes in boundary
      gene activity have played a key role in the development and evolution of diverse 
      3D plant shapes.

AB  - Forecasting assemblage-level responses to climate change remains one of the
      greatest challenges in global ecology [1, 2]. Data from the marine realm are
      limited because they largely come from experiments using limited numbers of
      species [3], mesocosms whose interior conditions are unnatural [4], and long-term
      correlation studies based on historical collections [5]. We describe the first
      ever experiment to warm benthic assemblages to ecologically relevant levels in
      situ. Heated settlement panels were used to create three test conditions: ambient
      and 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C above ambient (predicted in the next 50 and 100
      years, respectively [6]). We observed massive impacts on a marine assemblage,
      with near doubling of growth rates of Antarctic seabed life. Growth increases far
      exceed those expected from biological temperature relationships established more 
      than 100 years ago by Arrhenius. These increases in growth resulted in a single
      "r-strategist" pioneer species (the bryozoan Fenestrulina rugula) dominating
      seabed spatial cover and drove a reduction in overall diversity and evenness. In 
      contrast, a 2 degrees C rise produced divergent responses across species growth, 
      resulting in higher variability in the assemblage. These data extend our ability 
      to expand, integrate, and apply our knowledge of the impact of temperature on
      biological processes to predict organism, species, and ecosystem level ecological
      responses to regional warming.

AB  - Contagious yawning, in which yawning is triggered involuntarily when we observe
      another person yawn, is a common form of echophenomena-the automatic imitation of
      another's words (echolalia) or actions (echopraxia) [1]. The neural basis for
      echophenomena is unknown; however, it has been proposed that it is linked to
      disinhibition of the human mirror-neuron system [1-4] and hyper-excitability of
      cortical motor areas [1]. We investigated the neural basis for contagious yawning
      using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirty-six adults viewed video
      clips that showed another individual yawning and, in separate blocks, were
      instructed to either resist yawning or allow themselves to yawn. Participants
      were videoed throughout and their yawns or stifled yawns were counted. We used
      TMS to quantify motor cortical excitability and physiological inhibition for each
      participant, and these measures were then used to predict the propensity for
      contagious yawning across participants. We demonstrate that instructions to
      resist yawning increase the urge to yawn and alter how yawns are expressed (i.e.,
      full versus stifled yawns) but do not alter the individual propensity for
      contagious yawning. By contrast, TMS measures of cortical excitability and
      physiological inhibition were significant predictors of contagious yawning and
      accounted for approximately 50% of the variability in contagious yawning. These
      data demonstrate that individual variability in the propensity for contagious
      yawning is determined by cortical excitability and physiological inhibition in
      the primary motor cortex.

AB  - To test the directness of factors in initiating PIWI-directed gene silencing, we 
      employed a Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-targeted reporter assay in Drosophila
      ovary somatic sheet (OSS) cells [1]. This assay confirmed direct silencing roles 
      for piRNA biogenesis factors and PIWI-associated factors [2-12] but suggested
      that chromatin-modifying proteins may act downstream of the initial silencing
      event. Our data also revealed that RNA-polymerase-II-associated proteins like
      PAF1 and RTF1 antagonize PIWI-directed silencing. PAF1 knockdown enhances PIWI
      silencing of reporters when piRNAs target the transcript region proximal to the
      promoter. Loss of PAF1 suppresses endogenous transposable element (TE) transcript
      maturation, whereas a subset of gene transcripts and long-non-coding RNAs
      adjacent to TE insertions are affected by PAF1 knockdown in a similar fashion to 
      piRNA-targeted reporters. Additionally, transcription activation at specific TEs 
      and TE-adjacent loci during PIWI knockdown is suppressed when PIWI and PAF1
      levels are both reduced. Our study suggests a mechanistic conservation between
      fission yeast PAF1 repressing AGO1/small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed
      silencing [13, 14] and Drosophila PAF1 opposing PIWI/piRNA-directed silencing.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a state of irreversibly arrested proliferation, often
      induced by genotoxic stress [1]. Senescent cells participate in a variety of
      physiological and pathological conditions, including tumor suppression [2],
      embryonic development [3, 4], tissue repair [5-8], and organismal aging [9]. The 
      senescence program is variably characterized by several non-exclusive markers,
      including constitutive DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase (SA-betagal) activity, increased expression of the
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p16INK4A (CDKN2A) and p21CIP1 (CDKN1A), 
      increased secretion of many bio-active factors (the senescence-associated
      secretory phenotype, or SASP), and reduced expression of the nuclear lamina
      protein LaminB1 (LMNB1) [1]. Many senescence-associated markers result from
      altered transcription, but the senescent phenotype is variable, and methods for
      clearly identifying senescent cells are lacking [10]. Here, we characterize the
      heterogeneity of the senescence program using numerous whole-transcriptome
      datasets generated by us or publicly available. We identify transcriptome
      signatures associated with specific senescence-inducing stresses or senescent
      cell types and identify and validate genes that are commonly differentially
      regulated. We also show that the senescent phenotype is dynamic, changing at
      varying intervals after senescence induction. Identifying novel transcriptome
      signatures to detect any type of senescent cell or to discriminate among diverse 
      senescence programs is an attractive strategy for determining the diverse
      biological roles of senescent cells and developing specific drug targets.

AB  - Sex pheromones facilitate reproduction by attracting potential mates and altering
      their behavior and physiology. In C. elegans, males and hermaphrodites secrete
      similar blends of pheromone molecules, two of which are present in different
      relative concentrations: ascr#3, which is more abundant in hermaphrodites, and
      ascr#10, which is more abundant in males. It is not currently understood how this
      compositional difference results in sex-specific effects, for example, the slower
      aging of the hermaphrodite germline in the presence of physiologically relevant
      concentrations of male pheromones. Here we report three key elements of the
      mechanism responsible for this phenomenon. First, ascr#3 counters the activity of
      ascr#10. This antagonism decreases the magnitude and the sensitivity of the
      hermaphrodite response to the male pheromone, restricting it to situations in
      which the presence of a male could be inferred with high confidence. Second,
      hermaphrodites recognize pheromone as male if the concentration of ascr#10 is
      higher than that of ascr#3. Third, the response to ascr#10 requires TRPV channel 
      function in the ADL neurons and the daf-7 signaling from the ASI neurons, whereas
      the response to ascr#3 relies on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-gated
      channels and activity of the ASJ, AWB, and AWC neurons. These results argue that 
      the counteracting activities of distinct neuronal circuits determine the sexual
      identity of the pheromone. The parallels between this mechanism and other
      signaling systems suggest that diverse organisms may perform particular neuronal 
      computations using similar general principles.

AB  - Prior research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [1-4] and
      behavioral studies of patients with acquired or congenital amusia [5-8] suggest
      that the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the human brain is
      specialized for aspects of music processing (for review, see [9-12]).
      Intracranial electrical brain stimulation in awake neurosurgery patients is a
      powerful means to determine the computations supported by specific brain regions 
      and networks [13-21] because it provides reversible causal evidence with high
      spatial resolution (for review, see [22, 23]). Prior intracranial stimulation or 
      cortical cooling studies have investigated musical abilities related to reading
      music scores [13, 14] and singing familiar songs [24, 25]. However, individuals
      with amusia (congenitally, or from a brain injury) have difficulty humming
      melodies but can be spared for singing familiar songs with familiar lyrics [26]. 
      Here we report a detailed study of a musician with a low-grade tumor in the right
      temporal lobe. Functional MRI was used pre-operatively to localize music
      processing to the right STG, and the patient subsequently underwent awake
      intraoperative mapping using direct electrical stimulation during a melody
      repetition task. Stimulation of the right STG induced "music arrest" and errors
      in pitch but did not affect language processing. These findings provide causal
      evidence for the functional segregation of music and language processing in the
      human brain and confirm a specific role of the right STG in melody processing.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, characterized by motor incoordination, postural instability,
      and gait abnormality [1-3], greatly affects daily activities and quality of life.
      Although accumulating genetic and non-genetic etiological factors have been
      revealed [4-7], effective therapies for cerebellar ataxia are still lacking.
      Intriguingly, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a peptide hormone and
      neurotransmitter [8, 9], is considered a putative neurotransmitter in the
      olivo-cerebellar system [10-14]. Notably, decreased levels of CRF in the inferior
      olive (IO), the sole origin of cerebellar climbing fibers, have been reported in 
      patients with spinocerebellar degeneration or olivopontocerebellar atrophy [15,
      16], yet little is known about the exact role of CRF in cerebellar motor
      coordination and ataxia. Here we report that deficiency of CRF in the
      olivo-cerebellar system induces ataxia-like motor abnormalities. CRFergic neurons
      in the IO project directly to the cerebellar nuclei, the ultimate integration and
      output node of the cerebellum, and CRF selectively excites glutamatergic
      projection neurons rather than GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar interpositus
      nucleus (IN) via two CRF receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2, and their downstream inward 
      rectifier K(+) channel and/or hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
      (HCN) channel. Furthermore, CRF promotes cerebellar motor coordination and
      rescues ataxic motor deficits. The findings define a previously unknown role for 
      CRF in the olivo-cerebellar system in the control of gait, posture, and motor
      coordination, and provide new insight into the etiology, pathophysiology, and
      treatment strategy of cerebellar ataxia.

      the ON-Cone Bipolar Cell Receptive Field Surround in the Retina.

AB  - Cone bipolar cells are interneurons that receive synaptic input from cone
      photoreceptor cells and provide the output of the first synaptic layer of the
      retina. These cells exhibit center-surround receptive fields, a prototype of
      lateral inhibition between neighboring sensory cells in which stimulation of the 
      receptive field center excites the cell whereas stimulation of the surrounding
      region laterally inhibits the cell. This fundamental sensory coding mechanism
      facilitates spatial discrimination and detection of stimulus edges. However,
      although it is well established that the receptive field surround is strongest
      when ambient or background illumination is most intense, e.g., at midday, and
      that the surround is minimal following maintained darkness, the synaptic
      mechanisms that produce and modulate the surround have not been resolved. Using
      electrical recording of bipolar cells under experimental conditions in which the 
      cells exhibited surround light responses, and light and electron microscopic
      immunocytochemistry, we show in the rabbit retina that bright-light-induced
      activation of dopamine D1 receptors located on ON-center cone bipolar cell
      dendrites increases the expression and activity of GABAA receptors on the
      dendrites of the cells and that surround light responses depend on endogenous
      GABAA receptor activation. We also show that maintained darkness and D1 receptor 
      blockade following maintained illumination and D1 receptor activation result in
      minimal GABAA receptor expression and activity and greatly diminished surrounds. 
      Modulation of the D1/GABAA receptor signaling pathway of ON-cBC dendrites by the 
      ambient light level facilitates detection of spatial details on bright days and
      large dim objects on moonless nights.

AB  - Why do distantly related mammals like sheep, giant pandas, and fur seals produce 
      bleats that are characterized by vibrato-like fundamental frequency (F0)
      modulation? To answer this question, we used psychoacoustic tests and comparative
      analyses to investigate whether this distinctive vocal feature has evolved to
      improve the perception of formants, key acoustic components of animal calls that 
      encode important information about the caller's size and identity [1].
      Psychoacoustic tests on humans confirmed that vibrato-like F0 modulation improves
      the ability of listeners to detect differences in the formant patterns of
      synthetic bleat-like stimuli. Subsequent phylogenetically controlled comparative 
      analyses revealed that vibrato-like F0 modulation has evolved independently in
      six mammalian orders in vocal signals with relatively high F0 and, therefore, low
      spectral density (i.e., less harmonic overtones). We also found that mammals
      modulate the vibrato in these calls over greater frequency extents when the
      number of harmonic overtones per formant is low, suggesting that this is a
      mechanism to improve formant perception in calls with low spectral density. Our
      findings constitute the first evidence that formant perception in non-speech
      sounds is improved by fundamental frequency modulation and provide a mechanism
      for the convergent evolution of bleat-like calls in mammals. They also indicate
      that selection pressures for animals to transmit important information encoded by
      formant frequencies (on size and identity, for example) are likely to have been a
      key driver in the evolution of mammal vocal diversity.

TI  - BORC Regulates the Axonal Transport of Synaptic Vesicle Precursors by Activating 
      ARL-8.

AB  - Axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) is essential for synapse
      development and function. The conserved ARF-like small GTPase ARL-8 is localized 
      to SVPs and directly activates UNC-104/KIF1A, the axonal-transport kinesin for
      SVPs in C. elegans. It is not clear how ARL-8 is activated in this process. Here 
      we show that part of the BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), previously shown to
      regulate lysosomal transport, is required to recruit and activate ARL-8 on SVPs. 
      We found mutations in six BORC subunits-blos-1/BLOS1, blos-2/BLOS2,
      snpn-1/Snapin, sam-4/Myrlysin, blos-7/Lyspersin, and blos-9/MEF2BNB-cause defects
      in axonal transport of SVPs, leading to ectopic accumulation of synaptic vesicles
      in the proximal axon. This phenotype is suppressed by constitutively active arl-8
      or unc-104 mutants. Furthermore, SAM-4/Myrlysin, a subunit of BORC, promotes the 
      GDP-to-GTP exchange of ARL-8 in vitro and recruits ARL-8 onto SVPs in vivo. Thus,
      BORC regulates the axonal transport of synaptic materials and synapse formation
      by controlling the nucleotide state of ARL-8. Interestingly, the other two
      subunits of BORC essential for lysosomal transport, kxd-1/KXD1 and
      blos-8/Diaskedin, are not required for the SVP transport, suggesting distinct
      subunit requirements for lysosomal and SVP trafficking.

AB  - Acetylcholine in the neocortex is critical for executive function [1-3].
      Degeneration of cholinergic neurons in aging and Alzheimer's dementia is commonly
      treated with cholinesterase inhibitors [4-7]; however, these are modestly
      effective and are associated with side effects that preclude effective dosing in 
      many patients [8]. Electrical activation of the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert, 
      the source of neocortical acetylcholine [9, 10], provides a potential method of
      improving cholinergic activation [11, 12]. Here we tested whether NB stimulation 
      would improve performance of a working memory task in a nonhuman primate model.
      Unexpectedly, intermittent stimulation proved to be most beneficial (60 pulses
      per second, for 20 s every minute), whereas continuous stimulation often impaired
      performance. Pharmacological experiments confirmed that the effects depended on
      cholinergic activation. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, restored
      performance in animals impaired by continuous stimulation but did not improve
      performance further during intermittent stimulation. Intermittent stimulation was
      rendered ineffective by either nicotinic or muscarinic receptor antagonists. In
      the months after stimulation began, performance also improved in sessions without
      stimulation. Our results reveal that intermittent NB stimulation can improve
      working memory, a finding that has implications for restoring cognitive function 
      in aging and Alzheimer's dementia.

AB  - Many chemosensory stimuli evoke innate behavioral responses that can be either
      appetitive or aversive, depending on an animal's age, prior experience,
      nutritional status, and environment [1-9]. However, the circuit mechanisms that
      enable these valence changes are poorly understood. Here, we show that
      Caenorhabditis elegans can alternate between attractive or aversive responses to 
      carbon dioxide (CO2), depending on its recently experienced CO2 environment. Both
      responses are mediated by a single pathway of interneurons. The CO2-evoked
      activity of these interneurons is subject to extreme experience-dependent
      modulation, enabling them to drive opposite behavioral responses to CO2. Other
      interneurons in the circuit regulate behavioral sensitivity to CO2 independent of
      valence. A combinatorial code of neuropeptides acts on the circuit to regulate
      both valence and sensitivity. Chemosensory valence-encoding interneurons exist
      across phyla, and valence is typically determined by whether appetitive or
      aversive interneuron populations are activated. Our results reveal an alternative
      mechanism of valence determination in which the same interneurons contribute to
      both attractive and aversive responses through modulation of sensory neuron to
      interneuron synapses. This circuit design represents a previously unrecognized
      mechanism for generating rapid changes in innate chemosensory valence.

      Longitude Problem.

AB  - The longitude problem (determining east-west position) is a classical problem in 
      human sea navigation. Prior to the use of GPS satellites, extraordinarily
      accurate clocks measuring the difference between local time and a fixed reference
      (e.g., GMT) [1] were needed to determine longitude. Birds do not appear to
      possess a time-difference clock sense [2]. Nevertheless, experienced
      night-migratory songbirds can correct for east-west displacements to unknown
      locations [3-9]. Consequently, migratory birds must solve the longitude problem
      in a different way, but how they do so has remained a scientific mystery [10]. We
      suggest that experienced adult Eurasian reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus)
      can use magnetic declination to solve the longitude problem at least under some
      circumstances under clear skies. Experienced migrants tested during autumn
      migration in Rybachy, Russia, were exposed to an 8.5 degrees change in
      declination while all other cues remained unchanged. This corresponds to a
      virtual magnetic displacement to Scotland if and only if magnetic declination is 
      a part of their map. The adult migrants responded by changing their heading by
      151 degrees from WSW to ESE, consistent with compensation for the virtual
      magnetic displacement. Juvenile migrants that had not yet established a
      navigational map also oriented WSW at the capture site but became randomly
      oriented when the magnetic declination was shifted 8.5 degrees . In combination
      with latitudinal cues, which birds are known to detect and use [10-12], magnetic 
      declination could provide the mostly east-west component for a true bi-coordinate
      navigation system under clear skies for experienced migratory birds in some areas
      of the globe.

AB  - Topological distributions of individual cellular clocks have not been
      demonstrated in peripheral organs. The cochlea displays circadian patterns of
      core clock gene expression [1, 2]. PER2 protein is expressed in the hair cells
      and spiral ganglion neurons of the cochlea in the spiral ganglion neurons [1]. To
      investigate the topological organization of cellular oscillators in the cochlea, 
      we recorded circadian rhythms from mouse cochlear explants using highly sensitive
      real-time tracking of PER2::LUC bioluminescence. Here, we show cell-autonomous
      and self-sustained oscillations originating from hair cells and spiral ganglion
      neurons. Multi-phased cellular clocks were arranged along the length of the
      cochlea with oscillations initiating at the apex (low-frequency region) and
      traveling toward the base (high-frequency region). Phase differences of 3 hr were
      found between cellular oscillators in the apical and middle regions and from
      isolated individual cochlear regions, indicating that cellular networks organize 
      the rhythms along the tonotopic axis. This is the first demonstration of a
      spatiotemporal arrangement of circadian clocks at the cellular level in a
      peripheral organ. Cochlear rhythms were disrupted in the presence of either
      voltage-gated potassium channel blocker (TEA) or extracellular calcium chelator
      (BAPTA), demonstrating that multiple types of ion channels contribute to the
      maintenance of coherent rhythms. In contrast, preventing action potentials with
      tetrodotoxin (TTX) or interfering with cell-to-cell communication the
      broad-spectrum gap junction blocker (CBX [carbenoxolone]) had no influence on
      cochlear rhythms. These findings highlight a dynamic regulation and longitudinal 
      distribution of cellular clocks in the cochlea.

AB  - Methylotrophy is the ability of organisms to grow at the expense of reduced
      one-carbon compounds, such as methanol or methane. Here, we used transposon
      sequencing combining hyper-saturated transposon mutagenesis with high-throughput 
      sequencing to define the essential methylotrophy genome of Methylobacterium
      extorquens PA1, a model methylotroph. To distinguish genomic regions required for
      growth only on methanol from general required genes, we contrasted growth on
      methanol with growth on succinate, a non-methylotrophic reference substrate.
      About 500,000 insertions were mapped for each condition, resulting in a median
      insertion distance of five base pairs. We identified 147 genes and 76 genes as
      specific for growth on methanol and succinate, respectively, and a set of 590
      genes as required under both growth conditions. For the integration of metabolic 
      functions, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model and performed in
      silico essentiality analysis. In total, the approach uncovered 95 genes not
      previously described as crucial for methylotrophy, including genes involved in
      respiration, carbon metabolism, transport, and regulation. Strikingly, regardless
      of the absence of the Calvin cycle in the methylotroph, the screen led to the
      identification of the gene for phosphoribulokinase as essential during growth on 
      methanol, but not during growth on succinate. Genetic experiments in addition to 
      metabolomics and proteomics revealed that phosphoribulokinase serves a key
      regulatory function. Our data support a model according to which
      ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is an essential metabolite that induces a
      transcriptional regulator driving one-carbon assimilation.

AB  - The eukaryotic kinetochore is a sophisticated multi-protein machine that
      segregates chromosomes during cell division. To ensure accurate chromosome
      segregation, it performs three major functions using disparate molecular
      mechanisms. It operates a mechanosensitive signaling cascade known as the spindle
      assembly checkpoint (SAC) to detect and signal the lack of attachment to spindle 
      microtubules, and delay anaphase onset in response. In addition, after attaching 
      to spindle microtubules, the kinetochore generates the force necessary to move
      chromosomes. Finally, if the two sister kinetochores on a chromosome are both
      attached to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole, they activate
      another mechanosensitive mechanism to correct the monopolar attachments. All
      three of these functions maintain genome stability during cell division. The
      outlines of the biochemical activities responsible for these functions are now
      available. How the kinetochore integrates the underlying molecular mechanisms is 
      still being elucidated. In this Review, we discuss how the nanoscale protein
      organization in the kinetochore, which we refer to as kinetochore 'architecture',
      organizes its biochemical activities to facilitate the realization and
      integration of emergent mechanisms underlying its three major functions. For this
      discussion, we will use the relatively simple budding yeast kinetochore as a
      model, and extrapolate insights gained from this model to elucidate functional
      roles of the architecture of the much more complex human kinetochore.

AB  - In a recent Current Biology paper [1], we reported the oldest, morphologically
      specialized, and obligate termitophiles, Cretotrichopsenius burmiticus (Figure 1,
      left), from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, about 99 million years old.
      Cretotrichopsenius, belonging to the obligately termitophilous rove beetle tribe 
      Trichopseniini, display the protective horseshoe-crab-shaped body typical of many
      extant termitophiles. However, the termitophilous lifestyle of Cretotrichopsenius
      is being questioned by Yamamoto et al.[2] based on their representation of the
      termitophile-related features and premature and presumptive phylogenetic
      placement of Cretotrichopsenius within Trichopseniini. We stand by our
      interpretation that Cretotrichopsenius are obligate termitophiles, and
      Mesosymbion[3], a member of the largely free-living Mesoporini, are not
      necessarily termitophilous.

AB  - Fossil morphology is often used to infer the ecology of extinct species. In a
      recent report in Current Biology, Cai and colleagues [1] described an extinct
      rove beetle, Cretotrichopsenius burmiticus, from two specimens in mid-Cretaceous 
      Burmese amber ( approximately 99 million years old). Based on morphology and the 
      taxonomic group to which the specimens belong, the authors proposed that
      Cretotrichopsenius was a termitophile - a socially parasitic symbiont of termite 
      colonies. Moreover, the new taxon was claimed to represent the oldest
      "unequivocal" termitophile so far discovered, pushing back the known evolutionary
      history of termitophily by approximately 80 million years, close to the origin of
      termite eusociality. Cretotrichopsenius is certainly an important discovery for
      understanding the evolutionary steps leading to this type of social insect
      symbiosis. However, we issue a caveat here concerning the authors' assertion that
      Cretotrichopsenius was truly termitophilous. Additionally, we question the
      authors' representation of a previously published, likely-termitophilous rove
      beetle in Burmese amber [2].

AB  - Face perception in humans and nonhuman primates is rapid and accurate [1-4]. In
      the human brain, a network of visual-processing regions is specialized for faces 
      [5-7]. Although face processing is a priority of the primate visual system, face 
      detection is not infallible. Face pareidolia is the compelling illusion of
      perceiving facial features on inanimate objects, such as the illusory face on the
      surface of the moon. Although face pareidolia is commonly experienced by humans, 
      its presence in other species is unknown. Here we provide evidence for face
      pareidolia in a species known to possess a complex face-processing system [8-10]:
      the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). In a visual preference task [11, 12], monkeys
      looked longer at photographs of objects that elicited face pareidolia in human
      observers than at photographs of similar objects that did not elicit illusory
      faces. Examination of eye movements revealed that monkeys fixated the illusory
      internal facial features in a pattern consistent with how they view photographs
      of faces [13]. Although the specialized response to faces observed in humans [1, 
      3, 5-7, 14] is often argued to be continuous across primates [4, 15], it was
      previously unclear whether face pareidolia arose from a uniquely human capacity. 
      For example, pareidolia could be a product of the human aptitude for perceptual
      abstraction or result from frequent exposure to cartoons and illustrations that
      anthropomorphize inanimate objects. Instead, our results indicate that the
      perception of illusory facial features on inanimate objects is driven by a
      broadly tuned face-detection mechanism that we share with other species.

AB  - Toxic nectar is an ecological paradox [1, 2]. Plants divert substantial resources
      to produce nectar that attracts pollinators [3], but toxins in this reward could 
      disrupt the mutualism and reduce plant fitness [4]. Alternatively, such compounds
      could protect nectar from robbers [2], provided that they do not significantly
      alter pollinator visitation to the detriment of plant fitness [1, 5-8]. Indeed,
      very few studies have investigated the role of plant toxins in nectar for defense
      against nectar robbers [4, 9, 10]. Here, we compared two Aconitum species (A.
      napellus and A. lycoctonum) that have flowers specialized for long-tongued
      bumblebee pollinators (Bombus hortorum) but are occasionally robbed by
      short-tongued bumblebees (B. terrestris) [6, 11-13]. Pollinator visits to flowers
      were much more frequent than by robbers, but visits correlated negatively with
      nectar alkaloid concentration and declined sharply between 200 and 380 ppm.
      However, alkaloid concentrations of >20 ppm were deterrent to B. terrestris,
      suggesting that robbers were less tolerant of nectar alkaloids. Nectar of both
      plant species contained similar concentrations of carbohydrates and toxic
      alkaloids, but A. lycoctonum was more likely to secrete nectar in each flower and
      was also visited more frequently by pollinators and robbers. We conclude that
      alkaloids in Aconitum spp. nectar affect rates of both pollinator visitation and 
      robbery but may have co-evolved with nectar availability to maintain the fitness 
      benefits of specialized plant-pollinator relationships. Chemical defense of
      nectar is, however, ultimately constrained by pollinator gustatory sensitivity.

AB  - Spatial control of cell-wall deposition is essential for determining plant cell
      shape [1]. Rho-type GTPases, together with the cortical cytoskeleton, play
      central roles in regulating cell-wall patterning [2]. In metaxylem vessel cells, 
      which are the major components of xylem tissues, active ROP11 Rho GTPases form
      oval plasma membrane domains that locally disrupt cortical microtubules, thereby 
      directing the formation of oval pits in secondary cell walls [3-5]. However, the 
      regulatory mechanism that determines the planar shape of active Rho of Plants
      (ROP) domains is still unknown. Here we show that IQD13 associates with cortical 
      microtubules and the plasma membrane to laterally restrict the localization of
      ROP GTPase domains, thereby directing the formation of oval secondary cell-wall
      pits. Loss and overexpression of IQD13 led to the formation of abnormally round
      and narrow secondary cell-wall pits, respectively. Ectopically expressed IQD13
      increased the presence of parallel cortical microtubules by promoting microtubule
      rescue. A reconstructive approach revealed that IQD13 confines the area of active
      ROP domains within the lattice of the cortical microtubules, causing narrow ROP
      domains to form. This activity required the interaction of IQD13 with the plasma 
      membrane. These findings suggest that IQD13 positively regulates microtubule
      dynamics as well as their linkage to the plasma membrane, which synergistically
      confines the area of active ROP domains, leading to the formation of oval
      secondary cell-wall pits. This finding sheds light on the role of
      microtubule-plasma membrane linkage as a lateral fence that determines the planar
      shape of Rho GTPase domains.

AB  - Neutral genetic diversity gradients have long been used to infer the colonization
      history of species [1, 2], but range expansion may also influence the efficacy of
      natural selection and patterns of non-synonymous polymorphism in different parts 
      of a species' range [3]. Recent theory predicts both an accumulation of
      deleterious mutations and a reduction in the efficacy of positive selection as a 
      result of range expansion [4-8]. These signatures have been sought in a number of
      studies of the human range expansion out of Africa, but with contradictory
      results [9-14]. We analyzed the polymorphism patterns of 578,125 SNPs (17,648
      genes) in the European diploid plant Mercurialis annua, which expanded its range 
      from an eastern Mediterranean refugium into western habitats with contrasted
      climates [15]. Our results confirmed strong signatures of bottlenecks and
      revealed the accumulation of mildly to strongly deleterious mutations in
      range-front populations. A significantly higher number of these mutations were
      homozygous in individuals in range-front populations, pointing to increased
      genetic load and reduced fitness under a model of recessive deleterious effects. 
      We also inferred a reduction in the number of selective sweeps in range-front
      versus core populations. These signatures have persisted even in a dioecious herb
      subject to substantial interpopulation gene flow [15]. Our results extend support
      from humans to plants for theory on the dynamics of mutations under selection
      during range expansion, showing that colonization bottlenecks can compromise
      adaptive potential.

AB  - Noxious stimuli trigger a stereotyped escape response in animals. In Drosophila
      larvae, class IV dendrite arborization (C4 da) sensory neurons in the peripheral 
      nervous system are responsible for perception of multiple nociceptive modalities,
      including noxious heat and harsh mechanical stimulation, through distinct
      receptors [1-9]. Silencing or ablation of C4 da neurons largely eliminates larval
      responses to noxious stimuli [10-12], whereas optogenetic activation of C4 da
      neurons is sufficient to provoke corkscrew-like rolling behavior similar to what 
      is observed when larvae receive noxious stimuli, such as high temperature or
      harsh mechanical stimulation [10-12]. The receptors and the regulatory mechanisms
      for C4 da activation in response to a variety of noxious stimuli have been well
      studied [13-23], yet how C4 da activation triggers the escape behavior in the
      circuit level is still incompletely understood. Here we identify segmentally
      arrayed local interneurons (medial clusters of C4 da second-order interneurons
      [mCSIs]) in the ventral nerve cord that are necessary and sufficient to trigger
      rolling behavior. GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) analysis
      indicates that C4 da axons form synapses with mCSI dendrites. Optogenetic
      activation of mCSIs induces the rolling behavior, whereas silencing mCSIs reduces
      the probability of rolling behavior upon C4 da activation. Further anatomical and
      functional studies suggest that the C4 da-mCSI nociceptive circuit evokes rolling
      behavior at least in part through segmental nerve a (SNa) motor neurons. Our
      findings thus uncover a local circuit that promotes escape behavior upon noxious 
      stimuli in Drosophila larvae and provide mechanistic insights into how noxious
      stimuli are transduced into the stereotyped escape behavior in the circuit level.

AB  - Joint analyses of genes and languages, both of which are transmitted in
      populations by descent with modification-genes vertically by Mendel's laws,
      language via combinations of vertical, oblique, and horizontal processes
      [1-4]-provide an informative approach for human evolutionary studies [5-10].
      Although gene-language analyses have employed extensive data on individual
      genetic variation [11-23], their linguistic data have not considered
      corresponding long-recognized [24] variability in individual speech patterns, or 
      idiolects. Genetically admixed populations that speak creole languages show high 
      genetic and idiolectal variation-genetic variation owing to heterogeneity in
      ancestry within admixed groups [25, 26] and idiolectal variation owing to recent 
      language formation from differentiated sources [27-31]. To examine cotransmission
      of genetic and linguistic variation within populations, we collected genetic
      markers and speech recordings in the admixed creole-speaking population of Cape
      Verde, whose Kriolu language traces to West African languages and Portuguese [29,
      32-35] and whose genetic ancestry has individual variation in European and
      continental African contributions [36-39]. In parallel with the combined
      Portuguese and West African origin of Kriolu, we find that genetic admixture in
      Cape Verde varies on an axis separating Iberian and Senegambian populations. We
      observe, analogously to vertical genetic transmission, transmission of idiolect
      from parents to offspring, as idiolect is predicted by parental birthplace, even 
      after controlling for shared parent-child birthplaces. Further, African genetic
      admixture correlates with an index tabulating idiolectal features with likely
      African origins. These results suggest that Cape Verdean genetic and linguistic
      admixture have followed parallel evolutionary trajectories, with cotransmission
      of genetic and linguistic variation.

AB  - Oriented cell divisions are controlled by a conserved molecular cascade involving
      Galphai, LGN, and NuMA. We developed a new cellular model of oriented cell
      divisions combining micropatterning and localized recruitment of Galphai and
      performed an RNAi screen for regulators acting downstream of Galphai. Remarkably,
      this screen revealed a unique subset of dynein regulators as being essential for 
      spindle orientation, shedding light on a core regulatory aspect of oriented
      divisions. We further analyze the involvement of one novel regulator, the
      actin-capping protein CAPZB. Mechanistically, we show that CAPZB controls spindle
      orientation independently of its classical role in the actin cytoskeleton by
      regulating the assembly, stability, and motor activity of the dynein/dynactin
      complex at the cell cortex, as well as the dynamics of mitotic microtubules.
      Finally, we show that CAPZB controls planar divisions in vivo in the developing
      neuroepithelium. This demonstrates the power of this in cellulo model of oriented
      cell divisions to uncover new genes required in spindle orientation in
      vertebrates.

AB  - Although classically associated with urban environments in invertebrates,
      melanism in terrestrial snakes is more often linked to occupancy of cool climates
      [1-3]. Thermal advantages to melanism do not apply in aquatic snakes [4], but
      although turtle-headed seasnakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) are banded or blotched
      across a wide geographic range [5], most individuals are melanic in polluted
      inshore bays of the Pacific island of New Caledonia [4]. Why has melanism evolved
      in these urban sites? Because trace elements bind to melanin, darker feathers
      enhance a bird's ability to shed pollutants [6]. Reptiles in polluted habitats
      also accumulate trace elements, which are expelled when the skin is sloughed
      [7-11]. Might melanism enable snakes to rid themselves of harmful pollutants? We 
      measured trace elements in sloughed skins of seasnakes from urban-industrial
      versus other areas and in dark versus light skin. For the latter comparison, we
      used data from laticaudine seasnakes (sea kraits Laticauda spp.), in which each
      individual is dark and light banded, facilitating comparisons between dark and
      light skin. As predicted, concentrations of trace elements were higher in snakes 
      from urban-industrial areas and higher in darker than paler skin (even within the
      same slough). The rate of excretion of trace elements is further enhanced by
      higher frequencies of sloughing in melanic than banded individuals, even within
      the same population, because of higher rates of algal settlement on darker skin. 
      Thus, melanism of seasnakes in polluted sites may facilitate excretion of trace
      elements via sloughing. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - The factors rate-limiting growth of photosynthetic organisms under optimal
      conditions are controversial [1-8]. Adaptation to extreme environments is usually
      accompanied by reduced performance under optimal conditions [9, 10]. However, the
      green alga Chlorella ohadii, isolated from a harsh desert biological soil crust
      [11-17], does not obey this rule. In addition to resistance to photodamage [17,
      18], it performs the fastest growth ever reported for photosynthetic eukaryotes. 
      A multiphasic growth pattern (very fast growth [phase I], followed by growth
      retardation [phase II] and additional fast growth [phase III]) observed under
      constant illumination and temperature indicates synchronization of the algal
      population. Large physiological changes at transitions between growth phases
      suggest metabolic shifts. Indeed, metabolome analyses at points along the growth 
      phases revealed large changes in the levels of many metabolites during growth
      with an overall rise during phase I and decline in phase II. Multivariate
      analysis of the metabolome data highlighted growth phase as the main factor
      contributing to observed metabolite variance. The analyses identified putrescine 
      as the strongest predictive metabolite for growth phase and a putative growth
      regulator. Indeed, extracellular additions of polyamines strongly affected the
      growth rate in phase I and the growth arrest in phase II, with a marked effect on
      O2 exchange. Our data implicate polyamines as the signals harmonizing metabolic
      shifts and suggest that metabolic flexibility enables the immense growth
      capabilities of C. ohadii. The data provide a new dimension to current models
      focusing on growth-limiting processes in photosynthetic organisms where the
      anabolic and catabolic metabolisms must be strictly regulated.

AB  - Post-ingestive signals related to nutrient metabolism are thought to be the
      primary drivers of reinforcement potency of energy sources. Here, in a series of 
      neuroimaging and indirect calorimetry human studies, we examine the relative
      roles of caloric load and perceived sweetness in driving metabolic, perceptual,
      and brain responses to sugared beverages. Whereas caloric load was manipulated
      using the tasteless carbohydrate maltodextrin, sweetness levels were manipulated 
      using the non-nutritive sweetener sucralose. By formulating beverages that
      contain different amounts of maltodextrin+sucralose, we demonstrate a non-linear 
      association between caloric load, metabolic response, and reinforcement potency, 
      which is driven in part by the extent to which sweetness is proportional to
      caloric load. In particular, we show that (1) lower-calorie beverages can produce
      greater metabolic response and condition greater brain response and liking than
      higher-calorie beverages and (2) when sweetness is proportional to caloric load, 
      greater metabolic responses are observed. These results demonstrate a non-linear 
      association between caloric load and reward and describe an unanticipated role
      for sweet taste in regulating carbohydrate metabolism, revealing a novel
      mechanism by which sugar-sweetened beverages influence physiological responses to
      carbohydrate ingestion.

AB  - Spontaneous patterns of activity in the developing visual system may play an
      important role in shaping the brain for function. During the period 4-9 dpf (days
      post-fertilization), larval zebrafish learn to hunt prey, a behavior that is
      critically dependent on the optic tectum. However, how spontaneous activity
      develops in the tectum over this period and the effect of visual experience are
      unknown. Here we performed two-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6s zebrafish larvae
      at all days from 4 to 9 dpf. Using recently developed graph theoretic techniques,
      we found significant changes in both single-cell and population activity
      characteristics over development. In particular, we identified days 5-6 as a
      critical moment in the reorganization of the underlying functional network.
      Altering visual experience early in development altered the statistics of tectal 
      activity, and dark rearing also caused a long-lasting deficit in the ability to
      capture prey. Thus, tectal development is shaped by both intrinsic factors and
      visual experience.

AB  - Centrioles are evolutionarily conserved macromolecular structures that are
      fundamental to form cilia, flagella, and centrosomes. Centrioles are 9-fold
      symmetrical microtubule-based cylindrical barrels comprising three regions that
      can be clearly distinguished in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii organelle: an
      approximately 100-nm-long proximal region harboring a cartwheel; an approximately
      250-nm-long central core region containing a Y-shaped linker; and an
      approximately 150-nm-long distal region ending at the transitional plate. Despite
      the discovery of many centriolar components, no protein has been localized
      specifically to the central core region in Chlamydomonas thus far. Here,
      combining relative quantitative mass spectrometry and super-resolution microscopy
      on purified Chlamydomonas centrioles, we identified POB15 and POC16 as two
      proteins of the central core region, the distribution of which correlates with
      that of tubulin glutamylation. We demonstrated that POB15 is an inner barrel
      protein within this region. Moreover, we developed an assay to uncover temporal
      relationships between centriolar proteins during organelle assembly and thus
      established that POB15 is recruited after the cartwheel protein CrSAS-6 and
      before tubulin glutamylation takes place. Furthermore, we discovered that two
      poc16 mutants exhibit flagellar defects, indicating that POC16 is important for
      flagellum biogenesis. In addition, we discovered that WDR90, the human homolog of
      POC16, localizes to a region of human centrioles that we propose is analogous to 
      the central core of Chlamydomonas centrioles. Moreover, we demonstrate that WDR90
      is required for ciliogenesis, echoing the findings in Chlamydomonas. Overall, our
      work provides novel insights into the identity and function of centriolar central
      core components.

AB  - Chaetognaths (arrow worms) are a separate phylum (Chaetognatha) of small
      carnivorous animals, dominantly pelagic, and a major component of today's
      plankton [1, 2]. The position of Chaetognatha among metazoan phyla remains
      equivocal-neither morphological nor molecular data provide definitive evidence
      [3]. Originating early in the Cambrian period [4], if not earlier [5],
      chaetognaths quickly became important members of marine metazoan communities [6].
      Chaetognath grasping spines, originally reported as conodonts, occur worldwide in
      many Cambrian marine sediments [6, 7]. Fossilized chaetognath bodies, in
      contrast, are very rare: only two unequivocal specimens have been reported, both 
      from the early Cambrian of China [8, 9]. Here we describe Capinatator
      praetermissus, a new genus and species, based on approximately 50 specimens from 
      several middle Cambrian Burgess Shale localities in British Columbia, many of
      which preserve evidence of soft tissues. Capinatator praetermissus reached body
      lengths of nearly 10 cm exclusive of fins, a much larger size than that of most
      living forms. Clusters of specimens preserving the body indicate that they were
      rapidly buried, providing indirect evidence that they swam near the seabed. The
      feeding apparatus comprises up to approximately 25 spines in each half, almost
      double the maximum number in living chaetognaths. Early chaetognaths apparently
      occupied ecological niches associated with predatory euarthropods. The large body
      size and high number of grasping spines in C. praetermissus may indicate that
      miniaturization and migration to a planktonic lifestyle were secondary.

TI  - An Exceptionally Preserved Three-Dimensional Armored Dinosaur Reveals Insights
      into Coloration and Cretaceous Predator-Prey Dynamics.

AB  - Predator-prey dynamics are an important evolutionary driver of escalating
      predation mode and efficiency, and commensurate responses of prey [1-3]. Among
      these strategies, camouflage is important for visual concealment, with
      countershading the most universally observed [4-6]. Extant terrestrial herbivores
      free of significant predation pressure, due to large size or isolation, do not
      exhibit countershading. Modern predator-prey dynamics may not be directly
      applicable to those of the Mesozoic due to the dominance of very large, visually 
      oriented theropod dinosaurs [7]. Despite thyreophoran dinosaurs' possessing
      extensive dermal armor, some of the most extreme examples of anti-predator
      structures [8, 9], little direct evidence of predation on these and other
      dinosaur megaherbivores has been documented. Here we describe a new, exquisitely 
      three-dimensionally preserved nodosaurid ankylosaur, Borealopelta markmitchelli
      gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous of Alberta, which preserves
      integumentary structures as organic layers, including continuous fields of
      epidermal scales and intact horn sheaths capping the body armor. We identify
      melanin in the organic residues through mass spectroscopic analyses and observe
      lighter pigmentation of the large parascapular spines, consistent with display,
      and a pattern of countershading across the body. With an estimated body mass
      exceeding 1,300 kg, B. markmitchelli was much larger than modern terrestrial
      mammals that either are countershaded or experience significant predation
      pressure as adults. Presence of countershading suggests predation pressure strong
      enough to select for concealment in this megaherbivore despite possession of
      massive dorsal and lateral armor, illustrating a significant dichotomy between
      Mesozoic predator-prey dynamics and those of modern terrestrial systems.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission controls behaviors important for survival,
      including voluntary movement, reward processing, and detection of salient events,
      such as food or mate availability. Dopaminergic tone also influences circadian
      physiology and behavior. Although the evolutionary significance of this input is 
      appreciated, its precise neurophysiological architecture remains unknown. Here,
      we identify a novel, direct connection between the DA neurons of the ventral
      tegmental area (VTA) and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). We demonstrate that
      D1 dopamine receptor (Drd1) signaling within the SCN is necessary for properly
      timed resynchronization of activity rhythms to phase-shifted light:dark cycles
      and that elevation of DA tone through selective activation of VTA DA neurons
      accelerates photoentrainment. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated
      role for direct DA input to the master circadian clock and highlight the
      importance of an evolutionarily significant relationship between the circadian
      system and the neuromodulatory circuits that govern motivational behaviors.

AB  - Actions are typically associated with sensory consequences. For example, knocking
      at a door results in predictable sounds. These self-initiated sensory stimuli are
      known to elicit smaller cortical responses compared to passively presented
      stimuli, e.g., early auditory evoked magnetic fields known as M100 and M200
      components are attenuated. Current models implicate the cerebellum in the
      prediction of the sensory consequences of our actions. However, causal evidence
      is largely missing. In this study, we introduced a constant delay (of 100 ms)
      between actions and action-associated sounds, and we recorded
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) data as participants adapted to the delay. We found 
      an increase in the attenuation of the M100 component over time for self-generated
      sounds, which indicates cortical adaptation to the introduced delay. In contrast,
      no change in M200 attenuation was found. Interestingly, disrupting cerebellar
      activity via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) abolished the adaptation of 
      M100 attenuation, while the M200 attenuation reverses to an M200 enhancement. Our
      results provide causal evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum in adapting
      to delayed action effects, and thus in the prediction of the sensory consequences
      of our actions.

TI  - Drosophila CRY Entrains Clocks in Body Tissues to Light and Maintains Passive
      Membrane Properties in a Non-clock Body Tissue Independent of Light.

AB  - Circadian ( approximately 24 hr) clocks regulate daily rhythms in physiology,
      metabolism, and behavior via cell-autonomous transcriptional feedback loops. In
      Drosophila, the blue-light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) synchronizes these
      feedback loops to light:dark cycles by binding to and degrading TIMELESS (TIM)
      protein. CRY also acts independently of TIM in Drosophila to alter potassium
      channel conductance in arousal neurons after light exposure, and in many animals 
      CRY acts independently of light to repress rhythmic transcription. CRY expression
      has been characterized in the Drosophila brain and eyes, but not in peripheral
      clock and non-clock tissues in the body. To investigate CRY expression and
      function in body tissues, we generated a GFP-tagged-cry transgene that rescues
      light-induced behavioral phase resetting in cry(03) mutant flies and sensitively 
      reports GFP-CRY expression. In bodies, CRY is detected in clock-containing
      tissues including Malpighian tubules, where it mediates both light-dependent TIM 
      degradation and clock function. In larval salivary glands, which lack clock
      function but are amenable to electrophysiological recording, CRY prevents
      membrane input resistance from falling to low levels in a light-independent
      manner. The ability of CRY to maintain high input resistance in these
      non-excitable cells also requires the K(+) channel subunits Hyperkinetic, Shaker,
      and ether-a-go-go. These findings for the first time define CRY expression in
      Drosophila peripheral tissues and reveal that CRY acts together with K(+)
      channels to maintain passive membrane properties in a non-clock-containing
      peripheral tissue independent of light.

AB  - Plant seedlings emerging from darkness into the light environment undergo
      photomorphogenesis, which enables autotrophic growth with optimized morphology
      and physiology. During this transition, plants must rapidly remove
      photomorphogenic repressors accumulated in the dark. Among them is
      PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3), a key transcription factor promoting
      hypocotyl growth. Here we report that, in response to light activation of
      phytochrome photoreceptors, EIN3-BINDING F BOX PROTEINs (EBFs) 1 and 2 mediate
      PIF3 protein degradation in a manner dependent on light-induced phosphorylation
      of PIF3. Whereas PIF3 binds EBFs independent of light, the recruitment of
      PIF3-EBFs to the core SKP1-CUL1-F box protein (SCF) scaffold is facilitated by
      light signals or PIF3 phosphorylation. We also found that previously identified
      LIGHT-RESPONSE BRIC-A-BRACK/TRAMTRACK/BROAD (LRB) E3 ubiquitin ligases target
      phytochrome B (phyB) and PIF3 primarily under high-light conditions, whereas
      EBF1/2 vigorously target PIF3 degradation under wide ranges of light intensity
      without affecting the abundance of phyB. Both genetic and molecular data support 
      that SCF(EBF1/2) function as photomorphogenic E3s during seedling development.

AB  - Major improvements in crop yield are needed to keep pace with population growth
      and climate change. While plant breeding efforts have greatly benefited from
      advances in genomics, profiling the crop phenome (i.e., the structure and
      function of plants) associated with allelic variants and environments remains a
      major technical bottleneck. Here, we review the conceptual and technical
      challenges facing plant phenomics. We first discuss how, given plants' high
      levels of morphological plasticity, crop phenomics presents distinct challenges
      compared with studies in animals. Next, we present strategies for multi-scale
      phenomics, and describe how major improvements in imaging, sensor technologies
      and data analysis are now making high-throughput root, shoot, whole-plant and
      canopy phenomic studies possible. We then suggest that research in this area is
      entering a new stage of development, in which phenomic pipelines can help
      researchers transform large numbers of images and sensor data into knowledge,
      necessitating novel methods of data handling and modelling. Collectively, these
      innovations are helping accelerate the selection of the next generation of crops 
      more sustainable and resilient to climate change, and whose benefits promise to
      scale from physiology to breeding and to deliver real world impact for ongoing
      global food security efforts.

AB  - Modern humans originated in Africa, but where exactly? So far, East Africa
      harbored the oldest fossil and archaeological evidence. Now, fossils and stone
      tools from a cave in Morocco challenge the notion that East Africa was the
      birthplace of modern humans.

AB  - The mitotic spindle bears the load of chromosomes during mitosis, but how this
      load is distributed across the spindle is unclear. A new study shows that load
      distribution in the spindle is confined and requires the microtubule
      cross-linking protein NuMA.

AB  - In plants, one of the most understated developmental phenomena is that of
      straightness - a root will grow down, a petal will grow flat. A new mutant in
      Arabidopsis thaliana that displays twisting in petals and roots, at the organ and
      cell level, has been investigated. Strikingly, the twisting is always left-handed
      and is not due to underlying cytoskeletal skewing, as is the case in other known,
      phenotypically similar, mutants.

AB  - A number of previous studies have reported microbial degradation of polyethylene 
      [1,2]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of the products of
      degradation are, in many cases, contradictory, especially with regard to the
      relative intensities of different signals, suggesting that pathways are complex
      and may differ among organisms [1,2]. A detailed consideration of possible
      degradation products and pathways would have been beyond the scope of our initial
      brief report [3]. Nevertheless, the peaks to which we drew attention are
      consistent with those generally described in other studies.

AB  - In their recent paper on the degradation of polyethylene by caterpillars of the
      wax moth Galleria melonella, Bombelli et al.[1] report various experiments,
      including microscopic and spectroscopic data which the authors believe support
      the chemical digestion of the polymers by these insects. While the biodegradation
      of mostly inert artificial polymers is definitely a very interesting research
      field, we must respectfully disagree with the methodology and conclusions from
      this paper.

AB  - The reality of invisible chemical signals, pheromones, between members of the
      same species was recognized long before they could be identified. Charles Darwin 
      proposed that the breeding season sexual smells of male crocodiles, goats and
      other animals, too, could have evolved by sexual selection of the smelliest males
      through female choice. But it's not just sex. We now know that pheromones are
      used by species all across the animal kingdom, in every habitat, and in a wide
      range of biological contexts, from trail, alarm, and queen pheromones in social
      insects to the mammary pheromone produced by mother rabbits. Pheromones have
      provided fascinating examples of signal evolution. In some model organisms, such 
      as moths, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Mus musculus, a complete
      signaling system can be genetically dissected, from the enzymes producing
      pheromones, perception by chemosensory receptors, through to the neural circuits 
      processing the signals.

AB  - A long-standing goal of neuroscience has been to understand how computations are 
      implemented across large-scale brain networks. By correlating spontaneous
      activity during "resting states" [1], studies of intrinsic brain networks in
      humans have demonstrated a correspondence with task-related activation patterns
      [2], relationships to behavior [3], and alterations in processes such as aging
      [4] and brain disorders [5], highlighting the importance of resting-state
      measurements for understanding brain function. Here, we develop methods to
      measure intrinsic functional connectivity in Drosophila, a powerful model for the
      study of neural computation. Recent studies using calcium imaging have measured
      neural activity at high spatial and temporal resolution in zebrafish, Drosophila 
      larvae, and worms [6-10]. For example, calcium imaging in the zebrafish brain
      recently revealed correlations between the midbrain and hindbrain, demonstrating 
      the utility of measuring intrinsic functional connections in model organisms [8].
      An important component of human connectivity research is the use of brain atlases
      to compare findings across individuals and studies [11]. An anatomical atlas of
      the central adult fly brain was recently described [12]; however, combining an
      atlas with whole-brain calcium imaging has yet to be performed in vivo in adult
      Drosophila. Here, we measure intrinsic functional connectivity in Drosophila by
      acquiring calcium signals from the central brain. We develop an alignment
      procedure to assign functional data to atlas regions and correlate activity
      between regions to generate brain networks. This work reveals a large-scale
      architecture for neural communication and provides a framework for using
      Drosophila to study functional brain networks.

AB  - Neural oscillations, such as alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-100 
      Hz), are widespread across cortical areas, and their possible functional roles
      include feature binding [1], neuronal communication [2, 3], and memory [1, 4].
      The most prominent signal among these neural oscillations is the alpha
      oscillation. Although accumulating evidence suggests that alpha oscillations
      correlate with various aspects of visual processing [5-18], the number of studies
      proving their causal contribution in visual perception is limited [11, 16-18].
      Here we report that illusory visual vibrations are consciously experienced at the
      frequency of intrinsic alpha oscillations. We employed an illusory jitter
      perception termed the motion-induced spatial conflict [19] that originates from
      the cyclic interaction between motion and shape processing. Comparison between
      the perceived frequency of illusory jitter and the peak alpha frequency (PAF)
      measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that the inter- and
      intra-participant variations of the PAF are mirrored by an illusory jitter
      perception. More crucially, psychophysical and MEG measurements during
      amplitude-modulated current stimulation [20] showed that the PAF can be
      artificially manipulated, which results in a corresponding change in the
      perceived jitter frequency. These results suggest the causal contribution of
      neural oscillations at the alpha frequency in creating temporal characteristics
      of visual perception. Our results suggest that cortical areas, dorsal and ventral
      visual areas in this case, are interacting at the frequency of alpha oscillations
      [2, 3, 21-27].

TI  - Gut Microbiota Modifies Olfactory-Guided Microbial Preferences and Foraging
      Decisions in Drosophila.

AB  - The gut microbiota affects a wide spectrum of host physiological traits,
      including development [1-5], germline [6], immunity [7-9], nutrition [4, 10, 11],
      and longevity [12, 13]. Association with microbes also influences fitness-related
      behaviors such as mating [14] and social interactions [15, 16]. Although the gut 
      microbiota is evidently important for host wellbeing, how hosts become associated
      with particular assemblages of microbes from the environment remains unclear.
      Here, we present evidence that the gut microbiota can modify microbial and
      nutritional preferences of Drosophila melanogaster. By experimentally
      manipulating the gut microbiota of flies subjected to behavioral and chemosensory
      assays, we found that fly-microbe attractions are shaped by the identity of the
      host microbiota. Conventional flies exhibit preference for their associated
      Lactobacillus, a behavior also present in axenic flies as adults and marginally
      as larvae. By contrast, fly preference for Acetobacter is primed by early-life
      exposure and can override the innate preference. These microbial preferences are 
      largely olfactory guided and have profound impact on host foraging, as flies
      continuously trade off between acquiring beneficial microbes and balancing
      nutrients from food. Our study shows a role of animal microbiota in shaping host 
      fitness-related behavior through their chemosensory responses, opening a research
      theme on the interrelationships between the microbiota, host sensory perception, 
      and behavior.

AB  - The generative power of human language depends on grammatical rules, such as word
      ordering, that allow us to produce and comprehend even novel combinations of
      words [1-3]. Several species of birds and mammals produce sequences of calls
      [4-6], and, like words in human sentences, their order may influence receiver
      responses [7]. However, it is unknown whether animals use call ordering to
      extract meaning from truly novel sequences. Here, we use a novel experimental
      approach to test this in a wild bird species, the Japanese tit (Parus minor).
      Japanese tits are attracted to mobbing a predator when they hear conspecific
      alert and recruitment calls ordered as alert-recruitment sequences [7]. They also
      approach in response to recruitment calls of heterospecific individuals in
      mixed-species flocks [8, 9]. Using experimental playbacks, we assess their
      responses to artificial sequences in which their own alert calls are combined
      into different orderings with heterospecific recruitment calls. We find that
      Japanese tits respond similarly to mixed-species alert-recruitment call sequences
      and to their own alert-recruitment sequences. Importantly, however, tits rarely
      respond to mixed-species sequences in which the call order is reversed. Thus,
      Japanese tits extract a compound meaning from novel call sequences using an
      ordering rule. These results demonstrate a new parallel between animal
      communication systems and human language, opening new avenues for exploring the
      evolution of ordering rules and compositionality in animal vocal sequences.

AB  - Many decisions arise through an accumulation of evidence to a terminating
      threshold. The process, termed bounded evidence accumulation (or drift
      diffusion), provides a unified account of decision speed and accuracy, and it is 
      supported by neurophysiology in human and animal models. In many situations, a
      decision maker may not communicate a decision immediately and yet feel that at
      some point she had made up her mind. We hypothesized that this occurs when an
      accumulation of evidence reaches a termination threshold, registered,
      subjectively, as an "aha" moment. We asked human participants to make perceptual 
      decisions about the net direction of dynamic random dot motion. The difficulty
      and viewing duration were controlled by the experimenter. After indicating their 
      choice, participants adjusted the setting of a clock to the moment they felt they
      had reached a decision. The subjective decision times (tSDs) were faster on
      trials with stronger (easier) motion, and they were well fit by a bounded
      drift-diffusion model. The fits to the tSDs alone furnished parameters that fully
      predicted the choices (accuracy) of four of the five participants. The quality of
      the prediction provides compelling evidence that these subjective reports
      correspond to the terminating process of a decision rather than a post hoc
      inference or arbitrary report. Thus, conscious awareness of having reached a
      decision appears to arise when the brain's representation of accumulated evidence
      reaches a threshold or bound. We propose that such a mechanism might play a more 
      widespread role in the "piercing of consciousness" by non-conscious thought
      processes.

AB  - The brain has an extraordinary ability to create an internal spatial map of the
      external world [1]. This map-like representation of environmental surroundings is
      encoded through specific types of neurons, located within the hippocampus and
      entorhinal cortex, which exhibit spatially tuned firing patterns [2, 3]. In
      addition to encoding space, these neurons are believed to be related to
      contextual information and memory [4-7]. One class of such cells is the grid
      cells, which are located within the entorhinal cortex, presubiculum, and
      parasubiculum [3, 8]. Grid cell firing forms a hexagonal array of firing fields, 
      a pattern that is largely thought to reflect the operation of intrinsic
      self-motion-related computations [9-12]. If this is the case, then fields should 
      be relatively uniform in size, number of spikes, and peak firing rate. However,
      it has been suggested that this is not in fact the case [3, 13]. The possibility 
      exists that local spatial information also influences grid cells, which-if
      true-would greatly change the way in which grid cells are thought to contribute
      to place coding. Accordingly, we asked how discriminable the individual fields of
      a given grid cell are by looking at the distribution of field firing rates and
      reproducibility of this distribution across trials. Grid fields were less uniform
      in intensity than expected, and the pattern of strong and weak fields was
      spatially stable and recurred across trials. The distribution remained unchanged 
      even after arena rescaling, but not after remapping. This suggests that
      additional local information is being overlaid onto the global hexagonal pattern 
      of grid cells.

AB  - Female meiosis provides an opportunity for selfish genetic elements to violate
      Mendel's law of segregation by increasing the chance of segregating to the egg
      [1]. Centromeres and other repetitive sequences can drive in meiosis by cheating 
      the segregation process [2], but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we 
      show that centromeres with more satellite repeats house more nucleosomes that
      confer centromere identity, containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A, and bias
      their segregation to the egg relative to centromeres with fewer repeats. CENP-A
      nucleosomes predominantly occupy a single site within the repeating unit that
      becomes limiting for centromere assembly on smaller centromeres. We propose that 
      amplified repetitive sequences act as selfish elements by promoting expansion of 
      CENP-A chromatin and increased transmission through the female germline.

AB  - From the age of 3 months, infants learn relations between objects and
      co-occurring words [1]. These very first representations of object-word pairings 
      in infant memory are considered as non-symbolic proto-words comprising specific
      visual-auditory associations that can already be formed in the first months of
      life [2-5]. Genuine words that refer to semantic long-term memory have not been
      evidenced prior to 9 months of age [6-9]. Sleep is known to facilitate the
      reorganization of memories [9-14], but its impact on the perceptual-to-semantic
      trend in early development is unknown. Here we explored the formation of word
      meanings in 6- to 8-month-old infants and its reorganization during the course of
      sleep. Infants were exposed to new words as labels for new object categories. In 
      the memory test about an hour later, generalization to novel category exemplars
      was tested. In infants who took a short nap during the retention period, a brain 
      response of 3-month-olds [1] was observed, indicating generalizations based on
      early developing perceptual-associative memory. In those infants who napped
      longer, a semantic priming effect [15, 16] usually found later in development
      [17-19] revealed the formation of genuine words. The perceptual-to-semantic shift
      in memory was related to the duration of sleep stage 2 and to locally increased
      sleep spindle activity. The finding that, after the massed presentation of
      several labeled category exemplars, sleep enabled even 6-month-olds to create
      semantic long-term memory clearly challenges the notion that immature brain
      structures are responsible for the typically slower lexical development.

AB  - The canonical Wnt pathway regulates numerous fundamental processes throughout
      development and adult physiology and is often disrupted in diseases [1-4]. Signal
      in the pathway is transduced by beta-catenin, which in complex with Tcf/Lef
      regulates transcription. Despite the many processes that the Wnt pathway governs,
      beta-catenin acts primarily on a single cis element in the DNA, the
      Wnt-responsive element (WRE), at times potentiated by a nearby Helper site. In
      this study, working with Xenopus, mouse, and human systems, we identified a cis
      element, distinct from WRE, upon which beta-catenin and Tcf act. The element is
      11 bp long, hundreds of bases apart from the WRE, and exhibits a suppressive
      effect. In Xenopus patterning, loss of the 11-bp negative regulatory elements
      (11-bp NREs) broadened dorsal expression of siamois. In mouse embryonic stem
      cells, genomic deletion of the 11-bp NREs in the promoter elevated Brachyury
      expression. This reveals a previously unappreciated mechanism within the Wnt
      pathway, where gene response is not only driven by WREs but also tuned by 11-bp
      NREs. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found evidence for the NREs binding to
      beta-catenin and Tcf-suggesting a dual action by beta-catenin as a signal and a
      feedforward sensor. Analyzing beta-catenin ChIP sequencing in human cells, we
      found the 11-bp NREs co-localizing with the WRE in 45%-71% of the peaks,
      suggesting a widespread role for the mechanism. This study presents an example of
      a more complex cis regulation by a signaling pathway, where a signal is processed
      through two distinct cis elements in a gene circuitry.

AB  - Activity-dependent synaptic remodeling occurs during early-use critical periods, 
      when naive juveniles experience sensory input. Fragile X mental retardation
      protein (FMRP) sculpts synaptic refinement in an activity sensor mechanism based 
      on sensory cues, with FMRP loss causing the most common heritable autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the well-mapped Drosophila olfactory
      circuitry, projection neurons (PNs) relay peripheral sensory information to the
      central brain mushroom body (MB) learning/memory center. FMRP-null PNs reduce
      synaptic branching and enlarge boutons, with ultrastructural and synaptic
      reconstitution MB connectivity defects. Critical period activity modulation via
      odorant stimuli, optogenetics, and transgenic tetanus toxin neurotransmission
      block show that elevated PN activity phenocopies FMRP-null defects, whereas PN
      silencing causes opposing changes. FMRP-null PNs lose activity-dependent synaptic
      modulation, with impairments restricted to the critical period. We conclude that 
      FMRP is absolutely required for experience-dependent changes in synaptic
      connectivity during the developmental critical period of neural circuit
      optimization for sensory input.

AB  - Most eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated in the nucleus, and the poly(A)-tail is 
      required for efficient mRNA export and translation. However, mechanisms governing
      mRNA transport remain unclear. Here, we report that the nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 acts as an energy sensor and
      negatively regulates poly(A)RNA transport via deacetylating a poly(A)-binding
      protein, PABP1. Upon energy starvation, SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates
      PABP1 and deactivates its poly(A)RNA binding, leading to nuclear accumulation of 
      PABP1 and poly(A)RNA and thus facilitating eukaryotic cells to attenuate protein 
      synthesis and energy consumption to adapt to energy stress. Moreover,
      AMPK-directed SIRT1 phosphorylation is required for energy starvation-induced
      PABP1-SIRT1 association, PABP1 deacetylation, and poly(A)RNA nuclear retention.
      In addition, the SIRT1-PABP1 association is not specific to energy starvation but
      represents a common stress response. These observations provide insights into
      dynamic modulation of eukaryotic mRNA transport and translation, suggesting that 
      the poly(A)-tail also provides a basis for eukaryotes to effectively shut down
      mature mRNA transport and thereby tailor protein synthesis to maintain energy
      homeostasis under stress conditions.

AB  - The Drosophila antenna contains receptor neurons for mechanical, olfactory,
      thermal, and humidity stimuli. Neurons expressing the ionotropic receptor IR40a
      have been implicated in the selection of an appropriate humidity range [1, 2],
      but although previous work indicates that insect hygroreceptors may be made up by
      a "triad" of neurons (with a dry-, a cold-, and a humid-air-responding cell [3]),
      IR40a expression included only cold- and dry-air cells. Here, we report the
      identification of the humid-responding neuron that completes the hygrosensory
      triad in the Drosophila antenna. This cell type expresses the Ir68a gene, and
      Ir68a mutation perturbs humidity preference. Next, we follow the projections of
      Ir68a neurons to the brain and show that they form a distinct glomerulus in the
      posterior antennal lobe (PAL). In the PAL, a simple sensory map represents
      related features of the external environment with adjacent "hot," "cold," "dry," 
      and "humid" glomeruli-an organization that allows for both unique and
      combinatorial sampling by central relay neurons. Indeed, flies avoided dry heat
      more robustly than humid heat, and this modulation was abolished by silencing of 
      dry-air receptors. Consistently, at least one projection neuron type received
      direct synaptic input from both temperature and dry-air glomeruli. Our results
      further our understanding of humidity sensing in the Drosophila antenna, uncover 
      a neuronal substrate for early sensory integration of temperature and humidity in
      the brain, and illustrate the logic of how ethologically relevant combinations of
      sensory cues can be processed together to produce adaptive behavioral responses.

AB  - The evolutionary origin of rhythm perception, a cognitive ability essential to
      musicality, remains unresolved [1-5]. The ability to perceive and memorize
      rhythmic sounds is widely shared among humans [6] but seems rare among other
      mammals [7, 8]. Although the perception of temporal metrical patterns has been
      found in a few species, this ability has only been demonstrated through
      behavioral training [9] (but see [10] for an example of spontaneous tempo
      coordination in a bonobo), and there is no experimental evidence to indicate its 
      biological function. Furthermore, there is no example of a non-human mammal able 
      to remember and recognize auditory rhythmic patterns among a wide range of tempi.
      In the northern elephant seal Mirounga angustirostris, the calls of mature males 
      comprise a rhythmic series of pulses, with the call of each individual
      characterized by its tempo and timbre; these individual vocal signatures are
      stable over years and across contexts [11]. Here, we report that northern
      elephant seal males routinely memorize and recognize the unique tempo and timbre 
      of their rivals' voices and use this rhythmic information to individually
      identify competitors, which facilitates navigation within the social network of
      the rookery. By performing playbacks with natural and modified vocalizations, we 
      show that males are sensitive to call rhythm disruption independently of
      modification of spectral features and that they use both temporal and spectral
      cues to identify familiar rivals. While spectral features of calls typically
      encode individual identity in mammalian vocalizations [12], this is the first
      example of this phenomenon involving sound rhythm.

TI  - Overlap among Spatial Memories Triggers Repulsion of Hippocampal Representations.
PG  - 2307-2317.e5

AB  - Across the domains of spatial navigation and episodic memory, the hippocampus is 
      thought to play a critical role in disambiguating (pattern separating)
      representations of overlapping events. However, it is not fully understood how
      and why hippocampal patterns become separated. Here, we test the idea that event 
      overlap triggers a "repulsion" among hippocampal representations that develops
      over the course of learning. Using a naturalistic route-learning paradigm and
      spatiotemporal pattern analysis of human fMRI data, we found that hippocampal
      representations of overlapping routes gradually diverged with learning to the
      point that they became less similar than representations of non-overlapping
      events. In other words, the hippocampus not only disambiguated overlapping events
      but formed representations that "reversed" the objective similarity among routes.
      This finding, which was selective to the hippocampus, is not predicted by
      standard theoretical accounts of pattern separation. Critically, because the
      overlapping route stimuli that we used ultimately diverged (so that each route
      contained overlapping and non-overlapping segments), we were able to test whether
      the reversal effect was selective to the overlapping segments. Indeed, once
      overlapping routes diverged (eliminating spatial and visual similarity),
      hippocampal representations paradoxically became relatively more similar.
      Finally, using a novel analysis approach, we show that the degree to which
      individual hippocampal voxels were initially shared across route representations 
      was predictive of the magnitude of learning-related separation. Collectively,
      these findings indicate that event overlap triggers a repulsion of hippocampal
      representations-a finding that provides critical mechanistic insight into how and
      why hippocampal representations become separated.

AB  - The motility and signaling functions of the primary cilium require a unique
      protein and lipid composition that is determined by gating mechanisms localized
      at the base of the cilium. Several protein complexes localize to the gating zone 
      and may regulate ciliary protein composition; however, the mechanisms of ciliary 
      gating and the dynamics of the gating components are largely unknown. Here, we
      used the BiFC (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) assay and report for the
      first time on the protein-protein interactions that occur between ciliary gating 
      components and transiting cargoes during ciliary entry. We find that the
      nucleoporin Nup62 and the C termini of the nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins NPHP4
      and NPHP5 interact with the axoneme-associated kinesin-2 motor KIF17 and thus
      spatially map to the inner region of the ciliary gating zone. Nup62 and NPHP4
      exhibit rapid turnover at the transition zone and thus define dynamic components 
      of the gate. We find that B9D1, AHI1, and the N termini of NPHP4 and NPHP5
      interact with the transmembrane protein SSTR3 and thus spatially map to the outer
      region of the ciliary gating zone. B9D1, AHI1, and NPHP5 exhibit little to no
      turnover at the transition zone and thus define components of a stable gating
      structure. These data provide the first comprehensive map of the molecular
      orientations of gating zone components along the inner-to-outer axis of the
      ciliary gating zone. These results advance our understanding of the functional
      roles of gating zone components in regulating ciliary protein composition.

AB  - In response to a pulling force, a material can elongate, hold fast, or fracture. 
      During animal development, multi-cellular contraction of one region often
      stretches neighboring tissue. Such local contraction occurs by induced actomyosin
      activity, but molecular mechanisms are unknown for regulating the physical
      properties of connected tissue for elongation under stress. We show that
      cytohesins, and their Arf small G protein guanine nucleotide exchange activity,
      are required for tissues to elongate under stress during both Drosophila dorsal
      closure (DC) and zebrafish epiboly. In Drosophila, protein localization, laser
      ablation, and genetic interaction studies indicate that the cytohesin Steppke
      reduces tissue tension by inhibiting actomyosin activity at adherens junctions.
      Without Steppke, embryogenesis fails, with epidermal distortions and tears
      resulting from myosin misregulation. Remarkably, actomyosin network assembly is
      necessary and sufficient for local Steppke accumulation, where live imaging shows
      Steppke recruitment within minutes. This rapid negative feedback loop provides a 
      molecular mechanism for attenuating the main tension generator of animal tissues.
      Such attenuation relaxes tissues and allows orderly elongation under stress.

AB  - Although specific organs in some plant species exhibit helical growth patterns of
      fixed or variable handedness, most plant organs are not helical. Here we report
      that mutations in Arabidopsis RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS 1 (RHM1) cause dramatic
      left-handed helical growth of petal epidermal cells, leading to left-handed
      twisted petals. rhm1 mutant roots also display left-handed growth. Furthermore,
      we find that RHM1 is required to promote epidermal cell expansion. RHM1 encodes a
      UDP-L-rhamnose synthase, and rhm1 mutations affect synthesis of the pectic
      polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-I. Unlike other mutants that exhibit helical
      growth of fixed handedness, the orientation of cortical microtubule arrays is
      unaltered in rhm1 mutants. Our findings reveal a novel source of left-handed
      plant growth caused by changes in cell wall composition that is independent of
      microtubule orientation. We propose that an important function of
      rhamnose-containing cell wall polymers is to suppress helical twisting of
      expanding plant cells.

AB  - Notch receptors regulate cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and throughout 
      adult life. In many cell lineages, binary fate decisions are mediated by
      directional Notch signaling between the two sister cells produced by cell
      division. How Notch signaling is restricted to sister cells after division to
      regulate intra-lineage decision is poorly understood. More generally, where
      ligand-dependent activation of Notch occurs at the cell surface is not known, as 
      methods to detect receptor activation in vivo are lacking. In Drosophila pupae,
      Notch signals during cytokinesis to regulate the intra-lineage pIIa/pIIb decision
      in the sensory organ lineage. Here, we identify two pools of Notch along the
      pIIa-pIIb interface, apical and basal to the midbody. Analysis of the dynamics of
      Notch, Delta, and Neuralized distribution in living pupae suggests that ligand
      endocytosis and receptor activation occur basal to the midbody. Using selective
      photo-bleaching of GFP-tagged Notch and photo-tracking of photo-convertible
      Notch, we show that nuclear Notch is indeed produced by receptors located basal
      to the midbody. Thus, only a specific subset of receptors, located basal to the
      midbody, contributes to signaling in pIIa. This is the first in vivo
      characterization of the pool of Notch contributing to signaling. We propose a
      simple mechanism of cell fate decision based on intra-lineage signaling: ligands 
      and receptors localize during cytokinesis to the new cell-cell interface, thereby
      ensuring signaling between sister cells, hence intra-lineage fate decision.

AB  - After discovering a small drop of food, hungry flies exhibit a peculiar behavior 
      in which they repeatedly stray from, but then return to, the newly discovered
      resource. To study this behavior in more detail, we tracked hungry Drosophila as 
      they explored a large arena, focusing on the question of how flies remain near
      the food. To determine whether flies use external stimuli, we individually
      eliminated visual, olfactory, and pheromonal cues. In all cases, flies still
      exhibited a centralized search behavior, suggesting that none of these cues are
      absolutely required for navigation back to the food. To simultaneously eliminate 
      visual and olfactory cues associated with the position of the food, we
      constructed an apparatus in which the food could be rapidly translated from the
      center of the arena. Flies continued to search around the original location, even
      after the food was moved to a new position. A random search model based on
      measured locomotor statistics could not reproduce the centered nature of the
      animal's trajectory. We conclude that this behavior is best explained by a form
      of path integration in which the flies use idiothetic cues to search near the
      location of the food. We argue that the use of path integration to perform a
      centered local search is not a specialization of Drosophila but rather represents
      an ancient behavioral mode that is homologous to the more elaborate foraging
      strategies of central place foragers such as ants.

AB  - Examples of transgenerational inheritance of environmental responses are rapidly 
      accumulating. In Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, such heritable information
      transmits across generations in the form of RNA-dependent RNA
      polymerase-amplified small RNAs. Regulatory small RNAs enable sequence-specific
      gene regulation, and unlike chromatin modifications, can move between tissues,
      and escape from immediate germline reprogramming. In this review, we discuss the 
      path that small RNAs take from the soma to the germline, and elaborate on the
      mechanisms that maintain or erase parental small RNA responses after a specific
      number of generations. We focus on the intricate interactions between heritable
      small RNAs and histone modifications, deposited on specific loci. A trace of
      heritable chromatin marks, in particular trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9,
      is deposited on RNAi-targeted loci. However, how these modifications regulate
      RNAi or small RNA inheritance was until recently unclear. Integrating the very
      latest literature, we suggest that changes to histone marks may instigate
      transgenerational gene regulation indirectly, by affecting the biogenesis of
      heritable small RNAs. Inheritance of small RNAs could spread adaptive ancestral
      responses.

AB  - In a new study, previously unknown populations of wild date palm have been
      identified in remote areas of Oman. Genomic analyses indicate date palm
      domestication occurred in the eastern portion of the Arabian Peninsula and reveal
      substantial subsequent gene flow with African palm populations.

AB  - Perceptual processes in human observers vary considerably across a number of
      domains, producing idiosyncratic biases in the appearance of ambiguous figures
      [1], faces [2], and a number of visual illusions [3-6]. This work has largely
      emphasized object and pattern recognition, which suggests that these are more
      likely to produce individual differences. However, the presence of substantial
      variation in the anatomy and physiology of the visual system [4,7,8] suggests
      that individual variations may be found in even more basic visual tasks. To
      support this idea, we demonstrate observer-specific biases in a fundamental
      visual task - object localization throughout the visual field. We show that
      localization judgments of briefly presented targets produce idiosyncratic
      signatures of perceptual distortions in each observer and suggest that even the
      most basic visual judgments, such as object location, can differ substantially
      between individuals.

AB  - Fan worms (Annelida: Sabellidae) are sessile polychaetes that spend their adult
      lives in tubes and project their fans, composed of radiolar tentacles, up into
      the water column for respiration and filter feeding. To protect the fan from
      predation, many species have evolved unique compound eyes on the radioles that
      function as shadow or motion detectors, eliciting a rapid withdrawal response in 
      reaction to encroaching objects in the water column [1,2]. The structure of the
      eyes, their complexity, and their arrangements on the radioles are very diverse
      among sabellid genera [3] and they display many characteristics atypical of
      polychaete eyes, such as ciliary photoreceptors [3,4] that hyperpolarize in
      response to illumination [5]. Here we examine the retinal transcriptome of the
      radiolar eyes from the fan worm Megalomma interrupta. We find that the opsin, the
      protein component of light sensitive visual pigments, and other phototransduction
      cascade signaling proteins expressed in these eyes are related to those commonly 
      associated with vertebrate ciliary photoreceptors, as opposed to the rhabdomeric 
      receptors found in the primary eyes of many invertebrates. With previous
      anatomical and physiological observations, these results suggest that the
      radiolar eyes arose independently in fan worms.

AB  - We can estimate the veridical size of nearby objects reasonably well irrespective
      of their viewing distance. This perceptual capability, termed size constancy, is 
      accomplished by combining information about retinal image size together with the 
      viewing distance, or using the relational information available in the scene, via
      direct perception [1]. A previous study [2] showed that children typically
      underestimate the size of a distant object. This underestimation is reduced with 
      time, suggesting that years of visual experience may be essential for attaining
      true size constancy. But what if you have had very limited vision during the
      early years of life? We studied 23 Ethiopian children suffering from bilateral,
      early-onset cataract, who were surgically treated only years after birth.
      Surprisingly, most children were able to estimate object size reasonably well
      irrespective of distance; in fact, they usually tended to overestimate the
      far-object size. Closer examination indicated that, although before surgery the
      patients were diagnosed as having a full, mature bilateral cataract, they
      nevertheless had some residual form of vision, typically limited to very close
      range. Gandhi et al.[3] earlier reported immediate susceptibility to geometric
      visual illusions in a similar group of newly-sighted children, concluding that
      size constancy was probably innate. We suggest that their immediate ability to
      judge physical size irrespective of distance is more likely to result from their 
      previous visual experience.

AB  - The posterior parietal cortex, along with temporal and prefrontal cortices, is
      one of the three major associative regions in the cortex of the mammalian brain. 
      It is situated between the visual cortex at the caudal pole of the brain and the 
      somatosensory cortex just behind the central sulcus. Technically, any cortex
      covered by the parietal bone is referred to as 'parietal cortex', but the
      posterior sector, formally referred to as posterior parietal cortex, is indeed
      its own functional section of cortex, consisting of Brodmann's areas 5, 7, 39,
      and 40 in humans, areas 5 and 7 in macaques, and area 7 in rodents (Figure 1).
      Whereas the anterior parietal cortex in humans comprises primary somatosensory
      areas, the posterior parietal cortex has several higher-order functions. It is
      referred to as an 'associative' cortical region because it is neither strictly
      sensory nor motor, but combines inputs from a number of brain areas including
      somatosensory, auditory, visual, motor, cingulate and prefrontal cortices, and it
      integrates proprioceptive and vestibular signals from subcortical areas.

TI  - VE-Cadherin Phosphorylation Regulates Endothelial Fluid Shear Stress Responses
      through the Polarity Protein LGN.

AB  - Fluid shear stress due to blood flow on the vascular endothelium regulates blood 
      vessel development, remodeling, physiology, and pathology [1, 2]. A complex
      consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptors (VEGFRs) that resides at endothelial cell-cell junctions transduces
      signals important for flow-dependent vasodilation, blood vessel remodeling, and
      atherosclerosis. PECAM-1 transduces forces to activate src family kinases (SFKs),
      which phosphorylate and transactivate VEGFRs [3-5]. By contrast, VE-cadherin
      functions as an adaptor that interacts with VEGFRs through their respective
      cytoplasmic domains and promotes VEGFR activation in flow [6]. Indeed, shear
      stress triggers rapid increases in force across PECAM-1 but decreases the force
      across VE-cadherin, in close association with downstream signaling [5].
      Interestingly, VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tyrosine Y658 can be phosphorylated by
      SFKs [7], which is maximally induced by low shear stress in vitro and in vivo
      [8]. These considerations prompted us to address the involvement of VE-cadherin
      cytoplasmic tyrosines in flow sensing. We found that phosphorylation of a small
      pool of VE-cadherin on Y658 is essential for flow sensing through the junctional 
      complex. Y658 phosphorylation induces dissociation of p120ctn, which allows
      binding of the polarity protein LGN. LGN is then required for multiple flow
      responses in vitro and in vivo, including activation of inflammatory signaling at
      regions of disturbed flow, and flow-dependent vascular remodeling. Thus,
      endothelial flow mechanotransduction through the junctional complex is mediated
      by a specific pool of VE-cadherin that is phosphorylated on Y658 and bound to
      LGN.

AB  - Autophagy maintains cellular health and homeostasis during stress by delivering
      cytosolic material captured by autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation.
      Autophagosome formation is complex: initiated by the recruitment of autophagy
      (Atg) proteins to the formation site, it is sustained by activation of Atg
      proteins to allow growth and closure of the autophagosome. How Atg proteins are
      translocated to the forming autophagosome is not fully understood. Transport of
      the ATG8 family member GABARAP from the centrosome occurs during
      starvation-induced autophagosome biogenesis, but how centrosomal proteins
      regulate GABARAP localization is unknown. We show that the centriolar satellite
      protein PCM1 regulates the recruitment of GABARAP to the pericentriolar material.
      In addition to residing on the pericentriolar material, GABARAP marks a subtype
      of PCM1-positive centriolar satellites. GABARAP, but not another ATG8 family
      member LC3B, binds directly to PCM1 through a canonical LIR motif. Loss of PCM1
      results in destabilization of GABARAP, but not LC3B, through proteasomal
      degradation. GABARAP instability is mediated through the centriolar satellite E3 
      ligase Mib1, which interacts with GABARAP through its substrate-binding region
      and promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of GABARAP. Ubiquitination of GABARAP
      occurs in the N terminus, a domain associated with ATG8-family-specific functions
      during autophagosome formation, on residues absent in the LC3 family.
      Furthermore, PCM1-GABARAP-positive centriolar satellites colocalize with forming 
      autophagosomes. PCM1 enhances GABARAP/WIPI2/p62-positive autophagosome formation 
      and flux but has no significant effect on LC3B-positive autophagosome formation. 
      These data suggest a mechanism for how centriolar satellites can specifically
      regulate an ATG8 ortholog, the centrosomal GABARAP reservoir, and
      centrosome-autophagosome crosstalk.

AB  - Extensive data highlight the existence of major differences in individuals'
      susceptibility to stress [1-4]. While genetic factors [5, 6] and exposure to
      early life stress [7, 8] are key components for such neurobehavioral diversity,
      intriguing observations revealed individual differences in response to stress in 
      inbred mice [9-12]. This raised the possibility that other factors might be
      critical in stress vulnerability. A key challenge in the field is to identify
      non-invasively risk factors for vulnerability to stress. Here, we investigated
      whether behavioral factors, emerging from preexisting dominance hierarchies,
      could predict vulnerability to chronic stress [9, 13-16]. We applied a chronic
      social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression in C57BL/6J mice to investigate
      the predictive power of hierarchical status to pinpoint which individuals will
      exhibit susceptibility to CSDS. Given that the high social status of dominant
      mice would be the one particularly challenged by CSDS, we predicted and found
      that dominant individuals were the ones showing a strong susceptibility profile
      as indicated by strong social avoidance following CSDS, while subordinate mice
      were not affected. Data from (1)H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the metabolic
      profile in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) relates to social status and vulnerability
      to stress. Under basal conditions, subordinates show lower levels of
      energy-related metabolites compared to dominants. In subordinates, but not
      dominants, levels of these metabolites were increased after exposure to CSDS. To 
      the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies non-invasively
      the origin of behavioral risk factors predictive of stress-induced
      depression-like behaviors associated with metabolic changes.

AB  - Neural integrators are involved in a variety of sensorimotor and cognitive
      behaviors. The oculomotor system contains a simple example, a hindbrain neural
      circuit that takes velocity signals as inputs and temporally integrates them to
      control eye position. Here we investigated the structural underpinnings of
      temporal integration in the larval zebrafish by first identifying integrator
      neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and then reconstructing the same neurons
      through serial electron microscopic analysis. Integrator neurons were identified 
      as those neurons with activities highly correlated with eye position during
      spontaneous eye movements. Three morphological classes of neurons were observed: 
      ipsilaterally projecting neurons located medially, contralaterally projecting
      neurons located more laterally, and a population at the extreme lateral edge of
      the hindbrain for which we were not able to identify axons. Based on their
      somatic locations, we inferred that neurons with only ipsilaterally projecting
      axons are glutamatergic, whereas neurons with only contralaterally projecting
      axons are largely GABAergic. Dendritic and synaptic organization of the
      ipsilaterally projecting neurons suggests a broad sampling from inputs on the
      ipsilateral side. We also observed the first conclusive evidence of synapses
      between integrator neurons, which have long been hypothesized by recurrent
      network models of integration via positive feedback.

AB  - The transition from hunting and gathering to farming in Europe was brought upon
      by arrival of new people carrying novel material culture and genetic ancestry.
      The exact nature and scale of the transition-both material and genetic-varied in 
      different parts of Europe [1-7]. Farming-based economies appear relatively late
      in Northeast Europe, and the extent to which they involve change in genetic
      ancestry is not fully understood due to the lack of relevant ancient DNA data.
      Here we present the results from new low-coverage whole-genome shotgun sequence
      data from five hunter-gatherers and five first farmers of Estonia whose remains
      date to 4,500 to 6,300 years before present. We find evidence of significant
      differences between the two groups in the composition of autosomal as well as
      mtDNA, X chromosome, and Y chromosome ancestries. We find that Estonian
      hunter-gatherers of Comb Ceramic culture are closest to Eastern hunter-gatherers,
      which is in contrast to earlier hunter-gatherers from the Baltics, who are close 
      to Western hunter-gatherers [8, 9]. The Estonian first farmers of Corded Ware
      culture show high similarity in their autosomes with European hunter-gatherers,
      Steppe Eneolithic and Bronze Age populations, and European Late Neolithic/Bronze 
      Age populations, while their X chromosomes are in addition equally closely
      related to European and Anatolian and Levantine early farmers. These findings
      suggest that the shift to intensive cultivation and animal husbandry in Estonia
      was triggered by the arrival of new people with predominantly Steppe ancestry but
      whose ancestors had undergone sex-specific admixture with early farmers with
      Anatolian ancestry.

AB  - For many crops, wild relatives constitute an extraordinary resource for cultivar 
      improvement [1, 2] and also help to better understand the history of their
      domestication [3]. However, the wild ancestor species of several perennial crops 
      have not yet been identified. Perennial crops generally present a weak
      domestication syndrome allowing cultivated individuals to establish feral
      populations difficult to distinguish from truly wild populations, and there is
      frequently ongoing gene flow between wild relatives and the crop that might erode
      most genetic differences [4]. Here we report the discovery of populations of the 
      wild ancestor species of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.), one of the
      oldest and most important cultivated fruit plants in hot and arid regions of the 
      Old World. We discovered these wild individuals in remote and isolated
      mountainous locations of Oman. They are genetically more diverse than and
      distinct from a representative sample of Middle Eastern cultivated date palms and
      exhibit rounded seed shapes resembling those of a close sister species and
      archeological samples, but not modern cultivars. Whole-genome sequencing of
      several wild and cultivated individuals revealed a complex domestication history 
      involving the contribution of at least two wild sources to African cultivated
      date palms. The discovery of wild date palms offers a unique chance to further
      elucidate the history of this iconic crop that has constituted the cornerstone of
      traditional oasis polyculture systems for several thousand years [5].

AB  - In social interactions, it is highly salient to us where other people are
      looking. The ability to recover this information is critical to typical social
      development, helping us to coordinate our attention and behavior with others and 
      understand their intentions and mental states [1-3]. The depth and direction in
      which another individual is fixating are specified jointly by their head
      position, eye deviation, and binocular vergence [4, 5]. It is hereto unknown,
      however, whether this dynamic visual information about others' focus of attention
      affects how we ourselves see the world. Here we show that the perceived depth and
      movement of physical objects in our environment are influenced by others'
      tracking behavior. This effect occurred even in the presence of conflicting size 
      cues to object location and generalized to the context of apparent motion
      displays [6] and judgments about causal interactions between moving objects [7]. 
      Perceived object trajectory was modulated primarily by the object-level motion of
      the tracking agent (e.g., the head), with less-pronounced effects of eye motion
      and low-level motion. Interestingly, comparable perceptual effects were induced
      by non-face objects that displayed similar tracking behavior, indicating a
      mechanism of distal coupling between the motion of the target and an
      appropriately moving inducer. These results demonstrate that social information
      can have a fundamental effect on our vision, such that the visual reality
      constructed in each brain is determined in part by what others see.

AB  - Fear responses are defensive states that ensure survival of an organism in the
      presence of a threat. Perception of an aversive cue causes changes in behavior
      and physiology, such as freezing and elevated cortisol, followed by a return to
      the baseline state when the threat is evaded [1]. Neural systems that elicit fear
      behaviors include the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex.
      However, aside from a few examples, little is known about brain regions that
      promote recovery from an aversive event [2]. Previous studies had implicated the 
      dorsal habenular nuclei in regulating fear responses and boldness in zebrafish
      [3-7]. We now show, through perturbation of its inherent left-right (L-R)
      asymmetry at larval stages, that the dorsal habenulo-interpeduncular (dHb-IPN)
      pathway expedites the return of locomotor activity following an unexpected
      negative stimulus, electric shock. Severing habenular efferents to the IPN, or
      only those from the left dHb, prolongs the freezing behavior that follows shock. 
      Individuals with a symmetric, right-isomerized dHb also exhibit increased
      freezing. In contrast, larvae that have a symmetric, left-isomerized dHb, or in
      which just the left dHb-IPN projection is optogenetically activated, rapidly
      resume swimming post shock. In vivo calcium imaging reveals a neuronal subset,
      predominantly in the left dHb, whose activation is correlated with resumption of 
      swimming. The results demonstrate functional specialization of the left dHb-IPN
      pathway in attenuating the response to fear.

AB  - Biological clocks are a ubiquitous ancient and adaptive mechanism enabling
      organisms to anticipate environmental cycles and to regulate behavioral and
      physiological processes accordingly [1]. Although terrestrial circadian clocks
      are well understood, knowledge of clocks in marine organisms is still very
      limited [2-5]. This is particularly true for abundant species displaying
      large-scale rhythms like diel vertical migration (DVM) that contribute
      significantly to shaping their respective ecosystems [6]. Here we describe
      exogenous cycles and endogenous rhythms associated with DVM of the ecologically
      important and highly abundant planktic copepod Calanus finmarchicus. In the
      laboratory, C. finmarchicus shows circadian rhythms of DVM, metabolism, and most 
      core circadian clock genes (clock, period1, period2, timeless, cryptochrome2, and
      clockwork orange). Most of these genes also cycle in animals assessed in the
      wild, though expression is less rhythmic at depth (50-140 m) relative to
      shallow-caught animals (0-50 m). Further, peak expressions of clock genes
      generally occurred at either sunset or sunrise, coinciding with peak migration
      times. Including one of the first field investigations of clock genes in a marine
      species [5, 7], this study couples clock gene measurements with laboratory and
      field data on DVM. While the mechanistic connection remains elusive, our results 
      imply a high degree of causality between clock gene expression and one of the
      planet's largest daily migrations of biomass. We thus suggest that circadian
      clocks increase zooplankton fitness by optimizing the temporal trade-off between 
      feeding and predator avoidance, especially when environmental drivers are weak or
      absent [8].

AB  - Plant architectures can be characterized statistically by their spatial density
      function, which specifies the probability of finding a branch at each location in
      the territory occupied by a plant. Using high-precision 3D scanning, we analyzed 
      557 plant shoot architectures, representing three species, grown across three to 
      five environmental conditions, and through 20-30 developmental time points. We
      found two elegant properties in the spatial density functions of these
      architectures: all functions could be nearly modified in one direction without
      affecting the density in orthogonal directions (called "separability"), and all
      functions shared the same underlying shape, aside from stretching and compression
      (called "self-similarity"). Surprisingly, despite their striking visual
      diversity, we discovered that all architectures could be described as variations 
      on a single underlying function: a Gaussian density function truncated at roughly
      two SDs. We also observed systematic variation in the spatial density functions
      across species, growth conditions, and time, which suggests functional
      specialization despite following the same general design form.

AB  - How cells position their proteins is a key problem in cell biology. Targeting
      mRNAs to distinct regions of the cytoplasm contributes to protein localization by
      providing local control over translation. Here, we reveal that an interdependence
      of a protein and cognate mRNA maintains asymmetric protein distribution in
      mitotic Drosophila neural stem cells. We tagged endogenous mRNA or protein
      products of the gene miranda that is required for fate determination with GFP. We
      find that the mRNA localizes like the protein it encodes in a basal crescent in
      mitosis. We then used GFP-specific nanobodies fused to localization domains to
      alter the subcellular distribution of the GFP-tagged mRNA or protein. Altering
      the localization of the mRNA resulted in mislocalization of the protein and vice 
      versa. Protein localization defects caused by mislocalization of the cognate mRNA
      were rescued by introducing untagged mRNA coding for mutant non-localizable
      protein. Therefore, by combining the MS2 system and subcellular nanobody
      expression, we uncovered that maintenance of Mira asymmetric localization
      requires interaction with the cognate mRNA.

AB  - Sexual violence occurring in the context of long-term heterosexual relationships,
      such as sexual intimidation, is widespread across human populations [1-3].
      However, its evolutionary origins remain speculative because few studies have
      investigated the existence of comparable forms of sexual coercion in animals [4, 
      5], in which repeated male aggression toward a female provides the aggressor with
      delayed mating benefits [6]. Here, we test whether male aggression toward females
      functions as sexual coercion in wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We found
      support for all three main predictions of the sexual coercion hypothesis [7]:
      male aggression (1) is greatest against cycling females, (2) is costly and
      represents the main source of injuries for cycling females, and (3) increases
      male mating success with their victims in the future. Detailed analysis of
      chronological sequences between aggression and matings ruled out other coercive
      mechanisms, such as short-term harassment and punishment, by showing that
      aggression and matings are temporally decoupled. This decoupling may explain why 
      some forms of sexual violence have been largely overlooked in well-studied animal
      populations despite their likely impact on the fitness of both sexes. Finally, we
      found no support for alternative hypotheses such as a female preference for
      aggressive males [8, 9]. This new, detailed study of the forms and intensity of
      sexual intimidation in a wild primate suggests that it may be widespread across
      mammalian societies, with important implications for understanding the evolution 
      of mate choice and sexual conflict in mammals, as well as the origins of human
      sexual violence.

AB  - For over 50 years, biologists have accepted that all extant snakes share the same
      ZW sex chromosomes derived from a common ancestor [1-3], with different species
      exhibiting sex chromosomes at varying stages of differentiation. Accordingly,
      snakes have been a well-studied model for sex chromosome evolution in animals [1,
      4]. A review of the literature, however, reveals no compelling support that boas 
      and pythons possess ZW sex chromosomes [2, 5]. Furthermore, phylogenetic patterns
      of facultative parthenogenesis in snakes and a sex-linked color mutation in the
      ball python (Python regius) are best explained by boas and pythons possessing an 
      XY sex chromosome system [6, 7]. Here we demonstrate that a boa (Boa imperator)
      and python (Python bivittatus) indeed possess XY sex chromosomes, based on the
      discovery of male-specific genetic markers in both species. We use these markers,
      along with transcriptomic and genomic data, to identify distinct sex chromosomes 
      in boas and pythons, demonstrating that XY systems evolved independently in each 
      lineage. This discovery highlights the dynamic evolution of vertebrate sex
      chromosomes and further enhances the value of snakes as a model for studying sex 
      chromosome evolution.

AB  - Eating is a learned process. Our desires for specific foods arise through
      experience. Both electrical stimulation and optogenetic studies have shown that
      increased activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) promotes feeding. Current
      dogma is that these effects reflect a role for LH neurons in the control of the
      core motivation to feed, and their activity comes under control of forebrain
      regions to elicit learned food-motivated behaviors. However, these effects could 
      also reflect the storage of associative information about the cues leading to
      food in LH itself. Here, we present data from several studies that are consistent
      with a role for LH in learning. In the first experiment, we use a novel GAD-Cre
      rat to show that optogenetic inhibition of LH gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      neurons restricted to cue presentation disrupts the rats' ability to learn that a
      cue predicts food without affecting subsequent food consumption. In the second
      experiment, we show that this manipulation also disrupts the ability of a cue to 
      promote food seeking after learning. Finally, we show that inhibition of the
      terminals of the LH GABA neurons in ventral-tegmental area (VTA) facilitates
      learning about reward-paired cues. These results suggest that the LH GABA neurons
      are critical for storing and later disseminating information about
      reward-predictive cues.

TI  - Mapping Load-Bearing in the Mammalian Spindle Reveals Local Kinetochore Fiber
      Anchorage that Provides Mechanical Isolation and Redundancy.

AB  - Active forces generated at kinetochores move chromosomes, and the dynamic spindle
      must robustly anchor kinetochore fibers (k-fibers) to bear this load. The
      mammalian spindle bears the load of chromosome movement far from poles, but we do
      not know where and how-physically and molecularly-this load distributes across
      the spindle. In part, this is because probing spindle mechanics in live cells is 
      difficult. Yet answering this question is key to understanding how the spindle
      generates and responds to force and performs its diverse mechanical functions.
      Here, we map load-bearing across the mammalian spindle in space-time and dissect 
      local anchorage mechanics and mechanism. To do so, we laser-ablate single
      k-fibers at different spindle locations and in different molecular backgrounds
      and quantify the immediate relaxation of chromosomes, k-fibers, and microtubule
      speckles. We find that load redistribution is locally confined in all directions:
      along the first 3-4 mum from kinetochores, scaling with k-fiber length, and
      laterally within approximately 2 mum of k-fiber sides, without detectable load
      sharing between neighboring k-fibers. A phenomenological model suggests that
      dense, transient crosslinks to the spindle along k-fibers bear the load of
      chromosome movement but that these connections do not limit the timescale of
      spindle reorganization. The microtubule crosslinker NuMA is needed for the local 
      load-bearing observed, whereas Eg5 and PRC1 are not detectably required,
      suggesting specialization in mechanical function. Together, the data and model
      suggest that NuMA-mediated crosslinks locally bear load, providing mechanical
      isolation and redundancy while allowing spindle fluidity. These features are well
      suited to support robust chromosome segregation.

AB  - Accelerating climate change is eroding the functioning and stability of
      ecosystems by weakening the interactions among species that stabilize biological 
      communities against change [1]. A key challenge to forecasting the future of
      ecosystems centers on how to extrapolate results from short-term, single-species 
      studies to community-level responses that are mediated by key mechanisms such as 
      competition, resource availability (bottom-up control), and predation (top-down
      control) [2]. We used CO2 vents as potential analogs of ocean acidification
      combined with in situ experiments to test current predictions of fish
      biodiversity loss and community change due to elevated CO2 [3] and to elucidate
      the potential mechanisms that drive such change. We show that high risk-taking
      behavior and competitive strength, combined with resource enrichment and collapse
      of predator populations, fostered already common species, enabling them to double
      their populations under acidified conditions. However, the release of these
      competitive dominants from predator control led to suppression of less common and
      subordinate competitors that did not benefit from resource enrichment and reduced
      predation. As a result, local biodiversity was lost and novel fish community
      compositions were created under elevated CO2. Our study identifies the species
      interactions most affected by ocean acidification, revealing potential sources of
      natural selection. We also reveal how diminished predator abundances can have
      cascading effects on local species diversity, mediated by complex species
      interactions. Reduced overfishing of predators could therefore act as a key
      action to stall diversity loss and ecosystem change in a high-CO2 world. VIDEO

AB  - Perceptual decisions require both analysis of sensory information and selective
      routing of relevant information to decision networks. This study explores the
      contribution of a midbrain network to visual perception in chickens. Analysis of 
      visual orientation information in birds takes place in the forebrain sensory area
      called the Wulst, as it does in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals. In
      contrast, the midbrain, which receives parallel retinal input, encodes
      orientation poorly, if at all. We discovered, however, that small electrolytic
      lesions in the midbrain severely impair a chicken's ability to discriminate
      orientations. Focal lesions were placed in the optic tectum (OT) and in the
      nucleus isthmi pars parvocellularis (Ipc)-key nodes in the midbrain stimulus
      selection network-in chickens trained to perform an orientation discrimination
      task. A lesion in the OT caused a severe impairment in orientation discrimination
      specifically for targets at the location in space represented by the lesioned
      location. Distracting stimuli increased the deficit. A lesion in the Ipc produced
      similar but more transient effects. We discuss the possibilities that performance
      deficits were caused by interference with orientation information processing
      (sensory deficit) versus with the routing of information in the forebrain
      (agnosia). The data support the proposal that the OT transmits a space-specific
      signal that is required to gate orientation information from the Wulst into
      networks that mediate behavioral decisions, analogous to the role of ascending
      signals from the superior colliculus (SC) in monkeys. Furthermore, our results
      indicate a critical role for the cholinergic Ipc in this gating process.

TI  - SIRPA-Inhibited, Marrow-Derived Macrophages Engorge, Accumulate, and

AB  - Marrow-derived macrophages are highly phagocytic, but whether they can also
      traffic into solid tumors and engulf cancer cells is questionable, given the
      well-known limitations of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here, SIRPalpha on
      macrophages from mouse and human marrow was inhibited to block recognition of its
      ligand, the "marker of self" CD47 on all other cells. These macrophages were then
      systemically injected into mice with fluorescent human tumors that had been
      antibody targeted. Within days, the tumors regressed, and single-cell
      fluorescence analyses showed that the more the macrophages engulfed, the more
      they accumulated within regressing tumors. Human-marrow-derived macrophages
      engorged on the human tumors, while TAMs were minimally phagocytic, even toward
      CD47-knockdown tumors. Past studies had opsonized tumors in situ with antibody
      and/or relied on mouse TAMs but had not injected SIRPalpha-inhibited cells; also,
      unlike past injections of anti-CD47, blood parameters remained normal and safe.
      Consistent with tumor-selective engorge-and-accumulate processes in vivo,
      phagocytosis in vitro inhibited macrophage migration through micropores that
      mimic features of dense 3D tissue. Accumulation of SIRPalpha-inhibited
      macrophages in tumors favored tumor regression for 1-2 weeks, but donor
      macrophages quickly differentiated toward non-phagocytic, high-SIRPalpha TAMs.
      Analyses of macrophages on soft (like marrow) or stiff (like solid tumors)
      collagenous gels demonstrated a stiffness-driven, retinoic-acid-modulated
      upregulation of SIRPalpha and the mechanosensitive nuclear marker lamin-A.
      Mechanosensitive differentiation was similarly evident in vivo and likely limited
      the anti-tumor effects, as confirmed by re-initiation of tumor regression by
      fresh injections of SIRPalpha-inhibited macrophages. Macrophage motility,
      phagocytosis, and differentiation in vivo are thus coupled.

AB  - The calcium-based intracellular signalling system is used ubiquitously to couple 
      extracellular stimuli to their characteristic intracellular responses. It is
      becoming clear from genomic and physiological investigations that while the basic
      elements in the toolkit are common between plants and animals, evolution has
      acted in such a way that, in plants, some components have diversified with
      respect to their animal counterparts, while others have either been lost or have 
      never evolved in the plant lineages. In comparison with animals, in plants there 
      appears to have been a loss of diversity in calcium-influx mechanisms at the
      plasma membrane. However, the evolution of the calcium-storing vacuole may
      provide plants with additional possibilities for regulating calcium influx into
      the cytosol. Among the proteins that are involved in sensing and responding to
      increases in calcium, plants possess specific decoder proteins that are absent
      from the animal lineage. In seeking to understand the selection pressures that
      shaped the plant calcium-signalling toolkit, we consider the evolution of fast
      electrical signalling. We also note that, in contrast to animals, plants
      apparently do not make extensive use of cyclic-nucleotide-based signalling. It is
      possible that reliance on a single intracellular second-messenger-based system,
      coupled with the requirement to adapt to changing environmental conditions, has
      helped to define the diversity of components found in the extant plant
      calcium-signalling toolkit.

AB  - It has been widely observed that sex-related genes are copied from sex
      chromosomes and inserted into autosomes, a process termed 'gene traffic'.
      However, the adaptive significance of this phenomenon is unclear. Now, direct
      evidence has been provided that gene traffic may allow functional compensation
      during meiotic sex chromosome activation.

AB  - The two closest living relatives of humans, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and
      chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), share many traits that are common in humans but
      rare in other mammals, including societies with high fission-fusion dynamics,
      male philopatry, female dispersal and extensive social bonding among unrelated
      individuals [1]. The major difference between these two species is that male
      aggression is more frequent and intense in male-dominated chimpanzees than in
      bonobos, where the highest-ranking individuals are female [1]. One potential
      explanation is that because periods of female sexual receptivity and
      attractiveness are more extended in bonobos [2], males compete less intensely for
      each mating opportunity. This would reduce the strength of selection for traits
      that lead to success in direct contest competition between males and in sexual
      coercion of females, thus increasing the potential for female choice [3].
      Accordingly, it has been predicted that the influence of male dominance rank on
      reproductive success and the extent of male reproductive skew should be lower in 
      bonobos than in chimpanzees [1]. Although relevant for understanding the
      evolution of the unusual levels of egalitarianism and cooperation found in human 
      hunter-gatherers [4], comparative analyses in the genus Pan have been limited by 
      the scanty paternity data available for wild bonobos [5]. Here, we show using the
      largest sample of paternity data available that, contrary to expectation, male
      bonobos have a higher reproductive skew and a stronger relationship between
      dominance rank and reproductive success than chimpanzees.

AB  - The fundamental constraint shaping animal systems for internal gas transport is
      the slow pace of diffusion [1]. In response, most macroscopic animals have
      evolved systems for driving internal flows using muscular pumps or cilia. In
      arthropods, aside from terrestrial lineages that exchange gases via tracheal
      systems, most taxa have a dorsal heart that drives O2-carrying hemolymph through 
      peripheral vessels and an open hemocoel [2], with O2 often bound to respiratory
      proteins. Here we show that pycnogonids (sea spiders), a basal group of marine
      arthropods [3], use a previously undescribed mechanism of internal O2 transport: 
      flows of gut fluids and hemolymph driven by peristaltic contractions of a
      space-filling system of gut diverticula. This observation fundamentally expands
      the known range of gas-transport systems in extant arthropods.

AB  - A central paradigm of aquatic locomotion is that cetaceans use fluke strokes to
      power their swimming while relying on lift and torque generated by the flippers
      to perform maneuvers such as rolls, pitch changes and turns [1]. Compared to
      other cetaceans, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have disproportionately
      large flippers with added structural features to aid in hydrodynamic performance 
      [2,3]. Humpbacks use acrobatic lunging maneuvers to attack dense aggregations of 
      krill or small fish, and their large flippers are thought to increase their
      maneuverability and thus their ability to capture prey. Immediately before
      opening their mouths, humpbacks will often rapidly move their flippers, and it
      has been hypothesized that this movement is used to corral prey [4,5] or to
      generate an upward pitching moment to counteract the torque caused by rapid water
      engulfment [6]. Here, we demonstrate an additional function for the rapid flipper
      movement during lunge feeding: the flippers are flapped using a complex,
      hydrodynamically active stroke to generate lift and increase propulsive thrust.
      We estimate that humpback flipper-strokes are capable of producing large forward 
      oriented forces, which may be used to enhance lunge feeding performance. This
      behavior is the first observation of a lift-generating flipper-stroke for
      propulsion cetaceans and provides an additional function for the uniquely shaped 
      humpback whale flipper.

AB  - Perceptual learning refers to how experience can change the way we perceive
      sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touch. Examples abound: music training
      improves our ability to discern tones; experience with food and wines can refine 
      our pallet (and unfortunately more quickly empty our wallet), and with years of
      training radiologists learn to save lives by discerning subtle details of images 
      that escape the notice of untrained viewers. We often take perceptual learning
      for granted, but it has a profound impact on how we perceive the world. In this
      Primer, I will explain how perceptual learning is transformative in guiding our
      perceptual processes, how research into perceptual learning provides insight into
      fundamental mechanisms of learning and brain processes, and how knowledge of
      perceptual learning can be used to develop more effective training approaches for
      those requiring expert perceptual skills or those in need of perceptual
      rehabilitation (such as individuals with poor vision). I will make a case that
      perceptual learning is ubiquitous, scientifically interesting, and has
      substantial practical utility to us all.

AB  - As the largest known vertebrates of all time, mysticetes depend on keratinous
      sieves called baleen to capture enough small prey to sustain their enormous size 
      [1]. The origins of baleen are controversial: one hypothesis suggests that teeth 
      were lost during a suction-feeding stage of mysticete evolution and that baleen
      evolved thereafter [2-4], whereas another suggests that baleen evolved before
      teeth were lost [5]. Here we report a new species of toothed mysticete, Coronodon
      havensteini, from the Oligocene of South Carolina that is transitional between
      raptorial archaeocete whales and modern mysticetes. Although the morphology and
      wear on its anterior teeth indicate that it captured large prey, its broad,
      imbricated, multi-cusped lower molars frame narrow slots that were likely used
      for filter feeding. Coronodon havensteini is a basal, if not the most basal,
      mysticete, and our analysis suggests that it is representative of an initial
      stage of mysticete evolution in which teeth were functional analogs to baleen. In
      later lineages, the diastema between teeth increased-in some cases, markedly so
      [6]-and may mark a stage at which the balance of the oral fissure shifted from
      mostly teeth to mostly baleen. When placed in a phylogenetic context, our new
      taxon indicates that filter feeding was preceded by raptorial feeding and that
      suction feeding evolved separately within a clade removed from modern baleen
      whales.

AB  - The South Caucasus, situated between the Black and Caspian Seas, geographically
      links Europe with the Near East and has served as a crossroad for human
      migrations for many millennia [1-7]. Despite a vast archaeological record showing
      distinct cultural turnovers, the demographic events that shaped the human
      populations of this region is not known [8, 9]. To shed light on the maternal
      genetic history of the region, we analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of 
      52 ancient skeletons from present-day Armenia and Artsakh spanning 7,800 years
      and combined this dataset with 206 mitochondrial genomes of modern Armenians. We 
      also included previously published data of seven neighboring populations (n =
      482). Coalescence-based analyses suggest that the population size in this region 
      rapidly increased after the Last Glacial Maximum ca. 18 kya. We find that the
      lowest genetic distance in this dataset is between modern Armenians and the
      ancient individuals, as also reflected in both network analyses and discriminant 
      analysis of principal components. We used approximate Bayesian computation to
      test five different demographic scenarios explaining the formation of the modern 
      Armenian gene pool. Despite well documented cultural shifts in the South Caucasus
      across this time period, our results strongly favor a genetic continuity model in
      the maternal gene pool. This has implications for interpreting prehistoric
      migration dynamics and cultural shifts in this part of the world.

AB  - Inter-tissue communication is critical to control organismal energy homeostasis
      in response to temporal changes in feeding and activity or external challenges.
      Muscle is emerging as a key mediator of this homeostatic control through
      consumption of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, as well as governing
      systemic signaling networks. However, it remains less clear how energy substrate 
      usage tissues, such as muscle, communicate with energy substrate storage tissues 
      in order to adapt with diurnal changes in energy supply and demand. Using
      Drosophila, we show here that muscle plays a crucial physiological role in
      promoting systemic synthesis and accumulation of lipids in fat storage tissues,
      which subsequently impacts diurnal changes in circulating lipid levels. Our data 
      reveal that the metabolic transcription factor Foxo governs expression of the
      cytokine unpaired 2 (Upd2) in skeletal muscle, which acts as a myokine to control
      glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) secretion from specialized
      neuroendocrine cells. Circulating AKH levels in turn regulate lipid homeostasis
      in fat body/adipose and the intestine. Our data also reveal that this novel
      myokine-dependent hormone module is critical to maintain diurnal rhythms in
      circulating lipids. This tissue crosstalk provides a putative mechanism that
      allows muscle to integrate autonomous energy demand with systemic energy storage 
      and turnover. Together, these findings reveal a diurnal inter-tissue signaling
      network between muscle and fat storage tissues that constitutes an ancestral
      mechanism governing systemic energy homeostasis.

AB  - The mechanisms by which clock neurons in the Drosophila brain confer an
      approximately 24-hr rhythm onto locomotor activity are unclear, but involve the
      neuropeptide diuretic hormone 44 (DH44), an ortholog of corticotropin-releasing
      factor. Here we identified DH44 receptor 1 as the relevant receptor for
      rest:activity rhythms and mapped its site of action to hugin-expressing neurons
      in the subesophageal zone (SEZ). We traced a circuit that extends from
      Dh44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) through hugin+ SEZ
      neurons to the ventral nerve cord. Hugin neuropeptide, a neuromedin U ortholog,
      also regulates behavioral rhythms. The DH44 PI-Hugin SEZ circuit controls
      circadian locomotor activity in a daily cycle but has minimal effect on feeding
      rhythms, suggesting that the circadian drive to feed can be separated from
      circadian locomotion. These findings define a linear peptidergic circuit that
      links the clock to motor outputs to modulate circadian control of locomotor
      activity.

AB  - Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) direct microtubule (MT)
      organization to exert diverse cell-type-specific functions. In Drosophila
      spermatids, the giant mitochondria provide structural platforms for MT
      reorganization to support elongation of the extremely long sperm. However, the
      molecular basis for this mitochondrial MTOC and other non-centrosomal MTOCs has
      not been discerned. Here we report that Drosophila centrosomin (cnn) expresses
      two major protein variants: the centrosomal form (CnnC) and a non-centrosomal
      form in testes (CnnT). CnnC is established as essential for functional
      centrosomes, the major MTOCs in animal cells. We show that CnnT is expressed
      exclusively in testes by alternative splicing and localizes to giant mitochondria
      in spermatids. In cell culture, CnnT targets to the mitochondrial surface,
      recruits the MT nucleator gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC), and is
      sufficient to convert mitochondria to MTOCs independent of core pericentriolar
      proteins that regulate MT assembly at centrosomes. We mapped two separate domains
      in CnnT: one that is necessary and sufficient to target it to mitochondria and
      another that is necessary and sufficient to recruit gamma-TuRCs and nucleate MTs.
      In elongating spermatids, CnnT forms speckles on the giant mitochondria that are 
      required to recruit gamma-TuRCs to organize MTs and support spermiogenesis. This 
      molecular characterization of the mitochondrial MTOC defines a minimal molecular 
      requirement for MTOC generation and implicates the potent role of Cnn (or its
      related) proteins in the direct regulation of MT assembly and organization of
      non-centrosomal MTOCs.

AB  - The Y chromosome directly reflects male genealogies, but the extremely low Y
      chromosome sequence diversity in horses has prevented the reconstruction of
      stallion genealogies [1, 2]. Here, we resolve the first Y chromosome genealogy of
      modern horses by screening 1.46 Mb of the male-specific region of the Y
      chromosome (MSY) in 52 horses from 21 breeds. Based on highly accurate pedigree
      data, we estimated the de novo mutation rate of the horse MSY and showed that
      various modern horse Y chromosome lineages split much later than the
      domestication of the species. Apart from few private northern European
      haplotypes, all modern horse breeds clustered together in a roughly 700-year-old 
      haplogroup that was transmitted to Europe by the import of Oriental stallions.
      The Oriental horse group consisted of two major subclades: the Original Arabian
      lineage and the Turkoman horse lineage. We show that the English Thoroughbred MSY
      was derived from the Turkoman lineage and that English Thoroughbred sires are
      largely responsible for the predominance of this haplotype in modern horses.

AB  - Attention exerts a powerful influence on visual perception. The impact of
      attention on neuronal activity manifests at early visual information processing
      stages and progressively increases throughout the visual cortical hierarchy.
      However, the neuronal mechanisms of attention are unresolved. In particular, the 
      rules governing attentional modulation of individual neurons, whether they are
      facilitated by or suppressed by attention, are not known. To obtain a more
      granular or neuron- and circuit-level understanding of the mechanisms of
      attention and to directly test the feature similarity gain model in V1, we
      compared attentional modulation with neuronal feature selectivity across a large 
      population of V1 neurons in alert and behaving macaque monkeys trained on an
      attention-demanding contrast-change detection task. We utilized emerging
      multi-electrode array technology to record simultaneously from V1 neurons
      spanning all six cortical layers so that we could characterize the laminar
      position and physiological response properties of diverse V1 neuronal
      populations. We found significant relationships between attentional modulation
      and neuronal position within the cortical hierarchy, neuronal physiology, and
      neuronal feature selectivity. Our results support the feature similarity gain
      model and further suggest that attentional modulation depends critically upon the
      match between neuronal feature selectivity and the features required for the
      task.

AB  - Understanding how dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta
      (SNc) govern movements requires a detailed knowledge of how different
      neurotransmitter systems modulate DA neuronal excitability. We report a
      heterogeneity of electrophysiological properties between medial and lateral SNc
      neurons modulated by cholinergic neurotransmission. Lateral DA neurons received
      mainly excitatory (nicotinic or glutamatergic) mediated cholinergic
      neurotransmission. Medial DA neurons received predominantly GABAergic currents
      mediated by presynaptic nicotinic receptors or biphasic GABAergic and nicotinic
      neurotransmission conveyed by GABA and ACh corelease, which inhibited DA neurons.
      To examine whether cholinergic signaling in the SNc controls mouse behavior, we
      used optogenetics in awake behaving mice and found that activation of cholinergic
      terminals in the medial SNc decreased locomotion, whereas activation in the
      lateral SNc increased locomotion. Our findings provide novel insights on how
      cholinergic inputs to subregions of the SNc regulate the excitability of DA
      neurons differentially, resulting in different patterns of motor behavior.

AB  - The notochord, a conserved axial structure required for embryonic axis elongation
      and spine development, consists of giant vacuolated cells surrounded by an
      epithelial sheath [1-3]. During morphogenesis, vacuolated cells maintain their
      structural integrity despite being under constant mechanical stress [4]. We
      hypothesized that the high density of caveolae present in vacuolated cells [5, 6]
      could buffer mechanical tension. Caveolae are 50- to 80-nm membrane invaginations
      lined by cage-like polygonal structures [7, 8] formed by caveolin 1 (Cav1) or
      Cav3 and one of the cavin proteins [6, 9-11]. Recent in vitro work has shown that
      plasma membrane caveolae constitute a membrane reservoir that can buffer
      mechanical stresses such as stretching or osmotic swelling [12]. Moreover,
      mechanical integrity of vascular and muscle cells is partly dependent on caveolae
      [13-15]. However, the in vivo mechano-protective roles of caveolae have only
      begun to be explored. Using zebrafish mutants for cav1, cav3, and cavin1b, we
      show that caveolae are essential for notochord integrity. Upon loss of caveola
      function, vacuolated cells collapse at discrete positions under the mechanical
      strain of locomotion. Then, sheath cells invade the inner notochord and
      differentiate into vacuolated cells, thereby restoring notochord function and
      allowing normal spine development. Our data further indicate that nucleotides
      released by dying vacuolated cells promote sheath cell vacuolization and
      trans-differentiation. This work reveals a novel structural role for caveolae in 
      vertebrates and provides unique insights into the mechanisms that safeguard
      notochord and spine development.

AB  - The classic model for the evolution of novel gene function is through gene
      duplication followed by evolution of a new function by one of the copies
      (neofunctionalization) [1, 2]. However, other modes have also been found, such as
      novel genes arising from non-coding DNA, chimeric fusions, and lateral gene
      transfers from other organisms [3-7]. Here we use the rapid turnover of venom
      genes in parasitoid wasps to study how new gene functions evolve. In contrast to 
      the classic gene duplication model, we find that a common mode of acquisition of 
      new venom genes in parasitoid wasps is co-option of single-copy genes from
      non-venom progenitors. Transcriptome and proteome sequencing reveal that
      recruitment and loss of venom genes occur primarily by rapid cis-regulatory
      expression evolution in the venom gland. Loss of venom genes is primarily due to 
      downregulation of expression in the gland rather than gene death through coding
      sequence degradation. While the majority of venom genes have specialized
      expression in the venom gland, recent losses of venom function occur primarily
      among genes that show broader expression in development, suggesting that they can
      more readily switch functional roles. We propose that co-option of single-copy
      genes may be a common but relatively understudied mechanism of evolution for new 
      gene functions, particularly under conditions of rapid evolutionary change.

AB  - Our understanding of the origin of animals has been transformed by characterizing
      their most closely related, unicellular sisters: the choanoflagellates,
      filastereans, and ichthyosporeans. Together with animals, these lineages make up 
      the Holozoa [1, 2]. Many traits previously considered "animal specific" were
      subsequently found in other holozoans [3, 4], showing that they evolved before
      animals, although exactly when is currently uncertain because several key
      relationships remain unresolved [2, 5]. Here we report the morphology and
      transcriptome sequencing from three novel unicellular holozoans: Pigoraptor
      vietnamica and Pigoraptor chileana, which are related to filastereans, and
      Syssomonas multiformis, which forms a new lineage with Corallochytrium in
      phylogenomic analyses. All three species are predatory flagellates that feed on
      large eukaryotic prey, and all three also appear to exhibit complex life
      histories with several distinct stages, including multicellular clusters.
      Examination of genes associated with multicellularity in animals showed that the 
      new filastereans contain a cell-adhesion gene repertoire similar to those of
      other species in this group. Syssomonas multiformis possessed a smaller
      complement overall but does encode genes absent from the earlier-branching
      ichthyosporeans. Analysis of the T-box transcription factor domain showed
      expansion of T-box transcription factors based on combination with a non-T-box
      domain (a receiver domain), which has not been described outside of vertebrates. 
      This domain and other domains we identified in all unicellular holozoans are part
      of the two-component signaling system that has been lost in animals, suggesting
      the continued use of this system in the closest relatives of animals and
      emphasizing the importance of studying loss of function as well as gain in major 
      evolutionary transitions.

AB  - The embryonic notochord is a flexible structure present during development that
      serves as scaffold for formation of the vertebrate spine. This rod-like organ is 
      thought to have evolved in non-vertebrate chordates to facilitate locomotion by
      providing a rigid but flexible midline structure against which the axial muscles 
      can contract. This hydrostatic "skeleton" is exposed to a variety of mechanical
      forces during oscillation of the body. There is evidence that caveolae,
      submicroscopic cup-shaped plasma membrane pits, can buffer tension in cells that 
      undergo high levels of mechanical stress. Indeed, caveolae are particularly
      abundant in the embryonic notochord. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9
      system to generate a mutant zebrafish line lacking Cavin1b, a coat protein
      required for caveola formation. Our cavin1b(-/-) zebrafish line exhibits reduced 
      locomotor capacity and prominent notochord lesions characterized by necrotic,
      damaged, and membrane-permeable cells. Notochord diameter and body length are
      reduced, but remarkably, the mutants recover and are homozygous viable. By
      manipulating mechanical stress using a number of different assays, we show that
      progression of lesion severity in the mutant notochord is directly dependent on
      locomotion. We also demonstrate changes in caveola morphology in vivo in response
      to mechanical stress. Finally, induction of a catastrophic collapse of live
      cavin1b(-/-) mutant notochord cells provides the first real-time observation of
      caveolae mediating cellular mechanoprotection.

TI  - Selective Erasure of Distinct Forms of Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity Underlying
      Different Forms of Memory in the Same Postsynaptic Neuron.

AB  - Generalization of fear responses to non-threatening stimuli is a feature of
      anxiety disorders. It has been challenging to target maladaptive generalized
      memories without affecting adaptive memories. Synapse-specific long-term
      plasticity underlying memory involves the targeting of plasticity-related
      proteins (PRPs) to activated synapses. If distinct tags and PRPs are used for
      different forms of plasticity, one could selectively remove distinct forms of
      memory. Using a stimulation paradigm in which associative long-term facilitation 
      (LTF) occurs at one input and non-associative LTF at another input to the same
      postsynaptic neuron in an Aplysia sensorimotor preparation, we found that each
      form of LTF is reversed by inhibiting distinct isoforms of protein kinase M
      (PKM), putative PRPs, in the postsynaptic neuron. A dominant-negative (dn)
      atypical PKM selectively reversed associative LTF, while a dn classical PKM
      selectively reversed non-associative LTF. Although both PKMs are formed from
      calpain-mediated cleavage of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, each form of LTF is
      sensitive to a distinct dn calpain expressed in the postsynaptic neuron.
      Associative LTF is blocked by dn classical calpain, whereas non-associative LTF
      is blocked by dn small optic lobe (SOL) calpain. Interfering with a putative
      synaptic tag, the adaptor protein KIBRA, which protects the atypical PKM from
      degradation, selectively erases associative LTF. Thus, the activity of distinct
      PRPs and tags in a postsynaptic neuron contribute to the maintenance of different
      forms of synaptic plasticity at separate inputs, allowing for selective reversal 
      of synaptic plasticity and providing a cellular basis for developing therapeutic 
      strategies for selectively reversing maladaptive memories.

AB  - Species compositions of gut microbiomes impact host health [1-3], but the
      processes determining these compositions are largely unknown. An unexplained
      observation is that gut species composition varies widely between individuals but
      is largely stable over time within individuals [4, 5]. Stochastic factors during 
      establishment may drive these alternative stable states (colonized versus
      non-colonized) [6, 7], which can influence susceptibility to pathogens, such as
      Clostridium difficile. Here we sought to quantify and model the dose response,
      dynamics, and stability of bacterial colonization in the fruit fly (Drosophila
      melanogaster) gut. Our precise, high-throughput technique revealed stable
      between-host variation in colonization when individual germ-free flies were fed
      their own natural commensals (including the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum).
      Some flies were colonized while others remained germ-free even at extremely high 
      bacterial doses. Thus, alternative stable states of colonization exist even in
      this low-complexity model of host-microbe interactions. These alternative states 
      are driven by a fundamental asymmetry between the inoculum population and the
      stably colonized population that is mediated by spatial localization and a
      population bottleneck, which makes stochastic effects important by lowering the
      effective population size. Prior colonization with other bacteria reduced the
      chances of subsequent colonization, thus increasing the stability of
      higher-diversity guts. Therefore, stable gut diversity may be driven by
      inherently stochastic processes, which has important implications for combatting 
      infectious diseases and for stably establishing probiotics in the gut.

AB  - Sexually deceptive orchids lure their specific male pollinators using volatile
      semiochemicals that mimic female sex pheromones. To date, the semiochemicals
      known to be involved consist of blends of chemically and biosynthetically related
      compounds. In contrast, we report that (S)-beta-citronellol and
      2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone, two biosynthetically distinct compounds, are the 
      active semiochemicals in Caladenia plicata, which is pollinated by male Zeleboria
      sp. thynnine wasps. They are also sex pheromone components of the female
      Zeleboria. A 1:4 blend elicits a high rate of attempted copulation (
      approximately 70%) in bioassays, equivalent to rates observed at orchid flowers. 
      Whereas beta-citronellol is well known, 2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone appears to
      be previously unknown as a floral volatile. Production of the two compounds is
      restricted to glandular sepal tips; thus, differential expression analysis of
      contrasting floral tissue transcriptomes was employed to illuminate the
      biosynthesis. As expected, production of (S)-beta-citronellol commences with the 
      terpene synthase GES1 catalyzing the irreversible conversion of geranyl
      diphosphate (GPP) to geraniol. Contrary to prediction, biosynthesis subsequently 
      proceeds in three steps, commencing with the oxidation of geraniol to geranial by
      alcohol dehydrogenase ADH3, followed by the enantioselective reduction of a
      double bond in geranial by geranial reductase GER1 to give (S)-beta-citronellal. 
      Finally, ADH3-catalyzed reduction of (S)-beta-citronellal results in
      (S)-beta-citronellol. In line with previous work on insects showing that
      2-hydroxy-6-methylacetophenone is derived from a polyketide pathway, we report a 
      differentially expressed polyketide synthase (PKS) gene candidate. Thus, in this 
      unique example of sexual deception, pollination is achieved by co-opting and
      regulating two independent biosynthetic pathways of floral volatile compounds.

AB  - Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilins contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by
      promoting rapid actin filament disassembly. In the classical view, ADF/cofilin
      sever filaments, and capping proteins block filament barbed ends whereas pointed 
      ends depolymerize, at a rate that is still debated. Here, by monitoring the
      activity of the three mammalian ADF/cofilin isoforms on individual skeletal
      muscle and cytoplasmic actin filaments, we directly quantify the reactions
      underpinning filament severing and depolymerization from both ends. We find that,
      in the absence of monomeric actin, soluble ADF/cofilin can associate with bare
      filament barbed ends to accelerate their depolymerization. Compared to bare
      filaments, ADF/cofilin-saturated filaments depolymerize faster from their pointed
      ends and slower from their barbed ends, resulting in similar depolymerization
      rates at both ends. This effect is isoform specific because depolymerization is
      faster for ADF- than for cofilin-saturated filaments. We also show that,
      unexpectedly, ADF/cofilin-saturated filaments qualitatively differ from bare
      filaments: their barbed ends are very difficult to cap or elongate, and
      consequently undergo depolymerization even in the presence of capping protein and
      actin monomers. Such depolymerizing ADF/cofilin-decorated barbed ends are
      produced during 17% of severing events. They are also the dominant fate of
      filament barbed ends in the presence of capping protein, because capping allows
      growing ADF/cofilin domains to reach the barbed ends, thereby promoting their
      uncapping and subsequent depolymerization. Our experiments thus reveal how
      ADF/cofilin, together with capping protein, control the dynamics of actin
      filament barbed and pointed ends. Strikingly, our results propose that
      significant barbed-end depolymerization may take place in cells.

AB  - A living cell's ability to assemble actin filaments in intracellular motile
      processes is directly dependent on the availability of polymerizable actin
      monomers, which feed polarized filament growth [1, 2]. Continued generation of
      the monomer pool by filament disassembly is therefore crucial. Disassemblers like
      actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin and filament cappers like capping
      protein (CP) are essential agonists of motility [3-8], but the exact molecular
      mechanisms by which they accelerate actin polymerization at the leading edge and 
      filament turnover has been debated for over two decades [9-12]. Whereas filament 
      fragmentation by ADF/cofilin has long been demonstrated by total internal
      reflection fluorescence (TIRF) [13, 14], filament depolymerization was only
      inferred from bulk solution assays [15]. Using microfluidics-assisted TIRF
      microscopy, we provide the first direct visual evidence of ADF's simultaneous
      severing and rapid depolymerization of individual filaments. Using a conceptually
      novel assay to directly visualize ADF's effect on a population of pre-assembled
      filaments, we demonstrate how ADF's enhanced pointed-end depolymerization causes 
      an increase in polymerizable actin monomers, thus promoting faster barbed-end
      growth. We further reveal that ADF-enhanced depolymerization synergizes with CP's
      long-predicted "monomer funneling" [16] and leads to skyrocketing of filament
      growth rates, close to estimated lamellipodial rates. The "funneling model"
      hypothesized, on thermodynamic grounds, that at high enough extent of capping,
      the few non-capped filaments transiently grow much faster [15], an effect
      proposed to be very important for motility. We provide the first direct
      microscopic evidence of monomer funneling at the scale of individual filaments.
      These results significantly enhance our understanding of the turnover of cellular
      actin networks.

AB  - SYNE1 (synaptic nuclear envelope 1) encodes multiple isoforms of Nesprin1
      (nuclear envelope spectrin 1) that associate with the nuclear envelope (NE)
      through a C-terminal KASH (Klarsicht/Anc1/Syne homology) domain (Figure 1A)
      [1-4]. This domain interacts directly with the SUN (Sad1/Unc84) domain of Sun
      proteins [5-7], a family of transmembrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane 
      (INM) [8, 9], to form the so-called LINC complexes (linkers of the nucleoskeleton
      and cytoskeleton) that span the entire NE and mediate nuclear positioning
      [10-12]. In a stark departure from this classical depiction of Nesprin1 in the
      context of the NE, we report here that rootletin recruits Nesprin1alpha at the
      ciliary rootlets of photoreceptors and identify asymmetric NE aggregates of
      Nesprin1alpha and Sun2 that dock filaments of rootletin at the nuclear surface.
      In NIH 3T3 cells, we show that recombinant rootletin filaments also dock to the
      NE through the specific recruitment of an approximately 600-kDa endogenous
      isoform of Nesprin1 (Nes1(600kDa)) and of Sun2. In agreement with the association
      of Nesprin1alpha with photoreceptor ciliary rootlets and the functional
      interaction between rootletin and Nesprin1 in fibroblasts, we demonstrate that
      multiple isoforms of Nesprin1 are integral components of ciliary rootlets of
      multiciliated ependymal and tracheal cells. Together, these data provide a novel 
      functional paradigm for Nesprin1 at ciliary rootlets and suggest that the wide
      spectrum of human pathologies linked to truncating mutations of SYNE1 [13-15] may
      originate in part from ciliary defects.

AB  - The evolutionary pressures shaping humans' unique bipedal locomotion have been a 
      focus of research since Darwin, but the origins of humans' economical walking
      gait and endurance running capabilities remain unclear. Here, I review the
      anatomical and physiological determinants of locomotor economy (e.g., limb length
      and posture) and endurance (e.g., muscle volume and fiber type) and investigate
      their development in the hominin fossil record. The earliest hominins were
      bipedal but retained ape-like features in the hind limb that would have limited
      their walking economy compared to living humans. Moreover, the evolution of
      bipedalism and the loss of the forelimbs in weight support and propulsion would
      have reduced locomotor endurance in the earliest hominins and likely restricted
      ranging. Australopithecus evinced longer hind limbs, extended limb posture, and a
      stiff midfoot, suggesting improved, human-like economy, but were likely still
      limited in their endurance compared to modern humans. The appearance of skeletal 
      traits related to endurance (e.g., larger limb joints, spring-like plantar arch) 
      in Homo was somewhat mosaic, with the full endurance suite apparent only
      approximately 1 million years ago. The development of endurance capabilities in
      Homo appears to parallel the evolutionary increase in brain size, cognitive
      sophistication, and metabolic rate.

AB  - The origin of complex multicellularity was a major transition in evolution and is
      generally associated with higher genomic complexity. However, some complex
      multicellular fungi defy this principle, having small genomes that resemble those
      of unicellular yeasts rather than those of other complex multicellular organisms.

AB  - How does our brain use differences between the images in our two eyes, binocular 
      disparities, to generate depth perception? New work shows that a type of neural
      network trained on natural binocular images can learn parameters that match key
      properties of visual cortex. Most information is conveyed by cells which sense
      differences between the two eyes' images.

      growth, and faster growth due to increased nutrient supply results in larger cell
      volume. A new study demonstrates that fatty-acid availability limits growth rate 
      and cell envelope capacity, revealing that fatty-acid synthesis is the primary

AB  - The 'grooming handclasp' is one of the most well-established cultural traditions 
      in chimpanzees. A recent study by Wrangham et al.[1] reduced the cultural scope
      of grooming-handclasp behavior by showing that grooming-handclasp style
      convergence is "explained by matrilineal relationship rather than conformity"
      [1]. Given that we previously reported cultural differences in grooming-handclasp
      style preferences in captive chimpanzees [2], we tested the alternative view
      posed by Wrangham et al.[1] in the chimpanzee populations that our original
      results were based on. Using the same outcome variable as Wrangham et al.[1] -
      the proportion of high-arm grooming featuring palm-to-palm clasping - we found
      that matrilineal relationships explained neither within-group homogeneity nor
      between-group heterogeneity, thereby corroborating our original conclusion that
      grooming-handclasp behavior can represent a group-level cultural tradition in
      chimpanzees.

AB  - From intense sunlight in bright snow down to a moonless night in a dark forest,
      we can use light to recognize objects and guide our actions. This remarkable
      range mainly rests on having two different types of photoreceptors, the rods and 
      the cones. The cones are active under daylight conditions, allowing high acuity
      and color vision. Rods are mainly active under very dim illumination conditions
      and have an exquisite sensitivity to light [1]. There are obvious detriments to
      visual perception in near darkness, such as a central scotoma, reduced motion
      perception [2], and most of all a lack of color [3]. There is only one type of
      rod, and thus intensity and wavelength differences cannot be disentangled when
      only the rods are active. This is captured well by the old saying "at night all
      cats are gray", meaning that different colors inevitably get mapped onto
      different shades of gray. Here we show that the perception of lightness is also
      different for night vision: our results indicate that surfaces that appear to be 
      white under daylight conditions, at best, appear medium gray under night vision, 
      suggesting that activation of the cones is necessary for the perception of white.

AB  - Whether you see the person you are in love with, try to listen to your own
      heartbeat, suffer from a headache, or crave for a chocolate cookie, one part of
      your brain is sure to increase its activity strongly: the insular cortex. The
      insular cortex, or 'insula' for short, is part of the cerebral cortex. J.C. Reil,
      a German neurologist, first named this brain structure in the early 19(th)
      century. Subsequent research findings have implicated the insula in an
      overwhelming variety of functions ranging from sensory processing to representing
      feelings and emotions, autonomical and motor control, risk prediction and
      decision-making, bodily- and self-awareness, and complex social functions like
      empathy. How is one single brain area involved in so many different tasks? Is the
      insula comprised of several functional regions? How are these related? And, are
      there any common themes underlying the apparently so heterogeneous roles of the
      insula?

AB  - The ability to represent and select information in working memory provides the
      neurobiological infrastructure for human cognition. For 80 years, dominant views 
      of working memory have focused on the key role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) [1-8]. 
      However, more recent work has implicated posterior cortical regions [9-12],
      suggesting that PFC engagement during working memory is dependent on the degree
      of executive demand. We provide evidence from neurological patients with discrete
      PFC damage that challenges the dominant models attributing working memory to
      PFC-dependent systems. We show that neural oscillations, which provide a
      mechanism for PFC to communicate with posterior cortical regions [13],
      independently subserve communications both to and from PFC-uncovering parallel
      oscillatory mechanisms for working memory. Fourteen PFC patients and 20 healthy, 
      age-matched controls performed a working memory task where they encoded,
      maintained, and actively processed information about pairs of common shapes. In
      controls, the electroencephalogram (EEG) exhibited oscillatory activity in the
      low-theta range over PFC and directional connectivity from PFC to
      parieto-occipital regions commensurate with executive processing demands.
      Concurrent alpha-beta oscillations were observed over parieto-occipital regions, 
      with directional connectivity from parieto-occipital regions to PFC, regardless
      of processing demands. Accuracy, PFC low-theta activity, and PFC -->
      parieto-occipital connectivity were attenuated in patients, revealing a
      PFC-independent, alpha-beta system. The PFC patients still demonstrated task
      proficiency, which indicates that the posterior alpha-beta system provides
      sufficient resources for working memory. Taken together, our findings reveal
      neurologically dissociable PFC and parieto-occipital systems and suggest that
      parallel, bidirectional oscillatory systems form the basis of working memory.

AB  - Nutrients-and by extension biosynthetic capacity-positively impact cell size in
      organisms throughout the tree of life. In bacteria, cell size is reduced 3-fold
      in response to nutrient starvation or accumulation of the alarmone ppGpp, a
      global inhibitor of biosynthesis. However, whether biosynthetic capacity as a
      whole determines cell size or whether particular anabolic pathways are more
      important than others remains an open question. Here we identify fatty acid
      synthesis as the primary biosynthetic determinant of Escherichia coli size and
      present evidence supporting a similar role for fatty acids as a positive
      determinant of size in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and the
      single-celled eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Altering fatty acid synthesis
      recapitulated the impact of altering nutrients on cell size and morphology,
      whereas defects in other biosynthetic pathways had either a negligible or
      fatty-acid-dependent effect on size. Together, our findings support a novel
      "outside-in" model in which fatty acid availability sets cell envelope capacity, 
      which in turn dictates cell size. In the absence of ppGpp, limiting fatty acid
      synthesis leads to cell lysis, supporting a role for ppGpp as a linchpin linking 
      expansion of cytoplasmic volume to the growth of the cell envelope to preserve
      cellular integrity.

AB  - Insects, the most diverse group of organisms, are nested within crustaceans,
      arguably the most abundant group of marine animals. However, to date, no
      consensus has been reached as to which crustacean taxon is the closest relative
      of hexapods. A majority of studies have proposed that Branchiopoda (e.g., fairy
      shrimps) is the sister group of Hexapoda [1-7]. However, these investigations
      largely excluded two equally important taxa, Remipedia and Cephalocarida. Other
      studies suggested Remipedia [8-11] or Remipedia + Cephalocarida [12, 13] as
      potential sister groups of hexapods, but they either did not include
      Cephalocarida or used only Sanger sequence data and morphology [9, 12]. Here we
      present the first phylogenomic study specifically addressing the origins of
      hexapods, including transcriptomes for two species each of Cephalocarida and
      Remipedia. Phylogenetic analyses of selected matrices, ranging from 81 to 1,675
      orthogroups and up to 510,982 amino acid positions, clearly reject a sister-group
      relationship between Hexapoda and Branchiopoda [1-7]. Nonetheless, support for a 
      hexapod sister-group relationship to Remipedia or to Cephalocarida-Remipedia was 
      highly dependent on the employed analytical methodology. Further analyses
      assessing the effects of gene evolutionary rate and targeted taxon exclusion
      support Remipedia as the sole sister taxon of Hexapoda and suggest that the prior
      grouping of Remipedia + Cephalocarida is an artifact, possibly due to long branch
      attraction and compositional heterogeneity. We further conclude that
      terrestrialization of Hexapoda probably occurred in the late Cambrian to early
      Ordovician, an estimate that is independent of their proposed sister group [4, 8,
      12, 14].

AB  - Rats' large whiskers (macrovibrissae) are used to explore their nearby
      environment, typically using repetitive protraction-retraction "whisking" motions
      that are coordinated with head and body movements [1-8]. Once objects are
      detected, the rat can further explore the object tactually by using both the
      macrovibrissae and an array of shorter, stationary microvibrissae on the chin, as
      well as by using the lips [9-11]. When touch occurs during whisking, a fast
      reflexive response, termed a touch-induced pump (TIP), may be triggered. During a
      TIP, the whisker slightly retracts and protracts again, doubling the number of
      pressure onsets per contact. In head-fixed rats, TIPs occur in approximately 25% 
      of the contacts [12]. Here we report that the occurrence of TIPs depends strongly
      on attention, indicated by head-turning toward an object: when rats intended to
      explore an object, either after encountering it during free exploration or when
      expecting its existence, the probability of a TIP increased from <30% to >65%
      without an increase in TIP latency. TIP regulation was unilateral and specific to
      the attended object; when two objects were palpated bilaterally simultaneously,
      TIP probability increased to >65% and decreased to <20% for contacts with the
      apparently-attended and apparently-unattended object, respectively. A data-driven
      computational model indicates that attentional gating could not be triggered by
      object contact, due to temporal constraints; rather, it could be based on a
      normally enabled or whisking-triggered scheme. Taken together, our results
      suggest that object-related attention regulates contact dynamics by gating the
      operation of a brainstem motor-sensory-motor loop and that this regulation is
      optimized for fast reaction.

AB  - In the third trimester of pregnancy, the human fetus has the capacity to process 
      perceptual information [1-3]. With advances in 4D ultrasound technology, detailed
      assessment of fetal behavior [4] is now possible. Furthermore, modeling of
      intrauterine conditions has indicated a substantially greater luminance within
      the uterus than previously thought [5]. Consequently, light conveying perceptual 
      content could be projected through the uterine wall and perceived by the fetus,
      dependent on how light interfaces with maternal tissue. We do know that human
      infants at birth show a preference to engage with a top-heavy, face-like stimulus
      when contrasted with all other forms of stimuli [6, 7]. However, the viability of
      performing such an experiment based on visual stimuli projected through the
      uterine wall with fetal participants is not currently known. We examined fetal
      head turns to visually presented upright and inverted face-like stimuli. Here we 
      show that the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy is more likely to engage 
      with upright configural stimuli when contrasted to inverted visual stimuli, in a 
      manner similar to results with newborn participants. The current study suggests
      that postnatal experience is not required for this preference. In addition, we
      describe a new method whereby it is possible to deliver specific visual stimuli
      to the fetus. This new technique provides an important new pathway for the
      assessment of prenatal visual perceptual capacities.

AB  - Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) today greatly differ in
      their hearing abilities: Mysticeti are presumed to be sensitive to infrasonic
      noises [1-3], whereas Odontoceti are sensitive to ultrasonic sounds [4-6]. Two
      competing hypotheses exist regarding the attainment of hearing abilities in
      modern whales: ancestral low-frequency sensitivity [7-13] or ancestral
      high-frequency sensitivity [14, 15]. The significance of these evolutionary
      scenarios is limited by the undersampling of both early-diverging cetaceans
      (archaeocetes) and terrestrial hoofed relatives of cetaceans (non-cetacean
      artiodactyls). Here, we document for the first time the bony labyrinth, the
      hollow cavity housing the hearing organ, of two species of protocetid whales from
      Lutetian deposits (ca. 46-43 Ma) of Kpogame, Togo. These archaeocete cetaceans,
      which are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic forms, prove to be a key
      for determining the hearing abilities of early whales. We propose a new
      evolutionary picture for the early stages of this history, based on qualitative
      and quantitative studies of the cochlear morphology of an unparalleled sample of 
      extant and extinct land artiodactyls and cetaceans. Contrary to the hypothesis
      that archaeocetes have been more sensitive to high-frequency sounds than their
      terrestrial ancestors [15], we demonstrate that early cetaceans presented a

AB  - Sensitivity to inequity is thought to be an important mechanism for recognizing
      undesirable cooperative partners and thus crucial for the evolution of human
      cooperation [1]. This link may not be unique to humans, as cooperative non-human 
      primates also react to unequal outcomes [2], whereas non-cooperative species do
      not [3]. Although this hypothesis has not been tested in non-primate species,
      studies revealed that pet dogs show a limited form of inequity aversion,
      responding to reward, but not quality inequity [4-6]. It has been proposed that
      this primitive form of inequity aversion was selected for during domestication
      and thus absent in their ancestors, wolves. Alternatively, wolves, which hunt,
      raise pups, and defend their territory cooperatively, are similarly inequity
      averse as non-human primates, or at least to the same degree as pet dogs. Testing
      similarly raised and kept pack-living dogs and wolves, we found both to be
      inequity averse when their partner was being rewarded but they were not for
      performing the same action. Additionally, both wolves and dogs reacted to
      receiving a lower-quality reward than their partner. These results suggest that
      the inequity response found in pack-living dogs and wolves is comparable to that 
      observed in non-human primates; results from studies on pet dogs may be
      confounded by the dogs' relationship with humans. Consequently, our results
      suggest that inequity aversion was present already in the common-probably
      cooperative-ancestor of wolves and dogs and thus support the hypothesis of a
      close link of cooperation and inequity aversion.

      Gonad.

AB  - How sexually dimorphic gonads are generated is a fundamental question at the
      interface of developmental and evolutionary biology [1-3]. In C. elegans, sexual 
      dimorphism in gonad form and function largely originates in different
      apportionment of roles to three regulatory cells of the somatic gonad primordium 
      in young larvae. Their essential roles include leading gonad arm outgrowth,
      serving as the germline niche, connecting to epithelial openings, and organizing 
      reproductive organ development. The development and function of the regulatory
      cells in both sexes requires the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription
      factor HLH-2, the sole ortholog of the E proteins mammalian E2A and Drosophila
      Daughterless [4-8], yet how they adopt different fates to execute their different
      roles has been unknown. Here, we show that each regulatory cell expresses a
      distinct complement of bHLH-encoding genes-and therefore distinct HLH-2:bHLH
      dimers-and formulate a "bHLH code" hypothesis for regulatory cell identity. We
      support this hypothesis by showing that the bHLH gene complement is both
      necessary and sufficient to confer particular regulatory cell fates. Strikingly, 
      prospective regulatory cells can be directly reprogrammed into other regulatory
      cell types simply by loss or ectopic expression of bHLH genes, and male-to-female
      and female-to-male transformations indicate that the code is instructive for
      sexual dimorphism. The bHLH code appears to be embedded in a bow-tie regulatory
      architecture [9, 10], wherein sexual, positional, temporal, and lineage inputs
      connect through bHLH genes to diverse outputs for terminal features and provides 
      a plausible mechanism for the evolutionary plasticity of gonad form seen in
      nematodes [11-15].

AB  - Gene expression levels vary greatly within similar cells, even within clonal cell
      populations [1]. These spontaneous expression differences underlie cell fate
      diversity in both differentiation and disease [2]. The mechanisms responsible for
      generating expression variability are poorly understood. Using single-cell
      transcriptomics, we show that transcript variability emerging during
      Dictyostelium differentiation is driven predominantly by repression rather than
      activation. The increased variability of repressed genes was observed over a
      broad range of expression levels, indicating that variability is actively imposed
      and not a passive statistical effect of the reduced numbers of molecules
      accompanying repression. These findings can be explained by a simple model of
      transcript production, with expression controlled by the frequency, rather than
      the magnitude, of transcriptional firing events. Our study reveals that the
      generation of differences between cells can be a direct consequence of the basic 
      mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.

      Neurons Are Resilient to Disruption of Neuronal Migration.

AB  - The location of neurons early in development can be critical for their ability to
      differentiate and receive normal synaptic inputs. Indeed, disruptions in neuronal
      positioning lead to a variety of neurological disorders. Neurons have, however,
      shifted their positions across phylogeny, suggesting that changes in location do 
      not always spell functional disaster. To investigate the functional consequences 
      of abnormal positioning, we leveraged previously reported genetic perturbations
      to disrupt normal neuronal migration-and thus positioning-in a population of
      cranial motor neurons, the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs). We used a
      combination of topographical, morphological, physiological, and behavioral
      analyses to determine whether key functional features of FBMNs were still
      established in migration mutants, in spite of a dramatic rostrocaudal
      repositioning of these neurons in hindbrain. We discovered that FBMNs seem
      remarkably resilient to a disruption in positioning, suggesting that they may not
      rely heavily on rostrocaudal positioning to guide their functional development.
      Thus, the role of positioning may vary across the developing nervous system, with
      some populations-like facial motor neurons-exhibiting greater resilience to
      abnormal positioning that permits them to shift location as a part of
      evolutionary change.

AB  - The frontal cortex matures late in development, showing dramatic changes after
      puberty onset, yet few experiments have directly tested the role of pubertal
      hormones in cortical maturation. One mechanism thought to play a primary role in 
      regulating the maturation of the neocortex is an increase in inhibitory
      neurotransmission, which alters the balance of excitation and inhibition. We
      hypothesized that pubertal hormones could regulate maturation of the frontal
      cortex by this mechanism. Here, we report that manipulations of gonadal hormones 
      do significantly alter the maturation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the
      cingulate region of the mouse medial frontal cortex, an associative region that
      matures during the pubertal transition and is implicated in decision making,
      learning, and psychopathology. We find that inhibitory neurotransmission, but not
      excitatory neurotransmission, increases onto cingulate pyramidal neurons during
      peri-pubertal development and that this increase can be blocked by pre-pubertal, 
      but not post-pubertal, gonadectomy. We next used pre-pubertal hormone treatment
      to model early puberty onset, a phenomenon increasingly observed in girls living 
      in developed nations. We find that pre-pubertal hormone treatment drives an early
      increase in inhibitory neurotransmission in the frontal cortex, but not the
      somatosensory cortex, suggesting that earlier puberty can advance cortical
      maturation in a regionally specific manner. Pre-pubertal hormone treatment also
      accelerates maturation of tonic inhibition and performance in a
      frontal-cortex-dependent reversal-learning task. These data provide rare evidence
      of enduring, organizational effects of ovarian hormones at puberty and provide a 
      potential mechanism by which gonadal hormones could regulate the maturation of
      the associative neocortex.

AB  - Behavioral homology is often assumed to involve similarity in underlying neuronal
      mechanisms. Here, we provide a counterexample where homologous behaviors are
      produced by neurons with different synaptic connectivity. The nudibranch molluscs
      Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris exhibit homologous swimming behaviors,
      consisting of alternating left and right body flexions. The swim central pattern 
      generators (CPGs) in both species are composed of bilaterally symmetric
      interneurons, which are individually identified and reciprocally inhibit their
      contralateral counterparts, contributing to left-right burst alternation in the
      swim motor patterns. In Melibe, the swim CPG contains two parts that interact to 
      produce stable rhythmic bursting; one part is the primary half-center kernel, and
      the other part, which consists of a bilateral pair of neurons called Si3,
      regulates period length. The Dendronotus swim CPG is simpler, with Si3 being part
      of the primary half-center oscillator. Application of curare (d-tubocurarine)
      selectively blocked the Si3 synapses in both species. In Melibe, curare
      application caused the burst duration of the swim motor pattern to lengthen,
      whereas in Dendronotus, curare halted bursting altogether. In both species,
      replacing the curare-blocked Si3 synapses with artificial synapses using dynamic 
      clamp restored the original rhythmic bursting, thereby affirming the roles of
      those synapses. The curare-impaired bursting in Dendronotus was also restored by 
      rewiring the homologous neurons into a Melibe-like primary half-center oscillator
      configuration, indicating that the connectivity itself could account for species 
      differences in circuit responses to curare. The results suggest that synaptic
      connectivity diverged during evolution while behavior was conserved.

AB  - Circadian rhythms, metabolism, and nutrition are intimately linked [1, 2],
      although effects of meal timing on the human circadian system are poorly
      understood. We investigated the effect of a 5-hr delay in meals on markers of the
      human master clock and multiple peripheral circadian rhythms. Ten healthy young
      men undertook a 13-day laboratory protocol. Three meals (breakfast, lunch,
      dinner) were given at 5-hr intervals, beginning either 0.5 (early) or 5.5 (late) 
      hr after wake. Participants were acclimated to early meals and then switched to
      late meals for 6 days. After each meal schedule, participants' circadian rhythms 
      were measured in a 37-hr constant routine that removes sleep and environmental
      rhythms while replacing meals with hourly isocaloric snacks. Meal timing did not 
      alter actigraphic sleep parameters before circadian rhythm measurement. In
      constant routines, meal timing did not affect rhythms of subjective hunger and
      sleepiness, master clock markers (plasma melatonin and cortisol), plasma
      triglycerides, or clock gene expression in whole blood. Following late meals,
      however, plasma glucose rhythms were delayed by 5.69 +/- 1.29 hr (p < 0.001), and
      average glucose concentration decreased by 0.27 +/- 0.05 mM (p < 0.001). In
      adipose tissue, PER2 mRNA rhythms were delayed by 0.97 +/- 0.29 hr (p < 0.01),
      indicating that human molecular clocks may be regulated by feeding time and could
      underpin plasma glucose changes. Timed meals therefore play a role in
      synchronizing peripheral circadian rhythms in humans and may have particular
      relevance for patients with circadian rhythm disorders, shift workers, and
      transmeridian travelers.

AB  - Cilia on dendritic endings of sensory neurons organize distinct types of sensory 
      machinery [1]. Ciliated endings display neuron-type-specific patterns of membrane
      elaborations [1-3], but it is not well understood how such neuron-type-specific
      morphologies are generated and whether they are coupled to the specification of
      other identity aspects of a terminally differentiated sensory neuron. In the
      course of a genome-wide analysis of members of a small family of immunoglobulin
      domain proteins, we found that OIG-8, a previously uncharacterized transmembrane 
      protein with a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, instructs the distinct,
      neuron-type-specific elaboration of ciliated endings of different olfactory
      neuron types in the nematode C. elegans. OIG-8 protein localizes to ciliated
      endings of these sensory neurons, and is transcribed at different levels in
      distinct olfactory neuron types. oig-8 expression levels correlate with the
      extent of sensory cilia growth and branching patterns. Loss of oig-8 leads to a
      reduction in the branching patterns of cilia, whereas raising the levels of oig-8
      results in an increase in elaborations. Levels of OIG-8 expression are controlled
      by the specific combination of a terminal selector type of transcription factors 
      that also specify other identity features of distinct olfactory neuron types.

AB  - From development up to adulthood, the vertebrate brain is continuously supplied
      with newborn neurons that integrate into established mature circuits. However,
      how this process is coordinated during development remains unclear. Using
      two-photon imaging, GCaMP5 transgenic zebrafish larvae, and sparse
      electroporation in the larva's optic tectum, we monitored spontaneous and induced
      activity of large neuronal populations containing newborn and functionally mature
      neurons. We observed that the maturation of newborn neurons is a 4-day process.
      Initially, newborn neurons showed undeveloped dendritic arbors, no
      neurotransmitter identity, and were unresponsive to visual stimulation, although 
      they displayed spontaneous calcium transients. Later on, newborn-labeled neurons 
      began to respond to visual stimuli but in a very variable manner. At the end of
      the maturation period, newborn-labeled neurons exhibited visual tuning curves
      (spatial receptive fields and direction selectivity) and spontaneous correlated
      activity with neighboring functionally mature neurons. At this developmental
      stage, newborn-labeled neurons presented complex dendritic arbors and
      neurotransmitter identity (excitatory or inhibitory). Removal of retinal inputs
      significantly perturbed the integration of newborn neurons into the functionally 
      mature tectal network. Our results provide a comprehensive description of the
      maturation of newborn neurons during development and shed light on potential
      mechanisms underlying their integration into a functionally mature neuronal
      circuit.

AB  - The mammalian pupillary light reflex (PLR) involves a bilateral brain circuit
      whereby afferent light signals in the optic nerve ultimately drive
      iris-sphincter-muscle contraction via excitatory cholinergic parasympathetic
      innervation [1, 2]. Additionally, the PLR in nocturnal and crepuscular
      sub-primate mammals has a "local" component in the isolated sphincter muscle
      [3-5], as in amphibians, fish, and bird [6-10]. In mouse, this local PLR requires
      the pigment melanopsin [5], originally found in intrinsically photosensitive
      retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) [11-19]. However, melanopsin's presence and
      effector pathway locally in the iris remain uncertain. The sphincter muscle
      itself may express melanopsin [5], or its cholinergic parasympathetic innervation
      may be modulated by suggested intraocular axonal collaterals of ipRGCs traveling 
      to the eye's ciliary body or even to the iris [20-22]. Here, we show that the
      muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, eliminated the effect of acetylcholine 
      (ACh), but not of light, on isolated mouse sphincter muscle. Conversely,
      selective genetic deletion of melanopsin in smooth muscle mostly removed the
      light-induced, but not the ACh-triggered, increase in isolated sphincter muscle's
      tension and largely suppressed the local PLR in vivo. Thus, sphincter muscle
      cells are bona fide, albeit unconventional, photoreceptors. We found melanopsin
      expression in a small subset of mouse iris sphincter muscle cells, with the
      light-induced contractile signal apparently spreading through gap junctions into 
      neighboring muscle cells. Light and ACh share a common signaling pathway in
      sphincter muscle. In summary, our experiments have provided details of a
      photosignaling process in the eye occurring entirely outside the retina.

TI  - Paleogenomic Evidence for Multi-generational Mixing between Neolithic Farmers and

AB  - The transition from hunting and gathering to farming involved profound cultural
      and technological changes. In Western and Central Europe, these changes occurred 
      rapidly and synchronously after the arrival of early farmers of Anatolian origin 
      [1-3], who largely replaced the local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers [1, 4-6].
      Further east, in the Baltic region, the transition was gradual, with little or no
      genetic input from incoming farmers [7]. Here we use ancient DNA to investigate
      the relationship between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Lower Danube basin, 
      a geographically intermediate area that is characterized by a rapid Neolithic
      transition but also by the presence of archaeological evidence that points to
      cultural exchange, and thus possible admixture, between hunter-gatherers and
      farmers. We recovered four human paleogenomes (1.1x to 4.1x coverage) from
      Romania spanning a time transect between 8.8 thousand years ago (kya) and 5.4 kya
      and supplemented them with two Mesolithic genomes (1.7x and 5.3x) from Spain to
      provide further context on the genetic background of Mesolithic Europe. Our
      results show major Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) ancestry in a Romanian
      Eneolithic sample with a minor, but sizeable, contribution from Anatolian
      farmers, suggesting multiple admixture events between hunter-gatherers and
      farmers. Dietary stable-isotope analysis of this sample suggests a mixed
      terrestrial/aquatic diet. Our results provide support for complex interactions
      among hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Danube basin, demonstrating that in
      some regions, demic and cultural diffusion were not mutually exclusive, but
      merely the ends of a continuum for the process of Neolithization.

AB  - For over half a century now, primate vocalizations have been thought to undergo
      little or no experience-dependent acoustic changes during development [1]. If any
      changes are apparent, then they are routinely (and quite reasonably) attributed
      to the passive consequences of growth. Indeed, previous experiments on squirrel
      monkeys and macaque monkeys showed that social isolation [2, 3], deafness [2],
      cross-fostering [4] and parental absence [5] have little or no effect on vocal
      development. Here, we explicitly test in marmoset monkeys-a very vocal and
      cooperatively breeding species [6]-whether the transformation of immature into
      mature contact calls by infants is influenced by contingent parental vocal
      feedback. Using a closed-loop design, we experimentally provided more versus less
      contingent vocal feedback to twin infant marmoset monkeys over their first 2
      months of life, the interval during which their contact calls transform from
      noisy, immature calls to tonal adult-like "phee" calls [7, 8]. Infants who
      received more contingent feedback had a faster rate of vocal development,
      producing mature-sounding contact calls earlier than the other twin. The
      differential rate of vocal development was not linked to genetics, perinatal
      experience, or body growth; nor did the amount of contingency influence the
      overall rate of spontaneous vocal production. Thus, we provide the first
      experimental evidence for production-related vocal learning during the
      development of a nonhuman primate.

AB  - Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (Class Chondrichthyes; herein 'sharks') are the
      earliest extant jawed vertebrates and exhibit some of the greatest functional
      diversity of all vertebrates. Ecologically, they influence energy transfer
      vertically through trophic levels and sometimes trophic cascades via direct
      consumption and predation risk. Through movements and migrations, they connect
      horizontally and temporally across habitats and ecosystems, integrating energy
      flows at large spatial scales and across time. This connectivity flows from
      ontogenetic growth in size and spatial movements, which in turn underpins their
      relatively low reproductive rates compared with other exploited ocean fishes.
      Sharks are also ecologically and demographically diverse and are taken in a wide 
      variety of fisheries for multiple products (e.g. meat, fins, teeth, and gills).
      Consequently, a range of fisheries management measures are generally preferable
      to 'silver bullet' and 'one size fits all' conservation actions. Some species
      with extremely low annual reproductive output can easily become endangered and
      hence require strict protections to minimize mortality. Other, more prolific
      species can withstand fishing over the long term if catches are subject to
      effective catch limits throughout the species' range. We identify, based on the
      IUCN Red List status, 64 endangered species in particular need of new or stricter
      protections and 514 species in need of improvements to fisheries management. We
      designate priority countries for such actions, recognizing the widely differing
      fishing pressures and conservation capacity. We hope that this analysis assists
      efforts to ensure this group of ecologically important and evolutionarily
      distinct animals can support both ocean ecosystems and human activities in the
      future.

AB  - The evolution of cetaceans is one of the best examples of macroevolution
      documented from the fossil record. While ecological transitions dominate each
      phase of cetacean history, this context is rarely stated explicitly. The first
      major ecological phase involves a transition from riverine and deltaic
      environments to marine ones, concomitant with dramatic evolutionary
      transformations documented in their early fossil record. The second major phase
      involves ecological shifts associated with evolutionary innovations: echolocation
      (facilitating hunting prey at depth) and filter-feeding (enhancing foraging
      efficiency on small prey). This latter phase involves body size shifts,
      attributable to changes in foraging depth and environmental forcing, as well as
      re-invasions of freshwater systems on continental basins by multiple lineages.
      Modern phenomena driving cetacean ecology, such as trophic dynamics and arms
      races, have an evolutionary basis that remains mostly unexamined. The fossil
      record of cetaceans provides an historical basis for understanding current
      ecological mechanisms and consequences, especially as global climate change
      rapidly alters ocean and river ecosystems at rates and scales comparable to those
      over geologic time.

AB  - The world's oceans are home to many fantastic creatures, including about 16,000
      species of actinopterygian, or ray-finned, fishes. Notably, 85% of marine fish
      species come from a single actinopterygian subgroup, the acanthomorph or
      spiny-rayed fishes. Here, we review eight functional innovations found in marine 
      acanthomorphs that have been instrumental in the adaptive radiation of this group
      in the marine realm. Jaw protrusion substantially enhances the suction feeding
      mechanism found in all fish. Fin spines serve as a major deterrent to predators
      and enhance the locomotor function of fins. Pharyngognathy, a specialization of
      the second pair of jaws in the pharynx, enhances the ability of fishes to process
      hard and tough prey. Endothermy allows fishes to function at high levels of
      physiological performance in cold waters and facilitates frequent movement across
      strong thermal gradients found in the open ocean. Intramandibular joints enhance 
      feeding for fishes that bite and scrape prey attached to hard surfaces.
      Antifreeze proteins prevent ice crystal growth in extracellular fluids, allowing 
      fish to function in cold waters that would otherwise freeze them. Air-breathing
      allowed fishes at the water's edge to exploit terrestrial habitats. Finally,
      bioluminescence functions in communication, attracting prey and in hiding from
      predators, particularly for fishes of the deep ocean. All of these innovations
      have evolved multiple times in fishes. The frequent occurrence of convergent
      evolution of these complex functional novelties speaks to the persistence and
      potency of the selective forces in marine environments that challenge fishes and 
      stimulate innovation.

AB  - The study of marine microbial ecology has been completely transformed by
      molecular and genomic data: after centuries of relative neglect, genomics has
      revealed the surprising extent of microbial diversity and how microbial processes
      transform ocean and global ecosystems. But the revolution is not complete: major 
      gaps in our understanding remain, and one obvious example is that microbial
      eukaryotes, or protists, are still largely neglected. Here we examine various
      ways in which protists might be better integrated into models of marine microbial
      ecology, what challenges this will present, and why understanding the limitations
      of our tools is a significant concern. In part this is a technical challenge -
      eukaryotic genomes are more difficult to characterize - but eukaryotic
      adaptations are also more dependent on morphology and behaviour than they are on 
      the metabolic diversity that typifies bacteria, and these cannot be inferred from
      genomic data as readily as metabolism can be. We therefore cannot simply follow
      in the methodological footsteps of bacterial ecology and hope for similar
      success. Understanding microbial eukaryotes will require different approaches,
      including greater emphasis on taxonomically and trophically diverse model
      systems. Molecular sequencing will continue to play a role, and advances in
      environmental sequence tag studies and single-cell methods for genomic and
      transcriptomics offer particular promise.

AB  - Reef-building corals provide the foundation for the structural and biological
      diversity of coral-reef ecosystems. These massive biological structures, which
      can be seen from space, are the culmination of complex interactions between the
      tiny polyps of the coral animal in concert with its unicellular symbiotic algae
      and a wide diversity of closely associated microorganisms (bacteria, archaea,
      fungi, and viruses). While reef-building corals have persisted in various forms
      for over 200 million years, human-induced conditions threaten their function and 
      persistence. The scope for loss associated with the destruction of coral reef
      systems is economically, biologically, physically and culturally immense. Here,
      we provide a micro-to-macro perspective on the biology of scleractinian corals
      and discuss how cellular processes of the host and symbionts potentially affect
      the response of these reef builders to the wide variety of both natural and
      anthropogenic stressors encountered by corals in the Anthropocene. We argue that 
      the internal physicochemical settings matter to both the performance of the host 
      and microbiome, as bio-physical feedbacks may enhance stress tolerance through
      environmentally mediated host priming and effects on microbiome ecological and
      evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - The oceans appear ideal for biodiversity - they have unlimited water, a large
      area, are well connected, have less extreme temperatures than on land, and
      contain more phyla and classes than land and fresh waters. Yet only 16% of all
      named species on Earth are marine. Species richness decreases with depth in the
      ocean, reflecting wider geographic ranges of deep sea than coastal species. Here,
      we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying
      particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and
      parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then
      review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge
      informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for
      marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be
      large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by
      human impacts. Such threats now extend globally, and thus the only refuges for
      these species will be large, permanent, fully protected marine reserves.

AB  - The marine environment is the planet's largest, yet in many respects the least
      accessible. Our human sensory repertoire, with its emphasis on vision and
      air-adapted hearing, does not serve us well underwater. Underwater vision is
      often limited and as divers we find hearing of little, or no, use. Yet we know
      from the physics that underwater sound has properties well suited to serve as
      sensory and communication channels for suitably-adapted marine animals. The
      rapidly developing area of marine bioacoustics seeks to characterise underwater
      sound in relation to the acoustic capability of particular species (acoustic
      habitat), and discover the role of acoustics in the lives of marine animals
      (acoustic ecology) (Clarke et al., 2011).

AB  - As land-locked animals, when we visualise the ocean our mind's eye may see
      crashing waves or a vast blue expanse stretching to the horizon, a raft of
      torpedoing penguins, a glimpse of colourful coral reef fish from the shark-free
      safety of a sandy beach. Underwater, the crystal-clear, and in fact not at all
      silent, world of Jacques Cousteau, or more recently David Attenborough, is a
      wonderland that some cannot wait to witness first hand as divers, while others
      are content to see it on a screen. Spend a bit of time underwater, in the English
      Channel for example, and a few facts emerge. Most obviously, much of this
      underwater realm is visually very different to land and indeed to the
      cherry-picked clear waters of documentaries. It may be disappointingly murky and 
      monochromatic. Perhaps surprisingly, therefore, on close inspection the diversity
      of eye designs and light sensing mechanisms that evolved in the ocean are more
      varied than on land, reflecting the greater range of light environments and
      lifestyles of the marine world. Particularly in the last ten years, the
      destructive influence we are having on the oceans has become visibly obvious, not
      just to fisheries biologists and ecologists, but to anyone returning to a
      favourite dive spot or reef resort. Climate change, as a result of burning fossil
      fuels, human greed and carelessness with plastic disposal, are rapidly degrading 
      entire oceanic ecosystems.

AB  - Invisible to the naked eye, yet dominating life with some 10(30) cells, bacteria 
      and archaea (referred to herein as 'microbes') play key roles in the global
      cycling of nutrients, matter and energy in our oceans. Having experimented for
      over 3.5 billion years since their first appearance, they are true master
      chemists that are capable of carrying out the most diverse and complex of
      chemical reactions. One of the most abundant groups, cyanobacteria, converts
      light into chemical energy by fixing carbon dioxide into organic matter. Part of 
      this fixed carbon is consumed by higher trophic levels, while another fraction
      sinks to the deep sediments where, over geological time scales, it fossilizes
      into the natural resources that we tap into for our everyday lives. Despite our
      knowledge of their global importance and significant recent advances in marine
      microbiome research (Figure 1), some of the most fundamental questions still
      remain unanswered, and serve as active drivers of current research in this field:
      How many microbes are out there, and how many different types? What are they?
      What are their functional roles? How are they globally distributed? How do they
      adapt to varying environmental conditions and how will they respond to future
      environmental changes? This Primer provides a brief overview on how these
      questions have been addressed in the context of developing technologies. We
      discuss new insights, as well as new concepts and more refined questions, and we 
      highlight some of the future promises and challenges that lie ahead.

AB  - Herbivory occurs when animals consume plants; but the term hides two
      fundamentally different processes. One relates to the animal's nutrition, the
      other to the plant's survival and abundance. Both are central to the ecological
      process called herbivory. Evolutionary innovations in herbivore function have
      shaped shallow marine ecosystems from kelp forests to coral reefs.

AB  - Plankton comprises unicellular plants - phytoplankton - and generally small
      (millimetres or less) animals - zooplankton - that are adrift on the currents.
      Phytoplankton are responsible for about 45% of global annual primary production
      and are grazed by zooplankton, which in turn are suitably sized food items for
      predators including commercially important fish and great whales. Plankton are
      vital components of marine and freshwater water-column ecosystems. They also make
      major contributions to global biogeochemical cycling, and ameliorate atmospheric 
      accumulation of carbon dioxide by 'pumping' carbon to the deep sea. The integrity
      of these roles is under threat from climate-related physiological impacts on
      individual organisms and on the wide-scale distribution of plankton communities.

AB  - Phytoplankton form the basis of the marine food web and are responsible for
      approximately half of global carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation ( approximately 50 Pg 
      of carbon per year). Thus, these microscopic, photosynthetic organisms are vital 
      in controlling the atmospheric CO2 concentration and Earth's climate.
      Phytoplankton are dependent on sunlight and their CO2-fixation activity is
      therefore restricted to the upper, sunlit surface ocean (that is, the euphotic
      zone). CO2 usually does not limit phytoplankton growth due to its high
      concentration in seawater. However, the vast majority of oceanic surface waters
      are depleted in inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, iron and/or silica; nutrients
      that limit primary production in the ocean (Figure 1). Phytoplankton growth is
      mainly supported by either the recycling of nutrients or by reintroduction of
      nutrients from deeper waters by mixing. A small percentage of primary production,
      though, is fueled by 'external' or 'new' nutrients and it is these nutrients that
      determine the amount of carbon that can be sequestered long term in the deep
      ocean. For most nutrients such as phosphorus, iron, and silica, the external
      supply is limited to atmospheric deposition and/or coastal and riverine inputs,
      whereas their main sink is the sedimentation of particulate matter. Nitrogen,
      however, has an additional, biological source, the fixation of N2 gas, as well as
      biological sinks via the processes of denitrification and anammox. Despite the
      comparatively small contributions to the overall turnover of nutrients in the
      ocean, it is these biological processes that determine the ocean's capacity to
      sequester CO2 from the atmosphere on time scales of ocean circulation (
      approximately 1000 years). This primer will highlight shifts in the traditional
      paradigms of nutrient limitation in the ocean, with a focus on the uniqueness of 
      the nitrogen cycling and its biological sources and sinks.

AB  - Ocean currents have many profound impacts on marine life, moving not only animals
      and plants around the ocean but also redistributing heat and nutrients. While
      some of these impacts have been well known for many decades, there have been
      major recent developments in this area. Biologists are increasingly collaborating
      with physical oceanographers. At the same time, methods to accurately predict
      ocean currents and their variability have improved over a broad range of spatial 
      and temporal scales. Emerging from these initiatives is an understanding of how
      currents impact the connectivity of marine populations, how they influence the
      migration of strong swimmers, including whales and turtles, and how changing
      currents, as part of global climate change, may re-shape entire communities.

AB  - The structure and function of marine ecosystems are not fixed. Instead, major
      innovations - from the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, to the evolution of
      reefs or of deep bioturbation, to the rise of pelagic calcifiers - have changed
      biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem dynamics. As a result, modern marine
      ecosystems are fundamentally different from those in the distant past.

AB  - The deep ocean encompasses 95% of the oceans' volume and is the largest and least
      explored biome of Earth's Biosphere. New life forms are continuously being
      discovered. The physiological mechanisms allowing organisms to adapt to extreme
      conditions of the deep ocean (high pressures, from very low to very high
      temperatures, food shortage, lack of solar light) are still largely unknown. Some
      deep-sea species have very long life-spans, whereas others can tolerate toxic
      compounds at high concentrations; these characteristics offer an opportunity to
      explore the specialized biochemical and physiological mechanisms associated with 
      these responses. Widespread symbiotic relationships play fundamental roles in
      driving host functions, nutrition, health, and evolution. Deep-sea organisms
      communicate and interact through sound emissions, chemical signals and
      bioluminescence. Several giants of the oceans hunt exclusively at depth, and new 
      studies reveal a tight connection between processes in the shallow water and some
      deep-sea species. Limited biological knowledge of the deep-sea limits our
      capacity to predict future response of deep-sea organisms subject to increasing
      human pressure and changing global environmental conditions. Molecular tools,
      sensor-tagged animals, in situ and laboratory experiments, and new technologies
      can enable unprecedented advancement of deep-sea biology, and facilitate the
      sustainable management of deep ocean use under global change.

AB  - Most of Earth's surface is blue or white, but how much of each would depend on
      the time of observation. Our planet has been through phases of snowball (all
      frozen), greenhouse (all liquid seas) and icehouse (frozen and liquid). Even
      during current icehouse conditions, the extent of ice versus water has changed
      considerably between ice ages and interglacial periods. Water has been vital for 
      life on Earth and has driven and been influenced by transitions between
      greenhouse and icehouse. However, neither the possession of water nor having
      liquid and frozen seas are unique to Earth (Figure 1). Frozen water oceans on the
      moons Enceladus and Europa (and possibly others) and the liquid and frozen
      hydrocarbon oceans on Titan probably represent the most likely areas to find
      extraterrestrial life. We know very little about life in Earth's polar oceans,
      yet they are the engine of the thermohaline 'conveyor-belt', driving global
      circulation of heat, oxygen, carbon and nutrients as well as setting sea level
      through change in ice-mass balance. In regions of polar seas, where surface water
      is particularly cold and dense, it sinks to generate a tropic-ward flow on the
      ocean floor of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Cold water holds more
      gas, so this sinking water exports O2 and nutrients, thereby supporting life in
      the deep sea, as well as soaking up CO2 from the atmosphere. Water from
      mid-depths at lower latitudes flows in to replace the sinking polar surface
      water. This brings heat. The poles are cold because they receive the least energy
      from the sun, and this extreme light climate varies on many different time
      scales. To us, the current warm, interglacial conditions seem normal, yet such
      phases have represented only approximately 10% of Homo sapiens' existence.
      Variations in Earth's orbit (so called 'Milankovitch cycles') have driven
      cyclical alternation of glaciations (ice ages) and warmer interglacials. Despite 
      this, Earth's polar regions have been our planet's most environmentally constant 
      surface regions for several millions of years, with most land ice-covered and
      much of the ocean seasonally freezing. The two poles have much in common, such as
      light climate, temperature and water viscosity, winter calm and summer (iceberg
      and storm) disturbance and resources. However, they are also regions of striking 
      contrasts: the Arctic Ocean is near surrounded by land compared with the
      Antarctic continent, which is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. Polar oceans
      contrast in size, age, isolation, depth, oceanography, biology and human factors,
      such as governance and human habitation. The simplest foodwebs with the smallest 
      residents live on the 1% of Antarctica that is ice free, whilst the largest
      animals that have ever lived on Earth (Blue and Fin whales) feed in the Arctic
      and Southern Oceans.

AB  - People have an enduring fascination with the biology of the oceans. When the
      BBC's 'Blue Planet' series first aired on British television almost a quarter of 
      the nation tuned in. As the diversity of science in this special issue of Current
      Biology attests, the ocean presents a challenging environment for study while
      also exhibiting some of the most profound and disruptive symptoms of global
      change. Marine science has made major advances in the past few decades, which
      were primarily made possible through important technological innovations. This
      progress notwithstanding, there are persistent challenges in achieving an
      understanding of marine processes at appropriate scales and delivering meaningful
      insights to guide ocean policy and management. Naturally, the examples chosen
      below betray my ecological leanings, but I hope that many of the issues raised
      resonate with readers in many different disciplines.

AB  - New research reveals that neural activity is required for post-natal maturation
      of hippocampal neural circuits underlying memory and navigation; this
      activity-dependent maturation occurs sequentially along the classic
      'tri-synaptic' pathway, following the direction of information flow found in the 
      adult hippocampus.

AB  - Convergence of distantly related species to similar forms speaks to the
      predictability of evolution, but we still lack general insights into whether
      convergence is more common or rare than we would expect. Using a global dataset
      of mammalian species, Mazel and colleagues find that both convergence and
      divergence occur more often than expected. Convergence was especially common at
      broad scales that involved Australia, speaking to the extraordinary replicate
      mammalian communities found there.

AB  - Arbuscules are tree-shaped fungal structures inside plant root cells that
      facilitate the exchange of nutrients delivered by the fungus with carbon sources 
      from the host. To maintain symbiotic efficiency, plant cells can trigger
      degeneration of underperforming arbuscules. A recent study reveals the first
      transcription factor, which induces genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, to mediate
      arbuscule degeneration.

AB  - Of the 6,000 reef fish species, only 128 feed on corals [1,2]. Despite being
      widely available on tropical reefs, corals appear to represent a particularly
      challenging trophic resource, with mucus- and nematocyst-laden tissues spread
      over a sharp coral skeleton. Here we report that coral-feeding tubelip wrasses
      use highly modified lips to suck material from the coral surface. These lips have
      a specialized mushroom-like lamellar epithelium that secretes mucus. This mucus
      may facilitate suction and reduce damage by nematocysts in a manner akin to
      anemonefishes. The remarkable lip specializations observed in tubelip wrasses
      highlight the potential role of soft tissues in shaping the trophic ability of
      fishes.

AB  - To better understand how a stream of sensory data is transformed into a percept, 
      we examined neuronal activity in vibrissal sensory cortex, vS1, together with
      vibrissal motor cortex, vM1 (a frontal cortex target of vS1), while rats compared
      the intensity of two vibrations separated by an interstimulus delay. Vibrations
      were "noisy," constructed by stringing together over time a sequence of velocity 
      values sampled from a normal distribution; each vibration's mean speed was
      proportional to the width of the normal distribution. Durations of both stimulus 
      1 and stimulus 2 could vary from 100 to 600 ms. Psychometric curves reveal that
      rats overestimated the longer-duration stimulus-thus, perceived intensity of a
      vibration grew over the course of hundreds of milliseconds even while the sensory
      input remained, on average, stationary. Human subjects demonstrated the identical
      perceptual phenomenon, indicating that the underlying mechanisms of temporal
      integration generalize across species. The time dependence of the percept allowed
      us to ask to what extent neurons encoded the ongoing stimulus stream versus the
      animal's percept. We demonstrate that vS1 firing correlated with the local
      features of the vibration, whereas vM1 firing correlated with the percept: the
      final vM1 population state varied, as did the rat's behavior, according to both
      stimulus speed and stimulus duration. Moreover, vM1 populations appeared to
      participate in the trace of the percept of stimulus 1 as the rat awaited stimulus
      2. In conclusion, the transformation of sensory data into the percept appears to 
      involve the integration and storage of vS1 signals by vM1.

AB  - When we recall an experience, we rely upon the associations that we formed during
      the experience, such as those among objects, time, and place [1]. These
      associations are better remembered when they are familiar and draw upon
      generalized knowledge, suggesting that we use semantic memory in the service of
      episodic memory [2, 3]. Moreover, converging evidence suggests that episodic
      memory retrieval involves the reinstatement of neural activity that was present
      when we first experienced the event. Therefore, we hypothesized that retrieving
      associations should also reinstate the neural activity responsible for semantic
      processing. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that verbal memory retrieval 
      leads to the reinstatement of activity across regions of the brain that include
      the distributed semantic processing network [4-6], but it is unknown whether and 
      how individual neurons in the human cortex participate in the reinstatement of
      semantic representations. Recent advances using high-density microelectrode
      arrays (MEAs) have allowed clinicians to record from populations of neurons in
      the human cortex [7, 8]. Here we used MEAs to record neuronal spiking activity in
      the human middle temporal gyrus (MTG), a cortical region supporting the semantic 
      representation of words [9-11], as participants performed a verbal
      paired-associates task. We provide novel evidence that population spiking
      activity in the MTG forms distinct representations of semantic concepts and that 
      these representations are reinstated during the retrieval of those words.

AB  - The human brain is organized into large-scale functional modules that have been
      shown to evolve in childhood and adolescence. However, it remains unknown whether
      the underlying white matter architecture is similarly refined during development,
      potentially allowing for improvements in executive function. In a sample of 882
      participants (ages 8-22) who underwent diffusion imaging as part of the
      Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that structural network
      modules become more segregated with age, with weaker connections between modules 
      and stronger connections within modules. Evolving modular topology facilitates
      global network efficiency and is driven by age-related strengthening of hub edges
      present both within and between modules. Critically, both modular segregation and
      network efficiency are associated with enhanced executive performance and mediate
      the improvement of executive functioning with age. Together, results delineate a 
      process of structural network maturation that supports executive function in
      youth.

AB  - In most sexually reproducing plants, a single somatic, sub-epidermal cell in an
      ovule is selected to differentiate into a megaspore mother cell, which is
      committed to giving rise to the female germline. However, it remains unclear how 
      intercellular signaling among somatic cells results in only one cell in the
      sub-epidermal layer differentiating into the megaspore mother cell. Here we
      uncovered a role of the THO complex in restricting the megaspore mother cell fate
      to a single cell. Mutations in TEX1, HPR1, and THO6, components of the THO/TREX
      complex, led to the formation of multiple megaspore mother cells, which were able
      to initiate gametogenesis. We demonstrated that TEX1 repressed the megaspore
      mother cell fate by promoting the biogenesis of TAS3-derived trans-acting small
      interfering RNA (ta-siRNA), which represses ARF3 expression. The TEX1 protein was
      present in epidermal cells, but not in the germline, and, through TAS3-derived
      ta-siRNA, restricted ARF3 expression to the medio domain of ovule primordia.
      Expansion of ARF3 expression into lateral epidermal cells in a TAS3
      ta-siRNA-insensitive mutant led to the formation of supernumerary megaspore
      mother cells, suggesting that TEX1- and TAS3-mediated restriction of ARF3
      expression limits excessive megaspore mother cell formation
      non-cell-autonomously. Our findings reveal the role of a small-RNA pathway in the
      regulation of female germline specification in Arabidopsis.

AB  - In morphological terms, "form" is used to describe an object's shape and size. In
      dogs, facial form is stunningly diverse. Facial retrusion, the proximodistal
      shortening of the snout and widening of the hard palate is common to
      brachycephalic dogs and is a welfare concern, as the incidence of respiratory
      distress and ocular trauma observed in this class of dogs is highly correlated
      with their skull form. Progress to identify the molecular underpinnings of facial
      retrusion is limited to association of a missense mutation in BMP3 among small
      brachycephalic dogs. Here, we used morphometrics of skull isosurfaces derived
      from 374 pedigree and mixed-breed dogs to dissect the genetics of skull form.
      Through deconvolution of facial forms, we identified quantitative trait loci that
      are responsible for canine facial shapes and sizes. Our novel insights include
      recognition that the FGF4 retrogene insertion, previously associated with
      appendicular chondrodysplasia, also reduces neurocranium size. Focusing on facial
      shape, we resolved a quantitative trait locus on canine chromosome 1 to a 188-kb 
      critical interval that encompasses SMOC2. An intronic, transposable element
      within SMOC2 promotes the utilization of cryptic splice sites, causing its
      incorporation into transcripts, and drastically reduces SMOC2 gene expression in 
      brachycephalic dogs. SMOC2 disruption affects the facial skeleton in a
      dose-dependent manner. The size effects of the associated SMOC2 haplotype are
      profound, accounting for 36% of facial length variation in the dogs we tested.
      Our data bring new focus to SMOC2 by highlighting its clinical implications in
      both human and veterinary medicine.

AB  - Understanding both the organization of the human cortex and its relation to the
      performance of distinct functions is fundamental in neuroscience. The primary
      sensory cortices display topographic organization, whereby receptive fields
      follow a characteristic pattern, from tonotopy to retinotopy to somatotopy [1].
      GABAergic signaling is vital to the maintenance of cortical receptive fields [2];
      however, it is unclear how this fine-grain inhibition relates to measurable
      patterns of perception [3, 4]. Based on perceptual changes following perturbation
      of the GABAergic system, it is conceivable that the resting level of cortical
      GABAergic tone directly relates to the spatial specificity of activation in
      response to a given input [5-7]. The specificity of cortical activation can be
      considered in terms of cortical tuning: greater cortical tuning yields more
      localized recruitment of cortical territory in response to a given input. We
      applied a combination of fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and psychophysics to substantiate
      the link between the cortical neurochemical milieu, the tuning of cortical
      activity, and variability in perceptual acuity, using human somatosensory cortex 
      as a model. We provide data that explain human perceptual acuity in terms of both
      the underlying cellular and metabolic processes. Specifically, higher
      concentrations of sensorimotor GABA are associated with more selective cortical
      tuning, which in turn is associated with enhanced perception. These results show 
      anatomical and neurochemical specificity and are replicated in an independent
      cohort. The mechanistic link from neurochemistry to perception provides a vital
      step in understanding population variability in sensory behavior, informing
      metabolic therapeutic interventions to restore perceptual abilities clinically.

AB  - Plesiosaurs were the longest-surviving group of secondarily marine tetrapods,
      comparable in diversity to today's cetaceans. During their long evolutionary
      history, which spanned the Jurassic and the Cretaceous (201 to 66 Ma),
      plesiosaurs repeatedly evolved long- and short-necked body plans [1, 2]. Despite 
      this postcranial plasticity, short-necked plesiosaur clades have traditionally
      been regarded as being highly constrained to persistent and clearly distinct
      ecological niches: advanced members of Pliosauridae (ranging from the Middle
      Jurassic to the early Late Cretaceous) have been characterized as apex predators 
      [2-5], whereas members of the distantly related clade Polycotylidae (middle to
      Late Cretaceous) were thought to have been fast-swimming piscivores [1, 5-7]. We 
      report a new, highly unusual pliosaurid from the Early Cretaceous of Russia that 
      shows close convergence with the cranial structure of polycotylids: Luskhan
      itilensis gen. et sp. nov. Using novel cladistic and ecomorphological data, we
      show that pliosaurids iteratively evolved polycotylid-like cranial morphologies
      from the Early Jurassic until the Early Cretaceous. This underscores the
      ecological diversity of derived pliosaurids and reveals a more complex
      evolutionary history than their iconic representation as gigantic apex predators 
      of Mesozoic marine ecosystems suggests. Collectively, these data demonstrate an
      even higher degree of morphological plasticity and convergence in the evolution
      of plesiosaurs than previously thought and suggest the existence of an optimal
      ecomorphology for short-necked piscivorous plesiosaurs through time and across
      phylogeny.

TI  - Hec1 Tail Phosphorylation Differentially Regulates Mammalian Kinetochore Coupling
      to Polymerizing and Depolymerizing Microtubules.

AB  - The kinetochore links chromosomes to dynamic spindle microtubules and drives both
      chromosome congression and segregation. To do so, the kinetochore must hold on to
      depolymerizing and polymerizing microtubules. At metaphase, one sister
      kinetochore couples to depolymerizing microtubules, pulling its sister along
      polymerizing microtubules [1, 2]. Distinct kinetochore-microtubule interfaces
      mediate these behaviors: active interfaces transduce microtubule depolymerization
      into mechanical work, and passive interfaces generate friction as the kinetochore
      moves along microtubules [3, 4]. Despite a growing understanding of the molecular
      components that mediate kinetochore binding [5-7], we do not know how
      kinetochores physically interact with polymerizing versus depolymerizing
      microtubule bundles, and whether they use the same mechanisms and regulation to
      do so. To address this question, we focus on the mechanical role of the essential
      load-bearing protein Hec1 [8-11] in mammalian cells. Hec1's affinity for
      microtubules is regulated by Aurora B phosphorylation on its N-terminal tail
      [12-15], but its role at the interface with polymerizing versus depolymerizing
      microtubules remains unclear. Here we use laser ablation to trigger cellular
      pulling on mutant kinetochores and decouple sisters in vivo, and thereby
      separately probe Hec1's role on polymerizing versus depolymerizing microtubules. 
      We show that Hec1 tail phosphorylation tunes friction along polymerizing
      microtubules and yet does not compromise the kinetochore's ability to grip
      depolymerizing microtubules. Together, the data suggest that kinetochore
      regulation has differential effects on engagement with growing and shrinking
      microtubules. Through this mechanism, the kinetochore can modulate its grip on
      microtubules over mitosis and yet retain its ability to couple to microtubules
      powering chromosome movement.

AB  - The collapse of marine ecosystems during the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
      involved the base of the food chain [1] up to ubiquitous vertebrate apex
      predators [2-5]. Large marine reptiles became suddenly extinct at the
      Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, whereas other contemporaneous groups such
      as bothremydid turtles or dyrosaurid crocodylomorphs, although affected at the
      familial, genus, or species level, survived into post-crisis environments of the 
      Paleocene [5-9] and could have found refuge in freshwater habitats [10-12]. A
      recent hypothesis proposes that the extinction of plesiosaurians and mosasaurids 
      could have been caused by an important drop in sea level [13]. Mosasaurids are
      unusually diverse and locally abundant in the Maastrichtian phosphatic deposits
      of Morocco, and with large sharks and one species of elasmosaurid plesiosaurian
      recognized so far, contribute to an overabundance of apex predators [3, 7, 14,
      15]. For this reason, high local diversity of marine reptiles exhibiting
      different body masses and a wealth of tooth morphologies hints at complex trophic
      interactions within this latest Cretaceous marine ecosystem. Using calcium
      isotopes, we investigated the trophic structure of this extinct assemblage. Our
      results are consistent with a calcium isotope pattern observed in modern marine
      ecosystems and show that plesiosaurians and mosasaurids indiscriminately fall in 
      the tertiary piscivore group. This suggests that marine reptile apex predators
      relied onto a single dietary calcium source, compatible with the vulnerable
      wasp-waist food webs of the modern world [16]. This inferred peculiar ecosystem
      structure may help explain plesiosaurian and mosasaurid extinction following the 
      end-Cretaceous biological crisis.

AB  - Melanopsin photoreception enhances retinal responses to variations in ambient
      light (irradiance) and drives non-image-forming visual reflexes such as circadian
      entrainment [1-6]. Melanopsin signals also reach brain regions responsible for
      form vision [7-9], but melanopsin's contribution, if any, to encoding visual
      images remains unclear. We addressed this deficit using principles of receptor
      silent substitution to present images in which visibility for melanopsin versus
      rods+cones was independently modulated, and we recorded evoked responses in the
      mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN; thalamic relay for cortical
      vision). Approximately 20% of dLGN units responded to patterns visible only to
      melanopsin, revealing that melanopsin signals alone can convey spatial
      information. Spatial receptive fields (RFs) mapped using melanopsin-isolating
      stimuli had ON centers with diameters approximately 13 degrees . Melanopsin and
      rod+cone responses differed in the temporal domain, and responses to slow changes
      in radiance (<0.9 Hz) and stationary images were deficient when stimuli were
      rendered invisible for melanopsin. We employed these data to devise and test a
      mathematical model of melanopsin's involvement in form vision and applied it,
      along with further experimental recordings, to explore melanopsin signals under
      simulated active view of natural scenes. Our findings reveal that melanopsin
      enhances the thalamic representation of scenes containing local correlations in
      radiance, compensating for the high temporal frequency bias of cone vision and
      the negative correlation between magnitude and frequency for changes in direction
      of view. Together, these data reveal a distinct melanopsin contribution to
      encoding visual images, predicting that, under natural view, melanopsin augments 
      the early visual system's ability to encode patterns over moderate spatial
      scales.

TI  - The New Red Algal Subphylum Proteorhodophytina Comprises the Largest and Most
      Divergent Plastid Genomes Known.

AB  - Red algal plastid genomes are often considered ancestral and evolutionarily
      stable, and thus more closely resembling the last common ancestral plastid genome
      of all photosynthetic eukaryotes [1, 2]. However, sampling of red algal diversity
      is still quite limited (e.g., [2-5]). We aimed to remedy this problem. To this
      end, we sequenced six new plastid genomes from four undersampled and
      phylogenetically disparate red algal classes (Porphyridiophyceae,
      Stylonematophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae, and Rhodellophyceae) and discovered an
      unprecedented degree of genomic diversity among them. These genomes are rich in
      introns, enlarged intergenic regions, and transposable elements (in the
      rhodellophycean Bulboplastis apyrenoidosa), and include the largest and most
      intron-rich plastid genomes ever sequenced (that of the rhodellophycean
      Corynoplastis japonica; 1.13 Mbp). Sophisticated phylogenetic analyses accounting
      for compositional heterogeneity show that these four "basal" red algal classes
      form a larger monophyletic group, Proteorhodophytina subphylum nov., and
      confidently resolve the large-scale relationships in the Rhodophyta. Our analyses
      also suggest that secondary red plastids originated before the diversification of
      all mesophilic red algae. Our genomic survey has challenged the current
      paradigmatic view of red algal plastid genomes as "living fossils" [1, 2, 6] by
      revealing an astonishing degree of divergence in size, organization, and
      non-coding DNA content. A closer look at red algae shows that they comprise the
      most ancestral (e.g., [2, 7, 8]) as well as some of the most divergent plastid
      genomes known.

AB  - Recent climate change on the Antarctic Peninsula is well documented [1-5], with
      warming, alongside increases in precipitation, wind strength, and melt season
      length [1, 6, 7], driving environmental change [8, 9]. However, meteorological
      records mostly began in the 1950s, and paleoenvironmental datasets that provide a
      longer-term context to recent climate change are limited in number and often from
      single sites [7] and/or discontinuous in time [10, 11]. Here we use moss bank
      cores from a 600-km transect from Green Island (65.3 degrees S) to Elephant
      Island (61.1 degrees S) as paleoclimate archives sensitive to regional
      temperature change, moderated by water availability and surface microclimate [12,
      13]. Mosses grow slowly, but cold temperatures minimize decomposition,
      facilitating multi-proxy analysis of preserved peat [14]. Carbon isotope
      discrimination (Delta(13)C) in cellulose indicates the favorability of conditions
      for photosynthesis [15]. Testate amoebae are representative heterotrophs in
      peatlands [16-18], so their populations are an indicator of microbial
      productivity [14]. Moss growth and mass accumulation rates represent the balance 
      between growth and decomposition [19]. Analyzing these proxies in five cores at
      three sites over 150 years reveals increased biological activity over the past
      ca. 50 years, in response to climate change. We identified significant
      changepoints in all sites and proxies, suggesting fundamental and widespread
      changes in the terrestrial biosphere. The regional sensitivity of moss growth to 
      past temperature rises suggests that terrestrial ecosystems will alter rapidly
      under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of
      this iconic region-an Antarctic greening to parallel well-established
      observations in the Arctic [20].

AB  - Coordination of growth between individual organs and the whole body is essential 
      during development to produce adults with appropriate size and proportions [1,
      2]. How local organ-intrinsic signals and nutrient-dependent systemic factors are
      integrated to generate correctly proportioned organisms under different
      environmental conditions is poorly understood. In Drosophila, Hippo/Warts
      signaling functions intrinsically to regulate tissue growth and organ size [3,
      4], whereas systemic growth is controlled via antagonistic interactions of the
      steroid hormone ecdysone and nutrient-dependent insulin/insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF) (insulin) signaling [2, 5]. The interplay between insulin and
      ecdysone signaling regulates systemic growth and controls organismal size. Here, 
      we show that Warts (Wts; LATS1/2) signaling regulates systemic growth in
      Drosophila by activating basal ecdysone production, which negatively regulates
      body growth. Further, we provide evidence that Wts mediates effects of insulin
      and the neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) on regulation of ecdysone 
      production through Yorkie (Yki; YAP/TAZ) and the microRNA bantam (ban). Thus, Wts
      couples insulin signaling with ecdysone production to adjust systemic growth in
      response to nutritional conditions during development. Inhibition of Wts activity
      in the ecdysone-producing cells non-autonomously slows the growth of the
      developing imaginal-disc tissues while simultaneously leading to overgrowth of
      the animal. This indicates that ecdysone, while restricting overall body growth, 
      is limiting for growth of certain organs. Our data show that, in addition to its 
      well-known intrinsic role in restricting organ growth, Wts/Yki/ban signaling also
      controls growth systemically by regulating ecdysone production, a mechanism that 
      we propose controls growth between tissues and organismal size in response to
      nutrient availability.

AB  - Many insect species use multi-component sex pheromones to discriminate among
      potential mating partners [1-5]. In moths, pheromone blends tend to be dominated 
      by one or two major components, but behavioral responses are frequently optimized
      by the inclusion of less abundant minor components [6]. An increasing number of
      studies have shown that female insects use these chemicals to convey their mating
      availability to males, who can assess the maturity of females and thus decide
      when to mate [7, 8]. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms
      that enable males to assess female reproductive status. In this study, we found
      that females of Helicoverpa armigera avoid nonoptimal mating by inhibiting males 
      with pheromone antagonist cis-11-Hexadecenol (Z11-16:OH). We also show that this 
      antagonist-mediated optimization of mating time ensures maximum fecundity. To
      further investigate molecular aspects of this phenomenon, we used the CRISPR/Cas9
      system to knock out odorant receptor 16 (OR16), the only pheromone receptor tuned
      to Z11-16:OH. In mutant males, electrophysiological and behavioral responses to
      Z11-16:OH were abolished. Inability to detect Z11-16:OH prompted the males to
      mate with immature females, which resulted in significantly reduced viability of 
      eggs. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the sensitivity of OR16 to
      Z11-16:OH regulates optimal mating time and thus ensures maximum fecundity. These
      results may suggest novel strategies to disrupt pest insect mating.

AB  - Traversal of a complicated route is often facilitated by considering it as a set 
      of related sub-spaces. Such compartmentalization processes could occur within
      retrosplenial cortex, a structure whose neurons simultaneously encode position
      within routes and other spatial coordinate systems. Here, retrosplenial cortex
      neurons were recorded as rats traversed a track having recurrent structure at
      multiple scales. Consistent with a major role in compartmentalization of complex 
      routes, individual retrosplenial cortex (RSC) neurons exhibited periodic
      activation patterns that repeated across route segments having the same shape.
      Concurrently, a larger population of RSC neurons exhibited single-cycle
      periodicity over the full route, effectively defining a framework for encoding of
      sub-route positions relative to the whole. The same population simultaneously
      provides a novel metric for distance from each route position to all others.
      Together, the findings implicate retrosplenial cortex in the extraction of path
      sub-spaces, the encoding of their spatial relationships to each other, and path
      integration.

AB  - Half a century ago, MacArthur and Wilson proposed that the number of species on
      islands tends toward a dynamic equilibrium diversity around which species
      richness fluctuates [1]. The current prevailing view in island biogeography
      accepts the fundamentals of MacArthur and Wilson's theory [2] but questions
      whether their prediction of equilibrium can be fulfilled over evolutionary
      timescales, given the unpredictable and ever-changing nature of island geological
      and biotic features [3-7]. Here we conduct a complete molecular phylogenetic
      survey of the terrestrial bird species from four oceanic archipelagos that make
      up the diverse Macaronesian bioregion-the Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde,
      and Madeira [8, 9]. We estimate the times at which birds colonized and speciated 
      in the four archipelagos, including many previously unsampled endemic and
      non-endemic taxa and their closest continental relatives. We develop and fit a
      new multi-archipelago dynamic stochastic model to these data, explicitly
      incorporating information from 91 taxa, both extant and extinct. Remarkably, we
      find that all four archipelagos have independently achieved and maintained a
      dynamic equilibrium over millions of years. Biogeographical rates are homogeneous
      across archipelagos, except for the Canary Islands, which exhibit higher
      speciation and colonization. Our finding that the avian communities of the four
      Macaronesian archipelagos display an equilibrium diversity pattern indicates that
      a diversity plateau may be rapidly achieved on islands where rates of in situ
      radiation are low and extinction is high. This study reveals that equilibrium
      processes may be more prevalent than recently proposed, supporting MacArthur and 
      Wilson's 50-year-old theory.

AB  - "X-cells" have long been associated with tumor-like formations (xenomas) in
      marine fish, including many of commercial interest. The name was first used to
      refer to the large polygonal cells that were found in epidermal xenomas from
      flatfish from the Pacific Northwest [1]. Similar looking cells from
      pseudobranchial xenomas had previously been reported from cod in the Atlantic [2]
      and Pacific Oceans [3]. X-cell pathologies have been reported from five teleost
      orders: Pleuronectiformes (flatfish), Perciformes (perch-like fish), Gadiformes
      (cods), Siluriformes (catfish), and Salmoniformes (salmonids). Various
      explanations have been elicited for their etiology, including being adenomas or
      adenocarcinomas [4, 5], virally transformed fish cells [6-8], or products of
      coastal pollution [9, 10]. It was hypothesized that X-cells were protozoan
      parasites [1, 11-13], and although recent molecular analyses have confirmed this,
      they have failed to place them in any phylum [14-18], demonstrating weak
      phylogenetic associations with the haplosporidians [16] or the alveolates [15].
      Here, we sequenced rRNA genes from European and Japanese fish that are known to
      develop X-cell xenomas. We also generated a metagenomic sequence library from
      X-cell xenomas of blue whiting and Atlantic cod and assembled 63 X-cell
      protein-coding genes for a eukaryote-wide phylogenomic analysis. We show that
      X-cells group in two highly divergent clades, robustly sister to the bivalve
      parasite Perkinsus. We formally describe these as Gadixcellia and Xcellia and
      provide a phylogenetic context to catalyze future research. We also screened
      Atlantic cod populations for xenomas and residual pathologies and show that
      X-cell infections are more prevalent and widespread than previously known.

AB  - A direct retinal projection targets the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (an
      important hypothalamic control center). The accepted function of this projection 
      is to convey information about ambient light (irradiance) to synchronize the
      SCN's endogenous circadian clock with local time and drive the diurnal variations
      in physiology and behavior [1-4]. Here, we report that it also renders the SCN
      responsive to visual images. We map spatial receptive fields (RFs) for SCN
      neurons and find that only a minority are excited (or inhibited) by light from
      across the scene as expected for irradiance detectors. The most commonly
      encountered units have RFs with small excitatory centers, combined with very
      extensive inhibitory surrounds that reduce their sensitivity to global changes in
      light in favor of responses to spatial patterns. Other units have larger
      excitatory RF centers, but these always cover a coherent region of visual space, 
      implying visuotopic order at the single-unit level. Approximately 75% of
      light-responsive SCN units modulate their firing according to simple spatial
      patterns (drifting or inverting gratings) without changes in irradiance. The
      time-averaged firing rate of the SCN is modestly increased under these
      conditions, but including spatial contrast did not significantly alter the
      circadian phase resetting efficiency of light. Our data indicate that the SCN
      contains information about irradiance and spatial patterns. This newly
      appreciated sensory capacity provides a mechanism by which behavioral and
      physiological systems downstream of the SCN could respond to visual images [5].

AB  - The cyanobacterium Synechocystis relies on iron to perform oxygenic
      photosynthesis. This makes Synechocystis particularly sensitive to iron
      starvation. A new study shows that the small RNA IsaR1 is a major effector of the
      iron-stress response, remodeling the photosynthetic apparatus.

AB  - While wild goose populations wintering in North America and Europe are mostly
      flourishing by exploiting farmland, those in China (which seem confined to
      natural wetlands) are generally declining. Telemetry devices were attached to 67 
      wintering wild geese of five different species at three important wetlands in the
      Yangtze River Floodplain (YRF), China to determine habitat use. 50 individuals of
      three declining species were almost entirely diurnally confined to natural
      wetlands; 17 individuals from two species showing stable trends used wetlands 83%
      and 90% of the time, otherwise resorting to farmland. These results confirm
      earlier studies linking declines among Chinese wintering geese to natural habitat
      loss and degradation affecting food supply. These results also contribute to
      explaining the poor conservation status of Chinese wintering geese compared to
      the same and other goose species wintering in adjacent Korea and Japan, western
      Europe and North America, which feed almost entirely on agricultural land,
      liberating them from winter population limitation.

AB  - Invertebrate biomechanics focuses on mechanical analyses of non-vertebrate
      animals, which at root is no different in aim and technique from vertebrate
      biomechanics, or for that matter the biomechanics of plants and fungi. But
      invertebrates are special - they are fabulously diverse in form, habitat, and
      ecology and manage this without the use of hard, internal skeletons. They are
      also numerous and, in many cases, tractable in an experimental and field setting.
      In this Primer, we will probe three axes of invertebrate diversity: worms (Phylum
      Annelida), spiders (Class Arachnida) and insects (Class Insecta); three habitats:
      subterranean, terrestrial and airborne; and three integrations with other fields:
      ecology, engineering and evolution. Our goal is to capture the field of
      invertebrate biomechanics, which has blossomed from having a primary focus on
      discoveries at the interface of physics and biology to being inextricably linked 
      with integrative challenges that span biology, physics, mathematics and
      engineering.

AB  - The ability of the human brain to successively learn or perform two competing
      tasks constitutes a major challenge in daily function. Indeed, exposing the brain
      to two different competing memories within a short temporal offset can induce
      interference, resulting in deteriorated performance in at least one of the
      learned memories [1-4]. Although previous studies have investigated online
      interference and its effects on performance [5-13], whether the human brain can
      enable long-term prevention of future interference is unknown. To address this
      question, we utilized the memory reactivation-reconsolidation framework [2, 12]
      stemming from studies at the synaptic level [14-17], according to which
      reactivation of a memory enables its update. In a set of experiments, using the
      motor sequence learning task [18] we report that a unique pairing of reactivating
      the original memory (right hand) in synchrony with novel memory trials (left
      hand) prevented future interference between the two memories. Strikingly, these
      effects were long-term and observed a month following reactivation. Further
      experiments showed that preventing future interference was not due to practice
      per se, but rather specifically depended on a limited time window induced by
      reactivation of the original memory. These results suggest a mechanism according 
      to which memory reactivation enables long-term prevention of interference,
      possibly by creating an updated memory trace integrating original and novel
      memories during the reconsolidation time window. The opportunity to induce a
      long-term preventive effect on memories may enable the utilization of strategies 
      optimizing normal human learning, as well as recovery following neurological
      insults.

AB  - Binocular stereopsis is one of the primary cues for three-dimensional (3D) vision
      in species ranging from insects to primates. Understanding how the brain extracts
      depth from two different retinal images represents a tractable challenge in
      sensory neuroscience that has so far evaded full explanation. Central to current 
      thinking is the idea that the brain needs to identify matching features in the
      two retinal images (i.e., solving the "stereoscopic correspondence problem") so
      that the depth of objects in the world can be triangulated. Although intuitive,
      this approach fails to account for key physiological and perceptual observations.
      We show that formulating the problem to identify "correct matches" is suboptimal 
      and propose an alternative, based on optimal information encoding, that mixes
      disparity detection with "proscription": exploiting dissimilar features to
      provide evidence against unlikely interpretations. We demonstrate the role of
      these "what not" responses in a neural network optimized to extract depth in
      natural images. The network combines information for and against the likely depth
      structure of the viewed scene, naturally reproducing key characteristics of both 
      neural responses and perceptual interpretations. We capture the encoding and
      readout computations of the network in simple analytical form and derive a
      binocular likelihood model that provides a unified account of long-standing
      puzzles in 3D vision at the physiological and perceptual levels. We suggest that 
      marrying detection with proscription provides an effective coding strategy for
      sensory estimation that may be useful for diverse feature domains (e.g., motion) 
      and multisensory integration.

AB  - Nucleotides released from food sources into environmental water are supposed to
      act as feeding cues for many fish species. However, it remains unknown how fish
      can sensitively detect those nucleotides. Here we discover a novel olfactory
      mechanism for ATP sensing in zebrafish. Upon entering into the nostril, ATP is
      efficiently converted into adenosine through enzymatic reactions of two
      ecto-nucleotidases expressed in the olfactory epithelium. Adenosine subsequently 
      activates a small population of olfactory sensory neurons expressing a novel
      adenosine receptor A2c that is unique to fishes and amphibians. The information
      is then transmitted to a single glomerulus in the olfactory bulb and further to
      four regions in higher olfactory centers. These results provide conclusive
      evidence for a sophisticated enzyme-linked receptor mechanism underlying
      detection of ATP as a food-derived attractive odorant linking to foraging
      behavior that is crucial and common to aquatic lower vertebrates.

AB  - The experience of beauty is a pleasure, but common sense and philosophy suggest
      that feeling beauty differs from sensuous pleasures such as eating or sex.
      Immanuel Kant [1, 2] claimed that experiencing beauty requires thought but that
      sensuous pleasure can be enjoyed without thought and cannot be beautiful. These
      venerable hypotheses persist in models of aesthetic processing [3-7] but have
      never been tested. Here, participants continuously rated the pleasure felt from a
      nominally beautiful or non-beautiful stimulus and then judged whether they had
      experienced beauty. The stimuli, which engage various senses, included seeing
      images, tasting candy, and touching a teddy bear. The observer reported the
      feelings that the stimulus evoked. The time course of pleasure, across stimuli,
      is well-fit by a model with one free parameter: pleasure amplitude. Pleasure
      amplitude increases linearly with the feeling of beauty. To test Kant's claim of 
      a need for thought, we reduce cognitive capacity by adding a "two-back" task to
      distract the observer's thoughts. The distraction greatly reduces the beauty and 
      pleasure experienced from stimuli that otherwise produce strong pleasure and
      spares that of less-pleasant stimuli. We also find that strong pleasure is always
      beautiful, whether produced reliably by beautiful stimuli or just occasionally by
      sensuous stimuli. In sum, we confirm Kant's claim that only the pleasure
      associated with feeling beauty requires thought and disprove his claim that
      sensuous pleasures cannot be beautiful.

AB  - In mammalian females, germ cells remain arrested as primordial follicles.
      Resumption of meiosis is heralded by germinal vesicle breakdown, condensation of 
      chromosomes, and their eventual alignment on metaphase plates. At the first
      meiotic division, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome associated with Cdc20
      (APC/C(Cdc20)) activates separase and thereby destroys cohesion along chromosome 
      arms. Because cohesion around centromeres is protected by shugoshin-2, sister
      chromatids remain attached through centromeric/pericentromeric cohesin. We show
      here that, by promoting proteolysis of cyclins and Cdc25B at the germinal vesicle
      (GV) stage, APC/C associated with the Cdh1 protein (APC/C(Cdh1)) delays the
      increase in Cdk1 activity, leading to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). More
      surprisingly, by moderating the rate at which Cdk1 is activated following GVBD,
      APC/C(Cdh1) creates conditions necessary for the removal of shugoshin-2 from
      chromosome arms by the Aurora B/C kinase, an event crucial for the efficient
      resolution of chiasmata.

AB  - Navigation, finding food sources, and avoiding danger critically depend on the
      identification and spatial localization of airborne chemicals. When monitoring
      the olfactory environment, rodents spontaneously engage in active olfactory
      sampling behavior, also referred to as exploratory sniffing [1]. Exploratory
      sniffing is characterized by stereotypical high-frequency respiration, which is
      also reliably evoked by novel odorant stimuli [2, 3]. To study novelty-induced
      exploratory sniffing, we developed a novel, non-contact method for measuring
      respiration by infrared (IR) thermography in a behavioral paradigm in which novel
      and familiar stimuli are presented to head-restrained mice. We validated the
      method by simultaneously performing nasal pressure measurements, a commonly used 
      invasive approach [2, 4], and confirmed highly reliable detection of inhalation
      onsets. We further discovered that mice actively orient their nostrils toward
      novel, previously unexperienced, smells. In line with the remarkable speed of
      olfactory processing reported previously [3, 5, 6], we find that mice initiate
      their response already within the first sniff after odor onset. Moreover,
      transecting the anterior commissure (AC) disrupted orienting, indicating that the
      orienting response requires interhemispheric transfer of information. This
      suggests that mice compare odorant information obtained from the two bilaterally 
      symmetric nostrils to locate the source of the novel odorant. We further
      demonstrate that asymmetric activation of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is
      both necessary and sufficient for eliciting orienting responses. These findings
      support the view that the AON plays an important role in the internostril
      difference comparison underlying rapid odor source localization.

TI  - RPL10L Is Required for Male Meiotic Division by Compensating for RPL10 during
      Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation in Mice.

AB  - The mammalian sex chromosomes have undergone profound changes during their
      evolution from an ancestral pair of autosomes [1-4]. Specifically, the X
      chromosome has acquired a paradoxical sex-biased function by redistributing gene 
      contents [5, 6] and has generated a disproportionately high number of retrogenes 
      that are located on autosomes and exhibit male-biased expression patterns [6].
      Several selection-based models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon,
      including a model of sexual antagonism driving X inactivation (SAXI) [6-8] and a 
      compensatory mechanism based on meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) [6,
      8-11]. However, experimental evidence correlating the function of
      X-chromosome-derived autosomal retrogenes with evolutionary forces remains
      limited [12-17]. Here, we show that the deficiency of Rpl10l, a murine autosomal 
      retrogene of Rpl10 with testis-specific expression, disturbs ribosome biogenesis 
      in late-prophase spermatocytes and prohibits the transition from prophase into
      metaphase of the first meiotic division, resulting in male infertility. Rpl10l
      expression compensates for the lack of Rpl10, which exhibits a broad expression
      pattern but is subject to MSCI during spermatogenesis. Importantly, ectopic
      expression of RPL10L prevents the death of cultured RPL10-deficient somatic
      cells, and Rpl10l-promoter-driven transgenic expression of Rpl10 in spermatocytes
      restores spermatogenesis and fertility in Rpl10l-deficient mice. Our results
      demonstrate that Rpl10l plays an essential role during the meiotic stage of
      spermatogenesis by compensating for MSCI-mediated transcriptional silencing of
      Rpl10. These data provide direct evidence for the compensatory hypothesis and add
      novel insight into the evolution of X-chromosome-derived autosomal retrogenes and
      their role in male fertility.

AB  - Neuronal stem cell lineages are the fundamental developmental units of the brain,
      and neuronal circuits are the fundamental functional units of the brain.
      Determining lineage-circuitry relationships is essential for deciphering the
      developmental logic of circuit assembly. While the spatial distribution of
      lineage-related neurons has been investigated in a few brain regions [1-9], an
      important, but unaddressed question is whether temporal information that
      diversifies neuronal progeny within a single lineage also impacts circuit
      assembly. Circuits in the sensorimotor system (e.g., spinal cord) are thought to 
      be assembled sequentially [10-14], making this an ideal brain region for
      investigating the circuit-level impact of temporal patterning within a lineage.
      Here, we use intersectional genetics, optogenetics, high-throughput behavioral
      analysis, single-neuron labeling, connectomics, and calcium imaging to determine 
      how a set of bona fide lineage-related interneurons contribute to sensorimotor
      circuitry in the Drosophila larva. We show that Even-skipped lateral interneurons
      (ELs) are sensory processing interneurons. Late-born ELs contribute to a
      proprioceptive body posture circuit, whereas early-born ELs contribute to a
      mechanosensitive escape circuit. These data support a model in which a single
      neuronal stem cell can produce a large number of interneurons with similar
      functional capacity that are distributed into different circuits based on birth
      timing. In summary, these data establish a link between temporal specification of
      neuronal identity and circuit assembly at the single-cell level.

AB  - Although combined molecular and morphological analyses point to a late middle
      Eocene (38-39 million years ago) origin for the clade Neoceti (Odontoceti,
      echolocating toothed whales plus Mysticeti, baleen whales, and relatives), the
      oldest known mysticete fossil dates from the latest Eocene (about 34 million
      years ago) of Antarctica [1, 2]. Considering that the latter is not the most
      stemward mysticete in recent phylogenies and that Oligocene toothed mysticetes
      display a broad morphological disparity most likely corresponding to contrasted
      ecological niches, the origin of mysticetes from a basilosaurid ancestor and its 
      drivers are currently poorly understood [1, 3-8]. Based on an articulated
      cetacean skeleton from the early late Eocene (Priabonian, around 36.4 million
      years ago) of the Pisco Basin, Peru, we describe a new archaic tooth-bearing
      mysticete, Mystacodon selenensis gen. et sp. nov. Being the geologically oldest
      neocete (crown group cetacean) and the earliest mysticete to branch off described
      so far, the new taxon is interpreted as morphologically intermediate between
      basilosaurids and later toothed mysticetes, providing thus crucial information
      about the anatomy of the skull, forelimb, and innominate at these critical
      initial stages of mysticete evolution. Major changes in the morphology of the
      oral apparatus (including tooth wear) and flipper compared to basilosaurids
      suggest that suction and possibly benthic feeding represented key, early
      ecological traits accompanying the emergence of modern filter-feeding baleen
      whales' ancestors.

AB  - Proper cell size is essential for cellular function. Nonetheless, despite more
      than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell-size
      homeostasis are largely mysterious [1]. Cells in growing populations maintain
      cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial
      and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains
      population-level variation in cell size within a certain range and returns the
      population average to that range if it is perturbed [1, 2]. Recent work has
      proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been
      proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S
      transition [3], whereas bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a
      fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable
      average [4-6]. Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size-dependent
      expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. cdc25 transcript levels are regulated 
      such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25,
      creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cells grow and providing a
      mechanism for cells to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold
      concentration of Cdc25. Because regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well
      conserved, this mechanism may provide a widespread solution to the problem of
      size control in eukaryotes.

AB  - Neuronal oscillations comprise a fundamental mechanism by which distant neural
      structures establish and express functional connectivity. Long-range functional
      connectivity between the hippocampus and other forebrain structures is enabled by
      theta oscillations. Here, we show for the first time that the infant rat red
      nucleus (RN)-a brainstem sensorimotor structure-exhibits theta (4-7 Hz)
      oscillations restricted primarily to periods of active (REM) sleep. At postnatal 
      day 8 (P8), theta is expressed as brief bursts immediately following myoclonic
      twitches; by P12, theta oscillations are expressed continuously across bouts of
      active sleep. Simultaneous recordings from the hippocampus and RN at P12 show
      that theta oscillations in both structures are coherent, co-modulated, and
      mutually interactive during active sleep. Critically, at P12, inactivation of the
      medial septum eliminates theta in both structures. The developmental emergence of
      theta-dependent functional coupling between the hippocampus and RN parallels that
      between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, disruptions in the
      early expression of theta could underlie the cognitive and sensorimotor deficits 
      associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.

TI  - Acclimation of Oxygenic Photosynthesis to Iron Starvation Is Controlled by the

AB  - Oxygenic photosynthesis crucially depends on proteins that possess Fe(2+) or Fe/S
      complexes as co-factors or prosthetic groups. Here, we show that the small
      regulatory RNA (sRNA) IsaR1 (Iron-Stress-Activated RNA 1) plays a pivotal role in
      acclimation to low-iron conditions. The IsaR1 regulon consists of more than 15
      direct targets, including Fe(2+)-containing proteins involved in photosynthetic
      electron transfer, detoxification of anion radicals, citrate cycle, and
      tetrapyrrole biogenesis. IsaR1 is essential for maintaining physiological levels 
      of Fe/S cluster biogenesis proteins during iron deprivation. Consequently, IsaR1 
      affects the acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus to iron starvation at
      three levels: (1) directly, via posttranscriptional repression of gene
      expression; (2) indirectly, via suppression of pigment; and (3) Fe/S cluster
      biosynthesis. Homologs of IsaR1 are widely conserved throughout the
      cyanobacterial phylum. We conclude that IsaR1 is a critically important
      riboregulator. These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the
      regulation of iron homeostasis in photosynthetic organisms.

AB  - Skin vibrations sensed by tactile receptors contribute significantly to the
      perception of object properties during tactile exploration [1-4] and to
      sensorimotor control during object manipulation [5]. Sustained low-frequency skin
      vibration (<60 Hz) evokes a distinct tactile sensation referred to as flutter
      whose frequency can be clearly perceived [6]. How afferent spiking activity
      translates into the perception of frequency is still unknown. Measures based on
      mean spike rates of neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex are sufficient to
      explain performance in some frequency discrimination tasks [7-11]; however, there
      is emerging evidence that stimuli can be distinguished based also on temporal
      features of neural activity [12, 13]. Our study's advance is to demonstrate that 
      temporal features are fundamental for vibrotactile frequency perception.
      Pulsatile mechanical stimuli were used to elicit specified temporal spike train
      patterns in tactile afferents, and subsequently psychophysical methods were
      employed to characterize human frequency perception. Remarkably, the most salient
      temporal feature determining vibrotactile frequency was not the underlying
      periodicity but, rather, the duration of the silent gap between successive bursts
      of neural activity. This burst gap code for frequency represents a previously
      unknown form of neural coding in the tactile sensory system, which parallels
      auditory pitch perception mechanisms based on purely temporal information where
      longer inter-pulse intervals receive higher perceptual weights than short
      intervals [14]. Our study also demonstrates that human perception of stimuli can 
      be determined exclusively by temporal features of spike trains independent of the
      mean spike rate and without contribution from population response factors.

AB  - The spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) protein complex is required for
      accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis [1-6] and consists of two copies
      each of Ska1, Ska2, and Ska3 proteins [4, 7]. The Ska complex contains multiple
      microtubule-binding elements and promotes kinetochore-microtubule attachment
      [8-11]. The Ska1 C-terminal domain (CTD) recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to 
      kinetochores to promote timely anaphase onset [12]. The Ska complex regulates,
      and is regulated by, Aurora B [13]. Aurora B phosphorylates both Ska1 and Ska3 to
      inhibit the kinetochore localization of the Ska complex [14]. Despite its
      multitude of functions at kinetochores, how the Ska complex itself is recruited
      to kinetochores is unclear. It is unknown whether any mitotic kinases positively 
      regulate the localization of the Ska complex to kinetochores. Here, we show that 
      Cdk1 phosphorylates Ska3 to promote its direct binding to the Ndc80 complex
      (Ndc80C), a core outer kinetochore component. We also show that this
      phosphorylation occurs specifically during mitosis and is required for the
      kinetochore localization of the Ska complex. Ska3 mutants deficient in Cdk1
      phosphorylation are defective in kinetochore localization but retain microtubule 
      localization. These mutants support chromosome alignment but delay anaphase
      onset. We propose that Ska3 phosphorylated by Cdk1 in mitosis binds to Ndc80C and
      recruits the Ska complex to kinetochores where Ska1 can bind both PP1 and
      microtubules to promote anaphase onset.

AB  - Cytoplasmic dynein-2 powers retrograde intraflagellar transport that is essential
      for cilium formation and maintenance. Inactivation of dynein-2 by mutations in
      DYNC2H1 causes skeletal dysplasias, and it remains unclear how the dynein-2 heavy
      chain moves in cilia. Here, using the genome-editing technique to produce
      fluorescent dynein-2 heavy chain in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show by
      high-resolution live microscopy that dynein-2 moves in a surprising way along
      distinct ciliary domains. Dynein-2 shows triphasic movement in the retrograde
      direction: dynein-2 accelerates in the ciliary distal region and then moves at
      maximum velocity and finally decelerates adjacent to the base, which may
      represent a physical obstacle due to transition zone barriers. By knocking the
      conserved ciliopathy-related mutations into the C. elegans dynein-2 heavy chain, 
      we find that these mutations reduce its transport speed and frequency. Disruption
      of the dynein-2 tail domain, light intermediate chain, or intraflagellar
      transport (IFT)-B complex abolishes dynein-2's ciliary localization, revealing
      their important roles in ciliary entry of dynein-2. Furthermore, our affinity
      purification and genetic analyses show that IFT-A subunits IFT-139 and IFT-43
      function redundantly to promote dynein-2 motility. These results reveal the
      molecular regulation of dynein-2 movement in sensory cilia.

AB  - Interacting with the natural environment leads to complex stimulations of our
      senses. Here we focus on the estimation of visual speed, a critical source of
      information for the survival of many animal species as they monitor moving prey
      or approaching dangers. In mammals, and in particular in primates, speed
      information is conceived to be represented by a set of channels sensitive to
      different spatial and temporal characteristics of the optic flow [1-5]. However, 
      it is still largely unknown how the brain accurately infers the speed of complex 
      natural scenes from this set of spatiotemporal channels [6-14]. As complex
      stimuli, we chose a set of well-controlled moving naturalistic textures called
      "compound motion clouds" (CMCs) [15, 16] that simultaneously activate multiple
      spatiotemporal channels. We found that CMC stimuli that have the same physical
      speed are perceived moving at different speeds depending on which channel
      combinations are activated. We developed a computational model demonstrating that
      the activity in a given channel is both boosted and weakened after a systematic
      pattern over neighboring channels. This pattern of interactions can be understood
      as a combination of two components oriented in speed (consistent with a
      slow-speed prior) and scale (sharpening of similar features). Interestingly, the 
      interaction along scale implements a lateral inhibition mechanism, a canonical
      principle that hitherto was found to operate mainly in early sensory processing. 
      Overall, the speed-scale normalization mechanism may reflect the natural tendency
      of the visual system to integrate complex inputs into one coherent percept.

AB  - A common feature of sex chromosomes is coordinated regulation of X-linked genes
      in one sex. Drosophila melanogaster males have one X chromosome, whereas females 
      have two. The resulting imbalance in gene dosage is corrected by increased
      expression from the single X chromosome of males, a process known as dosage
      compensation. In flies, compensation involves recruitment of the male-specific
      lethal (MSL) complex to X-linked genes and modification of chromatin to increase 
      expression. The extraordinary selectivity of the MSL complex for the X chromosome
      has never been explained. We previously demonstrated that the small interfering
      RNA (siRNA) pathway and siRNA from a family of X-linked satellite repeats
      (1.688(X) repeats) promote X recognition. Now, we test the ability of 1.688(X)
      DNA to attract compensation to genes nearby and report that autosomal integration
      of 1.688(X) repeats increases MSL recruitment and gene expression in surrounding 
      regions. Placement of 1.688(X) repeats opposite a lethal autosomal deletion
      achieves partial rescue of males, demonstrating functional compensation of
      autosomal chromatin. Females block formation of the MSL complex and are not
      rescued. The 1.688(X) repeats are therefore cis-acting elements that guide dosage
      compensation. Furthermore, 1.688(X) siRNA enhances rescue of males with a lethal 
      deletion but only when repeat DNA is present on the intact homolog. We propose
      that the siRNA pathway promotes X recognition by enhancing the ability of
      1.688(X) DNA to attract compensation in cis. The dense and near-exclusive
      distribution of 1.688(X) sequences along the X chromosome suggests that they play
      a primary role in determining X identity during dosage compensation.

AB  - Certain visual images, even in the absence of motion or flicker, can trigger
      seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. As of yet, there is no
      systematic explanation as to why some static images are likely to provoke
      seizures, while others pose little or no risk. Here, we examined the
      neurophysiology literature to assess whether the pattern of neural responses in
      healthy visual cortex is predictive of the pathological responses in
      photosensitive epilepsy. Previous studies have suggested that gamma oscillations 
      (30-80 Hz) measured in human visual cortex may play a role in seizure generation 
      [1,2]. Recently, we and others have shown that increases in gamma band power can 
      come from two very different cortical signals, one that is oscillatory (with a
      narrow peak between 30 Hz and 80 Hz), and another that is broadband[3]. The
      oscillatory signal arises from neuronal synchrony in the local population, while 
      the broadband signal reflects the level of asynchronous neuronal activity, and is
      correlated with multiunit spiking [4]. These two responses have different
      biological origins and different selectivity for image properties. Here, we
      followed up on the previous proposals [1,2] to ask whether the image features
      that increase seizure likelihood in photosensitive epilepsy are linked to
      narrowband gamma oscillations specifically, or are associated with any kind of
      increase in visual activity. Based on published work, we compared pairs of image 
      classes on a number of dimensions, and show that the type of image that elicits
      larger narrowband gamma oscillations in healthy visual cortex is also more likely
      to provoke seizures or pre-seizure activity in patients with photosensitive
      epilepsy. In contrast, images that elicit larger broadband, multiunit, or fMRI
      responses are much less predictive of seizure activity. We propose that a risk
      factor for seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy is engagement of the
      circuitry that produces gamma oscillations.

AB  - Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) enable us to study the history of
      organismal evolution and diversification. PCMs comprise a collection of
      statistical methods for inferring history from piecemeal information, primarily
      combining two types of data: first, an estimate of species relatedness, usually
      based on their genes, and second, contemporary trait values of extant organisms. 
      Some PCMs also incorporate information from geological records, especially
      fossils, but also other gradual and episodic events in the Earth's history (for
      example, trait data from fossils or the global oxygen concentration as an
      independent variable). It is important to note at the outset that PCMs are not
      concerned with reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among species; this 
      has to do with estimating the phylogeny from genetic, fossil and other data, and 
      a separate set of methods for this process makes up the field of phylogenetics.
      PCMs as a set of methods are distinct from, but are not completely independent
      of, phylogenetics. PCMs are used to address the questions: how did the
      characteristics of organisms evolve through time and what factors influenced
      speciation and extinction?

AB  - In senses as diverse as vision, hearing, touch, and the electrosense, sensory
      neurons receive bottom-up input from the environment, as well as top-down input
      from feedback loops involving higher brain regions [1-4]. Through connectivity
      with local inhibitory interneurons, these feedback loops can exert both positive 
      and negative control over fundamental aspects of neural coding, including
      bursting [5, 6] and synchronous population activity [7, 8]. Here we show that a
      prominent midbrain feedback loop synthesizes a neural code for motion reversal in
      the hindbrain electrosensory ON- and OFF-type pyramidal cells. This top-down
      mechanism generates an accurate bidirectional encoding of object position,
      despite the inability of the electrosensory afferents to generate a consistent
      bottom-up representation [9, 10]. The net positive activity of this midbrain
      feedback is additionally regulated through a hindbrain feedback loop, which
      reduces stimulus-induced bursting and also dampens the ON and OFF cell responses 
      to interfering sensory input [11]. We demonstrate that synthesis of motion
      representations and cancellation of distracting signals are mediated
      simultaneously by feedback, satisfying an accepted definition of spatial
      attention [12]. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory feedback establishes a
      "focal" distance for optimized neural coding, whose connection to a classic
      motion-tracking behavior provides new insight into the computational roles of
      feedback and active dendrites in spatial localization [13, 14].

AB  - Navigation of cells along gradients of guidance cues is a determining step in
      many developmental and immunological processes. Gradients can either be soluble
      or immobilized to tissues as demonstrated for the haptotactic migration of
      dendritic cells (DCs) toward higher concentrations of immobilized chemokine
      CCL21. To elucidate how gradient characteristics govern cellular response
      patterns, we here introduce an in vitro system allowing to track migratory
      responses of DCs to precisely controlled immobilized gradients of CCL21. We find 
      that haptotactic sensing depends on the absolute CCL21 concentration and local
      steepness of the gradient, consistent with a scenario where DC directionality is 
      governed by the signal-to-noise ratio of CCL21 binding to the receptor CCR7. We
      find that the conditions for optimal DC guidance are perfectly provided by the
      CCL21 gradients we measure in vivo. Furthermore, we find that CCR7 signal
      termination by the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) is crucial for
      haptotactic but dispensable for chemotactic CCL21 gradient sensing in vitro and
      confirm those observations in vivo. These findings suggest that stable,
      tissue-bound CCL21 gradients as sustainable "roads" ensure optimal guidance in
      vivo.

AB  - Convergent adaptive evolution of species' ecological niches-i.e., the appearance 
      of similar niches in independent lineages-is the result of natural selection
      acting on niche-related species traits ("traits" hereafter) and contrasts with
      neutral evolution [1-4]. Although trait convergences are recognized as being of
      importance at the species scale, we still know little about the impact of species
      convergence on the overall trait and niche structure of entire biotas at large
      spatial scales [5]. Here, we map the convergent evolution of four traits (diet,
      body mass, activity cycle, and foraging strata) for mammal species and
      assemblages (defined at 200 x 200 km resolution) at a global scale. Using data on
      the geographic distributions, traits, and phylogenetic relationships of species
      and by comparing observed patterns of trait beta-diversity to evolutionary
      neutral expectations, we show that trait convergence is not restricted to
      particular lineages but scales up to entire assemblages (i.e., whole species
      communities). We find region-wide biota convergence in traits between regions
      with similar climates, particularly between Australia and other continents. Pairs
      of assemblages that show trait divergence often involves Arctic regions where
      rapid evolutionary changes occurred in response to extreme climatic constraints. 
      By integrating both macroecological and macroevolutionary approaches into a
      single framework, our study quantifies the crucial role of evolutionary processes
      such as natural selection in the spatial distribution and structure of
      large-scale species assemblages.

AB  - Throughout animals, embryonic cells must ultimately organize into polarized
      epithelial layers that provide the structural basis for gastrulation or
      subsequent developmental events [1]. Precisely how this primary epithelium
      maintains continuous integrity during rapid and repeated cell divisions has never
      been directly addressed, particularly in cases where early cleavages are driven
      in synchrony. Representing the early-branching non-bilaterian phylum Cnidaria,
      embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis undergo rapid synchronous cell 
      divisions and ultimately give rise to a diploblastic epithelial body plan after
      gastrulation [2, 3]. Here, using live imaging of apical polarity proteins in
      Nematostella embryos, we demonstrate that cell polarity is established by the
      four-cell stage and then reiteratively lost during subsequent mitoses,
      correlating with transient adhesion disengagement and dramatic deformations of
      embryonic morphology. Intriguingly, the re-establishment of polarity and adhesion
      during each interphase is associated with a process of whole-embryo compaction
      analogous to that observed in mammals [4-7]. Because similar protein dynamics are
      observed in dividing epithelial cells in Drosophila melanogaster, we propose that
      cell-cycle-coupled oscillations in apical polarity may be conserved throughout
      Metazoa.

AB  - The human brain has evolved for group living [1]. Yet we know so little about how
      it supports dynamic group interactions that the study of real-world social
      exchanges has been dubbed the "dark matter of social neuroscience" [2]. Recently,
      various studies have begun to approach this question by comparing brain responses
      of multiple individuals during a variety of (semi-naturalistic) tasks [3-15].
      These experiments reveal how stimulus properties [13], individual differences
      [14], and contextual factors [15] may underpin similarities and differences in
      neural activity across people. However, most studies to date suffer from various 
      limitations: they often lack direct face-to-face interaction between
      participants, are typically limited to dyads, do not investigate social dynamics 
      across time, and, crucially, they rarely study social behavior under naturalistic
      circumstances. Here we extend such experimentation drastically, beyond dyads and 
      beyond laboratory walls, to identify neural markers of group engagement during
      dynamic real-world group interactions. We used portable electroencephalogram
      (EEG) to simultaneously record brain activity from a class of 12 high school
      students over the course of a semester (11 classes) during regular classroom
      activities (Figures 1A-1C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1). A
      novel analysis technique to assess group-based neural coherence demonstrates that
      the extent to which brain activity is synchronized across students predicts both 
      student class engagement and social dynamics. This suggests that brain-to-brain
      synchrony is a possible neural marker for dynamic social interactions, likely
      driven by shared attention mechanisms. This study validates a promising new
      method to investigate the neuroscience of group interactions in ecologically
      natural settings.

AB  - Elongation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is thought to be an important mechanism 
      for regulating gene expression [1]. We measured the first wave of de novo
      transcription in living Drosophila embryos using dual-fluorescence detection of
      nascent transcripts containing 5' MS2 and 3' PP7 RNA stem loops. Pol II
      elongation rates of 2.4-3.0 kb/min were observed, approximately twice as fast as 
      earlier estimates [2-6]. The revised rates permit substantial levels of zygotic
      gene activity prior to the mid-blastula transition. We also provide evidence that
      variable rates of elongation are not a significant source of differential gene
      activity, suggesting that transcription initiation and Pol II release are the key
      determinants of gene control in development.

AB  - Marine group II Euryarchaeota (MG-II) are among the most abundant microbes in
      oceanic surface waters [1-4]. So far, however, representatives of MG-II have not 
      been cultivated, and no viruses infecting these organisms have been described.
      Here, we present complete genomes for three distinct groups of viruses assembled 
      from metagenomic sequence datasets highly enriched for MG-II. These novel
      viruses, which we denote magroviruses, possess double-stranded DNA genomes of 65 
      to 100 kilobases in size that encode a structural module characteristic of
      head-tailed viruses and, unusually for archaeal and bacterial viruses, a nearly
      complete replication apparatus of apparent archaeal origin. The newly identified 
      magroviruses are widespread and abundant and therefore are likely to be major
      ecological agents.

AB  - A fundamental question in neurobiology is how animals integrate external sensory 
      information from their environment with self-generated motor and sensory signals 
      in order to guide motor behavior and adaptation. The cerebellum is a vertebrate
      hindbrain region where all of these signals converge and that has been implicated
      in the acquisition, coordination, and calibration of motor activity. Theories of 
      cerebellar function postulate that granule cells encode a variety of sensorimotor
      signals in the cerebellar input layer. These models suggest that representations 
      should be high-dimensional, sparse, and temporally patterned. However, in vivo
      physiological recordings addressing these points have been limited and in
      particular have been unable to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of
      population-wide activity. In this study, we use both calcium imaging and
      electrophysiology in the awake larval zebrafish to investigate how cerebellar
      granule cells encode three types of sensory stimuli as well as stimulus-evoked
      motor behaviors. We find that a large fraction of all granule cells are active in
      response to these stimuli, such that representations are not sparse at the
      population level. We find instead that most responses belong to only one of a
      small number of distinct activity profiles, which are temporally homogeneous and 
      anatomically clustered. We furthermore identify granule cells that are active
      during swimming behaviors and others that are multimodal for sensory and motor
      variables. When we pharmacologically change the threshold of a stimulus-evoked
      behavior, we observe correlated changes in these representations. Finally,
      electrophysiological data show no evidence for temporal patterning in the coding 
      of different stimulus durations.

AB  - During early cardiogenesis, bilateral fields of mesenchymal heart progenitor
      cells (HPCs) move from the anterior lateral plate mesoderm to the ventral
      midline, undergoing a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) en route to
      forming a single epithelial sheet. Through tracking of tissue-level deformations 
      in the heart-forming region (HFR) as well as movement trajectories and traction
      generation of individual HPCs, we find that the onset of MET correlates with a
      peak in mechanical stress within the HFR and changes in HPC migratory behaviors. 
      Small-molecule inhibitors targeting actomyosin contractility reveal a temporally 
      specific requirement of bulk tissue compliance to regulate heart development and 
      MET. Targeting mutant constructs to modulate contractility and compliance in the 
      underlying endoderm, we find that MET in HPCs can be accelerated in response to
      microenvironmental stiffening and can be inhibited by softening. To test whether 
      MET in HPCs was responsive to purely physical mechanical cues, we mimicked a
      high-stress state by injecting an inert oil droplet to generate high strain in
      the HFR, demonstrating that exogenously applied stress was sufficient to drive
      MET. MET-induced defects in anatomy result in defined functional lesions in the
      larval heart, implicating mechanical signaling and MET in the etiology of
      congenital heart defects. From this integrated analysis of HPC polarity and
      mechanics, we propose that normal heart development requires bilateral HPCs to
      undergo a critical behavioral and phenotypic transition on their way to the
      ventral midline, and that this transition is driven in response to the changing
      mechanical properties of their endoderm substrate.

AB  - Much evidence indicates that humans and other species process large-scale visual 
      information before fine spatial detail. Neurophysiological data obtained with
      paralyzed eyes suggest that this coarse-to-fine sequence results from
      spatiotemporal filtering by neurons in the early visual pathway. However, the
      eyes are normally never stationary: rapid gaze shifts (saccades) incessantly
      alternate with slow fixational movements. To investigate the consequences of this
      oculomotor cycle on the dynamics of perception, we combined spectral analysis of 
      visual input signals, neural modeling, and gaze-contingent control of retinal
      stimulation in humans. We show that the saccade/fixation cycle reformats the flow
      impinging on the retina in a way that initiates coarse-to-fine processing at each
      fixation. This finding reveals that the visual system uses oculomotor-induced
      temporal modulations to sequentially encode different spatial components and
      suggests that, rather than initiating coarse-to-fine processing, spatiotemporal
      coupling in the early visual pathway builds on the information dynamics of the
      oculomotor cycle.

      One-Handers.

AB  - Individuals born without one hand (congenital one-handers) provide a unique model
      for understanding the relationship between focal reorganization in the
      sensorimotor cortex and everyday behavior. We previously reported that the
      missing hand's territory of one-handers becomes utilized by its cortical neighbor
      (residual arm representation), depending on residual arm usage in daily life to
      substitute for the missing hand's function [1, 2]. However, the repertoire of
      compensatory behaviors may involve utilization of other body parts that do not
      cortically neighbor the hand territory. Accordingly, the pattern of brain
      reorganization may be more extensive [3]. Here we studied unconstrained
      compensatory strategies under ecological conditions in one-handers, as well as
      changes in activation, connectivity, and neurochemical profile in their missing
      hand's cortical territory. We found that compensatory behaviors in one-handers
      involved multiple body parts (residual arm, lips, and feet). This diversified
      compensatory profile was associated with large-scale cortical reorganization,
      regardless of cortical proximity to the hand territory. Representations of those 
      body parts used to substitute hand function all mapped onto the cortical
      territory of the missing hand, as evidenced by task-based and resting-state fMRI.
      The missing-hand territory also exhibited reduced GABA levels, suggesting a
      reduction in connectional selectivity to enable the expression of diverse
      cortical inputs. Because the same body parts used for compensatory purposes are
      those showing increased representation in the missing hand's territory, we
      suggest that the typical hand territory may not necessarily represent the hand
      per se, but rather any other body part that shares the functionality of the
      missing hand [4].

AB  - People often forget information because they fail to effectively encode it. Here,
      we test the hypothesis that targeted electrical stimulation can modulate neural
      encoding states and subsequent memory outcomes. Using recordings from
      neurosurgical epilepsy patients with intracranially implanted electrodes, we
      trained multivariate classifiers to discriminate spectral activity during
      learning that predicted remembering from forgetting, then decoded neural activity
      in later sessions in which we applied stimulation during learning. Stimulation
      increased encoding-state estimates and recall if delivered when the classifier
      indicated low encoding efficiency but had the reverse effect if stimulation was
      delivered when the classifier indicated high encoding efficiency. Higher
      encoding-state estimates from stimulation were associated with greater evidence
      of neural activity linked to contextual memory encoding. In identifying the
      conditions under which stimulation modulates memory, the data suggest strategies 
      for therapeutically treating memory dysfunction.

AB  - More than 87% of flowering plant species are animal-pollinated [1] and produce
      floral scents and other signals to attract pollinators. These floral cues may
      however also attract antagonistic visitors, including herbivores [2]. The dilemma
      is exacerbated when adult insects pollinate the same plant that their larvae
      consume. It remains largely unclear how plants maximize their fitness under these
      circumstances. Here we show that in the night-flowering wild tobacco Nicotiana
      attenuata, the emission of a sesquiterpene, (E)-alpha-bergamotene, in flowers
      increases adult Manduca sexta moth-mediated pollination success, while the same
      compound in leaves is known to mediate indirect defense against M. sexta larvae
      [3, 4]. Forward and reverse genetic analyses demonstrated that both
      herbivory-induced and floral (E)-alpha-bergamotene are regulated by the
      expression of a monoterpene-synthase-derived sesquiterpene synthase (NaTPS38).
      The expression pattern of NaTPS38 also accounts for variation in
      (E)-alpha-bergamotene emission among natural accessions. These results highlight 
      that differential expression of a single gene that results in tissue-specific
      emission of one compound contributes to resolving the dilemma for plants when
      their pollinators are also herbivores. Furthermore, this study provides genetic
      evidence that pollinators and herbivores interactively shape the evolution of
      floral signals and plant defense.

AB  - Building a sizable, complex brain requires both cellular expansion and
      diversification. One mechanism to achieve these goals is production of multiple
      transiently amplifying intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) from a single
      neural stem cell. Like mammalian neural stem cells, Drosophila type II
      neuroblasts utilize INPs to produce neurons and glia. Within a given lineage, the
      consecutively born INPs produce morphologically distinct progeny, presumably due 
      to differential inheritance of temporal factors. To uncover the underlying
      temporal fating mechanisms, we profiled type II neuroblasts' transcriptome across
      time. Our results reveal opposing temporal gradients of Imp and Syp RNA-binding
      proteins (descending and ascending, respectively). Maintaining high Imp
      throughout serial INP production expands the number of neurons and glia with
      early temporal fate at the expense of cells with late fate. Conversely,
      precocious upregulation of Syp reduces the number of cells with early fate.
      Furthermore, we reveal that the transcription factor Seven-up initiates
      progression of the Imp/Syp gradients. Interestingly, neuroblasts that maintain
      initial Imp/Syp levels can still yield progeny with a small range of early fates.
      We therefore propose that the Seven-up-initiated Imp/Syp gradients create coarse 
      temporal windows within type II neuroblasts to pattern INPs, which subsequently
      undergo fine-tuned subtemporal patterning.

AB  - The rat limbic system contains head direction (HD) cells that fire according to
      heading in the horizontal plane, and these cells are thought to provide animals
      with an internal compass. Previous work has found that HD cell tuning correlates 
      with behavior on navigational tasks, but a direct, causal link between HD cells
      and navigation has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that pathway-specific
      optogenetic inhibition of the nucleus prepositus caused HD cells to become
      directionally unstable under dark conditions without affecting the animals'
      locomotion. Then, using the same technique, we found that this decoupling of the 
      HD signal in the absence of visual cues caused the animals to make directional
      homing errors and that the magnitude and direction of these errors were in a
      range that corresponded to the degree of instability observed in the HD signal.
      These results provide evidence that the HD signal plays a causal role as a neural
      compass in navigation.

AB  - Instinctive defensive behaviors are essential for animal survival. Across the
      animal kingdom, there are sensory stimuli that innately represent threat and
      trigger stereotyped behaviors such as escape or freezing [1-4]. While innate
      behaviors are considered to be hard-wired stimulus-responses [5], they act within
      dynamic environments, and factors such as the properties of the threat [6-9] and 
      its perceived intensity [1, 10, 11], access to food sources [12-14], and
      expectations from past experience [15, 16] have been shown to influence defensive
      behaviors, suggesting that their expression can be modulated. However, despite
      recent work [2, 4, 17-21], little is known about how flexible mouse innate
      defensive behaviors are and how quickly they can be modified by experience. To
      address this, we have investigated the dependence of escape behavior on learned
      knowledge about the spatial environment and how the behavior is updated when the 
      environment changes acutely. Using behavioral assays with innately threatening
      visual and auditory stimuli, we show that the primary goal of escape in mice is
      to reach a previously memorized shelter location. Memory of the escape target can
      be formed in a single shelter visit lasting less than 20 s, and changes in the
      spatial environment lead to a rapid update of the defensive action, including
      changing the defensive strategy from escape to freezing. Our results show that
      although there are innate links between specific sensory features and defensive
      behavior, instinctive defensive actions are surprisingly flexible and can be
      rapidly updated by experience to adapt to changing spatial environments.

AB  - It is generally assumed that the allocation and synthesis of total cellular
      resources in microorganisms are uniquely determined by the growth conditions.
      Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via
      reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell 
      size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological
      states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any
      steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable
      variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and
      the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively
      controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and
      antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can
      result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition
      experiments, and we discovered that cell size at replication initiation per
      origin, namely the initiation mass or unit cell, is remarkably invariant under
      perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication
      kinetics, fatty acid and cell wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape.
      Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the
      total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an
      overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in
      bacteria.

AB  - Actin cytoskeleton dynamics play vital roles in most forms of intracellular
      trafficking by promoting the biogenesis and transport of vesicular cargoes.
      Mounting evidence indicates that actin dynamics and membrane-cytoskeleton
      scaffolds also have essential roles in macroautophagy, the process by which
      cellular waste is isolated inside specialized vesicles called autophagosomes for 
      recycling and degradation. Branched actin polymerization is necessary for the
      biogenesis of autophagosomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane.
      Actomyosin-based transport is then used to feed the growing phagophore with
      pre-selected cargoes and debris derived from different membranous organelles
      inside the cell. Finally, mature autophagosomes detach from the ER membrane by an
      as yet unknown mechanism, undergo intracellular transport and then fuse with
      lysosomes, endosomes and multivesicular bodies through mechanisms that involve
      actin- and microtubule-mediated motility, cytoskeleton-membrane scaffolds and
      signaling proteins. In this review, we highlight the considerable progress made
      recently towards understanding the diverse roles of the cytoskeleton in
      autophagy.

AB  - The mechanism of axon degeneration is incompletely understood. A recent study
      demonstrates that transgenic expression of bacterial nicotinamide adenine
      mononucleotide (NMN) in zebrafish and mice, which decreases NMN levels by

AB  - The human gut metagenome was recently discovered to encode vast collections of
      biosynthetic gene clusters with diverse chemical potential, almost none of which 
      are yet functionally validated. Recent work elucidates common microbiome-derived 
      biosynthetic gene clusters encoding peptide aldehydes that inhibit human
      proteases.

AB  - Plastics are synthetic polymers derived from fossil oil and largely resistant to 
      biodegradation. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) represent approximately 
      92% of total plastic production. PE is largely utilized in packaging,
      representing approximately 40% of total demand for plastic products
      (www.plasticseurope.org) with over a trillion plastic bags used every year [1].
      Plastic production has increased exponentially in the past 50 years (Figure S1A
      in Supplemental Information, published with this article online). In the 27 EU
      countries plus Norway and Switzerland up to 38% of plastic is discarded in
      landfills, with the rest utilized for recycling (26%) and energy recovery (36%)
      via combustion (www.plasticseurope.org), carrying a heavy environmental impact.
      Therefore, new solutions for plastic degradation are urgently needed. We report
      the fast bio-degradation of PE by larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella,
      producing ethylene glycol.

AB  - Migration allows animals to track the environmental conditions that maximize
      growth, survival, and reproduction [1-3]. Improved understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying migrations allows for improved management of species and
      ecosystems [1-4]. For centuries, the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla)
      has provided one of Europe's most important fisheries and has sparked
      considerable scientific inquiry, most recently owing to the dramatic collapse of 
      juvenile recruitment [5]. Larval eels are transported by ocean currents
      associated with the Gulf Stream System from Sargasso Sea breeding grounds to
      coastal and freshwater habitats from North Africa to Scandinavia [6, 7]. After a 
      decade or more, maturing adults migrate back to the Sargasso Sea, spawn, and die 
      [8]. However, the migratory mechanisms that bring juvenile eels to Europe and
      return adults to the Sargasso Sea remain equivocal [9, 10]. Here, we used a
      "magnetic displacement" experiment [11, 12] to show that the orientation of
      juvenile eels varies in response to subtle differences in magnetic field
      intensity and inclination angle along their marine migration route. Simulations
      using an ocean circulation model revealed that even weakly swimming in the
      experimentally observed directions at the locations corresponding to the magnetic
      displacements would increase entrainment of juvenile eels into the Gulf Stream
      System. These findings provide new insight into the migration ecology and
      recruitment dynamics of eels and suggest that an adaptive magnetic map, tuned to 
      large-scale features of ocean circulation, facilitates the vast oceanic
      migrations of the Anguilla genus [7, 13, 14].

AB  - When independently evolved immune receptor variants meet in hybrid plants, they
      can activate immune signaling in the absence of non-self recognition. Such
      autoimmune risk alleles have recurrently evolved at the DANGEROUS MIX2 (DM2)
      nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-encoding locus in A.
      thaliana. One of these activates signaling in the presence of a particular
      variant encoded at another NLR locus, DM1. We show that the risk variants of DM1 
      and DM2d NLRs signal through the same pathway that is activated when plant NLRs
      recognize non-self elicitors. This requires the P loops of each protein and
      Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-mediated heteromeric association of DM1 
      and DM2d. DM1 and DM2d each resides in a multimeric complex in the absence of
      signaling, with the DM1 complex shifting to higher molecular weight when
      heteromerizing DM2 variants are present. The activation of the DM1 complex
      appears to be sensitive to the conformation of the heteromerizing DM2 variant.
      Autoimmunity triggered by interaction of this NLR pair thus suggests that
      activity of heteromeric NLR signaling complexes depends on the sum of activation 
      potentials of partner NLRs.

AB  - The interplay between binding and unbinding of synaptic receptor proteins at
      synapses plays an important role in determining receptor concentration and
      synaptic strength, with known links between changes in binding kinetics and
      synaptic plasticity. The regulation of such kinetics may subserve the specific
      functional requirements of neurons in intact circuits. However, the majority of
      studies of synaptic turnover kinetics have been performed in cultured neurons
      outside the context of normal circuits, and synaptic receptor turnover has not
      been measured at individual synaptic sites in vivo. We quantified the
      distribution of glycinergic receptor dynamics using fluorescence recovery after
      photoconversion of synapses in intact zebrafish and correlated recovery kinetics 
      to synaptic volume in two functionally distinct classes of cells: primary and
      secondary motoneurons. The rate of fluorescence recovery after photoconversion
      decreased with synaptic volume in both types of motoneurons, with larger synapses
      having slower recovery. Primary motoneurons had both larger synapses and
      associated slower recovery times than secondary motoneurons. Our results suggest 
      that synaptic kinetics are regulated in concert with synaptic sizes and reflect
      the functional role played by neurons within their circuit.

AB  - Termitophiles, symbionts that live in termite nests, include a wide range of
      morphologically and behaviorally specialized organisms. Complex adaptive
      mechanisms permit these animals to integrate into societies and to exploit their 
      controlled physical conditions and plentiful resources, as well as to garner
      protection inside termite nests. An understanding of the early evolution of
      termitophily is challenging owing to a scarcity of fossil termitophiles, with all
      known reliable records occurring from the Miocene (approximately 19 million years
      ago [mya]) [1-6], and an equivocal termitophile belonging to the largely
      free-living Mesoporini from the mid-Cretaceous [7]. Here we report the oldest,
      morphologically specialized, and obligate termitophiles from mid-Cretaceous
      Burmese amber (99 mya). Cretotrichopsenius burmiticus gen. et sp. nov. belongs to
      Trichopseniini, a group of distinctive termitophilous aleocharine rove beetles,
      all of which possess specialized swollen or horseshoe-crab-shaped body plans.
      Cretotrichopsenius display the protective horseshoe-crab-shaped body form typical
      of many modern termitophiles, with concealed head and antennae and strong
      posteriorly directed abdominal setae. Cretotrichopsenius represent the earliest
      definitive termitophiles, shedding light on host associations in the early
      evolution of termite societies. The fossil reveals that ancient termite societies
      were quickly invaded by beetles and by multiple independent lineages of social
      parasites over the subsequent eons.

AB  - To navigate through the world, animals must stabilize their path against
      disturbances and change direction to avoid obstacles and to search for resources 
      [1, 2]. Locomotion is thus guided by sensory cues but also depends on intrinsic
      processes, such as motivation and physiological state. Flies, for example, turn
      with the direction of large-field rotatory motion, an optomotor reflex that is
      thought to help them fly straight [3-5]. Occasionally, however, they execute fast
      turns, called body saccades, either spontaneously or in response to patterns of
      visual motion such as expansion [6-8]. These turns can be measured in tethered
      flying Drosophila [3, 4, 9], which facilitates the study of underlying neural
      mechanisms. Whereas there is evidence for an efference copy input to visual
      interneurons during saccades [10], the circuits that control spontaneous and
      visually elicited saccades are not well known. Using two-photon calcium imaging
      and electrophysiological recordings in tethered flying Drosophila, we have
      identified a descending neuron whose activity is correlated with both spontaneous
      and visually elicited turns during tethered flight. The cell's activity in open- 
      and closed-loop experiments suggests that it does not underlie slower
      compensatory responses to horizontal motion but rather controls rapid changes in 
      flight path. The activity of this neuron can explain some of the behavioral
      variability observed in response to visual motion and appears sufficient for
      eliciting turns when artificially activated. This work provides an entry point
      into studying the circuits underlying the control of rapid steering maneuvers in 
      the fly brain.

TI  - A Transcriptional Program for Arbuscule Degeneration during AM Symbiosis Is
      Regulated by MYB1.

AB  - During the endosymbiosis formed between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
      fungi, the root cortical cells are colonized by branched hyphae called
      arbuscules, which function in nutrient exchange with the plant [1]. Despite their
      positive function, arbuscules are ephemeral structures, and their development is 
      followed by a degeneration phase, in which the arbuscule and surrounding
      periarbuscular membrane and matrix gradually disappear from the root cell [2, 3].
      Currently, the root cell's role in this process and the underlying regulatory
      mechanisms are unknown. Here, by using a Medicago truncatula pt4 mutant in which 
      arbuscules degenerate prematurely [4], we identified arbuscule
      degeneration-associated genes, of which 38% are predicted to encode secreted
      hydrolases, suggesting a role in disassembly of the arbuscule and interface.
      Through RNAi and analysis of an insertion mutant, we identified a
      symbiosis-specific MYB-like transcription factor (MYB1) that suppresses arbuscule
      degeneration in mtpt4. In myb1, expression of several degeneration-associated
      genes is reduced. Conversely, in roots constitutively overexpressing MYB1,
      expression of degeneration-associated genes is increased and subsequent
      development of symbiosis is impaired. MYB1-regulated gene expression is enhanced 
      by DELLA proteins and is dependent on NSP1 [5], but not NSP2 [6]. Furthermore,
      MYB1 interacts with DELLA and NSP1. Our data identify a transcriptional program
      for arbuscule degeneration and reveal that its regulators include MYB1 in
      association with two transcriptional regulators, NSP1 and DELLA, both of which
      function in preceding phases of the symbiosis. We propose that the combinatorial 
      use of transcription factors enables the sequential expression of transcriptional
      programs for arbuscule development and degeneration.

TI  - Compartmentalization of DNA Damage Response between Heterochromatin and
      Euchromatin Is Mediated by Distinct H2A Histone Variants.

AB  - DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair depends on the ataxia telangiectasia mutated
      (ATM) kinase that phosphorylates the conserved C-terminal SQ motif present in the
      histone variant H2A.X [1-7]. In constitutive heterochromatin of mammals, DSB
      repair is delayed and relies on phosphorylation of the proteins HP1 and KAP1 by
      ATM [2, 8-14]. However, KAP1 is not conserved in plants and the HP1-related
      protein Like-HP1 (LHP1) is not localized at constitutive heterochromatin [15],
      suggesting that in plants, alternative mechanisms could be responsible for repair
      of DSBs in heterochromatin. In Arabidopsis, constitutive heterochromatin is
      marked by H3K9 methylation and the plant-specific histone variants H2A.W, which
      are distinguished by their C-terminal motif KSPKK and required for
      heterochromatin compaction [16-18]. We report that the Arabidopsis histone
      variant H2A.W.7 is confined to heterochromatin and carries a SQ motif that is
      phosphorylated by ATM. In response to DNA damage, phosphorylation of H2A.W.7
      takes place in heterochromatin, while H2A.X phosphorylation takes place primarily
      in euchromatin. We propose that H2A.W.7 evolved in addition to H2A.X to
      facilitate DNA damage response in highly condensed heterochromatin, thus playing 
      a role similar to KAP1 and HP1 phosphorylation in mammals. These data support the
      idea of the functional diversification of histone variants and their role in
      spatial compartmentalization of chromatin-related functions in eukaryotes.

AB  - A readily evident feature of animal central nervous systems (CNSs), apparent in
      all vertebrates and many invertebrates alike, is its "wedge-like" appearance,
      with more cells generated in anterior than posterior regions. This wedge could
      conceivably be established by an antero-posterior (A-P) gradient in the number of
      neural progenitor cells, their proliferation behaviors, and/or programmed cell
      death (PCD). However, the contribution of each of these mechanisms, and the
      underlying genetic programs, are not well understood. Building upon recent
      progress in the Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) ventral nerve cord (VNC), we
      address these issues in a comprehensive manner. We find that, although PCD plays 
      a role in controlling cell numbers along the A-P axis, the main driver of the
      wedge is a gradient of daughter proliferation, with divisions directly generating
      neurons (type 0) being more prevalent posteriorly and dividing daughters (type I)
      more prevalent anteriorly. In addition, neural progenitor (NB) cell-cycle exit
      occurs earlier posteriorly. The gradient of type I > 0 daughter proliferation
      switch and NB exit combine to generate radically different average lineage sizes 
      along the A-P axis, differing by more than 3-fold in cell number. We find that
      the Hox homeotic genes, expressed in overlapping A-P gradients and with a late
      temporal onset in NBs, trigger the type I > 0 daughter proliferation switch and
      NB exit. Given the highly evolutionarily conserved expression of overlapping Hox 
      homeotic genes in the CNS, our results point to a common mechanism for generating
      the CNS wedge.

AB  - Plant stem cell niches, the meristems, require long-distance transport of energy 
      metabolites and signaling molecules along the phloem tissue. However, currently
      it is unclear how specification of phloem cells is controlled. Here we show that 
      the genes SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE3 (SMXL3), SMXL4, and SMXL5 act as
      cell-autonomous key regulators of phloem formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The
      three genes form an uncharacterized subclade of the SMXL gene family that
      mediates hormonal strigolactone and karrikin signaling. Strigolactones are
      endogenous signaling molecules regulating shoot and root branching [1] whereas
      exogenous karrikin molecules induce germination after wildfires [2]. Both
      activities depend on the F-box protein and SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box) complex
      component MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) [3-5]. Strigolactone and karrikin
      perception leads to MAX2-dependent degradation of distinct SMXL protein family
      members, which is key for mediating hormonal effects [6-12]. However, the nature 
      of events immediately downstream of SMXL protein degradation and whether all SMXL
      proteins mediate strigolactone or karrikin signaling is unknown. In this study we
      demonstrate that, within the SMXL gene family, specifically SMXL3/4/5 deficiency 
      results in strong defects in phloem formation, altered sugar accumulation, and
      seedling lethality. By comparing protein stabilities, we show that SMXL3/4/5
      proteins function differently to canonical strigolactone and karrikin signaling
      mediators, although being functionally interchangeable with those under low
      strigolactone/karrikin signaling conditions. Our observations reveal a
      fundamental mechanism of phloem formation and indicate that diversity of SMXL
      protein functions is essential for a steady fuelling of plant meristems.

      record the activity of every neuron in a behaving animal and decode how it
      relates to behavior. We have achieved this with the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris,
      using calcium imaging of genetically engineered animals to measure the activity
      of essentially all of its neurons. Although the nervous system of Hydra is
      traditionally described as a simple nerve net, we surprisingly find instead a
      series of functional networks that are anatomically non-overlapping and are
      associated with specific behaviors. Three major functional networks extend
      through the entire animal and are activated selectively during longitudinal
      contractions, elongations in response to light, and radial contractions, whereas 
      an additional network is located near the hypostome and is active during nodding.
      These results demonstrate the functional sophistication of apparently simple
      nerve nets, and the potential of Hydra and other basal metazoans as a model
      system for neural circuit studies.

AB  - During mitosis, cells must segregate the replicated copies of their genome to
      their daughter cells with extremely high fidelity. Segregation errors lead to an 
      abnormal chromosome number (aneuploidy), which typically results in disease or
      cell death [1]. Chromosome segregation and anaphase onset are initiated through
      the action of the multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase known as the
      anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C [2]). The APC/C is inhibited by
      the spindle checkpoint in the presence of kinetochore attachment defects [3, 4]. 
      Here we demonstrate that two non-essential APC/C subunits (Apc14 and Apc15)
      regulate association of spindle checkpoint proteins, in the form of the mitotic
      checkpoint complex (MCC), with the APC/C. apc14Delta mutants display increased
      MCC association with the APC/C and are unable to silence the checkpoint
      efficiently. Conversely, apc15Delta mutants display reduced association between
      the MCC and APC/C, are defective in poly-ubiquitination of Cdc20, and are
      checkpoint defective. In vitro reconstitution studies have shown that human
      MCC-APC/C can contain two molecules of Cdc20 [5-7]. Using a yeast strain
      expressing two Cdc20 genes with different epitope tags, we show by
      co-immunoprecipitation that this is true in vivo. MCC binding to the second
      molecule of Cdc20 is mediated via the C-terminal KEN box in Mad3. Somewhat
      surprisingly, complexes containing both molecules of Cdc20 accumulate in
      apc15Delta cells, and the implications of this observation are discussed.

AB  - The mitotic checkpoint is a cellular safeguard that prevents chromosome
      missegregation in eukaryotic cells [1, 2]. Suboptimal functioning may foster
      chromosome missegregation in cancer cells [3]. Checkpoint signaling produces the 
      "mitotic checkpoint complex" (MCC), which prevents anaphase by targeting Cdc20,
      the activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Recent
      biochemical and structural studies revealed that the human MCC binds two Cdc20
      molecules, one (Cdc20(M)) through well-characterized, cooperative binding to Mad2
      and Mad3/BubR1 (forming the "core MCC") and the other one (Cdc20(A)) through
      additional binding sequences in Mad3/BubR1 [4-6]. Here, we dissect the different 
      functionality of these sites in vivo. We show in fission yeast that, at low Cdc20
      concentrations, Cdc20(M) binding is sufficient for checkpoint activity and
      Cdc20(A) binding becomes dispensable. Cdc20(A) binding is mediated by the
      conserved Mad3 ABBA-KEN2-ABBA motif [7, 8], which we find additionally required
      for binding of the MCC to the APC/C and for MCC disassembly. Strikingly, deletion
      of the APC/C subunit Apc15 mimics mutations in this motif, revealing a shared
      function. This function of Apc15 may be masked in human cells by independent
      mediators of MCC-APC/C binding. Our data provide important in vivo support for
      the recent structure-based models and functionally dissect three elements of
      Cdc20 inhibition: (1) sequestration of Cdc20 in the core MCC, sufficient at low
      Cdc20 concentrations; (2) inhibition of a second Cdc20 through the Mad3 C
      terminus, independent of Mad2 binding to this Cdc20 molecule; and (3) occupancy
      of the APC/C with full MCC, where Mad3 and Apc15 are involved.

AB  - Animals use rules to initiate behaviors. Such rules are often described as
      triggers that determine when behavior begins. However, although less explored,
      these selection rules are also an opportunity to establish sensorimotor
      constraints that influence how the behavior ends. These constraints may be
      particularly significant in influencing success in prey capture. Here we explore 
      this in dragonfly prey interception. We found that in the moments leading up to
      takeoff, perched dragonflies employ a series of sensorimotor rules that determine
      the time of takeoff and increase the probability of successful capture. First,
      the dragonfly makes a head saccade followed by smooth pursuit movements to orient
      its direction-of-gaze at potential prey. Second, the dragonfly assesses whether
      the prey's angular size and speed co-vary within a privileged range. Finally, the
      dragonfly times the moment of its takeoff to a prediction of when the prey will
      cross the zenith. Each of these processes serves a purpose. The angular
      size-speed criteria biases interception flights to catchable prey, while the head
      movements and the predictive takeoff ensure flights begin with the prey visually 
      fixated and directly overhead-the key parameters that underlie interception
      steering. Prey that do not elicit takeoff generally fail at least one of the
      criterion, and the loss of prey fixation or overhead positioning during flight is
      strongly correlated with terminated flights. Thus from an abundance of potential 
      targets, the dragonfly selects a stereotyped set of takeoff conditions based on
      the prey and body states most likely to end in successful capture.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients present neuronal alterations that lead to
      severe intellectual disability, but the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms
      are poorly understood. An emerging hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic
      inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of
      FXS. Here, we directly test this idea in a FXS Drosophila model. We show that FXS
      flies exhibit strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory
      representations are less odor specific due to broader response tuning of
      excitatory projection neurons. We find that impaired inhibitory interactions
      underlie reduced specificity in olfactory computations. Finally, we show that
      defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker
      inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. We provide direct evidence that deficient
      inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of FXS. 
      Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these 
      findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability.

AB  - The Drosophila central brain consists of stereotyped neural lineages,
      developmental-structural units of macrocircuitry formed by the sibling neurons of
      single progenitors called neuroblasts. We demonstrate that the lineage principle 
      guides the connectivity and function of neurons, providing input to the central
      complex, a collection of neuropil compartments important for visually guided
      behaviors. One of these compartments is the ellipsoid body (EB), a structure
      formed largely by the axons of ring (R) neurons, all of which are generated by a 
      single lineage, DALv2. Two further lineages, DALcl1 and DALcl2, produce neurons
      that connect the anterior optic tubercle, a central brain visual center, with R
      neurons. Finally, DALcl1/2 receive input from visual projection neurons of the
      optic lobe medulla, completing a three-legged circuit that we call the anterior
      visual pathway (AVP). The AVP bears a fundamental resemblance to the sky-compass 
      pathway, a visual navigation circuit described in other insects. Neuroanatomical 
      analysis and two-photon calcium imaging demonstrate that DALcl1 and DALcl2 form
      two parallel channels, establishing connections with R neurons located in the
      peripheral and central domains of the EB, respectively. Although neurons of both 
      lineages preferentially respond to bright objects, DALcl1 neurons have small
      ipsilateral, retinotopically ordered receptive fields, whereas DALcl2 neurons
      share a large excitatory receptive field in the contralateral hemifield. DALcl2
      neurons become inhibited when the object enters the ipsilateral hemifield and
      display an additional excitation after the object leaves the field of view. Thus,
      the spatial position of a bright feature, such as a celestial body, may be
      encoded within this pathway.

AB  - Venom systems have evolved on multiple occasions across the animal kingdom, and
      they can act as key adaptations to protect animals from predators [1].
      Consequently, venomous animals serve as models for a rich source of mimicry
      types, as non-venomous species benefit from reductions in predation risk by
      mimicking the coloration, body shape, and/or movement of toxic counterparts
      [2-5]. The frequent evolution of such deceitful imitations provides notable
      examples of phenotypic convergence and are often invoked as classic exemplars of 
      evolution by natural selection. Here, we investigate the evolution of fangs,
      venom, and mimetic relationships in reef fishes from the tribe Nemophini
      (fangblennies). Comparative morphological analyses reveal that enlarged canine
      teeth (fangs) originated at the base of the Nemophini radiation and have enabled 
      a micropredatory feeding strategy in non-venomous Plagiotremus spp. Subsequently,
      the evolution of deep anterior grooves and their coupling to venom secretory
      tissue provide Meiacanthus spp. with toxic venom that they effectively employ for
      defense. We find that fangblenny venom contains a number of toxic components that
      have been independently recruited into other animal venoms, some of which cause
      toxicity via interactions with opioid receptors, and result in a multifunctional 
      biochemical phenotype that exerts potent hypotensive effects. The evolution of
      fangblenny venom has seemingly led to phenotypic convergence via the formation of
      a diverse array of mimetic relationships that provide protective (Batesian
      mimicry) and predatory (aggressive mimicry) benefits to other fishes [2, 6]. Our 
      results further our understanding of how novel morphological and biochemical
      adaptations stimulate ecological interactions in the natural world.

AB  - In C. elegans, alterations to chromatin produce transgenerational effects, such
      as inherited increase in lifespan and gradual loss of fertility. Inheritance of
      histone modifications can be induced by double-stranded RNA-derived heritable
      small RNAs. Here, we show that the mortal germline phenotype, which is typical of
      met-2 mutants, defective in H3K9 methylation, depends on HRDE-1, an argonaute
      that carries small RNAs across generations, and is accompanied by accumulated
      transgenerational misexpression of heritable small RNAs. We discovered that MET-2
      inhibits small RNA inheritance, and, as a consequence, induction of RNAi in met-2
      mutants leads to permanent RNAi responses that do not terminate even after more
      than 30 generations. We found that potentiation of heritable RNAi in met-2
      animals results from global hyperactivation of the small RNA inheritance
      machinery. Thus, changes in histone modifications can give rise to drastic
      transgenerational epigenetic effects, by controlling the overall potency of small
      RNA inheritance.

AB  - Subterranean biodiversity in Europe is spectacularly rich, with the Western
      Balkans being home to about 400 cave species, representing the highest number of 
      species per area worldwide [1]. Nonetheless, cave fishes, which are the most
      commonly found vertebrates in underground habitats [2], have not been described
      from Europe so far [3]. Here, we report the first European record of a cave fish 
      population, a loach of the genus Barbatula (Figure 1), found in the Danube-Aach
      system, an underground karst water system in Southern Germany [4]. The fish
      exhibit traits typically observed in organisms adapted to subterranean life
      including reduced eyes and pale body coloration [5]. The newly discovered
      population also represents globally the northernmost cave fish found so far. The 
      geological history of the region implies that the Danube-Aach system was
      colonized post-glacially. A recent origin of the cave fish is supported by
      genetic analyses, because the subterranean population shares COI gene haplotypes 
      with adjacent surface stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) populations (Figure 1D). 
      Nonetheless, population genetic analyses based on microsatellites indicated that 
      cave fish are genetically isolated from populations in surface habitats (Figure
      1E) and exhibit reduced genetic variability. Hence, the newly discovered European
      cave loaches do not represent individuals displaced from surface populations, but
      they follow a unique evolutionary trajectory towards cave life.

AB  - Platyhelminthes (flatworms) have captivated the imagination of biologists for
      centuries. Indeed, planarian flatworms were used as experimental models decades
      before Caenorhabditis elegans became known as 'the worm'. Although planarians
      experienced a brief fall from grace, with the advent of molecular tools,
      planarians, such as Schmidtea mediterranea, have emerged in recent years as
      powerful models to study the basis of stem cell regulation and tissue
      regeneration. Flatworms are not just everyone's favorite experimental subjects
      from high school biology - they also include some of nature's most successful
      parasites, many of which have plagued humans throughout our history. This Primer 
      will focus on several aspects of the remarkable biology found throughout the
      phylum Platyhelminthes.

      Segregation Errors in Mouse Oocyte Meiosis-I.

AB  - Chromosome segregation errors in mammalian oocytes compromise development and are
      particularly prevalent in older females, but the aging-related cellular changes
      that promote segregation errors remain unclear [1, 2]. Aging causes a loss of
      meiotic chromosome cohesion, which can explain premature disjunction of sister
      chromatids [3-7], but why intact sister pairs should missegregate in meiosis-I
      (termed non-disjunction) remains unknown. Here, we show that oocytes from
      naturally aged mice exhibit substantially altered spindle microtubule dynamics,
      resulting in transiently multipolar spindles that predispose the oocytes to
      kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects and missegregation of intact sister
      chromatid pairs. Using classical micromanipulation approaches, including
      reciprocally transferring nuclei between young and aged oocytes, we show that
      altered microtubule dynamics are not attributable to age-related chromatin
      changes. We therefore report that altered microtubule dynamics is a novel primary
      lesion contributing to age-related oocyte segregation errors. We propose that,
      whereas cohesion loss can explain premature sister separation, classical
      non-disjunction is instead explained by altered microtubule dynamics, leading to 
      aberrant spindle assembly.

TI  - Phylogenomic Insights into the Evolution of Stinging Wasps and the Origins of
      Ants and Bees.

AB  - The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of
      hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity 
      of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation,
      pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid 
      wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are
      the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and
      the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3].
      Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and
      reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the
      biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding
      (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4-11],
      considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within
      Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5-7]. We used
      ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among
      stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from >800 UCE loci and 187
      samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon
      dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several
      alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the
      phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported
      phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence
      that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are
      nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice
      can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic
      inference.

AB  - Sister-chromatid cohesion is established by the cohesin complex in S phase and
      persists until metaphase, when sister chromatids are captured by microtubules
      emanating from opposite poles [1]. The Aurora-B-containing chromosome passenger
      complex (CPC) plays a crucial role in achieving chromosome bi-orientation by
      correcting erroneous microtubule attachment [2]. The centromeric localization of 
      the CPC relies largely on histone H3-T3 phosphorylation (H3-pT3), which is
      mediated by the mitotic histone kinase Haspin/Hrk1 [3-5]. Hrk1 localization to
      centromeres depends largely on the cohesin subunit Pds5 in fission yeast [5];
      however, it is unknown how Pds5 regulates Hrk1 localization. Here we identify a
      conserved Hrk1-interacting motif (HIM) in Pds5 and a Pds5-interacting motif (PIM)
      in Hrk1 in fission yeast. Mutations in either motif result in the displacement of
      Hrk1 from centromeres. We also show that the mechanism of Pds5-dependent Hrk1
      recruitment is conserved in human cells. Notably, the PIM in Haspin/Hrk1 is
      reminiscent of the YSR motif found in the mammalian cohesin destabilizer Wapl and
      stabilizer Sororin, both of which bind PDS5 [6-12]. Similarly, and through the
      same motifs, fission yeast Pds5 binds to Wpl1/Wapl and acetyltransferase
      Eso1/Eco1, in addition to Hrk1. Thus, we have identified a protein-protein
      interaction module in Pds5 that serves as a chromatin platform for regulating
      sister-chromatid cohesion and chromosome bi-orientation.

AB  - Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four mega-diverse insect
      orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and possibly up to one million
      undescribed extant species [1, 2]. As parasitoids, predators, and pollinators,
      Hymenoptera play a fundamental role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and
      are of substantial economic importance [1, 3]. To understand the diversification 
      and key evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to 
      parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to eusocial life, 
      we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all major lineages of
      Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in 173 insect species. Our
      analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started to diversify around 281 million 
      years ago (mya). The primarily ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be
      monophyletic. The species-rich lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a
      monophyletic group as well. The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are
      identified as the sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we
      located the evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family "Crabronidae."
      Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the result of a
      previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous Hymenoptera that did not 
      lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They also confirm that all primarily
      parasitoid wasps are descendants of a single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that 
      lived around 247 mya. Our findings provide the basis for a natural classification
      of Hymenoptera and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera,
      including their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life
      styles.

AB  - Astrocytes are active partners in neural information processing [1, 2]. However, 
      the roles of astrocytes in regulating behavior remain unclear [3, 4]. Because
      astrocytes have persistent circadian clock gene expression and ATP release in
      vitro [5-8], we hypothesized that they regulate daily rhythms in neurons and
      behavior. Here, we demonstrated that daily rhythms in astrocytes within the
      mammalian master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
      determine the period of wheel-running activity. Ablating the essential clock gene
      Bmal1 specifically in SCN astrocytes lengthened the circadian period of clock
      gene expression in the SCN and in locomotor behavior. Similarly, excision of the 
      short-period CK1epsilon tau mutation specifically from SCN astrocytes resulted in
      lengthened rhythms in the SCN and behavior. These results indicate that
      astrocytes within the SCN communicate to neurons to determine circadian rhythms
      in physiology and in rest activity.

      Centromeric Cohesion in Mitosis.

AB  - Sister-chromatid cohesion, mediated by the multi-subunit cohesin complex, must be
      precisely regulated to prevent chromosome mis-segregation. In prophase and
      prometaphase, whereas the bulk of cohesin on chromosome arms is removed by its
      antagonist Wapl, cohesin at centromeres is retained to ensure chromosome
      biorientation until anaphase onset. It remains incompletely understood how
      centromeric cohesin is protected against Wapl in mitosis. Here we show that the
      mitotic histone kinase Haspin binds to the cohesin regulatory subunit Pds5B
      through a conserved YGA/R motif in its non-catalytic N terminus, which is similar
      to the recently reported YSR-motif-dependent binding of Wapl to Pds5B. Knockout
      of Haspin or disruption of Haspin-Pds5B interaction causes weakened centromeric
      cohesion and premature chromatid separation, which can be reverted by centromeric
      targeting of a N-terminal short fragment of Haspin containing the Pds5B-binding
      motif or by prevention of Wapl-dependent cohesin removal. Conversely, excessive
      Haspin capable of binding Pds5B displaces Wapl from Pds5B and suppresses Wapl
      activity, and it largely bypasses the Wapl antagonist Sgo1 for cohesion
      protection. Taken together, these data indicate that the Haspin-Pds5B interaction
      is required to ensure proper sister-chromatid cohesion, most likely through
      antagonizing Wapl-mediated cohesin release from mitotic centromeres.

AB  - Detecting the direction of motion contained in the visual scene is crucial for
      many behaviors. However, because single photoreceptors only signal local
      luminance changes, motion detection requires a comparison of signals from
      neighboring photoreceptors across time in downstream neuronal circuits. For
      signals to coincide on readout neurons that thus become motion and direction
      selective, different input lines need to be delayed with respect to each other.
      Classical models of motion detection rely on non-linear interactions between two 
      inputs after different temporal filtering. However, recent studies have suggested
      the requirement for at least three, not only two, input signals. Here, we
      comprehensively characterize the spatiotemporal response properties of all
      columnar input elements to the elementary motion detectors in the fruit fly, T4
      and T5 cells, via two-photon calcium imaging. Between these input neurons, we
      find large differences in temporal dynamics. Based on this, computer simulations 
      show that only a small subset of possible arrangements of these input elements
      maps onto a recently proposed algorithmic three-input model in a way that
      generates a highly direction-selective motion detector, suggesting plausible
      network architectures. Moreover, modulating the motion detection system by
      octopamine-receptor activation, we find the temporal tuning of T4 and T5 cells to
      be shifted toward higher frequencies, and this shift can be fully explained by
      the concomitant speeding of the input elements.

AB  - Maternally inherited noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can regulate zygotic gene expression
      across generations [1-4]. Recently, many stable intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs),
      which are byproducts of pre-mRNA splicing, were found to be maternally deposited 
      and persist till zygotic transcription in Xenopus and Drosophila [5-7]. In
      various organisms, sisRNAs can be in linear or circular conformations, and they
      have been suggested to regulate host gene expression [5-10]. It is unknown
      whether maternally deposited sisRNAs can regulate zygotic gene expression in the 
      embryos. Here, we show that a maternally inherited sisRNA (sisR-4) from the
      deadpan locus is important for embryonic development in Drosophila. Mothers, but 
      not fathers, mutant for sisR-4 produce embryos that fail to hatch. During
      embryogenesis, sisR-4 promotes transcription of its host gene (deadpan), which is
      essential for development. Interestingly, sisR-4 functions by activating an
      enhancer present in the intron where sisR-4 is encoded. We propose that a
      maternal sisRNA triggers expression of its host gene via a positive feedback loop
      during embryogenesis.

TI  - Contextually Mediated Spontaneous Retrieval Is Specific to the Hippocampus.

AB  - Although it is now well established that the hippocampus supports memory encoding
      [1, 2], little is known about hippocampal activity during spontaneous memory
      retrieval. Recent intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) work has shown that
      hippocampal activity during encoding predicts subsequent temporal organization of
      memories [3], supporting a role in contextual binding. It is an open question,
      however, whether the hippocampus similarly supports contextually mediated
      processes during retrieval. Here, we analyzed iEEG recordings obtained from 215
      epilepsy patients as they performed a free recall task. To identify neural
      activity specifically associated with contextual retrieval, we compared correct
      recalls, intrusions (incorrect recall of either items from prior lists or items
      not previously studied), and deliberations (matched periods during recall when no
      items came to mind). Neural signals that differentiate correct recalls from both 
      other retrieval classes reflect contextual retrieval, as correct recalls alone
      arise from the correct context. We found that in the hippocampus, high-frequency 
      activity (HFA, 44-100 Hz), a proxy for neural activation [4], was greater prior
      to correct recalls relative to the other retrieval classes, with no
      differentiation between intrusions and deliberations. This pattern was not
      observed in other memory-related cortical regions, including DLPFC, thus
      supporting a specific hippocampal contribution to contextually mediated memory
      retrieval.

TI  - Cell-Specific alpha-Tubulin Isotype Regulates Ciliary Microtubule Ultrastructure,

AB  - Cilia are found on most non-dividing cells in the human body and, when faulty,
      cause a wide range of pathologies called ciliopathies. Ciliary specialization in 
      form and function is observed throughout the animal kingdom, yet mechanisms
      generating ciliary diversity are poorly understood. The "tubulin code"-a
      combination of tubulin isotypes and tubulin post-translational modifications-can 
      generate microtubule diversity. Using C. elegans, we show that alpha-tubulin
      isotype TBA-6 sculpts 18 A- and B-tubule singlets from nine ciliary A-B doublet
      microtubules in cephalic male (CEM) neurons. In CEM cilia, tba-6 regulates
      velocities and cargoes of intraflagellar transport (IFT) kinesin-2 motors
      kinesin-II and OSM-3/KIF17 without affecting kinesin-3 KLP-6 motility. In
      addition to their unique ultrastructure and accessory kinesin-3 motor, CEM cilia 
      are specialized to produce extracellular vesicles. tba-6 also influences several 
      aspects of extracellular vesicle biology, including cargo sorting, release, and
      bioactivity. We conclude that this cell-specific alpha-tubulin isotype dictates
      the hallmarks of CEM cilia specialization. These findings provide insight into
      mechanisms generating ciliary diversity and lay a foundation for further
      understanding the tubulin code.

AB  - Immune response during pathogen infection requires extensive transcription
      reprogramming. A fundamental mechanism of transcriptional regulation is histone
      acetylation. However, how pathogens interfere with this process to promote
      disease remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic
      effector PsAvh23 produced by the soybean pathogen Phytophthora sojae acts as a
      modulator of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) in plants. PsAvh23 binds to the ADA2
      subunit of the HAT complex SAGA and disrupts its assembly by interfering with the
      association of ADA2 with the catalytic subunit GCN5. As such, PsAvh23 suppresses 
      H3K9 acetylation mediated by the ADA2/GCN5 module and increases plant
      susceptibility. Expression of PsAvh23 or silencing of GmADA2/GmGCN5 resulted in
      misregulation of defense-related genes, most likely due to decreased H3K9
      acetylation levels at the corresponding loci. This study highlights an effective 
      counter-defense mechanism by which a pathogen effector suppresses the activation 
      of defense genes by interfering with the function of the HAT complex during
      infection.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is typically inherited from only one parent [1-3]. In
      animals, this is usually the mother. Maternal inheritance is often presented as
      the passive outcome of the difference in cytoplasmic content of egg and sperm;
      however, active programs enforce uniparental inheritance at two levels,
      eliminating paternal mitochondrial genomes or destroying mitochondria delivered
      to the zygote by the sperm [4-13]. Both levels operate in Drosophila [8, 12, 13].
      As sperm formation begins, hundreds of doomed mitochondrial genomes are
      visualized within the two huge mitochondria of each spermatid. These genomes
      abruptly disappear during spermatogenesis. Genome elimination, which is not in
      the interests of the restricted genomes, is directed by nuclear genes. Mutation
      of EndoG, which encodes a mitochondria-targeted endonuclease, retarded
      elimination [8]. Here, we show that knockdown of the nuclear-encoded mtDNA
      polymerase (Pol gamma-alpha), Tamas, produces a more complete block of mtDNA
      elimination. Tamas is found in large particles that localize to mtDNA during
      genome elimination. We discount a simple possible mechanism by showing that the
      3'-exonuclease function of the polymerase is not needed. While DNA elimination is
      a surprising function for DNA polymerase, it could provide a robust nexus for
      nuclear control of mitochondrial genome copy number, since use of common
      interactions for elimination and replication might limit options for the
      mitochondrial genome to escape restriction. We suggest that the DNA polymerase
      may play this role more widely and that inappropriate activation of its
      elimination ability might underlie association of DNA loss syndromes with
      mutations of the human mtDNA polymerase [14-16].

AB  - Anthocyanins are some of the most widely occurring secondary metabolites in
      plants, responsible for the orange, red, purple, and blue colors of flowers and
      fruits and red colors of autumn leaves. These pigments accumulate in vacuoles,
      and their color is influenced by chemical decorations, vacuolar pH, the presence 
      of copigments, and metal ions. Anthocyanins are usually soluble in the vacuole,
      but in some plants, they accumulate as discrete sub-vacuolar structures. Studies 
      have distinguished intensely colored intra-vacuolar bodies observed in the cells 
      of highly colored tissues, termed anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions (AVIs), from
      more globular, membrane-bound anthocyanoplasts. We describe a system in tobacco
      that adds additional decorations to the basic anthocyanin, cyanidin
      3-O-rutinoside, normally formed by this species. Using this system, we have been 
      able to establish which decorations underpin the formation of AVIs, the
      conditions promoting AVI formation, and, consequently, the mechanism by which
      they form.

TI  - Assembly of CNS Nodes of Ranvier in Myelinated Nerves Is Promoted by the Axon
      Cytoskeleton.

AB  - Nodes of Ranvier in the axons of myelinated neurons are exemplars of the
      specialized cell surface domains typical of polarized cells. They are rich in
      voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and thus underpin rapid nerve impulse
      conduction in the vertebrate nervous system [1]. Although nodal proteins cluster 
      in response to myelination, how myelin-forming glia influence nodal assembly is
      poorly understood. An axoglial adhesion complex comprising glial Neurofascin155
      and axonal Caspr/Contactin flanks mature nodes [2]. We have shown that assembly
      of this adhesion complex at the extremities of migrating oligodendroglial
      processes promotes process convergence along the axon during central nervous
      system (CNS) node assembly [3]. Here we show that anchorage of this axoglial
      complex to the axon cytoskeleton is essential for efficient CNS node formation.
      When anchorage is disrupted, both the adaptor Protein 4.1B and the cytoskeleton
      protein betaII spectrin are mislocalized in the axon, and assembly of the node of
      Ranvier is significantly delayed. Nodal proteins and migrating oligodendroglial
      processes are no longer juxtaposed, and single detached nodal complexes replace
      the symmetrical heminodes found in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system
      (PNS) during development. We propose that axoglial adhesion complexes contribute 
      to the formation of an interface between cytoskeletal elements enriched in
      Protein 4.1B and betaII spectrin and those enriched in nodal ankyrinG and betaIV 
      spectrin. This clusters nascent nodal complexes at heminodes and promotes their
      timely coalescence to form the mature node of Ranvier. These data demonstrate a
      role for the axon cytoskeleton in the assembly of a critical neuronal domain, the
      node of Ranvier.

TI  - A Large and Consistent Phylogenomic Dataset Supports Sponges as the Sister Group 
      to All Other Animals.

AB  - Resolving the early diversification of animal lineages has proven difficult, even
      using genome-scale datasets. Several phylogenomic studies have supported the
      classical scenario in which sponges (Porifera) are the sister group to all other 
      animals ("Porifera-sister" hypothesis), consistent with a single origin of the
      gut, nerve cells, and muscle cells in the stem lineage of eumetazoans
      (bilaterians + ctenophores + cnidarians). In contrast, several other studies have
      recovered an alternative topology in which ctenophores are the sister group to
      all other animals (including sponges). The "Ctenophora-sister" hypothesis implies
      that eumetazoan-specific traits, such as neurons and muscle cells, either evolved
      once along the metazoan stem lineage and were then lost in sponges and placozoans
      or evolved at least twice independently in Ctenophora and in Cnidaria +
      Bilateria. Here, we report on our reconstruction of deep metazoan relationships
      using a 1,719-gene dataset with dense taxonomic sampling of non-bilaterian
      animals that was assembled using a semi-automated procedure, designed to reduce
      known error sources. Our dataset outperforms previous metazoan gene
      superalignments in terms of data quality and quantity. Analyses with a
      best-fitting site-heterogeneous evolutionary model provide strong statistical
      support for placing sponges as the sister-group to all other metazoans, with
      ctenophores emerging as the second-earliest branching animal lineage. Only those 
      methodological settings that exacerbated long-branch attraction artifacts yielded
      Ctenophora-sister. These results show that methodological issues must be
      carefully addressed to tackle difficult phylogenetic questions and pave the road 
      to a better understanding of how fundamental features of animal body plans have
      emerged.

TI  - Long-Distance Range Expansion and Rapid Adjustment of Migration in a Newly

AB  - When bird populations spread, long-distance pioneering populations are often
      backfilled by a more slowly advancing front [1-3]. The Barn Swallow Hirundo
      rustica, a globally distributed passerine [4, 5], expanded its breeding range an 
      exceptional 7,000 km when it began breeding 35 years ago in its regular wintering
      range in Argentina [6], subsequently expanding over 500 km from its starting
      point [7-11]. Trans-hemispheric breeding attempts have occurred previously in
      related swallows [12-14], but only this colonization has lasted. Comparative
      studies of birds show a remarkable diversity in patterns of change in migratory
      habits [15-21], and these Argentine-breeding swallows might retain ancestral
      patterns, breeding in Argentina but returning to North America for the austral
      winter. Feather isotopes from these birds are consistent with the alternative
      possibility that they migrate no farther than northern South America [22].
      Because isotopic patterns cannot definitively distinguish these alternatives, we 
      pursued a solar geolocator study [23, 24] to do so. Data from nine tagged birds
      show conclusively that Barn Swallows breeding in Argentina have rapidly changed
      their movements to migrate no farther north in austral winter than northern South
      America. The phenology of the annual cycles of molt, migration, and breeding for 
      these Argentine-breeding swallows have all shifted by about 6 months, and we
      suggest that stimulatory day lengths and the proliferation of nesting substrates 
      facilitated their colonization.

AB  - Every year, 15 million preterm infants are born, and most spend their first weeks
      in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) [1]. Although essential for the support 
      and survival of these infants, NICU sensory environments are dramatically
      different from those in which full-term infants mature and thus likely impact the
      development of functional brain organization [2]. Yet the integrity of sensory
      systems determines effective perception and behavior [3, 4]. In neonates, touch
      is a cornerstone of interpersonal interactions and sensory-cognitive development 
      [5-7]. NICU treatments used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes rely heavily
      on touch [8]. However, we understand little of how brain maturation at birth
      (i.e., prematurity) and quality of early-life experiences (e.g., supportive
      versus painful touch) interact to shape the development of the somatosensory
      system [9]. Here, we identified the spatial, temporal, and amplitude
      characteristics of cortical responses to light touch that differentiate them from
      sham stimuli in full-term infants. We then utilized this data-driven analytical
      framework to show that the degree of prematurity at birth determines the extent
      to which brain responses to light touch (but not sham) are attenuated at the time
      of discharge from the hospital. Building on these results, we showed that, when
      controlling for prematurity and analgesics, supportive experiences (e.g.,
      breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care) are associated with stronger brain responses,
      whereas painful experiences (e.g., skin punctures, tube insertions) are
      associated with reduced brain responses to the same touch stimuli. Our results
      shed crucial insights into the mechanisms through which common early perinatal
      experiences may shape the somatosensory scaffolding of later perceptual,
      cognitive, and social development.

TI  - Persistent Single-Neuron Activity during Working Memory in the Human Medial
      Temporal Lobe.

AB  - Working memory is an essential component of human cognition. Persistent activity 
      related to working memory has been reported in many brain areas, including the
      inferior temporal and prefrontal cortex [1-8]. The medial temporal lobe (MTL)
      contains "concept cells" that respond invariantly to specific individuals or
      places whether presented as images, text, or speech [9, 10]. It is unknown,
      however, whether the MTL also participates in working memory processes. We thus
      sought to determine whether human MTL neurons respond to images held in working
      memory. We recorded from patients with chronically intractable epilepsy as they
      performed a task that required them to remember three or four sequentially
      presented pictures across a brief delay. 48% of visually selective neurons
      continued to carry image-specific information after image offset, but most ceased
      to encode previously presented images after a subsequent presentation of a
      different image. However, 8% of visually selective neurons encoded previously
      presented images during a final maintenance period, despite presentation of
      further images in the intervening interval. Population activity of
      stimulus-selective neurons predicted behavioral outcome in terms of correct and
      incorrect responses. These findings indicate that the MTL is part of a brain-wide
      network for working memory.

AB  - In a recent report in Current Biology, Xing and colleagues [1] present a small
      fragment of a vertebrate tail preserved in amber that bears integumentary
      appendages (DIP-V-15103, Dexu Institute of Paleontology, Chaozhou, China; Figure 
      1). Following several analyses using cutting-edge technology the authors conclude
      that: the tail belongs to a non-avian theropod dinosaur (non-avialan according to
      the authors, but non-avian used synonymously here); the dinosaur most likely was 
      a member of the Coelurosauria, possibly even Maniraptora; and, the integumentary 
      appendages are feathers that support a barbule-first evolutionary pattern for
      feathers. DIP-V-15103 is indeed an intriguing specimen with potential
      implications for contributing to understanding the evolution of feathers among
      dinosaurs, which remains a current and undoubtedly controversial topic [2,3].
      However, I would like to raise several concerns about the available evidence for 
      the phylogenetic hypothesis concerning the placement of DIP-V-15103 as concluded 
      by Xing and colleagues [1], and furthermore discuss the developmental
      trajectories predicted by them in light of their far-reaching evolutionary
      implications.

AB  - Positive emotional contagions are outwardly emotive actions that spread from one 
      individual to another, such as glee in preschool children [1] or laughter in
      humans of all ages [2]. The play vocalizations of some animals may also act as
      emotional contagions. For example, artificially deafened rats are less likely to 
      play than their non-hearing-impaired conspecifics, while no such effect is found 
      for blinded rats [3]. As rat play vocalizations are also produced in anticipation
      of play, they, rather than the play itself, may act as a contagion, leading to a 
      hypothesis of evolutionary parallels between rat play vocalizations and human
      laughter [4]. The kea parrot (Nestor notabilis) has complex play behaviour and a 
      distinct play vocalization [5]. We used acoustic playback to investigate the
      effect of play calls on wild kea, finding that play vocalizations increase the
      amount of play among both juveniles and adults, likely by acting as a positive
      emotional contagion.

AB  - The discrete and random nature of light absorption dictates that, when photons
      are scarce, images suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios [1]. Nocturnal animals 
      combat this by increasing photon catch, either optically, with large pupils,
      photoreceptors, and ever larger eyes [2], or neurally, with summation strategies,
      which sacrifice acuity and leave images blurry and slow [3]. Fast image motion
      produces the same problems as dim light: photon noise and low signal-to-noise
      ratio. As a result, fast animals often exhibit optical adaptations comparable to 
      nocturnal animals, but pronounced in lateral regions of the eye where images move
      quickly [4]. For example, flying insects typically increase equatorial curvature 
      between the front and side of the eye, which increases interommatidial angle and 
      improves light capture. Drosophila, curiously, show only minor changes in
      interommatidial angle [5]; but even without optical adaptations, they could
      potentially achieve a similar effect with neural summation. The optimal strategy 
      would manifest as acuity loss, specifically in regions of fast motion, and only
      parallel to motion. Photoreceptors need quick temporal dynamics to cope with fast
      motion [6], so the ideal filtering would additionally be spatial. To determine if
      fruit flies implement filtering driven by background optic flow, I tested their
      frequency-dependent steering and found that flow transiently eliminates high
      spatial frequency responses. This effect increases from forward to lateral visual
      regions, acts only parallel to flow direction, and filters only high spatial, not
      temporal, responses. Facultative summation may maximize visual information by
      improving sensitivity during fast flight, but limiting acuity loss when the fly
      is still.

AB  - Basement membranes (BMs) are thin, dense sheets of specialized, self-assembled
      extracellular matrix that surround most animal tissues (Figure 1, top). The
      emergence of BMs coincided with the origin of multicellularity in animals,
      suggesting that they were essential for the formation of tissues. Their
      sheet-like structure derives from two independent polymeric networks - one of
      laminin and one of type IV collagen (Figure 1, bottom). These independent
      collagen and laminin networks are thought to be linked by several additional
      extracellular matrix proteins, including nidogen and perlecan (Figure 1, bottom).
      BMs are usually associated with cells and are anchored to cell surfaces through
      interactions with adhesion receptors and sulfated glycolipids (Figure 1, bottom).
      Various combinations of other proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans -
      including fibulin, hemicentin, SPARC, agrin, and type XVIII collagen - are
      present in BMs, creating biochemically and biophysically distinct structures that
      serve a wide variety of functions. BMs have traditionally been viewed as static
      protein assemblies that provide structural support to tissues. However, recent
      studies have begun to uncover dynamic, active roles for BMs in many developmental
      processes. Here, we discuss established and emerging roles of BMs in development,
      tissue construction, and tissue homeostasis. We also explore how cells traverse
      BM barriers, the roles of BMs in human diseases, and future directions for the
      field.

AB  - Our visual system allows us to rapidly identify and intercept a moving object.
      When this object is far away, we base the trajectory on the target's location
      relative to an external frame of reference [1]. This process forms the basis for 
      the constant bearing angle (CBA) model, a reactive strategy that ensures
      interception since the bearing angle, formed between the line joining pursuer and
      target (called the range vector) and an external reference line, is held constant
      [2-4]. The CBA model may be a fundamental and widespread strategy, as it is also 
      known to explain the interception trajectories of bats and fish [5, 6]. Here, we 
      show that the aerial attack of the tiny robber fly Holcocephala fusca is
      consistent with the CBA model. In addition, Holcocephala fusca displays a novel
      proactive strategy, termed "lock-on" phase, embedded with the later part of the
      flight. We found the object detection threshold for this species to be 0.13
      degrees , enabled by an extremely specialized, forward pointing fovea (
      approximately 5 ommatidia wide, interommatidial angle Deltaphi = 0.28 degrees ,
      photoreceptor acceptance angle Deltarho = 0.27 degrees ). This study furthers our
      understanding of the accurate performance that a miniature brain can achieve in
      highly demanding sensorimotor tasks and suggests the presence of equivalent
      mechanisms for target interception across a wide range of taxa. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - The rise of a pest species represents a unique opportunity to address how species
      evolve new behaviors and adapt to novel ecological niches [1]. We address this
      question by studying the egg-laying behavior of Drosophila suzukii, an invasive
      agricultural pest species that has spread from Southeast Asia to Europe and North
      America in the last decade [2]. While most closely related Drosophila species lay
      their eggs on decaying plant substrates, D. suzukii oviposits on ripening fruit, 
      thereby causing substantial economic losses to the fruit industry [3-8]. D.
      suzukii has evolved an enlarged, serrated ovipositor that presumably plays a key 
      role by enabling females to pierce the skin of ripe fruit [9]. Here, we explore
      how D. suzukii selects oviposition sites, and how this behavior differs from that
      of closely related species. We have combined behavioral experiments in multiple
      species with neurogenetics and mutant analysis in D. suzukii to show that this
      species has evolved a specific preference for oviposition on ripe fruit. Our
      results also establish that changes in mechanosensation, olfaction, and
      presumably gustation have contributed to this ecological shift. Our observations 
      support a model in which the emergence of D. suzukii as an agricultural pest is
      the consequence of the progressive modification of several sensory systems, which
      collectively underlie a radical change in oviposition behavior.

AB  - The decision of stem cells to proliferate and differentiate is finely controlled.
      The Caenorhabditis elegans germline provides a tractable system for studying the 
      mechanisms that control stem cell proliferation and homeostasis [1-4]. Autophagy 
      is a conserved cellular recycling process crucial for cellular homeostasis in
      many different contexts [5], but its function in germline stem cell proliferation
      remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a function for autophagy in germline
      stem cell proliferation. We found that autophagy genes such as
      bec-1/BECN1/Beclin1, atg-16.2/ATG16L, atg-18/WIPI1/2, and atg-7/ATG7 are required
      for the late larval expansion of germline stem cell progenitors in the C. elegans
      gonad. We further show that BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 acts independently of the
      GLP-1/Notch or DAF-7/TGF-beta pathways but together with the DAF-2/insulin IGF-1 
      receptor (IIR) signaling pathway to promote germline stem cell proliferation.
      Similar to DAF-2/IIR, BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1, ATG-18/WIPI1/2, and ATG-16.2/ATG16L
      all promote cell-cycle progression and are negatively regulated by the
      phosphatase and tensin homolog DAF-18/PTEN. However, whereas BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 
      acts through the transcriptional regulator SKN-1/Nrf1, ATG-18/WIPI1/2 and
      ATG-16.2/ATG16L exert their function through the DAF-16/FOXO transcription
      factor. In contrast, ATG-7 functions in concert with the DAF-7/TGF-beta pathway
      to promote germline proliferation and is not required for cell-cycle progression.
      Finally, we report that BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 functions non-cell-autonomously to
      facilitate cell-cycle progression and stem cell proliferation. Our findings
      demonstrate a novel non-autonomous role for BEC-1/BECN1/Beclin1 in the control of
      stem cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, which may have implications
      for the understanding and development of therapies against malignant cell growth 
      in the future.

AB  - Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular defects of the CNS that
      arise from loss of integrity of the endothelial cells lining blood capillaries,
      causing leakage of blood into the brain [1]. This results in headaches, seizures,
      and/or hemorrhagic stroke, depending on the location of the lesion. CCM affects
      0.5% of the population and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
      caused by mutations in one of the three genes: CCM1 (gene name KRIT1), CCM2 (also
      known as malcavernin or OSM), and CCM3 (gene name PDCD10) [2, 3], with the
      earliest onset and most severe prognosis occurring in CCM3 patients [4]. The
      three CCM genes encode structurally distinct scaffold proteins that function in
      multiple complexes [5-9]. Using the C. elegans germline as a model of
      multicellular tube development, we show here that CCM-3 is enriched at the
      luminal membrane of the germline and the contractile ring of dividing cells in
      the embryo. Loss of ccm-3 results in defective RAB-11-mediated endocytic
      recycling, which in turn is necessary for gonadal lumen (rachis) formation,
      completion of cytokinesis, and localization of cell-surface receptors.
      CCM-3-mediated localization of anillin and non-muscle myosin to the lateral
      surfaces of germ cells is required for proper cytoskeletal organization,
      subsequent oocyte growth, and localization of polarity proteins. Biochemical
      analysis reveals conservation of the STRIPAK complex and distinct roles for GCK-1
      (germinal center kinase III family protein) and striatin/CASH-1 in controlling
      the localization and function of CCM-3. Taken together, our data establish CCM-3 
      as a novel regulator of rachis lumenization and polarity establishment during
      embryogenesis.

AB  - Germ cells in most animals are connected by intercellular bridges, actin-based
      rings that form stable cytoplasmic connections between cells promoting
      communication and coordination [1]. Moreover, these connections are required for 
      fertility [1, 2]. Intercellular bridges are proposed to arise from stabilization 
      of the cytokinetic ring during incomplete cytokinesis [1]. Paradoxically,
      proteins that promote closure of cytokinetic rings are enriched on stably open
      intercellular bridges [1, 3, 4]. Given this inconsistency, the mechanism of
      intercellular bridge stabilization is unclear. Here, we used the C. elegans
      germline as a model for identifying molecular mechanisms regulating intercellular
      bridges. We report that bridges are actually highly dynamic, changing size at
      precise times during germ cell development. We focused on the regulation of
      bridge stability by anillins, key regulators of cytokinetic rings and cytoplasmic
      bridges [1, 4-7]. We identified GCK-1, a conserved serine/threonine kinase [8],
      as a putative novel anillin interactor. GCK-1 works together with CCM-3, a known 
      binding partner [9], to promote intercellular bridge stability and limit
      localization of both canonical anillin and non-muscle myosin II (NMM-II) to
      intercellular bridges. Additionally, we found that a shorter anillin, known to
      stabilize bridges [4, 7], also regulates NMM-II levels at bridges. Consistent
      with these results, negative regulators of NMM-II stabilize intercellular bridges
      in the Drosophila egg chamber [10, 11]. Together with our findings, this suggests
      that tuning of myosin levels is a conserved mechanism for the stabilization of
      intercellular bridges that can occur by diverse molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1-4], but
      the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial,
      with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic
      evolution [5, 6]. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the 
      world's tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of
      socially parasitic myrmecophiles [7]. Remarkable among these are many species of 
      rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking "myrmecoid" body forms and
      are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts' societies: emigrating with
      colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with
      workers, but also consuming the brood [8-11]. Here, we demonstrate that myrmecoid
      rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this adaptive morphological and
      behavioral syndrome having evolved at least 12 times during the evolution of a
      single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is
      restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host specific on a single army 
      ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by
      substantial phylogenetic distances-as much as 105 million years. All such groups 
      arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, when army ants diversified into modern
      genera [12] and rose to ecological dominance [13, 14]. This work uncovers a rare 
      example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence,
      with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory
      during their parasitic adaptation to host colonies.

AB  - Central to the organization of behavior is the ability to predict the values of
      outcomes to guide choices. The accuracy of such predictions is honed by a
      teaching signal that indicates how incorrect a prediction was ("reward prediction
      error," RPE). In several reinforcement learning contexts, such as Pavlovian
      conditioning and decisions guided by reward history, this RPE signal is provided 
      by midbrain dopamine neurons. In many situations, however, the stimuli predictive
      of outcomes are perceptually ambiguous. Perceptual uncertainty is known to
      influence choices, but it has been unclear whether or how dopamine neurons factor
      it into their teaching signal. To cope with uncertainty, we extended a
      reinforcement learning model with a belief state about the perceptually ambiguous
      stimulus; this model generates an estimate of the probability of choice
      correctness, termed decision confidence. We show that dopamine responses in
      monkeys performing a perceptually ambiguous decision task comply with the model's
      predictions. Consequently, dopamine responses did not simply reflect a stimulus' 
      average expected reward value but were predictive of the trial-to-trial
      fluctuations in perceptual accuracy. These confidence-dependent dopamine
      responses emerged prior to monkeys' choice initiation, raising the possibility
      that dopamine impacts impending decisions, in addition to encoding a
      post-decision teaching signal. Finally, by manipulating reward size, we found
      that dopamine neurons reflect both the upcoming reward size and the confidence in
      achieving it. Together, our results show that dopamine responses convey teaching 
      signals that are also appropriate for perceptual decisions.

AB  - Axon degeneration during development is required to sculpt a functional nervous
      system and is also a hallmark of pathological insult, such as injury [1, 2].
      Despite similar morphological characteristics, very little overlap in molecular
      mechanisms has been reported between pathological and developmental degeneration 
      [3-5]. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), developmental axon pruning relies 
      on receptor-mediated extrinsic degeneration mechanisms to determine which axons
      are maintained or degenerated [5-7]. Receptors have not been implicated in
      Wallerian axon degeneration; instead, axon autonomous, intrinsic mechanisms are
      thought to be the primary driver for this type of axon disintegration [8-10].
      Here we survey the role of neuronally expressed, paralogous tumor necrosis factor
      receptor super family (TNFRSF) members in Wallerian degeneration. We find that an
      orphan receptor, death receptor 6 (DR6), is required to drive axon degeneration
      after axotomy in sympathetic and sensory neurons cultured in microfluidic
      devices. We sought to validate these in vitro findings in vivo using a transected
      sciatic nerve model. Consistent with the in vitro findings, DR6(-/-) animals
      displayed preserved axons up to 4 weeks after injury. In contrast to phenotypes
      observed in Wld(s) and Sarm1(-/-) mice, preserved axons in DR6(-/-) animals
      display profound myelin remodeling. This indicates that deterioration of axons
      and myelin after axotomy are mechanistically distinct processes. Finally, we find
      that JNK signaling after injury requires DR6, suggesting a link between this
      novel extrinsic pathway and the axon autonomous, intrinsic pathways that have
      become established for Wallerian degeneration.

AB  - Mechanical information is an important contributor to cell polarity in uni- and
      multicellular systems [1-3]. In planar tissues like the Drosophila wing, cell
      polarity reorients during growth as cells divide and reorganize [4]. In another
      planar tissue, the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis [5], polarized, asymmetric
      divisions of stomatal stem cells (meristemoid mother cells [MMCs]) are
      fundamental for the generation and patterning of multiple cell types, including
      stomata. The activity of key transcription factors, polarizing factors [6], and
      peptide signals [7] explains some local stomatal patterns emerging from the
      behavior of a few lineally related cells [6, 8-11]. Here we demonstrate that, in 
      addition to locally acting signals, tissue-wide mechanical forces can act as
      organizing cues, and that they do so by influencing the polarity of individual
      MMCs. If the mechanical stress environment in the tissue is altered through
      stretching or cell ablations, cellular polarity changes in response. In turn,
      polarity predicts the orientation of cellular and tissue outgrowth, leading to
      increased mechanical conflicts between neighboring cells. This interplay among
      growth, oriented divisions, and cell specification could contribute to the
      characteristic patterning of stomatal guard cells in the context of a growing
      leaf.

AB  - During the mid-Cretaceous, angiosperms diversified from several nondiverse
      lineages to their current global domination [1], replacing earlier gymnosperm
      lineages [2]. Several hypotheses explain this extensive radiation [3], one of
      which involves proliferation of insect pollinator associations in the transition 
      from gymnosperm to angiosperm dominance. However, most evidence supports
      gymnosperm-insect pollinator associations, buttressed by direct evidence of
      pollen on insect bodies, currently established for four groups: Thysanoptera
      (thrips), Neuroptera (lacewings), Diptera (flies), and now Coleoptera (beetles). 
      Each group represents a distinctive pollination mode linked to a unique mouthpart
      type and feeding guild [4-9]. Extensive indirect evidence, based on specialized
      head and mouthpart morphology, is present for one of these pollinator types, the 
      long-proboscid pollination mode [10], representing minimally ten family-level
      lineages of Neuroptera, Mecoptera (scorpionflies), and Diptera [8, 10, 11]. A
      recurring feature uniting these pollinator modes is host associations with
      ginkgoalean, cycad, conifer, and bennettitalean gymnosperms. Pollinator lineages 
      bearing these pollination modes were categorized into four evolutionary cohorts
      during the 35-million-year-long angiosperm radiation, each defined by its
      host-plant associations (gymnosperm or angiosperm) and evolutionary pattern
      (extinction, continuation, or origination) during this interval [12]. Here, we
      provide the first direct evidence for one cohort, exemplified by the beetle
      Darwinylus marcosi, family Oedemeridae (false blister beetles), that had an
      earlier gymnosperm (most likely cycad) host association, later transitioning onto
      angiosperms [13]. This association constitutes one of four patterns explaining
      the plateau of family-level plant lineages generally and pollinating insects
      specifically during the mid-Cretaceous angiosperm radiation [12].

AB  - The genus Drosophila contains over 2,000 species that, stemming from a common
      ancestor in the Old World Tropics, populate today very different environments [1,
      2] (reviewed in [3]). We found significant differences in the activity pattern of
      Drosophila species belonging to the holarctic virilis group, i.e., D. ezoana and 
      D. littoralis, collected in Northern Europe, compared to that of the cosmopolitan
      D. melanogaster, collected close to the equator. These behavioral differences
      might have been of adaptive significance for colonizing high-latitude habitats
      and hence adjust to long photoperiods. Most interestingly, the flies' locomotor
      activity correlates with the neurochemistry of their circadian clock network,
      which differs between low and high latitude for the expression pattern of the
      blue light photopigment cryptochrome (CRY) and the neuropeptide
      Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) [4-6]. In D. melanogaster, CRY and PDF are known 
      to modulate the timing of activity and to maintain robust rhythmicity under
      constant conditions [7-11]. We could partly simulate the rhythmic behavior of the
      high-latitude virilis group species by mimicking their CRY/PDF expression
      patterns in a laboratory strain of D. melanogaster. We therefore suggest that
      these alterations in the CRY/PDF clock neurochemistry might have allowed the
      virilis group species to colonize high-latitude environments.

AB  - Early visual experience sculpts neural mechanisms that regulate the balance of
      influence exerted by the two eyes on cortical mechanisms underlying binocular
      vision [1, 2], and experience's impact on this neural balancing act continues
      into adulthood [3-5]. One recently described, compelling example of adult neural 
      plasticity is the effect of patching one eye for a relatively short period of
      time: contrary to intuition, monocular visual deprivation actually improves the
      deprived eye's competitive advantage during a subsequent period of binocular
      rivalry [6-8], the robust form of visual competition prompted by dissimilar
      stimulation of the two eyes [9, 10]. Neural concomitants of this improvement in
      monocular dominance are reflected in measurements of brain responsiveness
      following eye patching [11, 12]. Here we report that patching an eye is
      unnecessary for producing this paradoxical deprivation effect: interocular
      suppression of an ordinarily visible stimulus being viewed by one eye is
      sufficient to produce shifts in subsequent predominance of that eye to an extent 
      comparable to that produced by patching the eye. Moreover, this imbalance in eye 
      dominance can also be induced by prior, extended viewing of two monocular images 
      differing only in contrast. Regardless of how shifts in eye dominance are
      induced, the effect decays once the two eyes view stimuli equal in strength.
      These novel findings implicate the operation of interocular neural gain control
      that dynamically adjusts the relative balance of activity between the two eyes
      [13, 14].

AB  - In order to produce rejuvenated daughters, dividing budding yeast cells confine
      aging factors, including protein aggregates, to the aging mother cell. The
      asymmetric inheritance of these protein deposits is mediated by organelle and
      cytoskeletal attachment and by cell geometry. Yet it remains unclear how deposit 
      formation is restricted to the aging lineage. Here, we show that selective
      membrane anchoring and the compartmentalization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      membrane confine protein deposit formation to aging cells during division.
      Supporting the idea that the age-dependent deposit forms through coalescence of
      smaller aggregates, two deposits rapidly merged when placed in the same cell by
      cell-cell fusion. The deposits localized to the ER membrane, primarily to the
      nuclear envelope (NE). Strikingly, weakening the diffusion barriers that separate
      the ER membrane into mother and bud compartments caused premature formation of
      deposits in the daughter cells. Detachment of the Hsp40 protein Ydj1 from the ER 
      membrane elicited a similar phenotype, suggesting that the diffusion barriers and
      farnesylated Ydj1 functioned together to confine protein deposit formation to
      mother cells during division. Accordingly, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy 
      measurements in dividing cells indicated that a slow-diffusing, possibly
      client-bound Ydj1 fraction was asymmetrically enriched in the mother compartment.
      This asymmetric distribution depended on Ydj1 farnesylation and intact diffusion 
      barriers. Taking these findings together, we propose that ER-anchored Ydj1 binds 
      deposit precursors and prevents them from spreading into daughter cells during
      division by subjecting them to the ER diffusion barriers. This ensures that the
      coalescence of precursors into a single deposit is restricted to the aging
      lineage.

AB  - With practice, humans tend to improve their performance on most tasks. But do
      such improvements then generalize to new tasks? Although early work documented
      primarily task-specific learning outcomes in the domain of perceptual learning
      [1-3], an emerging body of research has shown that significant learning
      generalization is possible under some training conditions [4-9]. Interestingly,
      however, research in this vein has focused nearly exclusively on just one
      possible manifestation of learning generalization, wherein training on one task
      produces an immediate boost to performance on the new task. For instance, it is
      this form of generalization that is most frequently referred to when discussing
      learning "transfer" [10, 11]. Essentially no work in this domain has focused on a
      second possible manifestation of generalization, wherein the knowledge or skills 
      acquired via training, despite not being directly applicable to the new task,
      nonetheless allow the new task to be learned more efficiently [12-15]. Here, in
      both the visual category learning and visual perceptual learning domains, we
      demonstrate that sequentially training participants on tasks that share a common 
      high-level task structure can produce faster learning of new tasks, even in cases
      where there is no immediate benefit to performance on the new tasks. We further
      show that methods commonly employed in the field may fail to detect or else
      conflate generalization that manifests as increased learning rate with
      generalization that manifests as immediate boosts to performance. These results
      thus lay the foundation for the various routes to learning generalization to be
      more thoroughly explored.

      NMNAT2 Deficiency In Vivo.

AB  - Axons require the axonal NAD-synthesizing enzyme NMNAT2 to survive. Injury or
      genetically induced depletion of NMNAT2 triggers axonal degeneration or defective
      axon growth. We have previously proposed that axonal NMNAT2 primarily promotes
      axon survival by maintaining low levels of its substrate NMN rather than
      generating NAD; however, this is still debated. NMN deamidase, a bacterial
      enzyme, shares NMN-consuming activity with NMNAT2, but not NAD-synthesizing
      activity, and it delays axon degeneration in primary neuronal cultures. Here we
      show that NMN deamidase can also delay axon degeneration in zebrafish larvae and 
      in transgenic mice. Like overexpressed NMNATs, NMN deamidase reduces NMN
      accumulation in injured mouse sciatic nerves and preserves some axons for up to
      three weeks, even when expressed at a low level. Remarkably, NMN deamidase also
      rescues axonal outgrowth and perinatal lethality in a dose-dependent manner in
      mice lacking NMNAT2. These data further support a pro-degenerative effect of
      accumulating NMN in axons in vivo. The NMN deamidase mouse will be an important
      tool to further probe the mechanisms underlying Wallerian degeneration and its
      prevention.

AB  - Blastocystis spp. are the most prevalent eukaryotic microbes found in the
      intestinal tract of humans. Here we present an in-depth investigation of lateral 
      gene transfer (LGT) in the genome of Blastocystis sp. subtype 1. Using rigorous
      phylogeny-based methods and strict validation criteria, we show that
      approximately 2.5% of the genes of this organism were recently acquired by LGT.
      We identify LGTs both from prokaryote and eukaryote donors. Several transfers
      occurred specifically in ancestors of a subset of Blastocystis subtypes,
      demonstrating that LGT is an ongoing process. Functional predictions reveal that 
      these genes are involved in diverse metabolic pathways, many of which appear
      related to adaptation of Blastocystis to the gut environment. Specifically, we
      identify genes involved in carbohydrate scavenging and metabolism, anaerobic
      amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, oxygen-stress resistance, and pH homeostasis.
      A number of the transferred genes encoded secreted proteins that are potentially 
      involved in infection, escaping host defense, or most likely affect the
      prokaryotic microbiome and the inflammation state of the gut. We also show that
      Blastocystis subtypes differ in the nature and copy number of LGTs that could
      relate to variation in their prevalence and virulence. Finally, we identified
      bacterial-derived genes encoding NH3-dependent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
      (NAD) synthase in Blastocystis and other protozoan parasites, which are promising
      targets for drug development. Collectively, our results suggest new avenues for
      research into the role of Blastocystis in intestinal disease and unequivocally
      demonstrate that LGT is an important mechanism by which eukaryotic microbes adapt
      to new environments.

AB  - From an ecological point of view, it is generally suggested that the main goal of
      vision in rats and mice is navigation and (aerial) predator evasion [1-3]. The
      latter requires fast and accurate detection of a change in the visual
      environment. An outstanding question is whether there are mechanisms in the
      rodent visual system that would support and facilitate visual change detection.
      An experimental protocol frequently used to investigate change detection in
      humans is the oddball paradigm, in which a rare, unexpected stimulus is presented
      in a train of stimulus repetitions [4]. A popular "predictive coding" theory of
      cortical responses states that neural responses should decrease for expected
      sensory input and increase for unexpected input [5, 6]. Despite evidence for
      response suppression and enhancement in noninvasive scalp recordings in humans
      with this paradigm [7, 8], it has proven challenging to observe both phenomena in
      invasive action potential recordings in other animals [9-11]. During a visual
      oddball experiment, we recorded multi-unit spiking activity in rat primary visual
      cortex (V1) and latero-intermediate area (LI), which is a higher area of the
      rodent ventral visual stream. In rat V1, there was only evidence for response
      suppression related to stimulus-specific adaptation, and not for response
      enhancement. However, higher up in area LI, spiking activity showed clear
      surprise-based response enhancement in addition to stimulus-specific adaptation. 
      These results show that neural responses along the rat ventral visual stream
      become increasingly sensitive to changes in the visual environment, suggesting a 
      system specialized in the detection of unexpected events.

AB  - The recent discovery of the positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) Orsay
      virus (OV) as a natural pathogen of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has
      stimulated interest in exploring virus-nematode interactions. However, OV
      infection is restricted to a small number of intestinal cells, even in nematodes 
      defective in their antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) response, and is neither
      lethal nor vertically transmitted. Using a fluorescent reporter strain of the
      negative-sense ssRNA vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we show that
      microinjection of VSV particles leads to a dose-dependent, muscle tissue-tropic, 
      lethal infection in C. elegans. Furthermore, we find nematodes deficient for
      components of the antiviral RNAi pathway, such as Dicer-related helicase 1
      (DRH-1), to display hypersusceptibility to VSV infection as evidenced by elevated
      infection rates, virus replication in multiple tissue types, and earlier
      mortality. Strikingly, infection of oocytes and embryos could also be observed in
      drh-1 mutants. Our results suggest that the antiviral RNAi response not only
      inhibits vertical VSV transmission but also promotes transgenerational
      inheritance of antiviral immunity. Our study introduces a new, in vivo virus-host
      model system for exploring arbovirus pathogenesis and provides the first evidence
      for vertical pathogen transmission in C. elegans.

AB  - Sex determination is as important for the fitness of plants as it is for animals,
      but its mechanisms appear to vary much more among plants than among animals, and 
      the expression of gender in plants differs in important respects from that in
      most animals. In this Minireview, I provide an overview of the broad variety of
      ways in which plants determine sex. I suggest that several important
      peculiarities of plant sex determination can be understood by recognising that:
      plants show an alternation of generations between sporophytic and gametophytic
      phases (either of which may take control of sex determination); plants are
      modular in structure and lack a germ line (allowing for a quantitative expression
      of gender that is not common in animals); and separate sexes in plants have
      ultimately evolved from hermaphroditic ancestors. Most theorising about sex
      determination in plants has focused on dioecious species, but we have much to
      learn from monecious or hermaphroditic species, where sex is determined at the
      level of modules, tissues or cells. Because of the fundamental modularity of
      plant development and potentially important evolutionary links between monoecy
      and dioecy, it may be useful to relax the distinction often made between
      'developmental sex determination' (which underpins the development of male versus
      female flowers in monoecious species) and 'genetic sex determination' (which
      underpins the separation of males and females in dioecious species, often
      mediated by a genetic polymorphism and sex chromosomes). I also argue for
      relaxing the distinction between sex determination involving a genetic
      polymorphism and that involving responses to environmental or hormonal cues,
      because non-genetic cues might easily be converted into genetic switches.

AB  - China ranks first among Northern hemisphere countries for species richness, but
      approximately 43% of its species are threatened [1], with harvesting being the
      major threat to vertebrates [2]. To protect its biodiversity, China has
      established about 2,700 nature reserves covering 1.46 million km(2) ( about 15%
      of China's territory, a percentage higher than the world average [3]). With
      increasing habitat destruction and harvesting, nature reserves are the final
      refugia for threatened species. However, many Chinese nature reserves are poorly 
      managed, leaving them vulnerable to poaching and other human encroachment [4]. In
      this study, we conducted a 12-year (2002-2013) case study on turtles to
      illustrate the damaging impacts China's nature reserves have on wildlife
      conservation. We discovered that poaching occurred in all of the 56 reserves
      surveyed, resulting in dramatically reduced turtle populations. In a majority of 
      the reserves, the reserve staff themselves were involved in poaching. Although
      nature reserves were created to protect plants and animals, they have become part
      of the problem due to weak enforcement of rules.

AB  - The individual molecular pathways downstream of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho GTPases are
      well documented, but we know surprisingly little about how these pathways are
      coordinated when cells move in a complex environment in vivo. In the developing
      embryo, melanoblasts originating from the neural crest must traverse the dermis
      to reach the epidermis of the skin and hair follicles. We previously established 
      that Rac1 signals via Scar/WAVE and Arp2/3 to effect pseudopod extension and
      migration of melanoblasts in skin. Here we show that RhoA is redundant in the
      melanocyte lineage but that Cdc42 coordinates multiple motility systems
      independent of Rac1. Similar to Rac1 knockouts, Cdc42 null mice displayed a
      severe loss of pigmentation, and melanoblasts showed cell-cycle progression,
      migration, and cytokinesis defects. However, unlike Rac1 knockouts, Cdc42 null
      melanoblasts were elongated and displayed large, bulky pseudopods with dynamic
      actin bursts. Despite assuming an elongated shape usually associated with fast
      mesenchymal motility, Cdc42 knockout melanoblasts migrated slowly and
      inefficiently in the epidermis, with nearly static pseudopods. Although much of
      the basic actin machinery was intact, Cdc42 null cells lacked the ability to
      polarize their Golgi and coordinate motility systems for efficient movement. Loss
      of Cdc42 de-coupled three main systems: actin assembly via the formin FMNL2 and
      Arp2/3, active myosin-II localization, and integrin-based adhesion dynamics.

AB  - Cytokinesis depends on a contractile actomyosin ring in many eukaryotes [1-3].
      Myosin II is a key component of the actomyosin ring, although whether it
      functions as a motor or as an actin cross-linker to exert its essential role is
      disputed [1, 4, 5]. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the myo2-E1 mutation affects
      the upper 50 kDa sub-domain of the myosin II heavy chain, and cells carrying this
      lethal mutation are defective in actomyosin ring assembly at the non-permissive
      temperature [6, 7]. myo2-E1 also affects actomyosin ring contraction when rings
      isolated from permissive temperature-grown cells are incubated with ATP [8]. Here
      we report isolation of a compensatory suppressor mutation in the lower 50 kDa
      sub-domain (myo2-E1-Sup1) that reverses the inability of myo2-E1 to form colonies
      at the restrictive temperature. myo2-E1-Sup1 is capable of assembling normal
      actomyosin rings, although rings isolated from myo2-E1-Sup1 are defective in
      ATP-dependent contraction in vitro. Furthermore, the product of myo2-E1-Sup1 does
      not translocate actin filaments in motility assays in vitro. Superimposition of
      myo2-E1 and myo2-E1-Sup1 on available rigor and blebbistatin-bound myosin II
      structures suggests that myo2-E1-Sup1 may represent a novel actin
      translocation-defective allele. Actomyosin ring contraction and viability of
      myo2-E1-Sup1 cells depend on the late cytokinetic S. pombe myosin II isoform,
      Myp2p, a non-essential protein that is normally dispensable for actomyosin ring
      assembly and contraction. Our work reveals that Myo2p may function in two
      different and essential modes during cytokinesis: a motor activity-independent
      form that can promote actomyosin ring assembly and a motor activity-dependent
      form that supports ring contraction.

AB  - The conserved transmembrane protein, HAP2/GCS1, has been linked to fertility in a
      wide range of taxa and is hypothesized to be an ancient gamete fusogen. Using
      template-based structural homology modeling, we now show that the ectodomain of
      HAP2 orthologs from Tetrahymena thermophila and other species adopt a protein
      fold remarkably similar to the dengue virus E glycoprotein and related class II
      viral fusogens. To test the functional significance of this predicted structure, 
      we developed a flow-cytometry-based assay that measures cytosolic exchange across
      the conjugation junction to rapidly probe the effects of HAP2 mutations in the
      Tetrahymena system. Using this assay, alterations to a region in and around a
      predicted "fusion loop" in T. thermophila HAP2 were found to abrogate membrane
      pore formation in mating cells. Consistent with this, a synthetic peptide
      corresponding to the HAP2 fusion loop was found to interact directly with model
      membranes in a variety of biophysical assays. These results raise interesting
      questions regarding the evolutionary relationships of class II membrane fusogens 
      and harken back to a long-held argument that eukaryotic sex arose as the
      byproduct of selection for the horizontal transfer of a "selfish" genetic element
      from cell to cell via membrane fusion.

AB  - At least some animal species can generate neurons from mesoderm or endoderm, but 
      the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We screened for C. elegans mutants in
      which the presumptive mesoderm-derived I4 neuron adopts a muscle-like cell fate. 
      From this screen, we identified HLH-3, the C. elegans homolog of a mammalian
      proneural protein (Ascl1) used for in vitro neuronal reprogramming, as required
      for efficient I4 neurogenesis. We discovered that the CDK-8 Mediator kinase
      module acts together with a second proneural protein, HLH-2, and in parallel to
      HLH-3 to promote I4 neurogenesis. Genetic analysis revealed that CDK-8 most
      likely promotes I4 neurogenesis by inhibiting the CDK-7/CYH-1 (CDK7/cyclin H)
      kinase module of the transcription initiation factor TFIIH. Ectopic expression of
      HLH-2 and HLH-3 together promoted expression of neuronal features in non-neuronal
      cells. These findings reveal that the Mediator CDK8 kinase module can promote
      non-ectodermal neurogenesis and suggest that inhibiting CDK7/cyclin H might
      similarly promote neurogenesis.

AB  - The formation of Casparian strips and suberin lamellae at the endodermis limits
      the free diffusion of nutrients and harmful substances via the apoplastic space
      between the soil solution and the stele in roots [1-3]. Casparian strips are
      ring-like lignin polymers deposited in the middle of anticlinal cell walls
      between endodermal cells and fill the gap between them [4-6]. Suberin lamellae
      are glycerolipid polymers covering the endodermal cells and likely function as a 
      barrier to limit transmembrane movement of apoplastic solutes into the endodermal
      cells [7, 8]. However, the current knowledge on the formation of these two
      distinct endodermal barriers and their regulatory role in nutrient transport is
      still limited. Here, we identify an uncharacterized gene, LOTR1, essential for
      Casparian strip formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The lotr1 mutants display
      altered localization of CASP1, an essential protein for Casparian strip formation
      [9], disrupted Casparian strips, ectopic suberization of endodermal cells, and
      low accumulation of shoot calcium (Ca). Degradation by expression of a
      suberin-degrading enzyme in the mutants revealed that the ectopic suberization at
      the endodermal cells limits Ca transport through the transmembrane pathway,
      thereby causing reduced Ca delivery to the shoot. Moreover, analysis of the
      mutants showed that suberin lamellae function as an apoplastic diffusion barrier 
      to the stele at sites of lateral root emergence where Casparian strips are
      disrupted. Our findings suggest that the transmembrane pathway through
      unsuberized endodermal cells, rather than the sites of lateral root emergence,
      mediates the transport of apoplastic substances such as Ca into the xylem.

AB  - Noise is a ubiquitous source of errors in all forms of communication [1].
      Noise-induced errors in speech communication, for example, make it difficult for 
      humans to converse in noisy social settings, a challenge aptly named the
      "cocktail party problem" [2]. Many nonhuman animals also communicate acoustically
      in noisy social groups and thus face biologically analogous problems [3].
      However, we know little about how the perceptual systems of receivers are
      evolutionarily adapted to avoid the costs of noise-induced errors in
      communication. In this study of Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis;
      Hylidae), we investigated whether receivers exploit a potential statistical
      regularity present in noisy acoustic scenes to reduce errors in signal
      recognition and discrimination. We developed an anatomical/physiological model of
      the peripheral auditory system to show that temporal correlation in amplitude
      fluctuations across the frequency spectrum ("comodulation") [4-6] is a feature of
      the noise generated by large breeding choruses of sexually advertising males. In 
      four psychophysical experiments, we investigated whether females exploit
      comodulation in background noise to mitigate noise-induced errors in
      evolutionarily critical mate-choice decisions. Subjects experienced fewer errors 
      in recognizing conspecific calls and in selecting the calls of high-quality mates
      in the presence of simulated chorus noise that was comodulated. These data show
      unequivocally, and for the first time, that exploiting statistical regularities
      present in noisy acoustic scenes is an important biological strategy for solving 
      cocktail-party-like problems in nonhuman animal communication.

AB  - Insects, like most animals, tend to steer away from imminent threats [1-7].
      Drosophila melanogaster, for example, generally initiate an escape take-off in
      response to a looming visual stimulus, mimicking a potential predator [8]. The
      escape response to a visual threat is, however, flexible [9-12] and can
      alternatively consist of walking backward away from the perceived threat [11],
      which may be a more effective response to ambush predators such as nymphal
      praying mantids [7]. Flexibility in escape behavior may also add an element of
      unpredictability that makes it difficult for predators to anticipate or learn the
      prey's likely response [3-6]. Whereas the fly's escape jump has been well studied
      [8, 9, 13-18], the neuronal underpinnings of evasive walking remain largely
      unexplored. We previously reported the identification of a cluster of descending 
      neurons-the moonwalker descending neurons (MDNs)-the activity of which is
      necessary and sufficient to trigger backward walking [19], as well as a
      population of visual projection neurons-the lobula columnar 16 (LC16) cells-that 
      respond to looming visual stimuli and elicit backward walking and turning [11].
      Given the similarity of their activation phenotypes, we hypothesized that LC16
      neurons induce backward walking via MDNs and that turning while walking backward 
      might reflect asymmetric activation of the left and right MDNs. Here, we present 
      data from functional imaging, behavioral epistasis, and unilateral activation
      experiments that support these hypotheses. We conclude that LC16 and MDNs are
      critical components of the neural circuit that transduces threatening visual
      stimuli into directional locomotor output.

AB  - Cooling and hypothermia are profoundly neuroprotective, mediated, at least in
      part, by the cold shock protein, RBM3. However, the neuroprotective effector
      proteins induced by RBM3 and the mechanisms by which mRNAs encoding cold shock
      proteins escape cooling-induced translational repression are unknown. Here, we
      show that cooling induces reprogramming of the translatome, including the
      upregulation of a new cold shock protein, RTN3, a reticulon protein implicated in
      synapse formation. We report that this has two mechanistic components. Thus, RTN3
      both evades cooling-induced translational elongation repression and is also bound
      by RBM3, which drives the increased expression of RTN3. In mice, knockdown of
      RTN3 expression eliminated cooling-induced neuroprotection. However, lentivirally
      mediated RTN3 overexpression prevented synaptic loss and cognitive deficits in a 
      mouse model of neurodegeneration, downstream and independently of RBM3. We
      conclude that RTN3 expression is a mediator of RBM3-induced neuroprotection,
      controlled by novel mechanisms of escape from translational inhibition on
      cooling.

AB  - The delineation of sensorimotor circuits that guide exploration begins with an
      understanding of the pattern of motor outputs [1]. These motor patterns provide a
      clue to the form of the underlying circuits [2-4] (but see [5]). We focus on the 
      behaviors that rodents use to explore their peripersonal space through
      goal-directed positioning of their nose, head, and vibrissae. Rodents sniff in
      response to novel odors, reward expectation, and as part of social interactions
      [6-12]. Sniffing serves olfaction [13, 14], while whisking synchronized to
      sniffing serves vibrissa-based touch [6, 15, 16]. We quantify the ethology of
      exploratory nose and head movements in relation to breathing. We find that
      sniffing is accompanied by prominent lateral and vertical deflections of the
      nose, i.e., twitches, which are driven by activation of the deflector nasi
      muscles [17]. On the timescale of individual breaths, nose motion is rhythmic and
      has a maximum deflection following the onset of inspiration. On a longer
      timescale, excursions of the nose persist for several breaths and are accompanied
      by an asymmetry in vibrissa positioning toward the same side of the face. Such
      directed deflections can be triggered by a lateralized source of odor. Lastly,
      bobbing of the head as the animal cranes and explores is phase-locked to sniffing
      and to movement of the nose. These data, along with prior results on the
      resetting of the whisk cycle at the onset of inspiration [15, 16, 18], reveal
      that the onset of each breath initiates a "snapshot" of the orofacial sensory
      environment. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

      Rorqual Whales.

AB  - Peripheral nerves are susceptible to stretch injury [1-4] and incorporate
      structural waviness at the level of the axons, fascicles, and nerve trunk to
      accommodate physiological increases in length [5, 6]. It is unknown whether there
      are limits to the amount of deformation that waviness can accommodate. In rorqual
      whales, a sub-group of baleen whales, nerves running through the ventral groove
      blubber (VGB) associated with the floor of the mouth routinely experience
      dramatically large deformations. In fact, some of these nerves more than double
      their length during lunge feeding and then recoil to a short, compressed state
      after each lunge [7-9]. It is unknown how these nerves have adapted to operate in
      both extended and recoiled states. Using micro-CT and mechanics, we have
      discovered that the VGB nerves from fin whales require two levels of waviness to 
      prevent stretch damage in both extended and recoiled states. The entire nerve
      core itself is highly folded when recoiled and appears buckled. This folding
      provides slack for extension but unavoidably generates large stretches at the
      bends that could damage nerve fascicles within the core. The strain at the bends 
      is minimized by the specific waveform adopted by the core [10, 11], while the
      existing bending strains are accommodated by a second level of waviness in the
      individual fascicles that avoids stretch of the fascicle itself. Structural
      hierarchy partitions the waviness between the two length scales, providing a
      mechanism to maintain total elongation while preventing the stretching of
      fascicles at the bends when recoiled.

AB  - Comparing synaptic circuits and networks between brains of different animal
      groups helps us derive an understanding of how nervous systems might have
      evolved. The circuits of the startle response pathway in the brains of tailed
      vertebrates are known from electrophysiological studies on the giant
      reticulospinal Mauthner cells (M-cells). To identify morphological counterparts
      in chordate tunicates, a sister group of vertebrates [1, 2], we have compiled a
      densely reconstructed connectome (defined in [3]) for the CNS in the tadpole
      larva of Ciona intestinalis (L.), using ssEM [4]. The dorsal, tubular CNS of the 
      approximately 1-mm tadpole larva is built on a similar plan to vertebrates, its
      neurons distributed rostrocaudally in three centers, a brain vesicle, motor
      ganglion, and caudal nerve cord [5]. A single pair of descending decussating
      neurons, ddNs, found in the motor ganglion, have similarities to reticulospinal
      neurons descending from the vertebrate hindbrain to the spinal cord. The pre- and
      postsynaptic connections and circuits of these ddNs support their homology with
      decussating vertebrate M-cells. Network analysis reveals that, like M-cells, ddNs
      receive mechanosensory input from the peripheral nervous system and provide input
      to motoneurons, premotor interneurons, and ascending commissural inhibitory
      neurons (ACINs). These circuits uncover a putative homologous startle network in 
      the Ciona tadpole. However, differences in circuits, including a lack of
      bilateral symmetry in their network, and convergence of inputs from left and
      right sides, raise questions about the relationship between form and function,
      and are a possible outcome of the tiny number of neurons in ascidian larvae.

AB  - Actin filaments assemble into a variety of networks to provide force for diverse 
      cellular processes [1]. Tropomyosins are coiled-coil dimers that form
      head-to-tail polymers along actin filaments and regulate interactions of other
      proteins, including actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilins and myosins, with 
      actin [2-5]. In mammals, >40 tropomyosin isoforms can be generated through
      alternative splicing from four tropomyosin genes. Different isoforms display
      non-redundant functions and partially non-overlapping localization patterns, for 
      example within the stress fiber network [6, 7]. Based on cell biological studies,
      it was thus proposed that tropomyosin isoforms may specify the functional
      properties of different actin filament populations [2]. To test this hypothesis, 
      we analyzed the properties of actin filaments decorated by
      stress-fiber-associated tropomyosins (Tpm1.6, Tpm1.7, Tpm2.1, Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and
      Tpm4.2). These proteins bound F-actin with high affinity and competed with
      alpha-actinin for actin filament binding. Importantly, total internal reflection 
      fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of fluorescently tagged proteins revealed that
      most tropomyosin isoforms cannot co-polymerize with each other on actin
      filaments. These isoforms also bind actin with different dynamics, which
      correlate with their effects on actin-binding proteins. The long isoforms Tpm1.6 
      and Tpm1.7 displayed stable interactions with actin filaments and protected
      filaments from ADF/cofilin-mediated disassembly, but did not activate non-muscle 
      myosin IIa (NMIIa). In contrast, the short isoforms Tpm3.1, Tpm3.2, and Tpm4.2
      displayed rapid dynamics on actin filaments and stimulated the ATPase activity of
      NMIIa, but did not efficiently protect filaments from ADF/cofilin. Together,
      these data provide experimental evidence that tropomyosin isoforms segregate to
      different actin filaments and specify functional properties of distinct actin
      filament populations.

      to Drive Alternative Startle Behaviors.

AB  - The reticulospinal Mauthner cells (M-cells) of the startle circuit have been
      considered to be dedicated to one basic motor output and the C-type startle
      response in fish. The neural circuit underlying the C-start, a startle behavior
      in which the fish forms a "C"-shaped body bend has been described in depth in
      goldfish and zebrafish [1, 2] and is thought to occur in other species [3, 4].
      However, previous research has shown that some species can perform a second type 
      of startle called the S-start [5-7]. This startle response, in which the first
      movement creates an "S"-shaped body bend achieved with regional muscle activity
      on left and right sides, cannot be explained by M-cell circuit models. Here we
      use larval zebrafish to examine the S-start circuit. Since S-starts are elicited 
      through tail stimulation [5-7] and ablating M-cells abolishes short-latency
      tail-elicited startles [8, 9], we hypothesized that M-cell activity was necessary
      for S-start generation. Our findings show that the M-cells fire simultaneously to
      generate the S-start. However, simultaneous M-cell spikes generated through
      direct current injection were not sufficient to generate S-starts. Through
      recordings of motoneurons, inhibitory interneurons, and sensory neurons, we
      uncover a mechanism for generating alternative startle behaviors; local sensory
      inputs drive inhibitory interneuron activity, which inhibits caudal motoneurons
      and pre-conditions their excitability prior to the arrival of M-cell spikes in
      the tail. We suggest that this motoneuron hyperpolarization can bias motor output
      to left or right sides, determining whether the fish performs a C-start or an
      S-start behavior.

AB  - Regeneration in many organisms involves the formation of a blastema, which
      differentiates and organizes into the appropriate missing tissues. How blastema
      pattern is generated and integrated with pre-existing tissues is a central
      question in the field of regeneration. Planarians are free-living flatworms
      capable of rapidly regenerating from small body fragments [1]. A cell cluster at 
      the anterior tip of planarian head blastemas (the anterior pole) is required for 
      anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) blastema patterning [2-4].
      Transplantation of the head tip into tails induced host tissues to grow patterned
      head-like outgrowths containing a midline. Given the important patterning role of
      the anterior pole, understanding how it becomes localized during regeneration
      would help explain how wounds establish pattern in new tissue. Anterior pole
      progenitors were specified at the pre-existing midline of regenerating fragments,
      even when this location deviated from the ML median plane of the wound face.
      Anterior pole progenitors were specified broadly on the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis 
      and subsequently formed a cluster at the DV boundary of the animal. We propose
      that three landmarks of pre-existing tissue at wounds set the location of
      anterior pole formation: a polarized AP axis, the pre-existing midline, and the
      dorsal-ventral median plane. Subsequently, blastema pattern is organized around
      the anterior pole. This process, utilizing positional information in existing
      tissue at unpredictably shaped wounds, can influence the patterning of new tissue
      in a manner that facilitates integration with pre-existing tissue in
      regeneration.

AB  - The gaseous second messenger nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to regulate memory 
      formation by activating retrograde signaling cascades from post- to presynapse
      that involve cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production to induce synaptic 
      plasticity and transcriptional changes. In this study, we analyzed the role of NO
      in the formation of a visual working memory that lasts only a few seconds. This
      memory is encoded in a subset of ring neurons that form the ellipsoid body in the
      Drosophila brain. Using genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we show that
      NO signaling is required for cGMP-mediated CREB activation, leading to the
      expression of competence factors like the synaptic homer protein. Interestingly, 
      this cell-autonomous function can also be fulfilled by hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
      through a converging pathway, revealing for the first time that endogenously
      produced H2S has a role in memory processes. Notably, the NO synthase is strictly
      localized to the axonal output branches of the ring neurons, and this
      localization seems to be necessary for a second, phasic role of NO signaling. We 
      provide evidence for a model where NO modulates the opening of cGMP-regulated
      cation channels to encode a short-term memory trace. Local production of NO/cGMP 
      in restricted branches of ring neurons seems to represent the engram for objects,
      and comparing signal levels between individual ring neurons is used to orient the
      fly during search behavior. Due to its short half-life, NO seems to be a uniquely
      suited second messenger to encode working memories that have to be restricted in 
      their duration.

AB  - Pharyngeal gills are a fundamental feature of the vertebrate body plan [1].
      However, the evolutionary history of vertebrate gills has been the subject of a
      long-standing controversy [2-8]. It is thought that gills evolved independently
      in cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed
      vertebrates-cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic
      origins: the gills of cyclostomes derive from endoderm [9-12], while gnathostome 
      gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we
      demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the
      little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding
      supports the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and a single
      origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient
      vertebrate lineages.

AB  - Many animals rely on vision to detect objects such as conspecifics, predators,
      and prey. Hypercomplex cells found in feline cortex and small target motion
      detectors found in dragonfly and hoverfly optic lobes demonstrate robust tuning
      for small objects, with weak or no response to larger objects or movement of the 
      visual panorama [1-3]. However, the relationship among anatomical, molecular, and
      functional properties of object detection circuitry is not understood. Here we
      characterize a specialized object detector in Drosophila, the lobula columnar
      neuron LC11 [4]. By imaging calcium dynamics with two-photon excitation
      microscopy, we show that LC11 responds to the omni-directional movement of a
      small object darker than the background, with little or no responses to static
      flicker, vertically elongated bars, or panoramic gratings. LC11 dendrites
      innervate multiple layers of the lobula, and each dendrite spans enough columns
      to sample 75 degrees of visual space, yet the area that evokes calcium responses 
      is only 20 degrees wide and shows robust responses to a 2.2 degrees object
      spanning less than half of one facet of the compound eye. The dendrites of
      neighboring LC11s encode object motion retinotopically, but the axon terminals
      fuse into a glomerular structure in the central brain where retinotopy is lost.
      Blocking inhibitory ionic currents abolishes small object sensitivity and
      facilitates responses to elongated bars and gratings. Our results reveal
      high-acuity object motion detection in the Drosophila optic lobe.

AB  - One of the enduring questions that has driven neuroscientific enquiry in the last
      century has been the nature of differences in the prefrontal cortex of humans
      versus other animals [1]. The prefrontal cortex has drawn particular interest due
      to its role in a range of evolutionarily specialized cognitive capacities such as
      language [2], imagination [3], and complex decision making [4]. Both
      cytoarchitectonic [5] and comparative neuroimaging [6] studies have converged on 
      the conclusion that the proportion of prefrontal cortex in the human brain is
      greatly increased relative to that of other primates. However, considering the
      tremendous overall expansion of the neocortex in human evolution, it has proven
      difficult to ascertain whether this extent of prefrontal enlargement follows
      general allometric growth patterns, or whether it is exceptional [1]. Species'
      adherence to a common allometric relationship suggests conservation through
      phenotypic integration, while species' deviations point toward the occurrence of 
      shifts in genetic and/or developmental mechanisms. Here we investigate prefrontal
      cortex scaling across anthropoid primates and find that great ape and human
      prefrontal cortex expansion are non-allometrically derived features of cortical
      organization. This result aligns with evidence for a developmental heterochronic 
      shift in human prefrontal growth [7, 8], suggesting an association between
      neurodevelopmental changes and cortical organization on a macroevolutionary
      scale. The evolutionary origin of non-allometric prefrontal enlargement is
      estimated to lie at the root of great apes ( approximately 19-15 mya), indicating
      that selection for changes in executive cognitive functions characterized both
      great ape and human cortical organization.

AB  - Some bacteria glide mysteriously on surfaces without using flagella, pili, or
      other external appendages. Recent studies suggest how gliding motors in the inner
      membrane may transduce force to the cell surface.

AB  - Studies of the neural control of locomotion have tended to focus on the
      modulation of motoneuron firing by premotor neurons; new work indicates that the 
      regulation of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction can also be
      important, revealing an inverse relationship between input resistance and
      synaptic output in motoneurons.

AB  - It is not unexpected that a proposal, such as ours [1], of four new mammalian
      species stirs up controversy, as evident in the correspondence by Bercovitch et
      al.[2]. We appreciate that their concerns are unrelated to the quality of the
      genetic data, the methodological approach or analyses, but are focused on the
      interpretation. Thus, we provided an analysis of giraffe speciation based on
      genomic sequence data, and not just "another viewpoint on giraffe taxonomy" [2]. 
      We maintain our perspective that there is not only one but four species of
      giraffe (Figure 1).

AB  - In a recent paper in Current Biology, Fennessy and colleagues [1] conclude that
      there are four species of giraffe and that their numbers are declining in Africa.
      Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are presently classified as one species, with
      nine subspecies, which are considered 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN Red List [2]. The 
      present consensus of one species divided into nine subspecies has previously been
      questioned (Supplemental information), and Fennessy and colleagues [1] provide
      another viewpoint on giraffe taxonomy. The fundamental reason for different
      taxonomic interpretations is that they are based upon different datasets that
      adopt different statistical techniques and follow different criteria for
      nomenclature.

AB  - Elephant populations are in peril everywhere, but forest elephants in Central
      Africa have sustained alarming losses in the last decade [1]. Large, remote
      protected areas are thought to best safeguard forest elephants by supporting
      large populations buffered from habitat fragmentation, edge effects and human
      pressures. One such area, the Minkebe National Park (MNP), Gabon, was created
      chiefly for its reputation of harboring a large elephant population. MNP held the
      highest densities of elephants in Central Africa at the turn of the century, and 
      was considered a critical sanctuary for forest elephants because of its
      relatively large size and isolation. We assessed population change in the park
      and its surroundings between 2004 and 2014. Using two independent modeling
      approaches, we estimated a 78-81% decline in elephant numbers over ten years - a 
      loss of more than 25,000 elephants. While poaching occurs from within Gabon,
      cross-border poaching largely drove the precipitous drop in elephant numbers.
      With nearly 50% of forest elephants in Central Africa thought to reside in Gabon 
      [1], their loss from the park is a considerable setback for the preservation of
      the species.

AB  - Nociception, the sensory mechanism that allows animals to sense and avoid
      potentially tissue-damaging stimuli, is critical for survival. This process
      relies on nociceptors, which are specialized neurons that detect and respond to
      potentially damaging forms of energy - heat, mechanical and chemical - in the
      environment. Nociceptors accomplish this task through the expression of molecules
      that function to detect and signal the presence of potential harm. Downstream of 
      the nociceptive sensory input, the neural signals trigger protective
      (nocifensive) behaviors, and the sensory stimuli that reach the brain may be
      perceived as painful.

TI  - The Evolution of Lateralization in Group Hunting Sailfish.
PG  - 521-526

AB  - Lateralization is widespread throughout the animal kingdom [1-7] and can increase
      task efficiency via shortening reaction times and saving on neural tissue [8-16].
      However, lateralization might be costly because it increases predictability
      [17-21]. In predator-prey interactions, for example, predators might increase
      capture success because of specialization in a lateralized attack, but at the
      cost of increased predictability to their prey, constraining the evolution of
      lateralization. One unexplored mechanism for evading such costs is group hunting:
      this would allow individual-level specialization, while still allowing for
      group-level unpredictability. We investigated this mechanism in group hunting
      sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, attacking schooling sardines, Sardinella
      aurita. During these attacks, sailfish alternate in attacking the prey using
      their elongated bills to slash or tap the prey [22-24]. This rapid bill movement 
      is either leftward or rightward. Using behavioral observations of identifiable
      individual sailfish hunting in groups, we provide evidence for individual-level
      attack lateralization in sailfish. More strongly lateralized individuals had a
      higher capture success. Further evidence of lateralization comes from
      morphological analyses of sailfish bills that show strong evidence of one-sided
      micro-teeth abrasions. Finally, we show that attacks by single sailfish are
      indeed highly predictable, but predictability rapidly declines with increasing
      group size because of a lack of population-level lateralization. Our results
      present a novel benefit of group hunting: by alternating attacks,
      individual-level attack lateralization can evolve, without the negative
      consequences of individual-level predictability. More generally, our results
      suggest that group hunting in predators might provide more suitable conditions
      for the evolution of strategy diversity compared to solitary life.

AB  - The giant, single-celled organism Stentor coeruleus has a long history as a model
      system for studying pattern formation and regeneration in single cells. Stentor
      [1, 2] is a heterotrichous ciliate distantly related to familiar ciliate models, 
      such as Tetrahymena or Paramecium. The primary distinguishing feature of Stentor 
      is its incredible size: a single cell is 1 mm long. Early developmental
      biologists, including T.H. Morgan [3], were attracted to the system because of
      its regenerative abilities-if large portions of a cell are surgically removed,
      the remnant reorganizes into a normal-looking but smaller cell with correct
      proportionality [2, 3]. These biologists were also drawn to Stentor because it
      exhibits a rich repertoire of behaviors, including light avoidance,
      mechanosensitive contraction, food selection, and even the ability to habituate
      to touch, a simple form of learning usually seen in higher organisms [4]. While
      early microsurgical approaches demonstrated a startling array of regenerative and
      morphogenetic processes in this single-celled organism, Stentor was never
      developed as a molecular model system. We report the sequencing of the Stentor
      coeruleus macronuclear genome and reveal key features of the genome. First, we
      find that Stentor uses the standard genetic code, suggesting that
      ciliate-specific genetic codes arose after Stentor branched from other ciliates. 
      We also discover that ploidy correlates with Stentor's cell size. Finally, in the
      Stentor genome, we discover the smallest spliceosomal introns reported for any
      species. The sequenced genome opens the door to molecular analysis of single-cell
      regeneration in Stentor.

AB  - Temporal simultaneity provides an essential cue for integrating multisensory
      signals into a unified perception. Early visual deprivation, in both animals and 
      humans, leads to abnormal neural responses to audiovisual signals in subcortical 
      and cortical areas [1-5]. Behavioral deficits in integrating complex audiovisual 
      stimuli in humans are also observed [6, 7]. It remains unclear whether early
      visual deprivation affects visuotactile perception similarly to audiovisual
      perception and whether the consequences for either pairing differ after monocular
      versus binocular deprivation [8-11]. Here, we evaluated the impact of early
      visual deprivation on the perception of simultaneity for audiovisual and
      visuotactile stimuli in humans. We tested patients born with dense cataracts in
      one or both eyes that blocked all patterned visual input until the cataractous
      lenses were removed and the affected eyes fitted with compensatory contact lenses
      (mean duration of deprivation = 4.4 months; range = 0.3-28.8 months). Both
      monocularly and binocularly deprived patients demonstrated lower precision in
      judging audiovisual simultaneity. However, qualitatively different outcomes were 
      observed for the two patient groups: the performance of monocularly deprived
      patients matched that of young children at immature stages, whereas that of
      binocularly deprived patients did not match any stage in typical development.
      Surprisingly, patients performed normally in judging visuotactile simultaneity
      after either monocular or binocular deprivation. Therefore, early binocular input
      is necessary to develop normal neural substrates for simultaneity perception of
      visual and auditory events but not visual and tactile events.

AB  - Conjoined twins fused at the thorax display an enigmatic left-right defect:
      although left twins are normal, laterality is disturbed in one-half of right
      twins [1-3]. Molecularly, this randomization corresponds to a lack of asymmetric 
      Nodal cascade induction in right twins [4]. We studied leftward flow [5, 6] at
      the left-right organizer (LRO) [7, 8] in thoracopagus twins in Xenopus, which
      displayed a duplicated, fused, and ciliated LRO. Cilia were motile and produced a
      leftward flow from the right LRO margin of the right to the left margin of the
      left twin. Motility was required for correct laterality in left twins, as
      knockdown of dynein motor dnah9 prevented Nodal cascade induction. Nodal was
      rescued by parallel knockdown of the inhibitor dand5 [9, 10] on the left side of 
      the left twin. Lack of Nodal induction in the right twin, despite the presence of
      flow, was due to insufficient suppression of dand5. Knockdown of dand5 at the
      center of the fused LRO resulted in asymmetric Nodal cascade induction in the
      right twin as well. Manipulation of leftward flow and dand5 in a targeted and
      sided manner induced the Nodal cascade in a predictable manner, in the left twin,
      the right one, both, or neither. Laterality in conjoined twins thus was
      determined by cilia-driven leftward fluid flow like in single embryos, which
      solves a century-old riddle, as the phenomenon was already studied by some of the
      founders of experimental embryology, including Dareste [11], Fol and Warynsky
      [12], and Spemann and Falkenberg [13] (reviewed in [14]).

AB  - The ability to plan and execute appropriately timed responses to external stimuli
      is based on a well-orchestrated balance between movement initiation and
      inhibition. In impulse control disorders involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      [1], this balance is disturbed, emphasizing the critical role that PFC plays in
      appropriately timing actions [2-4]. Here, we employed optogenetic and
      electrophysiological techniques to systematically analyze the functional role of 
      five key subareas of the rat medial PFC (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in 
      action control [5-9]. Inactivation of mPFC subareas induced drastic changes in
      performance, namely an increase (prelimbic cortex, PL) or decrease (infralimbic
      cortex, IL) of premature responses. Additionally, electrophysiology revealed a
      significant decrease in neuronal activity of a PL subpopulation prior to
      premature responses. In contrast, inhibition of OFC subareas (mainly the ventral 
      OFC, i.e., VO) significantly impaired the ability to respond rapidly after
      external cues. Consistent with these findings, mPFC activity during response
      preparation predicted trial outcomes and reaction times significantly better than
      OFC activity. These data support the concept of opposing roles of IL and PL in
      directing proactive behavior and argue for an involvement of OFC in predominantly
      reactive movement control. By attributing defined roles to rodent PFC sections,
      this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the functional heterogeneity 
      of this brain area and thus may guide medically relevant studies of
      PFC-associated impulse control disorders in this animal model for neural
      disorders [10-12].

AB  - Hormonal signaling provides metazoans with the ability to regulate development,
      growth, metabolism, immune defense, and reproduction in response to internal and 
      external stimuli. The use of hormones as central regulators of physiology makes
      them prime candidates for mediating allocation of resources to competing
      biological functions (i.e., hormonal pleiotropy) [1]. In animals, reproductive
      effort often results in weaker immune responses (e.g., [2-4]), and this reduction
      is sometimes linked to hormone signaling (see [5-7]). In the fruit fly,
      Drosophila melanogaster, mating and the receipt of male seminal fluid proteins
      results in reduced resistance to a systemic bacterial infection [8, 9]. Here, we 
      evaluate whether the immunosuppressive effect of reproduction in female D.
      melanogaster is attributable to the endocrine signal juvenile hormone (JH), which
      promotes the development of oocytes and the synthesis and deposition of yolk
      protein [10, 11]. Previous work has implicated JH as immunosuppressive [12, 13], 
      and the male seminal fluid protein Sex Peptide (SP) activates JH biosynthesis in 
      female D. melanogaster after mating [14]. We find that transfer of SP activates
      synthesis of JH in the mated female, which in turn suppresses resistance to
      infection through the receptor germ cell expressed (gce). We find that mated
      females are more likely to die from infection, suffer higher pathogen burdens,
      and are less able to induce their immune responses. All of these deficiencies are
      rescued when JH signaling is blocked. We argue that hormonal signaling is
      important for regulating immune system activity and, more generally, for
      governing trade-offs between physiological processes.

AB  - Climate change and fisheries are transforming the oceans, but we lack a complete 
      understanding of their ecological impact [1-3]. Environmental degradation can
      cause maladaptive habitat selection, inducing ecological traps with profound
      consequences for biodiversity [4-6]. However, whether ecological traps operate in
      marine systems is unclear [7]. Large marine vertebrates may be vulnerable to
      ecological traps [6], but their broad-scale movements and complex life histories 
      obscure the population-level consequences of habitat selection [8, 9]. We
      satellite tracked postnatal dispersal in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus)
      from eight sites across their breeding range to test whether they have become
      ecologically trapped in the degraded Benguela ecosystem. Bayesian state-space and
      habitat models show that penguins traversed thousands of square kilometers to
      areas of low sea surface temperatures (14.5 degrees C-17.5 degrees C) and high
      chlorophyll-a ( approximately 11 mg m(-3)). These were once reliable cues for
      prey-rich waters, but climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage 
      fish stocks in this system [10, 11]. Juvenile penguin survival is low in
      populations selecting degraded areas, and Bayesian projection models suggest that
      breeding numbers are approximately 50% lower than if non-impacted habitats were
      used, revealing the extent and effect of a marine ecological trap for the first
      time. These cascading impacts of localized forage fish depletion-unobserved in
      studies on adults-were only elucidated via broad-scale movement and demographic
      data on juveniles. Our results support suspending fishing when prey biomass drops
      below critical thresholds [12, 13] and suggest that mitigation of marine
      ecological traps will require matching conservation action to the scale of
      ecological processes [14].

AB  - The Late Ordovician (Hirnantian, approximately 445 million years ago) extinction 
      event was among the largest known, with 85% species loss [1]. Post-extinction
      survival faunas are invariably low diversity, especially benthic communities [2],
      but ecological structure was restored relatively rapidly [1]. This pattern,
      however, reflects organisms with robust skeletons, as only one exceptionally
      preserved Hirnantian fossil biota was previously known [3, 4]; in particular,
      almost no Hirnantian sponges have been recorded. Our study reveals an
      extraordinarily diverse, sponge-dominated community thriving immediately after
      the Hirnantian extinction in Zhejiang, South China. Several contemporaneous sites
      preserve a total diversity of over 75 sponge species, many with preserved soft
      tissues, in pronounced contrast to normal survival and early recovery faunas.
      This diversity is unprecedented for any Hirnantian fossil group, and the fauna
      provides a unique window into a post-extinction ecosystem. The sponges are often 
      large and structurally complex and represent numerous different lineages that
      survived the extinction. Layers with abundant sponge remains were deposited after
      other mass extinctions [5, 6], suggesting a general pattern of sponge abundance
      during collapse of Phanerozoic marine ecosystems. It is possible that the
      conditions of ecological collapse increase the particulate food sources for
      sponges, while they themselves are relatively unaffected by the crises.
      Furthermore, the abundance of sponges in the Hirnantian sequence of South China
      may have aided post-extinction ecosystem recovery by stabilizing the sediment
      surface, allowing sessile suspension feeders such as brachiopods, corals, and
      bryozoans to recover rapidly.

AB  - Proper division plane positioning is crucial for faithful chromosome segregation 
      but also influences cell size, position, or fate [1]. In fission yeast, medial
      division is controlled through negative signaling by the cell tips during
      interphase and positive signaling by the centrally placed nucleus at mitotic
      entry [2-4]: the cell geometry network (CGN), controlled by the inhibitory
      cortical gradient of the DYRK kinase Pom1 emanating from the cell tips, first
      promotes the medial localization of cytokinetic ring precursors organized by the 
      SAD kinase Cdr2 to pre-define the division plane [5-8]; then, massive nuclear
      export of the anillin-like protein Mid1 at mitosis entry confirms or readjusts
      the division plane according to nuclear position and triggers the assembly of a
      medial contractile ring [5, 9-11]. Strikingly, the Hippo-like septation
      initiation network (SIN) induces Cdr2 dissociation from cytokinetic precursors at
      this stage [12-14]. We show here that SIN-dependent phosphorylation of Cdr2
      promotes its interaction with the 14-3-3 protein Rad24 that sequesters it in the 
      cytoplasm during cell division. If this interaction is compromised, cytokinetic
      precursors are asymmetrically distributed in the cortex of newborn cells, leading
      to asymmetrical division if nuclear signaling is abolished. We conclude that,
      through this new function, the SIN resets the division plane in newborn cells to 
      ensure medial division.

AB  - Recent studies claim that visual perception of stimulus features, such as
      orientation, numerosity, and faces, is systematically biased toward visual input 
      from the immediate past [1-3]. However, the extent to which these positive biases
      truly reflect changes in perception rather than changes in post-perceptual
      processes is unclear [4, 5]. In the current study we sought to disentangle
      perceptual and decisional biases in visual perception. We found that
      post-perceptual decisions about orientation were indeed systematically biased
      toward previous stimuli and this positive bias did not strongly depend on the
      spatial location of previous stimuli (replicating previous work [1]). In
      contrast, observers' perception was repelled away from previous stimuli,
      particularly when previous stimuli were presented at the same spatial location.
      This repulsive effect resembles the well-known negative tilt-aftereffect in
      orientation perception [6]. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the positive
      decisional bias increased when a longer interval was imposed between perception
      and decision, suggesting a shift of working memory representations toward the
      recent history as a source of the decisional bias. We conclude that positive
      aftereffects on perceptual choice are likely introduced at a post-perceptual
      stage. Conversely, perception is negatively biased away from recent visual input.
      We speculate that these opposite effects on perception and post-perceptual
      decision may derive from the distinct goals of perception and decision-making
      processes: whereas perception may be optimized for detecting changes in the
      environment, decision processes may integrate over longer time periods to form
      stable representations.

AB  - SIRT1, the most conserved mammalian NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, plays a
      vital role in the regulation of metabolism, stress responses, and genome
      stability. However, the role of SIRT1 in the multi-step process leading to
      transformation and/or tumorigenesis, as either a tumor suppressor or tumor
      promoter, is complex and may be dependent upon the context in which SIRT1
      activity is altered, and the role of SIRT1 in tumor metabolism is unknown. Here, 
      we demonstrate that SIRT1 dose-dependently regulates cellular glutamine
      metabolism and apoptosis, which in turn differentially impact cell proliferation 
      and cancer development. Heterozygous deletion of Sirt1 induces c-Myc expression, 
      enhancing glutamine metabolism and subsequent proliferation, autophagy, stress
      resistance, and cancer formation. In contrast, homozygous deletion of Sirt1
      triggers cellular apoptotic pathways, increases cell death, diminishes autophagy,
      and reduces cancer formation. Consistent with the observed dose dependence in
      cells, intestine-specific Sirt1 heterozygous mice have enhanced intestinal tumor 
      formation, whereas intestine-specific Sirt1 homozygous knockout mice have reduced
      development of colon cancer. Furthermore, SIRT1 reduction, but not deletion, is
      associated with human colorectal tumors, and colorectal cancer patients with low 
      protein expression of SIRT1 have a poor prognosis. Taken together, our findings
      indicate that the dose-dependent regulation of tumor metabolism and possibly
      apoptosis by SIRT1 mechanistically contribute to the observed dual roles of SIRT1
      in tumorigenesis. Our study highlights the importance of maintenance of a
      suitable SIRT1 dosage for metabolic and tissue homeostasis, which will have
      important implications in SIRT1-small-molecule-activator/inhibitor-based
      therapeutic strategies for cancers.

AB  - Misophonia is an affective sound-processing disorder characterized by the
      experience of strong negative emotions (anger and anxiety) in response to
      everyday sounds, such as those generated by other people eating, drinking,
      chewing, and breathing [1-8]. The commonplace nature of these sounds (often
      referred to as "trigger sounds") makes misophonia a devastating disorder for
      sufferers and their families, and yet nothing is known about the underlying
      mechanism. Using functional and structural MRI coupled with physiological
      measurements, we demonstrate that misophonic subjects show specific
      trigger-sound-related responses in brain and body. Specifically, fMRI showed that
      in misophonic subjects, trigger sounds elicit greatly exaggerated
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the anterior insular cortex
      (AIC), a core hub of the "salience network" that is critical for perception of
      interoceptive signals and emotion processing. Trigger sounds in misophonics were 
      associated with abnormal functional connectivity between AIC and a network of
      regions responsible for the processing and regulation of emotions, including
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, 
      and amygdala. Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR) and galvanic
      skin response (GSR) in misophonic subjects, which were mediated by AIC activity. 
      Questionnaire analysis showed that misophonic subjects perceived their bodies
      differently: they scored higher on interoceptive sensibility than controls,
      consistent with abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain structural
      measurements implied greater myelination within vmPFC in misophonic individuals. 
      Overall, our results show that misophonia is a disorder in which abnormal
      salience is attributed to particular sounds based on the abnormal activation and 
      functional connectivity of AIC.

      European Farmers.

AB  - The Neolithic transition was a dynamic time in European prehistory of cultural,
      social, and technological change. Although this period has been well explored in 
      central Europe using ancient nuclear DNA [1, 2], its genetic impact on northern
      and eastern parts of this continent has not been as extensively studied. To
      broaden our understanding of the Neolithic transition across Europe, we analyzed 
      eight ancient genomes: six samples (four to approximately 1- to 4-fold coverage) 
      from a 3,500 year temporal transect ( approximately 8,300-4,800 calibrated years 
      before present) through the Baltic region dating from the Mesolithic to the Late 
      Neolithic and two samples spanning the Mesolithic-Neolithic boundary from the
      Dnieper Rapids region of Ukraine. We find evidence that some hunter-gatherer
      ancestry persisted across the Neolithic transition in both regions. However, we
      also find signals consistent with influxes of non-local people, most likely from 
      northern Eurasia and the Pontic Steppe. During the Late Neolithic, this
      Steppe-related impact coincides with the proposed emergence of Indo-European
      languages in the Baltic region [3, 4]. These influences are distinct from the
      early farmer admixture that transformed the genetic landscape of central Europe, 
      suggesting that changes associated with the Neolithic package in the Baltic were 
      not driven by the same Anatolian-sourced genetic exchange.

AB  - Reduced exposure to daytime sunlight and increased exposure to electrical
      lighting at night leads to late circadian and sleep timing [1-3]. We have
      previously shown that exposure to a natural summer 14 hr 40 min:9 hr 20 min
      light-dark cycle entrains the human circadian clock to solar time, such that the 
      internal biological night begins near sunset and ends near sunrise [1]. Here we
      show that the beginning of the biological night and sleep occur earlier after a
      week's exposure to a natural winter 9 hr 20 min:14 hr 40 min light-dark cycle as 
      compared to the modern electrical lighting environment. Further, we find that the
      human circadian clock is sensitive to seasonal changes in the natural light-dark 
      cycle, showing an expansion of the biological night in winter compared to summer,
      akin to that seen in non-humans [4-8]. We also show that circadian and sleep
      timing occur earlier after spending a weekend camping in a summer 14 hr 39 min:9 
      hr 21 min natural light-dark cycle compared to a typical weekend in the modern
      environment. Weekend exposure to natural light was sufficient to achieve
      approximately 69% of the shift in circadian timing we previously reported after a
      week's exposure to natural light [1]. These findings provide evidence that the
      human circadian clock adapts to seasonal changes in the natural light-dark cycle 
      and is timed later in the modern environment in both winter and summer. Further, 
      we demonstrate that earlier circadian timing can be rapidly achieved through
      natural light exposure during a weekend spent camping.

AB  - Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling augments synaptic transmission, but because many
      targets of cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) may be involved, mechanisms underlying
      this pathway remain unclear. To probe this mechanism, we used optogenetic
      stimulation of cAMP signaling by Beggiatoa-photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (bPAC)
      in Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons. Behavioral, electron microscopy (EM),
      and electrophysiology analyses revealed cAMP effects on both the rate and on
      quantal size of transmitter release and led to the identification of a
      neuropeptidergic pathway affecting quantal size. cAMP enhanced synaptic vesicle
      (SV) fusion by increasing mobilization and docking/priming. cAMP further evoked
      dense core vesicle (DCV) release of neuropeptides, in contrast to
      channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation. cAMP-evoked DCV release required
      UNC-31/Ca(2+)-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS). Thus, DCVs
      accumulated in unc-31 mutant synapses. bPAC-induced neuropeptide signaling acts
      presynaptically to enhance vAChT-dependent SV loading with acetylcholine, thus
      causing increased miniature postsynaptic current amplitudes (mPSCs) and
      significantly enlarged SVs.

AB  - RNA molecules can attach to chromatin. It remains difficult to know what RNAs are
      associated with chromatin and where the genomic target loci of these RNAs are.
      Here, we present MARGI (mapping RNA-genome interactions), a technology to
      massively reveal native RNA-chromatin interactions from unperturbed cells. The
      gist of this technology is to ligate chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) with
      their target genomic sequences by proximity ligation, forming RNA-DNA chimeric
      sequences, which are converted to a sequencing library for paired-end sequencing.
      Using MARGI, we produced RNA-genome interaction maps for human embryonic stem
      cells (ESCs) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. MARGI revealed hundreds of
      caRNAs, including previously known XIST, SNHG1, NEAT1, and MALAT1, as well as
      each caRNA's genomic interaction loci. Using a cross-species experiment, we
      estimated that approximately 2.2% of MARGI-identified interactions were false
      positives. In ESCs and HEK cells, the RNA ends of more than 5% of MARGI read
      pairs were mapped to distal or inter-chromosomal locations as compared to the
      locations of their corresponding DNA ends. The majority of transcription start
      sites are associated with distal or inter-chromosomal caRNAs.
      Chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)-reported H3K27ac and H3K4me3 
      levels are positively correlated, while H3K9me3 is negatively correlated, with
      MARGI-reported RNA attachment levels. The MARGI technology should facilitate
      revealing novel RNA functions and their genomic target regions.

AB  - Different from animal cells that divide by constriction of the cortex inward,
      cells of land plants divide by initiating a new cell-wall segment from their
      center. For this, a disk-shaped, membrane-enclosed precursor termed the cell
      plate is formed that radially expands toward the parental cell wall [1-3]. The
      synthesis of the plate starts with the fusion of vesicles into a tubulo-vesicular
      network [4-6]. Vesicles are putatively delivered to the division plane by
      transport along microtubules of the bipolar phragmoplast network that guides
      plate assembly [7-9]. How vesicle immobilization and fusion are then locally
      triggered is unclear. In general, a framework for how the cytoskeleton spatially 
      defines cell-plate formation is lacking. Here we show that membranous material
      for cell-plate formation initially accumulates along regions of microtubule
      overlap in the phragmoplast of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Kinesin-4-mediated
      shortening of these overlaps at the onset of cytokinesis proved to be required to
      spatially confine membrane accumulation. Without shortening, the wider cell-plate
      membrane depositions evolved into cell walls that were thick and irregularly
      shaped. Phragmoplast assembly thus provides a regular lattice of short overlaps
      on which a new cell-wall segment can be scaffolded. Since similar patterns of
      overlaps form in central spindles of animal cells, involving the activity of
      orthologous proteins [10, 11], we anticipate that our results will help uncover
      universal features underlying membrane-cytoskeleton coordination during
      cytokinesis.

AB  - Center-surround antagonism has been used as the canonical model to describe
      receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) for decades. We describe a
      newly identified RGC type in the mouse, called the ON delayed (OND) RGC, with
      receptive field properties that deviate from center-surround organization.
      Responding with an unusually long latency to light stimulation, OND RGCs respond 
      earlier as the visual stimulus increases in size. Furthermore, OND RGCs are
      excited by light falling far beyond their dendrites. We unravel details of the
      circuit mechanisms behind these phenomena, revealing new roles for inhibition in 
      controlling both temporal and spatial receptive field properties. The
      non-canonical receptive field properties of the OND RGC-integration of long
      temporal and large spatial scales-suggest that unlike typical RGCs, it may encode
      a slowly varying, global property of the visual scene.

AB  - Cytokinesis in many eukaryotes requires an actomyosin-based contractile ring [1].
      In fission yeast, cytokinesis involves the type II myosins Myo2p and Myp2p and
      the type V myosin Myo51p [2]. A recent study by Laplante et al.[3], using
      deletion mutants of myp2 and myo51 and the mis-sense mutant myo2-E1 [4],
      concluded that each myosin has distinct functions and proposed that Myp2p plays
      the dominant role in actomyosin ring contraction. Here we present evidence that
      Myo2p, not Myp2p, is likely to be the major motor driving actomyosin ring
      contractility. Since the previous work [3] was performed at 25 degrees C, the
      permissive temperature for myo2-E1, we compared cytokinesis timings in myo2-E1
      and myo2Delta at 25 degrees C and found that myo2-E1 is only partially
      compromised at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, we find that myp2Delta and myp2Delta
      myo51Delta double mutants contract actomyosin rings at approximately 90% of the
      rate of wild-type cells at 30 degrees C and 36 degrees C, suggesting that Myp2p
      plays a minimal role in ring contraction at these temperatures. Finally, ring
      contraction in our myo2-E1 strain took longer at 25 degrees C than previously
      reported [3]. Although faster-acting alleles of myo2 will be required to evaluate
      its contribution at 25 degrees C, our work establishes that Myo2p is the major
      motor involved in ring contraction, under most, if not all, conditions.

AB  - Sharks, rays and chimeras (class Chondrichthyes; herein 'sharks') today face
      possibly the largest crisis of their 420 million year history. Tens of millions
      of sharks are caught and traded internationally each year, many populations are
      overfished to the point where global catch peaked in 2003, and a quarter of
      species have an elevated risk of extinction [1-3]. To some, the solution is to
      simply stop taking them from our oceans, or prohibit carriage, sale or trade in
      shark fins [4]. Approaches such as bans and alternative livelihoods for fishers
      (e.g. ecotourism) may play some role in controlling fishing mortality but will
      not solve this crisis because sharks are mostly taken as incidental catch and
      play an important role in food security [5-7]. Here, we show that moving to
      sustainable fishing is a feasible solution. In fact, approximately 9% of the
      current global catch of sharks, from at least 33 species with a wide range of
      life histories, is biologically sustainable, although not necessarily
      sufficiently managed.

AB  - Reduction in seawater pH due to rising levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
      (CO2) in the world's oceans is a major force set to shape the future of marine
      ecosystems and the ecological services they provide [1,2]. In particular, ocean
      acidification is predicted to have a detrimental effect on the physiology of
      calcifying organisms [3]. Yet, the indirect effects of ocean acidification on
      calcifying organisms, which may counter or exacerbate direct effects, is
      uncertain. Using volcanic CO2 vents, we tested the indirect effects of ocean
      acidification on a calcifying herbivore (gastropod) within the natural complexity
      of an ecological system. Contrary to predictions, the abundance of this calcifier
      was greater at vent sites (with near-future CO2 levels). Furthermore,
      translocation experiments demonstrated that ocean acidification did not drive
      increases in gastropod abundance directly, but indirectly as a function of
      increased habitat and food (algal biomass). We conclude that the effect of ocean 
      acidification on algae (primary producers) can have a strong, indirect positive
      influence on the abundance of some calcifying herbivores, which can overwhelm any
      direct negative effects. This finding points to the need to understand ecological
      processes that buffer the negative effects of environmental change.

AB  - Eph receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
      with fourteen receptors divided into two subfamilies - EphAs and EphBs. Yet,
      despite their multitude of functions in almost all tissues of the body, these
      receptors represent one of the most underappreciated RTK families. What makes Eph
      receptors unique is that their cognate ligands, the ephrins, are tethered to the 
      cell surface, in contrast to other RTKs whose ligands are generally soluble. This
      phenomenon means that signalling through Eph receptors is largely dependent on
      cell-cell contact. In this way, Eph receptors allow cells to sense their
      immediate surrounding cellular microenvironment and make appropriate behavioural 
      decisions. For example, Eph receptors control whether two contacting cells are
      repelled by, or attracted to, each other. As such, they play an important role in
      normal physiological processes, including embryonic tissue boundary formation and
      directional guidance of developing axons, while in adult tissues they aid in
      wound healing and the maintenance of intestinal cell populations in particular
      compartments. Aberrant expression of these receptors, however, has been
      implicated in many pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. 
      In this Primer we will discuss some of the key aspects of signalling by Ephs and 
      ephrins that make them pivotal players in health and disease.

AB  - Photosynthetic eukaryotes are the product of an endosymbiotic event between a
      eukaryotic host and a cyanobacterium that became today's plastid. A new
      phylogenomic study suggests that the closest relative of plastids among extant
      cyanobacteria is the recently discovered freshwater-dwelling Gloeomargarita
      lithophora.

AB  - Stimulated by our 2015 Current Biology paper [1], Zambon et al. reinvestigated
      how three myosin isoforms participate in the formation and constriction of the
      contractile ring in fission yeast. Our paper presented evidence that these myosin
      isoforms have distinct roles: "Conventional myosin-II Myo2 is crucial to ring
      assembly, unconventional myosin-II Myp2 is most important for ring constriction, 
      and type V myosin Myo51 aids the other two myosins." Zambon et al. used different
      markers to reexamine the contributions of the three myosins to cytokinesis and
      concluded "that Myo2p is the major motor involved in ring contraction in S.
      pombe." Here, we show that most of the differences observed by Zambon et al. can 
      be attributed to their use of the Rlc1p-3GFP marker, which genetically interacts 
      with myo2-E1.

AB  - Nutrient-sensing pathways respond to changes in the levels of macronutrients,
      such as sugars, lipids, or amino acids, and regulate metabolic pathways to
      maintain organismal homeostasis [1, 2]. Consequently, nutrient sensing provides
      animals with the metabolic flexibility necessary for enduring temporal
      fluctuations in nutrient intake. Recent studies have shown that an animal's
      ability to survive on a high-sugar diet is determined by sugar-responsive gene
      regulation [3-8]. It remains to be elucidated whether other levels of metabolic
      control, such as post-translational regulation of metabolic enzymes, also
      contribute to organismal sugar tolerance. Furthermore, the sugar-regulated
      metabolic pathways contributing to sugar tolerance remain insufficiently
      characterized. Here, we identify Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3), a member of the 
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinase family, as a key determinant
      of Drosophila sugar tolerance. SIK3 allows sugar-feeding animals to increase the 
      reductive capacity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
      (NADPH/NADP(+)). NADPH mediates the reduction of the intracellular antioxidant
      glutathione, which is essential for survival on a high-sugar diet. SIK3 controls 
      NADP(+) reduction by phosphorylating and activating Glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. 
      SIK3 gene expression is regulated by the sugar-regulated transcription factor
      complex Mondo-Mlx, which was previously identified as a key determinant of sugar 
      tolerance. SIK3 converges with Mondo-Mlx in sugar-induced activation of G6PD, and
      simultaneous inhibition of SIK3 and Mondo-Mlx leads to strong synergistic
      lethality on a sugar-containing diet. In conclusion, SIK3 cooperates with
      Mondo-Mlx to maintain organismal sugar tolerance through the regulation of
      NADPH/NADP(+) redox balance.

AB  - Animals face the daunting task of controlling their limbs using a small set of
      highly constrained actuators. This problem is particularly demanding for insects 
      such as Drosophila, which must adjust wing motion for both quick voluntary
      maneuvers and slow compensatory reflexes using only a dozen pairs of muscles. To 
      identify strategies by which animals execute precise actions using sparse motor
      networks, we imaged the activity of a complete ensemble of wing control muscles
      in intact, flying flies. Our experiments uncovered a remarkably efficient logic
      in which each of the four skeletal elements at the base of the wing are equipped 
      with both large phasically active muscles capable of executing large changes and 
      smaller tonically active muscles specialized for continuous fine-scaled
      adjustments. Based on the responses to a broad panel of visual motion stimuli, we
      have developed a model by which the motor array regulates aerodynamically
      functional features of wing motion. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

TI  - Deficits in Top-Down Sensory Prediction in Infants At Risk due to Premature
      Birth.

AB  - A prominent theoretical view is that the brain is inherently predictive [1, 2]
      and that prediction helps drive the engine of development [3, 4]. Although
      infants exhibit neural signatures of top-down sensory prediction [5, 6], in order
      to establish that prediction supports development, it must be established that
      deficits in early prediction abilities alter trajectories. We investigated
      prediction in infants born prematurely, a leading cause of neuro-cognitive
      impairment worldwide [7]. Prematurity, independent of medical complications,
      leads to developmental disturbances [8-12] and a broad range of developmental
      delays [13-17]. Is an alteration in early prediction abilities the common cause? 
      Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we measured top-down sensory
      prediction in preterm infants (born <33 weeks gestation) before infants exhibited
      clinically identifiable developmental delays (6 months corrected age). Whereas
      preterm infants had typical neural responses to presented visual stimuli, they
      exhibited altered neural responses to predicted visual stimuli. Importantly, a
      separate behavioral control confirmed that preterm infants detect pattern
      violations at the same rate as full-terms, establishing selectivity of this
      response to top-down predictions (e.g., not in learning an audiovisual
      association). These findings suggest that top-down sensory prediction plays a
      crucial role in development and that deficits in this ability may be the reason
      why preterm infants experience altered developmental trajectories and are at risk
      for poor developmental outcomes. Moreover, this work presents an opportunity for 
      establishing a neuro-biomarker for early identification of infants at risk and
      could guide early intervention regimens.

AB  - A core aspect of the human self is the attribution of personal relevance to
      everyday stimuli enabling us to experience our environment as meaningful [1].
      However, abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to sensory
      experiences are also critical features of many psychiatric disorders [2, 3].
      Despite their clinical relevance, the neurochemical and anatomical substrates
      enabling meaningful experiences are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated
      the neuropharmacology of personal relevance processing in humans by combining
      fMRI and the administration of the mixed serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptor
      (R) agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), well known to alter the subjective 
      meaning of percepts, with and without pretreatment with the 5-HT2AR antagonist
      ketanserin. General subjective LSD effects were fully blocked by ketanserin. In
      addition, ketanserin inhibited the LSD-induced attribution of personal relevance 
      to previously meaningless stimuli and modulated the processing of meaningful
      stimuli in cortical midline structures. These findings point to the crucial role 
      of the 5-HT2AR subtype and cortical midline regions in the generation and
      attribution of personal relevance. Our results thus increase our mechanistic
      understanding of personal relevance processing and reveal potential targets for
      the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in personal
      relevance attribution.

AB  - Mitochondria form close physical associations with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      that regulate a number of physiological functions. One mechanism by which regions
      of ER are recruited to mitochondria involves binding of the ER protein VAPB to
      the mitochondrial protein PTPIP51, which act as scaffolds to tether the two
      organelles. Here, we show that the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate autophagy. We
      demonstrate that overexpression of VAPB or PTPIP51 to tighten ER-mitochondria
      contacts impairs, whereas small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated loss of VAPB or 
      PTPIP51 to loosen contacts stimulates, autophagosome formation. Moreover, we show
      that expression of a synthetic linker protein that artificially tethers ER and
      mitochondria also reduces autophagosome formation, and that this artificial
      tether rescues the effects of siRNA loss of VAPB or PTPIP51 on autophagy. Thus,
      these effects of VAPB and PTPIP51 manipulation on autophagy are a consequence of 
      their ER-mitochondria tethering function. Interestingly, we discovered that
      tightening of ER-mitochondria contacts by overexpression of VAPB or PTPIP51
      impairs rapamycin- and torin 1-induced, but not starvation-induced, autophagy.
      This suggests that the regulation of autophagy by ER-mitochondria signaling is at
      least partly dependent upon the nature of the autophagic stimulus. Finally, we
      demonstrate that the mechanism by which the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers regulate
      autophagy involves their role in mediating delivery of Ca(2+) to mitochondria
      from ER stores. Thus, our findings reveal a new molecular mechanism for
      regulating autophagy.

AB  - Photosynthesis evolved in eukaryotes by the endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium,
      the future plastid, within a heterotrophic host. This primary endosymbiosis
      occurred in the ancestor of Archaeplastida, a eukaryotic supergroup that includes
      glaucophytes, red algae, green algae, and land plants [1-4]. However, although
      the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from a single cyanobacterial ancestor is
      firmly established, the nature of that ancestor remains controversial: plastids
      have been proposed to derive from either early- or late-branching cyanobacterial 
      lineages [5-11]. To solve this issue, we carried out phylogenomic and
      supernetwork analyses of the most comprehensive dataset analyzed so far including
      plastid-encoded proteins and nucleus-encoded proteins of plastid origin resulting
      from endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) of primary photosynthetic eukaryotes, as
      well as wide-ranging genome data from cyanobacteria, including novel lineages.
      Our analyses strongly support that plastids evolved from deep-branching
      cyanobacteria and that the present-day closest cultured relative of primary
      plastids is Gloeomargarita lithophora. This species belongs to a recently
      discovered cyanobacterial lineage widespread in freshwater microbialites and
      microbial mats [12, 13]. The ecological distribution of this lineage sheds new
      light on the environmental conditions where the emergence of photosynthetic
      eukaryotes occurred, most likely in a terrestrial-freshwater setting. The fact
      that glaucophytes, the first archaeplastid lineage to diverge, are exclusively
      found in freshwater ecosystems reinforces this hypothesis. Therefore, not only
      did plastids emerge early within cyanobacteria, but the first photosynthetic
      eukaryotes most likely evolved in terrestrial-freshwater settings, not in oceans 
      as commonly thought.

AB  - Episodic memory is thought to critically depend on interaction of the hippocampus
      with distributed brain regions [1-3]. Specific contributions of distinct networks
      have been hypothesized, with the hippocampal posterior-medial (HPM) network
      implicated in the recollection of highly precise contextual and spatial
      information [3-6]. Current evidence for HPM specialization is mostly indirect,
      derived from correlative measures such as neural activity recordings. Here we
      tested the causal role of the HPM network in recollection using network-targeted 
      noninvasive brain stimulation in humans, which has previously been shown to
      increase functional connectivity within the HPM network [7]. Effects of
      multiple-day electromagnetic stimulation were assessed using an object-location
      memory task that segregated recollection precision from general recollection
      success. HPM network-targeted stimulation produced lasting ( approximately 24 hr)
      enhancement of recollection precision, without effects on general success.
      Canonical neural correlates of recollection [8-10] were also modulated by
      stimulation. Late-positive evoked potential amplitude and theta-alpha oscillatory
      power were reduced, suggesting that stimulation can improve memory through
      enhanced reactivation of detailed visuospatial information at retrieval. The HPM 
      network was thus specifically implicated in the processing of fine-grained memory
      detail, supporting functional specialization of hippocampal-cortical networks.
      These findings demonstrate that brain networks can be causally linked to distinct
      and specific neurocognitive functions and suggest mechanisms for long-lasting
      changes in memory due to network-targeted stimulation.

AB  - The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse
      physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2]. There are 29 Aux/IAA 
      genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of
      expression [3]. Although some studies have suggested that individual Aux/IAA
      genes have specialized function, genetic analyses of the family have been limited
      by the scarcity of loss-of-function phenotypes [4]. Furthermore, with a few
      exceptions, our knowledge of the factors that regulate Aux/IAA expression is
      limited [1, 5]. We hypothesize that transcriptional control of Aux/IAA genes
      plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin-signaling pathways that
      regulate organogenesis, growth, and environmental response. Here, we describe a
      screen for transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the Aux/IAA genes. We
      identify TFs from 38 families, including 26 members of the DREB/CBF family.
      Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes
      in response to abiotic stress. Recessive mutations in these IAA genes result in
      decreased tolerance to stress conditions, demonstrating a role for auxin in
      abiotic stress. Our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the
      auxin gene regulatory network (GRN) through transcription of the Aux/IAA genes.
      We propose that the Aux/IAA genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and
      environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or
      physiological outcome.

AB  - Ants can navigate over long distances between their nest and food sites using
      visual cues [1, 2]. Recent studies show that this capacity is undiminished when
      walking backward while dragging a heavy food item [3-5]. This challenges the idea
      that ants use egocentric visual memories of the scene for guidance [1, 2, 6]. Can
      ants use their visual memories of the terrestrial cues when going backward? Our
      results suggest that ants do not adjust their direction of travel based on the
      perceived scene while going backward. Instead, they maintain a straight direction
      using their celestial compass. This direction can be dictated by their path
      integrator [5] but can also be set using terrestrial visual cues after a forward 
      peek. If the food item is too heavy to enable body rotations, ants moving
      backward drop their food on occasion, rotate and walk a few steps forward, return
      to the food, and drag it backward in a now-corrected direction defined by
      terrestrial cues. Furthermore, we show that ants can maintain their direction of 
      travel independently of their body orientation. It thus appears that egocentric
      retinal alignment is required for visual scene recognition, but ants can
      translate this acquired directional information into a holonomic frame of
      reference, which enables them to decouple their travel direction from their body 
      orientation and hence navigate backward. This reveals substantial flexibility and
      communication between different types of navigational information: from
      terrestrial to celestial cues and from egocentric to holonomic directional
      memories. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Balance arises from the interplay of external forces acting on the body and
      internally generated movements. Many animal bodies are inherently unstable,
      necessitating corrective locomotion to maintain stability. Understanding how
      developing animals come to balance remains a challenge. Here we study the
      interplay among environment, sensation, and action as balance develops in larval 
      zebrafish. We first model the physical forces that challenge underwater balance
      and experimentally confirm that larvae are subject to constant destabilization.
      Larvae propel in swim bouts that, we find, tend to stabilize the body. We confirm
      the relationship between locomotion and balance by changing larval body
      composition, exacerbating instability and eliciting more frequent swimming.
      Intriguingly, developing zebrafish come to control the initiation of locomotion, 
      swimming preferentially when unstable, thus restoring preferred postures. To test
      the sufficiency of locomotor-driven stabilization and the developing control of
      movement timing, we incorporate both into a generative model of swimming.
      Simulated larvae recapitulate observed postures and movement timing across early 
      development, but only when locomotor-driven stabilization and control of movement
      initiation are both utilized. We conclude the ability to move when unstable is
      the key developmental improvement to balance in larval zebrafish. Our work
      informs how emerging sensorimotor ability comes to impact how and why animals
      move when they do.

AB  - Eye blinks cause disruptions to visual input and are accompanied by rotations of 
      the eyeball [1]. Like every motor action, these eye movements are subject to
      noise and introduce instabilities in gaze direction across blinks [2].
      Accumulating errors across repeated blinks would be debilitating for visual
      performance. Here, we show that the oculomotor system constantly recalibrates
      gaze direction during blinks to counteract gaze instability. Observers were
      instructed to fixate a visual target while gaze direction was recorded and blinks
      were detected in real time. With every spontaneous blink-while eyelids were
      closed-the target was displaced laterally by 0.5 degrees (or 1.0 degrees ). Most 
      observers reported being unaware of displacements during blinks. After adapting
      for approximately 35 blinks, gaze positions after blinks showed significant
      biases toward the new target position. Automatic eye movements accompanied each
      blink, and an aftereffect persisted for a few blinks after target displacements
      were eliminated. No adaptive gaze shift occurred when blinks were simulated with 
      shutter glasses at random time points or actively triggered by observers, or when
      target displacements were masked by a distracting stimulus. Visual signals during
      blinks are suppressed by inhibitory mechanisms [3-6], so that small changes
      across blinks are generally not noticed [7, 8]. Additionally, target
      displacements during blinks can trigger automatic gaze recalibration, similar to 
      the well-known saccadic adaptation effect [9-11]. This novel mechanism might be
      specific to the maintenance of gaze direction across blinks or might depend on a 
      more general oculomotor recalibration mechanism adapting gaze position during
      intrinsically generated disruptions to visual input.

AB  - Exercise is a common component of weight loss strategies, yet exercise programs
      are associated with surprisingly small changes in body weight [1-4]. This may be 
      due in part to compensatory adaptations, in which calories expended during
      exercise are counteracted by decreases in other aspects of energy expenditure [1,
      5-10]. Here we examined the relationship between a rodent model of voluntary
      exercise- wheel running- and total daily energy expenditure. Use of a running
      wheel for 3 to 7 days increased daily energy expenditure, resulting in a caloric 
      deficit of approximately 1 kcal/day; however, total daily energy expenditure
      remained stable after the first week of wheel access, despite further increases
      in wheel use. We hypothesized that compensatory mechanisms accounted for the lack
      of increase in daily energy expenditure after the first week. Supporting this
      idea, we observed a decrease in off-wheel ambulation when mice were using the
      wheels, indicating behavioral compensation. Finally, we asked whether individual 
      variation in wheel use within a group of mice would be associated with different 
      levels of daily energy expenditure. Despite a large variation in wheel running,
      we did not observe a significant relationship between the amount of daily wheel
      running and total daily energy expenditure or energy intake across mice.
      Together, our experiments support a model in which the transition from sedentary 
      to light activity is associated with an increase in daily energy expenditure, but
      further increases in physical activity produce diminishingly small increments in 
      daily energy expenditure.

AB  - The recruitment of motoneurons during force generation follows a general pattern 
      that has been confirmed across diverse species [1-3]. Motoneurons are recruited
      systematically according to synaptic inputs and intrinsic cellular properties and
      corresponding to movements of different intensities. However, much less is known 
      about the output properties of individual motoneurons and how they affect the
      translation of motoneuron recruitment to the strength of muscle contractions. In 
      larval zebrafish, spinal motoneurons are recruited in a topographic gradient
      according to their input resistance (Rin) at different swimming strengths and
      speeds. Whereas dorsal, lower-Rin primary motoneurons (PMns) are only activated
      during behaviors that involve strong and fast body bends, more ventral,
      higher-Rin secondary motoneurons (SMns) are recruited during weaker and slower
      movements [4-6]. Here we perform in vivo paired recordings between identified
      spinal motoneurons and skeletal muscle cells in larval zebrafish. We characterize
      individual motoneuron outputs to single muscle cells and show that the strength
      and reliability of motoneuron outputs are inversely correlated with motoneuron
      Rin. During repetitive high-frequency motoneuron drive, PMn synapses undergo
      depression, whereas SMn synapses potentiate. We monitor muscle cell contractions 
      elicited by single motoneurons and show that the pattern of motoneuron output
      strength and plasticity observed in electrophysiological recordings is reflected 
      in muscle shortening. Our findings indicate a link between the recruitment
      pattern and output properties of spinal motoneurons that can together generate
      appropriate intensities for muscle contractions. We demonstrate that motoneuron
      output properties provide an additional peripheral mechanism for graded locomotor
      control at the neuromuscular junction.

AB  - Cancer metastases arise from a multi-step process that requires metastasizing
      tumor cells to adapt to signaling input from varying tissue environments [1]. As 
      an early metastatic event, cancer cell dissemination occurs through different
      migration programs, including multicellular, collective, and single-cell
      mesenchymal or amoeboid migration [2-4]. Migration modes can interconvert based
      on changes in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal mechanotransduction [5], and/or
      proteolysis [6], most likely under the control of transcriptional programs such
      as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [7, 8]. However, how plasticity
      of tumor cell migration and EMT is spatiotemporally controlled and connected upon
      challenge by the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Using 3D cultures of
      collectively invading breast and head and neck cancer spheroids, here we identify
      hypoxia, a hallmark of solid tumors [9], as an inducer of the
      collective-to-amoeboid transition (CAT), promoting the dissemination of
      amoeboid-moving single cells from collective invasion strands. Hypoxia-induced
      amoeboid detachment was driven by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), followed
      the downregulation of E-cadherin, and produced heterogeneous cell subsets whose
      phenotype and migration were dependent ( approximately 30%) or independent (
      approximately 70%) of Twist-mediated EMT. EMT-like and EMT-independent amoeboid
      cell subsets showed stable amoeboid movement over hours as well as leukocyte-like
      traits, including rounded morphology, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-independent 
      migration, and nuclear deformation. Cancer cells undergoing pharmacological
      stabilization of HIFs retained their constitutive ability for early metastatic
      seeding in an experimental model of lung metastasis, indicating that
      hypoxia-induced CAT enhances cell release rather than early organ colonization.
      Induced by metabolic challenge, amoeboid movement may thus constitute a common
      endpoint of both EMT-dependent and EMT-independent cancer dissemination programs.

AB  - When a navigator's internal sense of direction is disrupted, she must rely on
      external cues to regain her bearings, a process termed spatial reorientation.
      Extensive research has demonstrated that the geometric shape of the environment
      exerts powerful control over reorientation behavior, but the neural and cognitive
      mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. Whereas some
      theories claim that geometry controls behavior through an allocentric mechanism
      potentially tied to the hippocampus, others postulate that disoriented navigators
      reach their goals by using an egocentric view-matching strategy. To resolve this 
      debate, we characterized hippocampal representations during reorientation. We
      first recorded from CA1 cells as disoriented mice foraged in chambers of various 
      shapes. We found that the alignment of the recovered hippocampal map was
      determined by the geometry of the chamber, but not by nongeometric cues, even
      when these cues could be used to disambiguate geometric ambiguities. We then
      recorded hippocampal activity as disoriented mice performed a classical
      goal-directed spatial memory task in a rectangular chamber. Again, we found that 
      the recovered hippocampal map aligned solely to the chamber geometry. Critically,
      we also found a strong correspondence between the hippocampal map alignment and
      the animal's behavior, making it possible to predict the search location of the
      animal from neural responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Together, these results
      demonstrate that spatial reorientation involves the alignment of the hippocampal 
      map to local geometry. We hypothesize that geometry may be an especially salient 
      cue for reorientation because it is an inherently stable aspect of the
      environment.

AB  - Eukaryotic plasma membrane organization theory has long been controversial, in
      part due to a dearth of suitably high-resolution techniques to probe molecular
      architecture in situ and integrate information from diverse data streams [1].
      Notably, clustered patterning of membrane proteins is a commonly conserved
      feature across diverse protein families (reviewed in [2]), including the SNAREs
      [3], SM proteins [4, 5], ion channels [6, 7], and receptors (e.g., [8]). Much
      effort has gone into analyzing the behavior of secretory organelles [9-13], and
      understanding the relationship between the membrane and proximal organelles [4,
      5, 12, 14] is an essential goal for cell biology as broad concepts or rules may
      be established. Here we explore the generally accepted model that vesicles at the
      plasmalemma are guided by cytoskeletal tracks to specific sites on the membrane
      that have clustered molecular machinery for secretion [15], organized in part by 
      the local lipid composition [16]. To increase our understanding of these
      fundamental processes, we integrated nanoscopy and spectroscopy of the secretory 
      machinery with organelle tracking data in a mathematical model, iterating with
      knockdown cell models. We find that repeated routes followed by successive
      vesicles, the re-use of similar fusion sites, and the apparently distinct vesicle
      "pools" are all fashioned by the Brownian behavior of organelles overlaid on
      navigation between non-reactive secretory protein molecular depots patterned at
      the plasma membrane.

AB  - The vertebrate diencephalic A11 system provides the sole dopaminergic innervation
      of hindbrain and spinal cord and has been implicated in modulation of locomotion 
      and sensory processes. However, the exact contributions of sensory stimuli and
      motor behavior to A11 dopaminergic activity remain unclear. We recorded cellular 
      calcium activity in four anatomically distinct posterior tubercular A11-type
      dopaminergic subgroups and two adjacent hypothalamic dopaminergic groups in
      GCaMP7a-transgenic, semi-restrained zebrafish larvae. Our analyses reveal the
      contributions of different sensory modalities and motor states to dopaminergic
      activity. Each posterior tubercular and hypothalamic subgroup showed distinct
      activity patterns, while activity was synchronous within individual subgroups.
      Caudal and dorsomedial hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons are activated following 
      vigorous tail movements and stay active for about 10 s, revealing predominantly
      post-motor activity. In contrast, posterior tubercular dopaminergic neurons are
      predominantly sensory driven, with subgroups differentially responding to
      different tactile or visual sensory modalities. In the anterior subgroups,
      neuronal response magnitudes are tuned to tactile stimulus intensities, revealing
      features similar to sensory systems. We identify the lateral line system as
      source for this tactile tuning. In contrast, the posterior subgroup is responsive
      to distinct moving visual stimuli. Specifically, translational forward stimuli,
      which may indicate insufficient rheotaxis and drift, induce dopaminergic
      activity, but backward or rotational stimuli not. The activation of posterior
      tubercular dopaminergic neurons by sensory stimuli, and their projections onto
      peripheral mechanosensory systems, suggests a participation of A11-type neurons
      in the feedback regulation of sensory systems. Together with the adjacent
      hypothalamic neurons, they may serve to set basic behavioral states.

AB  - Probability distributions over external states (priors) are essential to the
      interpretation of sensory signals. Priors for cultural artifacts such as music
      and language remain largely uncharacterized, but likely constrain cultural
      transmission, because only those signals with high probability under the prior
      can be reliably reproduced and communicated. We developed a method to estimate
      priors for simple rhythms via iterated reproduction of random temporal sequences.
      Listeners were asked to reproduce random "seed" rhythms; their reproductions were
      fed back as the stimulus and over time became dominated by internal biases, such 
      that the prior could be estimated by applying the procedure multiple times. We
      validated that the measured prior was consistent across the modality of
      reproduction and that it correctly predicted perceptual discrimination. We then
      measured listeners' priors over the entire space of two- and three-interval
      rhythms. Priors in US participants showed peaks at rhythms with simple integer
      ratios and were similar for musicians and non-musicians. An analogous procedure
      produced qualitatively different results for spoken phrases, indicating some
      specificity to music. Priors measured in members of a native Amazonian society
      were distinct from those in US participants but also featured integer ratio
      peaks. The results do not preclude biological constraints favoring integer
      ratios, but they suggest that priors on musical rhythm are substantially
      modulated by experience and may simply reflect the empirical distribution of
      rhythm that listeners encounter. The proposed method can efficiently map out a
      high-resolution view of biases that shape transmission and stability of simple
      reproducible patterns within a culture.

AB  - A complex brain consists of multiple intricate neural networks assembled from
      distinct sets of input and output neurons as well as region-specific local
      interneurons. Within a given anatomical set, there exist diverse neuronal types
      that can vary in morphology, neural physiology, and modes of neurotransmission.
      The genetic programs that guide specification of neuronal types during
      neurogenesis preconfigure the brain. This is best demonstrated in the Drosophila 
      central brain, which is composed of approximately 100 pairs of individually
      tailored neuronal lineages. Each neuronal lineage (the neurons/glia produced from
      a single stem cell) can contain multiple morphological classes of neurons that
      can consist of many analogous neuronal types. The detailed patterns of neuronal
      diversification are lineage-specific and can differ drastically even among
      neighboring neuronal lineages. Furthermore, the interrelationships between
      neuronal lineages and neural networks are complex. These phenomena underscore the
      importance of tracking all neuronal lineages in understanding brain development
      and evolution.

AB  - Autophagic responses specific for damaged or superfluous mitochondria are crucial
      for the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis. Recent data
      demonstrate that components of the inner mitochondrial membrane that are unmasked
      upon outer membrane permeabilization facilitate the autophagic destruction of the
      organelle.

      occurred during metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Female pheromones
      appeared to influence various aspects of the physiology and development of adult

      development and had a positive impact on reproduction, as measured by a
      difference in the % of eggs developing into larvae in crosses involving adult
      male flies that had developed at metamorphosis with or without female pupae [1].

AB  - Wolbachia are widespread endosymbiotic bacteria found in terrestrial arthropods
      and filarial nematodes [1]. In insects, Wolbachia generally rely on diverse
      strategies to manipulate their host's reproduction and favor their own vertical
      transmission through infected eggs [2]. One such mechanism is a sterility
      syndrome called 'cytoplasmic incompatibility'. Cytoplasmic incompatibility occurs
      at fertilization, when a spermatozoon from a Wolbachia-infected male fertilizes
      an uninfected egg. In this case, sperm-derived chromosomes fail to separate
      normally at the first zygotic division, thus preventing the development of a
      diploid embryo [3]. Moreover, the presence of Wolbachia in females rescues the
      integration of paternal chromosomes in the zygote and allows the development of a
      viable, infected individual. Although the molecular basis of cytoplasmic
      incompatibility is still unknown, a current model implies the existence of
      Wolbachia-induced reversible modifications on sperm DNA or chromatin that must be
      eliminated or neutralized shortly after fertilization by rescuing Wolbachia
      factors present in infected eggs [4]. In a recent Current Biology paper [5],
      Stephanie Pontier and Francois Schweisguth recently challenged this model by
      proposing that Wolbachia perturbs a pheromone-based communication between male
      and female pupae in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, which
      controls the "compatibility range" of male and female gametes. However, we fail
      to detect any influence of pupal communication on cytoplasmic incompatibility in 
      Drosophila simulans as well as in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Our
      results thus question the robustness of their model.

AB  - Many corvid species accurately remember the locations where they have seen others
      cache food, allowing them to pilfer these caches efficiently once the cachers
      have left the scene [1]. To protect their caches, corvids employ a suite of
      different cache-protection strategies that limit the observers' visual or
      acoustic access to the cache site [2,3]. In cases where an observer's sensory
      access cannot be reduced it has been suggested that cachers might be able to
      minimise the risk of pilfering if they avoid caching food the observer is most
      motivated to pilfer [4]. In the wild, corvids have been reported to pilfer
      others' caches as soon as possible after the caching event [5], such that the
      cacher might benefit from adjusting its caching behaviour according to the
      observer's current desire. In the current study, observers pilfered according to 
      their current desire: they preferentially pilfered food that they were not sated 
      on. Cachers adjusted their caching behaviour accordingly: they protected their
      caches by selectively caching food that observers were not motivated to pilfer.
      The same cache-protection behaviour was found when cachers could not see on which
      food the observers were sated. Thus, the cachers' ability to respond to the
      observer's desire might have been driven by the observer's behaviour at the time 
      of caching.

PG  - 286-290

AB  - Gastrulation of the Drosophila embryo is one of the most intensively studied
      morphogenetic processes in animal development [1-4]. Particular efforts have
      focused on the formation of the ventral furrow, whereby approximately 1,000
      presumptive mesoderm cells exhibit coordinated apical constrictions that mediate 
      invagination [5, 6]. Apical constriction depends on a Rho GTPase signaling
      pathway (T48/Fog) that is deployed by the developmental regulatory genes twist
      and snail [7-10]. It is thought that coordinate mesoderm constriction depends on 
      high levels of myosin along the ventral midline, although the basis for this
      localization is uncertain. Here, we employ newly developed quantitative imaging
      methods to visualize the transcriptional dynamics of two key components of the
      Rho signaling pathway in living embryos, T48 and Fog. Both genes display
      dorsoventral (DV) gradients of expression due to differential timing of
      transcription activation. Transcription begins as a narrow stripe of two or three
      cells along the ventral midline, followed by progressive expansions into more
      lateral regions. Quantitative image analyses suggest that these temporal
      gradients produce differential spatial accumulations of t48 and fog mRNAs along
      the DV axis, similar to the distribution of myosin activity. We therefore propose
      that the transcriptional dynamics of t48 and fog expression foreshadow the
      coordinated invagination of the mesoderm at the onset of gastrulation.

AB  - Why females of some species cease ovulation prior to the end of their natural
      lifespan is a long-standing evolutionary puzzle [1-4]. The fitness benefits of
      post-reproductive helping could in principle select for menopause [1, 2, 5], but 
      the magnitude of these benefits appears insufficient to explain the timing of
      menopause [6-8]. Recent theory suggests that the cost of inter-generational
      reproductive conflict between younger and older females of the same social unit
      is a critical missing term in classical inclusive fitness calculations (the
      "reproductive conflict hypothesis" [6, 9]). Using a unique long-term dataset on
      wild resident killer whales, where females can live decades after their final
      parturition, we provide the first test of this hypothesis in a non-human animal. 
      First, we confirm previous theoretical predictions that local relatedness
      increases with female age up to the end of reproduction. Second, we construct a
      new evolutionary model and show that given these kinship dynamics, selection will
      favor younger females that invest more in competition, and thus have greater
      reproductive success, than older females (their mothers) when breeding at the
      same time. Third, we test this prediction using 43 years of individual-based
      demographic data in resident killer whales and show that when mothers and
      daughters co-breed, the mortality hazard of calves from older-generation females 
      is 1.7 times that of calves from younger-generation females. Intergenerational
      conflict combined with the known benefits conveyed to kin by post-reproductive
      females can explain why killer whales have evolved the longest post-reproductive 
      lifespan of all non-human animals.

AB  - The distribution of biomass among trophic levels provides a theoretical basis for
      understanding energy flow and the hierarchical structure of animal communities.
      In the absence of energy subsidies [1], bottom-heavy trophic pyramids are
      expected to predominate, based on energy transfer efficiency [2] and empirical
      evidence from multiple ecosystems [3]. However, the predicted pyramid of biomass 
      distribution among trophic levels may be disrupted through trophic replacement by
      alternative organisms in the ecosystem, trophic cascades, and humans
      preferentially impacting specific trophic levels [4-6]. Using empirical data
      spanning >250 coral reefs, we show how trophic pyramid shape varies given
      human-mediated gradients along two orders of magnitude in reef fish biomass. Mean
      trophic level of the assemblage increased modestly with decreasing biomass,
      contrary to predictions of fishing down the food web [7]. The mean trophic level 
      pattern is explained by trophic replacement of herbivorous fish by sea urchins at
      low biomass and the accumulation of slow-growing, large-bodied, herbivorous fish 
      at high biomass. Further, at high biomass, particularly where fishers are not
      selectively removing higher trophic level individuals, a concave trophic
      distribution emerges. The concave trophic distribution implies a more direct link
      between lower and upper trophic levels, which may confer greater energy
      efficiency. This trophic distribution emerges when community biomass exceeds
      approximately 650 kg/ha, suggesting that fisheries for upper trophic level
      species will only be supported under lightly fished scenarios.

AB  - The appearance of wings in insects, early in their evolution [1], has been one of
      the more critical innovations contributing to their extraordinary diversity.
      Despite the conspicuousness and importance of wings, the origin of these
      structures has been difficult to resolve and represented one of the "abominable
      mysteries" in evolutionary biology [2]. More than a century of debate has boiled 
      the matter down to two competing alternatives-one of wings representing an
      extension of the thoracic notum, the other stating that they are appendicular
      derivations from the lateral body wall. Recently, a dual model has been supported
      by genomic and developmental data [3-6], representing an amalgamation of elements
      from both the notal and pleural hypotheses. Here, we reveal crucial information
      from the wing pad joints of Carboniferous palaeodictyopteran insect nymphs using 
      classical and high-tech techniques. These nymphs had three pairs of wing pads
      that were medially articulated to the thorax but also broadly contiguous with the
      notum anteriorly and posteriorly (details unobservable in modern insects),
      supporting their overall origin from the thoracic notum as well as the expected
      medial, pleural series of axillary sclerites. Our study provides support for the 
      formation of the insect wing from the thoracic notum as well as the already known
      pleural elements of the arthropodan leg. These results support the unique, dual
      model for insect wing origins and the convergent reduction of notal fusion in
      more derived clades, presumably due to wing rotation during development, and they
      help to bring resolution to this long-standing debate.

AB  - Advances in technology are opening new windows on the structural connectivity and
      functional dynamics of brain circuits. Quantitative frameworks are needed that
      integrate these data from anatomy and physiology. Here, we present a modeling
      approach that creates such a link. The goal is to infer the structure of a neural
      circuit from sparse neural recordings, using partial knowledge of its anatomy as 
      a regularizing constraint. We recorded visual responses from the output neurons
      of the retina, the ganglion cells. We then generated a systematic sequence of
      circuit models that represents retinal neurons and connections and fitted them to
      the experimental data. The optimal models faithfully recapitulated the ganglion
      cell outputs. More importantly, they made predictions about dynamics and
      connectivity among unobserved neurons internal to the circuit, and these were
      subsequently confirmed by experiment. This circuit inference framework promises
      to facilitate the integration and understanding of big data in neuroscience.

AB  - Functional and anatomical sexual dimorphisms in the brain are either the result
      of cells that are generated only in one sex or a manifestation of sex-specific
      differentiation of neurons present in both sexes. The PHC neuron pair of the
      nematode C. elegans differentiates in a strikingly sex-specific manner. In
      hermaphrodites the PHC neurons display a canonical pattern of synaptic
      connectivity similar to that of other sensory neurons, but in males PHC
      differentiates into a densely connected hub sensory neuron/interneuron,
      integrating a large number of male-specific synaptic inputs and conveying them to
      both male-specific and sex-shared circuitry. We show that the differentiation
      into such a hub neuron involves the sex-specific scaling of several components of
      the synaptic vesicle machinery, including the vesicular glutamate transporter
      eat-4/VGLUT, induction of neuropeptide expression, changes in axonal projection
      morphology, and a switch in neuronal function. We demonstrate that these
      molecular and anatomical remodeling events are controlled cell autonomously by
      the phylogenetically conserved Doublesex homolog dmd-3, which is both required
      and sufficient for sex-specific PHC differentiation. Cellular specificity of
      dmd-3 action is ensured by its collaboration with non-sex-specific terminal
      selector-type transcription factors, whereas the sex specificity of dmd-3 action 
      is ensured by the hermaphrodite-specific transcriptional master regulator of
      hermaphroditic cell identity tra-1, which represses the transcription of dmd-3 in
      hermaphrodite PHC. Taken together, our studies provide mechanistic insights into 
      how neurons are specified in a sexually dimorphic manner.

AB  - Germ cell death occurs in many species [1-3] and has been proposed as a mechanism
      by which the fittest, strongest, or least damaged germ cells are selected for
      transmission to the next generation. However, little is known about how the
      choice is made between germ cell survival and death. Here, we focus on the
      mechanisms that regulate germ cell survival during embryonic development in
      Drosophila. We find that the decision to die is a germ cell-intrinsic process
      linked to quantitative differences in germ plasm inheritance, such that higher
      germ plasm inheritance correlates with higher primordial germ cell (PGC) survival
      probability. We demonstrate that the maternal factor lipid phosphate phosphatase 
      Wunen-2 (Wun2) regulates PGC survival in a dose-dependent manner. Since wun2 mRNA
      levels correlate with the levels of other maternal determinants at the
      single-cell level, we propose that Wun2 is used as a readout of the overall germ 
      plasm quantity, such that only PGCs with the highest germ plasm quantity survive.
      Furthermore, we demonstrate that Wun2 and p53, another regulator of PGC survival,
      have opposite yet independent effects on PGC survival. Since p53 regulates cell
      death upon DNA damage and various cellular stresses, we hypothesize that together
      they ensure selection of the PGCs with highest germ plasm quantity and least
      cellular damage.

AB  - Neurons in animal visual systems that respond to global optic flow exhibit
      selectivity for motion direction and/or velocity. The avian lentiformis
      mesencephali (LM), known in mammals as the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), is a
      key nucleus for global motion processing [1-4]. In all animals tested, it has
      been found that the majority of LM and NOT neurons are tuned to temporo-nasal
      (back-to-front) motion [4-11]. Moreover, the monocular gain of the optokinetic
      response is higher in this direction, compared to naso-temporal (front-to-back)
      motion [12, 13]. Hummingbirds are sensitive to small visual perturbations while
      hovering, and they drift to compensate for optic flow in all directions [14].
      Interestingly, the LM, but not other visual nuclei, is hypertrophied in
      hummingbirds relative to other birds [15], which suggests enhanced perception of 
      global visual motion. Using extracellular recording techniques, we found that
      there is a uniform distribution of preferred directions in the LM in Anna's
      hummingbirds, whereas zebra finch and pigeon LM populations, as in other
      tetrapods, show a strong bias toward temporo-nasal motion. Furthermore, LM and
      NOT neurons are generally classified as tuned to "fast" or "slow" motion [10, 16,
      17], and we predicted that most neurons would be tuned to slow visual motion as
      an adaptation for slow hovering. However, we found the opposite result: most
      hummingbird LM neurons are tuned to fast pattern velocities, compared to zebra
      finches and pigeons. Collectively, these results suggest a role in rapid
      responses during hovering, as well as in velocity control and collision avoidance
      during forward flight of hummingbirds.

AB  - Most neuronal populations form on both the left and right sides of the brain.
      Their efferent axons appear to grow synchronously along similar pathways on each 
      side, although the neurons or their environment often differ between the two
      hemispheres [1-4]. How this coordination is controlled has received little
      attention. Frequently, neurons establish interhemispheric connections, which can 
      function to integrate information between brain hemispheres (e.g., [5]). Such
      commissures form very early, suggesting their potential developmental role in
      coordinating ipsilateral axon navigation during embryonic development [4]. To
      address the temporal-spatial control of bilateral axon growth, we applied
      long-term time-lapse imaging to visualize the formation of the conserved
      left-right asymmetric habenular neural circuit in the developing zebrafish embryo
      [6]. Although habenular neurons are born at different times across brain
      hemispheres [7], we found that elongation of habenular axons occurs
      synchronously. The initiation of axon extension is not controlled within the
      habenular network itself but through an early developing proximal diencephalic
      network. The commissural neurons of this network influence habenular axons both
      ipsilaterally and contralaterally. Their unilateral absence impairs commissure
      formation and coordinated habenular axon elongation and causes their subsequent
      arrest on both sides of the brain. Thus, habenular neural circuit formation
      depends on a second intersecting commissural network, which facilitates the
      exchange of information between hemispheres required for ipsilaterally projecting
      habenular axons. This mechanism of network formation may well apply to other
      circuits, and has only remained undiscovered due to technical limitations.

AB  - The hippocampus plays an important role in memory for events that are distinct in
      space and time. One of the strongest, most synchronous neural signals produced by
      the hippocampus is the sharp-wave ripple (SWR), observed in a variety of
      mammalian species during offline behaviors, such as slow-wave sleep [1-3] and
      quiescent waking and pauses in exploration [4-8], leading to long-standing and
      widespread theories of its contribution to plasticity and memory during these
      inactive or immobile states [9-14]. Indeed, during sleep and waking inactivity,
      hippocampal SWRs in rodents appear to support spatial long-term and working
      memory [4, 15-23], but so far, they have not been linked to memory in primates.
      More recently, SWRs have been observed during active, visual scene exploration in
      macaques [24], opening up the possibility that these active-state ripples in the 
      primate hippocampus are linked to memory for objects embedded in scenes. By
      measuring hippocampal SWRs in macaques during search for scene-contextualized
      objects, we found that SWR rate increased with repeated presentations.
      Furthermore, gaze during SWRs was more likely to be near the target object on
      repeated than on novel presentations, even after accounting for overall
      differences in gaze location with scene repetition. This proximity bias with
      repetition occurred near the time of target object detection for remembered
      targets. The increase in ripple likelihood near remembered visual objects
      suggests a link between ripples and memory in primates; specifically, SWRs may
      reflect part of a mechanism supporting the guidance of search based on past
      experience.

      Differentiation Response in Fission Yeast.

AB  - Extracellular cues regulate cell fate, and this is mainly achieved through the
      engagement of specific transcriptional programs. The TORC1 and TORC2 complexes
      mediate the integration of nutritional cues to cellular behavior, but their
      interplay is poorly understood. Here, we use fission yeast to investigate how
      phosphatase activity participates in this interplay during the switch from
      proliferation to sexual differentiation. We find that loss of PP2A-B55(Pab1)
      enhances the expression of differentiation-specific genes and leads to premature 
      conjugation. pab1 deletion brings about a transcriptional profile similar to
      TORC1 inactivation, and deletion of pab1 overcomes the repression of
      differentiation genes in cells overexpressing TORC1. Importantly, we show that
      this effect is mediated by an increased TORC2-AKT (Gad8) signaling. Under
      nutrient-rich conditions, PP2A-B55(Pab1) dephosphorylates Gad8 Ser546, repressing
      its activity. Conversely, TORC1 inactivation upon starvation leads to the
      inactivation of PP2A-B55(Pab1) through the Greatwall-Endosulfin pathway. This
      results in the activation of Gad8 and the commitment to differentiation. Thus,
      PP2A-B55(Pab1) enables a crosstalk between the two TOR complexes that controls
      cell-fate decisions in response to nutrient availability.

AB  - Self-fertilization is widely believed to be an "evolutionary dead end" [1, 2],
      increasing the risk of extinction [3] and the accumulation of deleterious
      mutations in genomes [4]. Strikingly, while the failure to adapt has always been 
      central to the dead-end hypothesis [1, 2], there are no quantitative genetic
      selection experiments comparing the response to positive selection in selfing
      versus outcrossing populations. Here we studied the response to selection on a
      morphological trait in laboratory populations of a hermaphroditic, self-fertile
      snail under either selfing or outcrossing. We applied both treatments to two
      types of populations: some having undergone frequent selfing and purged a
      substantial fraction of their mutation load in their recent history [5], and
      others continuously maintained under outcrossing. Populations with a history of
      outcrossing respond faster to selection than those that have experienced selfing.
      In addition, when self-fertilization occurs during selection, the response is
      initially fast but then rapidly slows, while outcrossing populations maintain
      their response throughout the experiment. This occurs irrespective of past
      selfing history, suggesting that high levels of inbreeding depression, contrary
      to expectation [6], do not set strong limits to the response to selection under
      inbreeding, at least at the timescale of a few generations. More surprisingly,
      phenotypic variance is consistently higher under selfing, although it quickly
      becomes less responsive to selection. This implies an increase in non-heritable
      variance, hence a breakdown of developmental canalization [7] under selfing. Our 
      findings provide the first empirical support of the short-term positive and
      long-term negative effects of selfing on adaptive potential.

AB  - An inherent limitation of human visual system research stems from its reliance on
      highly controlled laboratory conditions. Visual processing in the real world
      differs substantially from such controlled conditions. In particular, during
      natural vision, we continuously sample the dynamic environment by variable eye
      movements that lead to inherent instability of the optical image. The neuronal
      mechanism by which human perception remains stable under these natural conditions
      remains unknown. Here, we examined a neural mechanism that may contribute to such
      stability, i.e., the extent to which neuronal responses remain invariant to
      oculomotor parameters and viewing conditions. To this end, we introduce an
      experimental paradigm in which intracranial brain activity, a video of the
      real-life visual scene, and free oculomotor behavior were simultaneously recorded
      in human patients. Our results reveal, in high-order visual areas, a remarkable
      level of neural invariance to the length of eye fixations and lack of evidence
      for a saccade-related neuronal signature. Thus, neuronal responses, while showing
      high selectivity to the category of visual images, manifested stable "iconic"
      dynamics. This property of invariance to fixation onset and duration emerged only
      in high-order visual representations. In early visual cortex, the fixation onset 
      was accompanied with suppressive neural signal, and duration of neuronal
      responses was largely determined by the fixation times. These results uncover
      unique neuronal dynamics in high-order ventral stream visual areas that could
      play an important role in achieving perceptual stability, despite the drastic
      changes introduced by oculomotor behavior in real life.

AB  - Motile cilia are actively beating hair-like structures that cover the surface of 
      multiple epithelia. The flow that ciliary beating generates is utilized for
      diverse functions and depends on the spatial location and biophysical properties 
      of cilia. Here we show that the motile cilia in the nose of aquatic vertebrates
      are spatially organized and stably beat with an asymmetric pattern, resulting in 
      a robust and stereotypical flow around the nose. Our results demonstrate that
      these flow fields attract odors to the nose pit and facilitate detection of odors
      by the olfactory system in stagnant environments. Moreover, we show that ciliary 
      beating quickly exchanges the content of the nose, thereby improving the temporal
      resolution of the olfactory system for detecting dynamic changes of odor plumes
      in turbulent environments. Altogether, our work unravels a central function of
      ciliary beating for generating flow fields that increase the sensitivity and the 
      temporal resolution of olfactory computations in the vertebrate brain.

AB  - Temperature is a key seasonal signal that shapes plant growth. Elevated ambient
      temperature accelerates growth and developmental transitions [1] while
      compromising plant defenses, leading to increased susceptibility [2, 3].
      Suppression of immunity at elevated temperature is at the interface of trade-off 
      between growth and defense [2, 4]. Climate change and the increase in average
      growth-season temperatures threaten biodiversity and food security [5, 6].
      Despite its significance, the molecular mechanisms that link thermosensory growth
      and defense responses are not known. Here we show that PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING
      FACTOR 4 (PIF4)-mediated thermosensory growth and architecture adaptations are
      directly linked to suppression of immunity at elevated temperature. PIF4
      positively regulates growth and development and negatively regulates immunity. We
      also show that natural variation of PIF4-mediated temperature response underlies 
      variation in the balance between growth and defense among Arabidopsis natural
      strains. Importantly, we find that modulation of PIF4 function alters temperature
      sensitivity of defense. Perturbation of PIF4-mediated growth has resulted in
      temperature-resilient disease resistance. This study reveals a molecular link
      between thermosensory growth and immunity in plants. Elucidation of the molecular
      mechanisms that define environmental signal integration is key to the development
      of novel strategies for breeding temperature-resilient disease resistance in
      crops.

AB  - Legumes associate with rhizobia to form nitrogen (N2)-fixing nodules, which is
      important for plant fitness [1, 2]. Medicago truncatula controls the terminal
      differentiation of Sinorhizobium meliloti into N2-fixing bacteroids by producing 
      defensin-like nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) [3, 4]. The redox
      state of NCRs influences some biological activities in free-living bacteria, but 
      the relevance of redox regulation of NCRs in planta is unknown [5, 6], although
      redox regulation plays a crucial role in symbiotic nitrogen fixation [7, 8]. Two 
      thioredoxins (Trx), Trx s1 and s2, define a new type of Trx and are expressed
      principally in nodules [9]. Here, we show that there are four Trx s genes, two of
      which, Trx s1 and s3, are induced in the nodule infection zone where bacterial
      differentiation occurs. Trx s1 is targeted to the symbiosomes, the N2-fixing
      organelles. Trx s1 interacted with NCR247 and NCR335 and increased the cytotoxic 
      effect of NCR335 in S. meliloti. We show that Trx s silencing impairs bacteroid
      growth and endoreduplication, two features of terminal bacteroid differentiation,
      and that the ectopic expression of Trx s1 in S. meliloti partially complements
      the silencing phenotype. Thus, our findings show that Trx s1 is targeted to the
      bacterial endosymbiont, where it controls NCR activity and bacteroid terminal
      differentiation. Similarly, Trxs are critical for the activation of defensins
      produced against infectious microbes in mammalian hosts. Therefore, our results
      suggest the Trx-mediated regulation of host peptides as a conserved mechanism
      among symbiotic and pathogenic interactions.

AB  - Honeybees are models for studying how animals with relatively small brains
      accomplish complex cognition, displaying seemingly advanced (or "non-elemental") 
      learning phenomena involving multiple conditioned stimuli. These include "peak
      shift" [1-4]-where animals not only respond to entrained stimuli, but respond
      even more strongly to similar ones that are farther away from non-rewarding
      stimuli. Bees also display negative and positive patterning discrimination [5],
      responding in opposite ways to mixtures of two odors than to individual odors.
      Since Pavlov, it has often been assumed that such phenomena are more complex than
      simple associate learning. We present a model of connections between olfactory
      sensory input and bees' mushroom bodies [6], incorporating empirically determined
      properties of mushroom body circuitry (random connectivity [7], sparse coding
      [8], and synaptic plasticity [9, 10]). We chose not to optimize the model's
      parameters to replicate specific behavioral phenomena, because we were interested
      in the emergent cognitive capacities that would pop out of a network constructed 
      solely based on empirical neuroscientific information and plausible assumptions
      for unknown parameters. We demonstrate that the circuitry mediating "simple"
      associative learning can also replicate the various non-elemental forms of
      learning mentioned above and can effectively multi-task by replicating a range of
      different learning feats. We found that PN-KC synaptic plasticity is crucial in
      controlling the generalization-discrimination trade-off-it facilitates peak shift
      and hinders patterning discrimination-and that PN-to-KC connection number can
      affect this trade-off. These findings question the notion that forms of learning 
      that have been regarded as "higher order" are computationally more complex than
      "simple" associative learning.

AB  - Migration through micron-size constrictions has been seen to rupture the nucleus,
      release nuclear-localized GFP, and cause localized accumulations of ectopic
      53BP1-a DNA repair protein. Here, constricted migration of two human cancer cell 
      types and primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) increases DNA breaks throughout
      the nucleoplasm as assessed by endogenous damage markers and by electrophoretic
      "comet" measurements. Migration also causes multiple DNA repair proteins to
      segregate away from DNA, with cytoplasmic mis-localization sustained for many
      hours as is relevant to delayed repair. Partial knockdown of repair factors that 
      also regulate chromosome copy numbers is seen to increase DNA breaks in U2OS
      osteosarcoma cells without affecting migration and with nucleoplasmic patterns of
      damage similar to constricted migration. Such depletion also causes aberrant
      levels of DNA. Migration-induced nuclear damage is nonetheless reversible for
      wild-type and sub-cloned U2OS cells, except for lasting genomic differences
      between stable clones as revealed by DNA arrays and sequencing. Gains and losses 
      of hundreds of megabases in many chromosomes are typical of the changes and
      heterogeneity in bone cancer. Phenotypic differences that arise from constricted 
      migration of U2OS clones are further illustrated by a clone with a highly
      elongated and stable MSC-like shape that depends on microtubule assembly
      downstream of the transcription factor GATA4. Such changes are consistent with
      reversion to a more stem-like state upstream of cancerous osteoblastic cells.
      Migration-induced genomic instability can thus associate with heritable changes.

AB  - The actin cytoskeleton provides not only the underpinning for cell architecture
      but also mechanical force and the ability to drive movement of cells and their
      organelles. It is tempting to think of it simply as a set of stable structural
      elements, but nothing could be further from the truth. The cells of our bodies
      are continually remodelling their architecture by responding to a range of
      imposed biomechanical forces and intracellular functional demands. Studies of the
      dynamic and functional properties of the actin cytoskeleton have been dominated
      by a focus on actin and the view that actin filaments are essentially 'generic'. 
      However, the 'other' component of most actin filaments in animals - tropomyosin -
      is coming into prominence. With this discovery is the realisation that far from
      being generic, actin filaments have their own functional individuality provided
      to them by their associated tropomyosin. This is changing the way we understand
      and study the actin cytoskeleton and has delivered a new therapeutic opportunity 
      in what had come to be considered a 'no-go zone'.

AB  - How Drosophila larvae select one behavior or a sequence of behaviors, and then
      persist in the final one, has been addressed by a powerful combination of
      electron-microscopy reconstruction of neuronal connections, genetic
      manipulations, electrophysiology, and neuronal modeling. Surprisingly, reciprocal
      inhibitory synaptic connections are major players in choosing, sequencing and
      maintaining behaviors.

AB  - The mesopelagic or 'twilight zone' of the oceans occurs too deep for
      photosynthesis, but is a major part of the world's carbon cycle. Depth boundaries
      for the mesopelagic have now been shown on a global scale using the distribution 
      of pelagic animals detected by compiling echo-soundings from ships around the
      world, and been used to predict the effect of global warming on regional fish
      production.

AB  - Coordinated changes of cell shape are often the result of the excitable,
      wave-like dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. New work shows that, in migrating
      cells, protrusion waves arise from mechanochemical crosstalk between adhesion
      sites, membrane tension and the actin protrusive machinery.

AB  - Larval stages can be astonishingly different from their adult forms. A new study 
      in acorn worms shows that the whole larval body is patterned only with a subset
      of anterior genes, revealing the intricate developmental bases that underlie the 
      evolution of larval forms.

AB  - Mitotic chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion, and higher order
      folding of interphase chromatin are mediated by condensin and cohesin, eukaryotic
      members of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes)-kleisin protein
      family. Other members facilitate chromosome segregation in bacteria [1]. A
      hallmark of these complexes is the binding of the two ends of a kleisin subunit
      to the apices of V-shaped Smc dimers, creating a tripartite ring capable of
      entrapping DNA (Figure 1A). In addition to creating rings, kleisins recruit
      regulatory subunits. One family of regulators, namely Kite dimers (Kleisin
      interacting winged-helix tandem elements), interact with Smc-kleisin rings from
      bacteria, archaea and the eukaryotic Smc5-6 complex, but not with either
      condensin or cohesin [2]. These instead possess proteins containing HEAT
      (Huntingtin/EF3/PP2A/Tor1) repeat domains whose origin and distribution have not 
      yet been characterized. Using a combination of profile Hidden Markov Model
      (HMM)-based homology searches, network analysis and structural alignments, we
      identify a common origin for these regulators, for which we propose the name
      Hawks, i.e. HEAT proteins associated with kleisins.

AB  - Ocean surface warming is resulting in an expansion of stratified, low-nutrient
      environments, a process referred to as ocean desertification [1]. A challenge for
      assessing the impact of these changes is the lack of robust baseline information 
      on the biological communities that carry out marine photosynthesis. Phytoplankton
      perform half of global biological CO2 uptake, fuel marine food chains, and
      include diverse eukaryotic algae that have photosynthetic organelles (plastids)
      acquired through multiple evolutionary events [1-3]. While amassing data from
      ocean ecosystems for the Baselines Initiative (6,177 near full-length 16S rRNA
      gene sequences and 9.4 million high-quality 16S V1-V2 amplicons) we identified
      two deep-branching plastid lineages based on 16S rRNA gene data. The two lineages
      have global distributions, but do not correspond to known phytoplankton. How the 
      newly discovered phytoplankton lineages contribute to food chains and vertical
      carbon export to the deep sea remains unknown, but their prevalence in expanding,
      low nutrient surface waters suggests they will have a role in future oceans.

AB  - It is widely accepted that coral reefs are in decline globally, due to climate
      change as well as more direct human impacts such as poor water quality and
      overharvesting [1-3]. Biological invasions are also seen as a major threat [4-6];
      however, they may not all be negative. An invasion of Red Sea rabbitfishes is
      disrupting Mediterranean ecosystems by removing macro-algae - meanwhile, in
      contrast, the Caribbean is suffering from excess macro-algal growth. We suggest
      that an invasion of the Caribbean by rabbitfishes may prove beneficial, and that 
      the future of Caribbean coral reefs may depend upon a rabbitfish invasion.

AB  - Vertebrate red blood cells (RBCs) display a range of sizes, spanning orders of
      magnitude in volume in different clades [1]. The importance of this size
      variation to diffusion during exercise is reinforced by functional links between 
      RBC and capillary diameters [2, 3]. Small RBCs, such as those of mammals (which
      lack nuclei) and birds, contribute to shorter diffusion distances and permit
      relatively fast O2 uptake kinetics [4]. Although constraints on RBC size have
      been tied to the cell's need to attend capillary sizes for effective gas
      diffusion [3], as well as to genome size evolution [5, 6], major questions
      persist concerning patterns of RBC size evolution and its paleobiological
      significance. Here, we evaluate the relationship between RBC sizes and bone
      histometry and use microstructural evidence to trace their evolution in a
      phylogeny of extinct tetrapods. We find that several fossilizable aspects of bone
      microstructure, including the sizes of vascular and lacunar (cellular) spaces,
      provide useful indicators of RBC size in tetrapods. We also show that Triassic
      non-mammalian cynodonts had reduced and densely packed vascular canals identical 
      to those of some mammals and likely accommodated smaller, more mammal-like RBCs. 
      Reduced channel diameters accommodating smaller RBCs predated the origin of crown
      mammals by as much as 70 million years. This discovery offers a new proxy for the
      physiologic status of the mammal and avian stem groups and contextualizes the
      independent origins of their increased activity metabolism.

LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2016.10.043 [doi]
AB  - Ontogenetic variation is documented within many dinosaur species, but extreme
      ontogenetic changes are rare among dinosaurs, particularly among theropods. Here,
      we analyze 19 specimens of the Jurassic ceratosaurian theropod Limusaurus
      inextricabilis, representing six ontogenetic stages based on body size and
      histological data. Among 78 ontogenetic changes we identify in these specimens,
      the most unexpected one is the change from fully toothed jaws in the hatchling
      and juvenile individuals to a completely toothless beaked jaw in the more mature 
      individuals, representing the first fossil record of ontogenetic edentulism among
      the jawed vertebrates. Jaw morphological data, including those derived from Mi-CT
      and SR-muCT scanning of Limusaurus specimens, reveal dental alveolar vestiges and
      indicate that ontogenetic tooth loss in Limusaurus is a gradual, complex process.
      Our discovery has significant implications for understanding the evolution of the
      beak, an important feeding structure present in several tetrapod clades,
      including modern birds. This radical morphological change suggests a dietary
      shift, probably from omnivory for juvenile Limusaurus to herbivory for adult
      Limusaurus, which is also supported by additional evidence from gastroliths and
      stable isotopes. Incorporating new ontogenetic information from Limusaurus into
      phylogenetic analyses demonstrates surprisingly little effect on its placement
      when data from different stages are used exclusively, in contrast to previous
      analyses of tyrannosaurids, but produces subtle differences extending beyond the 
      placement of Limusaurus.

AB  - The global ocean's near surface can be partitioned into distinct provinces on the
      basis of regional primary productivity and oceanography [1]. This ecological
      geography provides a valuable framework for understanding spatial variability in 
      ecosystem function but has relevance only partway into the epipelagic zone (the
      top 200 m). The mesopelagic (200-1,000 m) makes up approximately 20% of the
      global ocean volume, plays important roles in biogeochemical cycling [2], and
      holds potentially huge fish resources [3-5]. It is, however, hidden from
      satellite observation, and a lack of globally consistent data has prevented
      development of a global-scale understanding. Acoustic deep scattering layers
      (DSLs) are prominent features of the mesopelagic. These vertically narrow (tens
      to hundreds of m) but horizontally extensive (continuous for tens to thousands of
      km) layers comprise fish and zooplankton and are readily detectable using
      echosounders. We have compiled a database of DSL characteristics globally. We
      show that DSL depth and acoustic backscattering intensity (a measure of biomass) 
      can be modeled accurately using just surface primary productivity, temperature,
      and wind stress. Spatial variability in these environmental factors leads to a
      natural partition of the mesopelagic into ten distinct classes. These classes
      demark a more complex biogeography than the latitudinally banded schemes proposed
      before [6, 7]. Knowledge of how environmental factors influence the mesopelagic
      enables future change to be explored: we predict that by 2100 there will be
      widespread homogenization of mesopelagic communities and that mesopelagic biomass
      could increase by approximately 17%. The biomass increase requires increased
      trophic efficiency, which could arise because of ocean warming and DSL
      shallowing.

AB  - The spindle checkpoint acts as a mitotic surveillance system, monitoring
      interactions between kinetochores and spindle microtubules and ensuring
      high-fidelity chromosome segregation [1-3]. The checkpoint is activated by
      unattached kinetochores, and Mps1 kinase phosphorylates KNL1 on conserved MELT
      motifs to generate a binding site for the Bub3-Bub1 complex [4-7]. This leads to 
      dynamic kinetochore recruitment of Mad proteins [8, 9], a conformational change
      in Mad2 [10-12], and formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC:
      Cdc20-Mad3-Mad2 [13-15]). MCC formation inhibits the anaphase-promoting
      complex/cyclosome (Cdc20-APC/C), thereby preventing the proteolytic destruction
      of securin and cyclin and delaying anaphase onset. What happens at kinetochores
      after Mps1-dependent Bub3-Bub1 recruitment remains mechanistically unclear, and
      it is not known whether kinetochore proteins other than KNL1 have significant
      roles to play in checkpoint signaling and MCC generation. Here, we take a
      reductionist approach, avoiding the complexities of kinetochores, and demonstrate
      that co-recruitment of KNL1(Spc7) and Mps1(Mph1) is sufficient to generate a
      robust checkpoint signal and prolonged mitotic arrest. We demonstrate that a
      Mad1-Bub1 complex is formed during synthetic checkpoint signaling. Analysis of
      bub3Delta mutants demonstrates that Bub3 acts to suppress premature checkpoint
      signaling. This synthetic system will enable detailed, mechanistic dissection of 
      MCC generation and checkpoint silencing. After analyzing several mutants that
      affect localization of checkpoint complexes, we conclude that spindle checkpoint 
      arrest can be independent of their kinetochore, spindle pole, and nuclear
      envelope localization.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central circadian clock in mammals. It
      is entrained by light but resistant to temperature shifts that entrain peripheral
      clocks [1-5]. The SCN expresses many functionally important neuropeptides,
      including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which drives light entrainment,
      synchrony, and amplitude of SCN cellular clocks and organizes circadian behavior 
      [5-16]. The transcription factor LHX1 drives SCN Vip expression, and cellular
      desynchrony in Lhx1-deficient SCN largely results from Vip loss [17, 18]. LHX1
      regulates many genes other than Vip, yet activity rhythms in Lhx1-deficient mice 
      are similar to Vip(-/-) mice under light-dark cycles and only somewhat worse in
      constant conditions. We suspected that LHX1 targets other than Vip have circadian
      functions overlooked in previous studies. In this study, we compared circadian
      sleep and temperature rhythms of Lhx1- and Vip-deficient mice and found loss of
      acute light control of sleep in Lhx1 but not Vip mutants. We also found loss of
      circadian resistance to fever in Lhx1 but not Vip mice, which was partially
      recapitulated by heat application to cultured Lhx1-deficient SCN. Having
      identified VIP-independent functions of LHX1, we mapped the VIP-independent
      transcriptional network downstream of LHX1 and a largely separable VIP-dependent 
      transcriptional network. The VIP-independent network does not affect core clock
      amplitude and synchrony, unlike the VIP-dependent network. These studies identify
      Lhx1 as the first gene required for temperature resistance of the SCN clockworks 
      and demonstrate that acute light control of sleep is routed through the SCN and
      its immediate output regions.

AB  - Disrupted mesocortical dopamine contributes to cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). Past work has implicated medial frontal neurons expressing D1
      dopamine receptors (D1DRs) in temporal processing. Here, we investigated whether 
      these neurons can compensate for behavioral deficits resulting from midbrain
      dopamine dysfunction. We report three main results. First, both PD patients and
      mice with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine depletion had attenuated delta
      activity (1-4 Hz) in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) during interval timing.
      Second, we found that optogenetically stimulating MFC D1DR neurons could increase
      ramping activity among MFC neurons. Finally, stimulating MFC D1DR neurons
      specifically at delta frequencies (2 Hz) compensated for deficits in temporal
      control of action caused by VTA dopamine depletion. Our results suggest that
      cortical networks can be targeted by frequency-specific brain stimulation to
      improve dopamine-dependent cognitive processing.

AB  - Classical cadherins are well known for their essential function in mediating
      cell-cell adhesion via their extra-cellular cadherin domains and intra-cellular
      connections to the actin cytoskeleton [1-3]. There is evidence, however, of
      adhesion-independent cadherin clusters existing outside of cell-cell junctions
      [4-6]. What function, if any, these clusters have is not known. HMR-1, the sole
      classical cadherin in Caenorhabditis elegans, plays essential roles during
      gastrulation, blastomere polarity establishment, and epidermal morphogenesis
      [7-11]. To elucidate the physiological roles of non-junctional cadherin, we
      analyzed HMR-1 in the C. elegans zygote, which is devoid of neighbors. We show
      that non-junctional clusters of HMR-1 form during the one-cell polarization stage
      and associate with F-actin at the cortex during episodes of cortical flow.
      Non-junctional HMR-1 clusters downregulate RHO-1 activity and inhibit
      accumulation of non-muscle myosin II (NMY-2) at the anterior cortex. We found
      that HMR-1 clusters impede cortical flows and play a role in preserving the
      integrity of the actomyosin cortex, preventing it from splitting in two.
      Importantly, we uncovered an inverse relationship between the amount of HMR-1 at 
      the cell surface and the rate of cytokinesis. The effect of HMR-1 clusters on
      cytokinesis is independent of their effect on NMY-2 levels, and is also
      independent of their extra-cellular domains. Thus, in addition to their canonical
      role in inter-cellular adhesion, HMR-1 clusters regulate RHO-1 activity and NMY-2
      level at the cell surface, reinforce the stability of the actomyosin cortex, and 
      resist its movement to influence cell-shape dynamics.

AB  - The Palaeognathae comprise the flightless ratites and the volant tinamous, and
      together with the Neognathae constitute the extant members of class Aves. It is
      commonly believed that Palaeognathae originated in Gondwana since most of the
      living species are found in the Southern Hemisphere [1-3]. However, this
      hypothesis has been questioned because the fossil paleognaths are mostly from the
      Northern Hemisphere in their earliest time (Paleocene) and possessed many
      putative ancestral characters [4]. Uncertainties regarding the origin and
      evolution of Palaeognathae stem from the difficulty in estimating their
      divergence times [1, 2] and their remarkable morphological convergence. Here, we 
      recovered nuclear genome fragments from extinct elephant birds, which enabled us 
      to reconstruct a reliable phylogenomic time tree for the Palaeognathae. Based on 
      the tree, we identified homoplasies in morphological traits of paleognaths and
      reconstructed their morphology-based phylogeny including fossil species without
      molecular data. In contrast to the prevailing theories, the fossil paleognaths
      from the Northern Hemisphere were placed as the basal lineages. Combined with our
      stable divergence time estimates that enabled a valid argument regarding the
      correlation with geological events, we propose a new evolutionary scenario that
      contradicts the traditional view. The ancestral Palaeognathae were volant, as
      estimated from their molecular evolutionary rates, and originated during the Late
      Cretaceous in the Northern Hemisphere. They migrated to the Southern Hemisphere
      and speciated explosively around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. They then
      extended their distribution to the Gondwana-derived landmasses, such as New
      Zealand and Madagascar, by overseas dispersal. Gigantism subsequently occurred
      independently on each landmass.

      Disjunction.

AB  - In most sexually reproducing organisms, crossover formation between homologous
      chromosomes is necessary for proper chromosome disjunction during meiosis I.
      During meiotic recombination, a subset of programmed DNA double-strand breaks
      (DSBs) are repaired as crossovers, with the remainder becoming noncrossovers [1].
      Whether a repair intermediate is designated to become a crossover is a highly
      regulated decision that integrates several crossover patterning processes, both
      along chromosome arms (interference and the centromere effect) and between
      chromosomes (crossover assurance) [2]. Because the mechanisms that generate
      crossover patterning have remained elusive for over a century, it has been
      difficult to assess the relationship between crossover patterning and meiotic
      chromosome behavior. We show here that meiotic crossover patterning is lost in
      Drosophila melanogaster mutants that lack the Bloom syndrome helicase. In the
      absence of interference and the centromere effect, crossovers are distributed
      more uniformly along chromosomes. Crossovers even occur on the small chromosome
      4, which normally never has meiotic crossovers [3]. Regulated distribution of
      crossovers between chromosome pairs is also lost, resulting in an elevated
      frequency of homologs that do not receive a crossover, which in turn leads to
      elevated nondisjunction.

AB  - The degree to which offspring remain near their parents or disperse widely is
      critical for understanding population dynamics, evolution, and biogeography, and 
      for designing conservation actions. In the ocean, most estimates suggesting
      short-distance dispersal are based on direct ecological observations of
      dispersing individuals, while indirect evolutionary estimates often suggest
      substantially greater homogeneity among populations. Reconciling these two
      approaches and their seemingly competing perspectives on dispersal has been a
      major challenge. Here we show for the first time that evolutionary and ecological
      measures of larval dispersal can closely agree by using both to estimate the
      distribution of dispersal distances. In orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula)
      populations in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, we found that evolutionary dispersal 
      kernels were 17 km (95% confidence interval: 12-24 km) wide, while an exhaustive 
      set of direct larval dispersal observations suggested kernel widths of 27 km
      (19-36 km) or 19 km (15-27 km) across two years. The similarity between these two
      approaches suggests that ecological and evolutionary dispersal kernels can be
      equivalent, and that the apparent disagreement between direct and indirect
      measurements can be overcome. Our results suggest that carefully applied
      evolutionary methods, which are often less expensive, can be broadly relevant for
      understanding ecological dispersal across the tree of life.

AB  - Small increases in ambient temperature can elicit striking effects on plant
      architecture, collectively termed thermomorphogenesis [1]. In Arabidopsis
      thaliana, these include marked stem elongation and leaf elevation, responses that
      have been predicted to enhance leaf cooling [2-5]. Thermomorphogenesis requires
      increased auxin biosynthesis, mediated by the bHLH transcription factor
      PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) [6-8], and enhanced stability of the
      auxin co-receptor TIR1, involving HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90 (HSP90) [9].
      High-temperature-mediated hypocotyl elongation additionally involves localized
      changes in auxin metabolism, mediated by the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido
      synthetase Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3).17 [10]. Here we show that ultraviolet-B light 
      (UV-B) perceived by the photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) [11] strongly 
      attenuates thermomorphogenesis via multiple mechanisms inhibiting PIF4 activity. 
      Suppression of thermomorphogenesis involves UVR8 and CONSTITUTIVELY
      PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1)-mediated repression of PIF4 transcript accumulation,
      reducing PIF4 abundance. UV-B also stabilizes the bHLH protein LONG HYPOCOTYL IN 
      FAR RED (HFR1), which can bind to and inhibit PIF4 function. Collectively, our
      results demonstrate complex crosstalk between UV-B and high-temperature
      signaling. As plants grown in sunlight would most likely experience concomitant
      elevations in UV-B and ambient temperature, elucidating how these pathways are
      integrated is of key importance to the understanding of plant development in
      natural environments.

TI  - Regional Growth Rate Differences Specified by Apical Notch Activities Regulate
      Liverwort Thallus Shape.

AB  - Plants have undergone 470 million years of evolution on land and different groups
      have distinct body shapes. Liverworts are the most ancient land plant lineage and
      have a flattened, creeping body (the thallus), which grows from apical cells in
      an invaginated "notch." The genetic mechanisms regulating liverwort shape are
      almost totally unknown, yet they provide a blueprint for the radiation of land
      plant forms. We have used a combination of live imaging, growth analyses, and
      computational modeling to determine what regulates liverwort thallus shape in
      Marchantia polymorpha. We find that the thallus undergoes a stereotypical
      sequence of shape transitions during the first 2 weeks of growth and that key
      aspects of global shape depend on regional growth rate differences generated by
      the coordinated activities of the apical notches. A "notch-drives-growth" model, 
      in which a diffusible morphogen produced at each notch promotes specified
      isotropic growth, can reproduce the growth rate distributions that generate
      thallus shape given growth suppression at the apex. However, in surgical
      experiments, tissue growth persists following notch excision, showing that this
      model is insufficient to explain thallus growth. In an alternative
      "notch-pre-patterns-growth" model, a persistently acting growth regulator whose
      distribution is pre-patterned by the notches can account for the discrepancies
      between growth dynamics in the notch-drives-growth model and real plants
      following excision. Our work shows that growth rate heterogeneity is the primary 
      shape determinant in Marchantia polymorpha and suggests that the thallus is
      likely to have zones with specialized functions.

TI  - The Adult Body Plan of Indirect Developing Hemichordates Develops by Adding a
      Hox-Patterned Trunk to an Anterior Larval Territory.

AB  - Many animals are indirect developers with distinct larval and adult body plans
      [1]. The molecular basis of differences between larval and adult forms is often
      poorly understood, adding a level of uncertainty to comparative developmental
      studies that use data from both indirect and direct developers. Here we compare
      the larval and adult body plans of an indirect developing hemichordate,
      Schizocardium californicum [2]. We describe the expression of 27 transcription
      factors with conserved roles in deuterostome ectodermal anteroposterior (AP)
      patterning in developing embryos, tornaria larvae, and post-metamorphic juveniles
      and show that the tornaria larva of S. californicum is transcriptionally similar 
      to a truncated version of the adult. The larval ectoderm has an anterior
      molecular signature, while most of the trunk, defined by the expression of
      hox1-7, is absent. Posterior ectodermal activation of Hox is initiated in the
      late larva prior to metamorphosis, in preparation for the transition to the adult
      form, in which the AP axis converges on a molecular architecture similar to that 
      of the direct developing hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii. These results
      identify a molecular correlate of a major difference in body plan between
      hemichordate larval and adult forms and confirm the hypothesis that deuterostome 
      larvae are "swimming heads" [3]. This will allow future comparative studies with 
      hemichordates to take into account molecular differences caused by early life
      history evolution within the phylum. Additionally, comparisons with other phyla
      suggest that a delay in trunk development is a feature of indirect development
      shared across distantly related phyla.

TI  - Opposing Activities of Aurora B Kinase and B56-PP2A Phosphatase on MKlp2
      Determine Abscission Timing.

AB  - After cleavage furrow ingression during cytokinesis, nascent daughter cells
      remain connected by an intercellular bridge (ICB) and the midbody [1, 2]. The
      midbody becomes an assembly platform for ESCRT complexes that split apart the
      plasma membrane (PM) anchored to the ICB and complete abscission, which is the
      final step of cell division [3-5]. Aurora B governs abscission by regulating its 
      timing as a checkpoint [6-10]. However, the underlying mechanisms for this
      process remain unknown. Here, we reveal the mechanism controlling abscission
      through integration of Aurora B kinase and B56-bound PP2A phosphatase activities 
      on the kinesin motor protein MKlp2. We identify MKlp2 as an essential protein for
      promoting abscission, which may regulate tethering and stabilizing of the PM to
      the microtubule cytoskeleton at the ICB through its previously uncharacterized
      lipid association motif (LAM). MKlp2 recruits Aurora B to the ICB [11-15]. In
      turn, Aurora B phosphorylation of MKlp2 S878 in the LAM is a key inhibitory
      signal for abscission. Conversely, B56-PP2A promotes abscission by opposing
      Aurora B phosphorylation of MKlp2 S878. Strikingly, a phospho-resistant MKlp2
      S878A mutant overcomes Aurora-B-mediated abscission blockade. Thus, abscission is
      determined by the balance of Aurora B and B56-PP2A activities on MKlp2 S878
      within the LAM. Together, these findings establish a key mechanism for Aurora B
      regulation of abscission in mammalian cells.

AB  - Dynamic actin networks are excitable. In migrating cells, feedback loops can
      amplify stochastic fluctuations in actin dynamics, often resulting in traveling
      waves of protrusion. The precise contributions of various molecular and
      mechanical interactions to wave generation have been difficult to disentangle, in
      part due to complex cellular morphodynamics. Here we used a relatively simple
      cell type-the fish epithelial keratocyte-to define a set of mechanochemical
      feedback loops underlying actin network excitability and wave generation.
      Although keratocytes are normally characterized by the persistent protrusion of a
      broad leading edge, increasing cell-substrate adhesion strength results in waving
      protrusion of a short leading edge. We show that protrusion waves are due to
      fluctuations in actin polymerization rates and that overexpression of VASP, an
      actin anti-capping protein that promotes actin polymerization, switches highly
      adherent keratocytes from waving to persistent protrusion. Moreover, VASP
      localizes both to adhesion complexes and to the leading edge. Based on these
      results, we developed a mathematical model for protrusion waves in which local
      depletion of VASP from the leading edge by adhesions-along with lateral
      propagation of protrusion due to the branched architecture of the actin network
      and negative mechanical feedback from the cell membrane-results in regular
      protrusion waves. Consistent with our model simulations, we show that VASP
      localization at the leading edge oscillates, with VASP leading-edge enrichment
      greatest just prior to protrusion initiation. We propose that the mechanochemical
      feedbacks underlying wave generation in keratocytes may constitute a general
      module for establishing excitable actin dynamics in other cellular contexts.

AB  - Multiple human diseases involving chronic oxidative stress show a significant sex
      bias, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, immune dysfunction, diabetes,
      and cardiovascular disease. However, a possible molecular mechanism for the sex
      bias in physiological adaptation to oxidative stress remains unclear. Here, we
      report that Drosophila melanogaster females but not males adapt to hydrogen
      peroxide stress, whereas males but not females adapt to paraquat (superoxide)
      stress. Stress adaptation in each sex requires the conserved mitochondrial Lon
      protease and is associated with sex-specific expression of Lon protein isoforms
      and proteolytic activity. Adaptation to oxidative stress is lost with age in both
      sexes. Transgenic expression of transformer gene during development transforms
      chromosomal males into pseudo-females and confers the female-specific pattern of 
      Lon isoform expression, Lon proteolytic activity induction, and H2O2 stress
      adaptation; these effects were also observed using adult-specific transformation.
      Conversely, knockdown of transformer in chromosomal females eliminates the
      female-specific Lon isoform expression, Lon proteolytic activity induction, and
      H2O2 stress adaptation and produces the male-specific paraquat (superoxide)
      stress adaptation. Sex-specific expression of alternative Lon isoforms was also
      observed in mouse tissues. The results develop Drosophila melanogaster as a model
      for sex-specific stress adaptation regulated by the Lon protease, with potential 
      implications for understanding sexual dimorphism in human disease.

AB  - The sesquiterpene (E)-beta-farnesene (EBF) is the alarm pheromone for many
      species of aphids [1]. When released from aphids attacked by parasitoids or
      predators, it alerts nearby conspecifics to escape by walking away and dropping
      off the host plant [2, 3]. The reception of alarm pheromone in aphids is
      accomplished through a highly sensitive chemosensory system. Although
      olfaction-related gene families including odorant receptors (ORs) and
      odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) have recently been identified from aphid genomes 
      [4-6], the cellular and molecular mechanisms of EBF reception are still largely
      unknown. Here we demonstrate that ApisOR5, a member of the large superfamily of
      odorant receptors, is expressed in large placoid sensillum neurons on the sixth
      antennal segment and confers response to EBF when co-expressed with Orco, an
      obligate odorant receptor co-receptor, in parallel heterologous expression
      systems. In addition, the repellent behavior of Acyrthosiphon pisum to EBF
      disappears after knocking down ApisOR5 by RNAi as well as two A. pisum
      odorant-binding proteins known to bind EBF (ApisOBP3 and ApisOBP7). Furthermore, 
      other odorants that can also activate ApisOR5, such as geranyl acetate,
      significantly repel A. pisum, as does EBF. Taken together, these data allow us to
      conclude that ApisOR5 is essential to EBF reception in A. pisum. The
      characterization of the EBF receptor allows high-throughput screening of aphid
      repellents, providing the necessary information to develop new strategies for
      aphid control.

AB  - The primate brain contains a hierarchy of visual areas, dubbed the ventral
      stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific for 
      object identity and robust against identity-preserving transformations, like
      depth rotations [1, 2]. Current computational models of object recognition,
      including recent deep-learning networks, generate these properties through a
      hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and
      tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells
      operations [3-6]. Here, we prove that a class of hierarchical architectures and a
      broad set of biologically plausible learning rules generate approximate
      invariance to identity-preserving transformations at the top level of the
      processing hierarchy. However, all past models tested failed to reproduce the
      most salient property of an intermediate representation of a three-level
      face-processing hierarchy in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning to head
      orientation [7]. Here, we demonstrate that one specific biologically plausible
      Hebb-type learning rule generates mirror-symmetric tuning to bilaterally
      symmetric stimuli, like faces, at intermediate levels of the architecture and
      show why it does so. Thus, the tuning properties of individual cells inside the
      visual stream appear to result from group properties of the stimuli they encode
      and to reflect the learning rules that sculpted the information-processing system
      within which they reside.
