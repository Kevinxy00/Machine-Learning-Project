TI  - Succinate-acetate permease from Citrobacter koseri is an anion channel that
      unidirectionally translocates acetate.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0032-8 [doi]
AB  - Acetate is an important metabolite in metabolism and cell signaling.
      Succinate-Acetate Permease (SatP) superfamily proteins are known to be
      responsible for acetate transport across membranes, but the nature of this
      transport remains unknown. Here, we show that the SatP homolog from Citrobacter
      koseri (SatP_Ck) is an anion channel that can unidirectionally translocate
      acetate at rates of the order of ~10(7) ions/s. Crystal structures of SatP_Ck in 
      complex with multiple acetates at 1.8 A reveal that the acetate pathway consists 
      of four acetate-binding sites aligned in a single file that are interrupted by
      three hydrophobic constrictions. The bound acetates at the four sites are each
      orientated differently. The acetate at the cytoplasmic vestibule is partially
      dehydrated, whereas those in the main pore body are fully dehydrated. Aromatic
      residues within the substrate pathway may coordinate translocation of acetates
      via anion-pi interactions. SatP_Ck reveals a new type of selective anion channel 
      and provides a structural and functional template for understanding organic anion
      transport.

TI  - SUMO suppresses and MYC amplifies transcription globally by regulating CDK9
      sumoylation.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0023-9 [doi]
AB  - Regulation of transcription is fundamental to the control of cellular gene
      expression and function. Although recent studies have revealed a role for the
      oncoprotein MYC in amplifying global transcription, little is known as to how the
      global transcription is suppressed. Here we report that SUMO and MYC mediate
      opposite effects upon global transcription by controlling the level of CDK9
      sumoylation. On one hand, SUMO suppresses global transcription via sumoylation of
      CDK9, the catalytic subunit of P-TEFb kinase essential for productive
      transcriptional elongation. On the other hand, MYC amplifies global transcription
      by antagonizing CDK9 sumoylation. Sumoylation of CDK9 blocks its interaction with
      Cyclin T1 and thus the formation of active P-TEFb complex. Transcription
      profiling analyses reveal that SUMO represses global transcription, particularly 
      of moderately to highly expressed genes and by generating a sumoylation-resistant
      CDK9 mutant, we confirm that sumoylation of CDK9 inhibits global transcription.
      Together, our data reveal that SUMO and MYC oppositely control global gene
      expression by regulating the dynamic sumoylation and desumoylation of CDK9.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of human mTOR complex 2.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0029-3 [doi]
AB  - Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) plays an essential role
      in regulating cell proliferation through phosphorylating AGC protein kinase
      family members, including AKT, PKC and SGK1. The functional core complex consists
      of mTOR, mLST8, and two mTORC2-specific components, Rictor and mSin1. Here we
      investigated the intermolecular interactions within mTORC2 complex and determined
      its cryo-electron microscopy structure at 4.9 A resolution. The structure reveals
      a hollow rhombohedral fold with a 2-fold symmetry. The dimerized mTOR serves as a
      scaffold for the complex assembly. The N-terminal half of Rictor is composed of
      helical repeat clusters and binds to mTOR through multiple contacts. mSin1 is
      located close to the FRB domain and catalytic cavity of mTOR. Rictor and mSin1
      together generate steric hindrance to inhibit binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to
      mTOR, revealing the mechanism for rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2. The mTOR
      dimer in mTORC2 shows more compact conformation than that of mTORC1 (rapamycin
      sensitive), which might result from the interaction between mTOR and
      Rictor-mSin1. Structural comparison shows that binding of Rictor and Raptor
      (mTORC1-specific component) to mTOR is mutually exclusive. Our study provides a
      basis for understanding the assembly of mTORC2 and a framework to further
      characterize the regulatory mechanism of mTORC2 pathway.

TI  - An NF90/NF110-mediated feedback amplification loop regulates dicer expression and
      controls ovarian carcinoma progression.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0016-8 [doi]
AB  - Reduced expression of DICER, a key enzyme in the miRNA pathway, is frequently
      associated with aggressive, invasive disease, and poor survival in various
      malignancies. Regulation of DICER expression is, however, poorly understood.
      Here, we show that NF90/NF110 facilitates DICER expression by controlling the
      processing of a miRNA, miR-3173, which is embedded in DICER pre-mRNA. As miR-3173
      in turn targets NF90, a feedback amplification loop controlling DICER expression 
      is established. In a nude mouse model, NF90 overexpression reduced proliferation 
      of ovarian cancer cells and significantly reduced tumor size and metastasis,
      whereas overexpression of miR-3173 dramatically increased metastasis in an NF90- 
      and DICER-dependent manner. Clinically, low NF90 expression and high miR-3173-3p 
      expression were found to be independent prognostic markers of poor survival in a 
      cohort of ovarian carcinoma patients. These findings suggest that, by
      facilitating DICER expression, NF90 can act as a suppressor of ovarian carcinoma.

TI  - Ligand-triggered de-repression of Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins coupled
      to immune receptor kinases.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0027-5 [doi]
AB  - Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins regulate diverse processes by coupling to
      single-transmembrane receptors. One such receptor is the FLS2 receptor kinase,
      which perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate immunity through a 
      class of cytoplasmic kinases called BIK1/PBLs. Unlike animal and fungal
      heterotrimeric G proteins that are activated by a ligand-induced guanine
      nucleotide exchange activity of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors
      (GPCRs), plant heterotrimeric G proteins are self-activating. How plant receptors
      regulate heterotrimeric G proteins in response to external ligands remains
      unknown. Here we show that RGS1, a GTPase accelerating protein, maintains
      Arabidopsis G proteins in an inactive state in complex with FLS2. Activation of
      FLS2 by flg22 induces a BIK1/PBL-mediated phosphorylation of RGS1 at Ser428 and
      Ser431 and that promotes RGS1 dissociation from the FLS2-G protein complex. This 
      relieves G proteins from the RGS1-mediated repression and enables positive
      regulation of immune signaling. We additionally show that RGS1 is similarly
      regulated by multiple immune receptors. Our results uncover ligand-induced
      de-repression as a mechanism for G protein signaling in plants that is distinct
      from previously reported mechanism underlying the activation of heterotrimeric G 
      proteins in other systems.

TI  - Malate transported from chloroplast to mitochondrion triggers production of ROS
      and PCD in Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0024-8 [doi]
AB  - Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process. Deficiency in
      MOSAIC DEATH 1 (MOD1), a plastid-localized enoyl-ACP reductase, leads to the
      accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PCD, which can be suppressed by
      mitochondrial complex I mutations, indicating a signal from chloroplasts to
      mitochondria. However, this signal remains to be elucidated. In this study,
      through cloning and analyzing a series of mod1 suppressors, we reveal a
      comprehensive organelle communication pathway that regulates the generation of
      mitochondrial ROS and triggers PCD. We show that mutations in PLASTIDIAL
      NAD-DEPENDENT MALATE DEHYDROGENASE (plNAD-MDH), chloroplastic DICARBOXYLATE
      TRANSPORTER 1 (DiT1) and MITOCHONDRIAL MALATE DEHYDROGENASE 1 (mMDH1) can each
      rescue the ROS accumulation and PCD phenotypes in mod1, demonstrating a direct
      communication from chloroplasts to mitochondria via the malate shuttle. Further
      studies demonstrate that these elements play critical roles in the redox
      homeostasis and plant growth under different photoperiod conditions. Moreover, we
      reveal that the ROS level and PCD are significantly increased in malate-treated
      HeLa cells, which can be dramatically attenuated by knockdown of the human gene
      MDH2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis mMDH1. These results uncover a conserved
      malate-induced PCD pathway in plant and animal systems, revolutionizing our
      understanding of the communication between organelles.

TI  - Setd2 deficiency impairs hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and causes
      malignant transformation.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0015-9 [doi]
AB  - The histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase SETD2 is frequently mutated in various
      cancers, including leukemia. However, there has not been any functional model to 
      show the contribution of SETD2 in hematopoiesis or the causal role of SETD2
      mutation in tumorigenesis. In this study, using a conditional Setd2 knockout
      mouse model, we show that Setd2 deficiency skews hematopoietic differentiation
      and reduces the number of multipotent progenitors; although the number of
      phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in Setd2-deleted mice is unchanged,
      functional assays, including serial BM transplantation, reveal that the
      self-renewal and competitiveness of HSCs are impaired. Intriguingly,
      Setd2-deleted HSCs, through a latency period, can acquire abilities to overcome
      the growth disadvantage and eventually give rise to hematopoietic malignancy
      characteristic of myelodysplastic syndrome. Gene expression profile of
      Setd2-deleted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) partially resembles
      that of Dnmt3a/Tet2 double knockout HSPCs, showing activation of the erythroid
      transcription factor Klf1-related pathway, which plays an important role in
      hematopoietic malignant transformation. Setd2 deficiency also induces DNA
      replication stress in HSCs, as reflected by an activated E2F gene regulatory
      network and repressed expression of the ribonucleotide reductase subunit Rrm2b,
      which results in proliferation and cell cycle abnormalities and genomic
      instability, allowing accumulation of secondary mutation(s) that synergistically 
      contributes to tumorigenesis. Thus, our results demonstrate that Setd2 is
      required for HSC self-renewal, and provide evidence supporting the causal role of
      Setd2 deficiency in tumorigenesis. The underlying mechanism shall advance our
      understanding of epigenetic regulation of cancer and provide potential new
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Phosphorylation of glutaminase by PKCepsilon is essential for its enzymatic
      activity and critically contributes to tumorigenesis.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0021-y [doi]
AB  - Glutamine metabolism plays an important role in cancer development and
      progression. Glutaminase C (GAC), the first enzyme in glutaminolysis, has emerged
      as an important target for cancer therapy and many studies have focused on the
      mechanism of enhanced GAC expression in cancer cells. However, little is known
      about the post-translational modification of GAC. Here, we report that
      phosphorylation is a crucial post-translational modification of GAC, which is
      responsible for the higher glutaminase activity in lung tumor tissues and cancer 
      cells. We identify the key Ser314 phosphorylation site on GAC that is regulated
      by the NF-kappaB-PKCepsilon axis. Blocking Ser314 phosphorylation by the S314A
      mutation in lung cancer cells inhibits the glutaminase activity, triggers genetic
      reprogramming, and alleviates tumor malignancy. Furthermore, we find that a high 
      level of GAC phosphorylation correlates with poor survival rate of lung cancer
      patients. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated mechanism for
      activation of GAC by phosphorylation and demonstrate that targeting glutaminase
      activity can inhibit oncogenic transformation.

TI  - Polyubiquitin chain-induced p62 phase separation drives autophagic cargo
      segregation.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0017-7 [doi]
AB  - Misfolded proteins can be degraded by selective autophagy. The prevailing view is
      that ubiquitin-tagged misfolded proteins are assembled into aggregates by the
      scaffold protein p62, and the aggregates are then engulfed and degraded by
      autophagosomes. Here we report that p62 forms droplets in vivo which have
      liquid-like properties such as high sphericity, the ability to undergo fusion,
      and recovery after photobleaching. Recombinant p62 does not undergo phase
      separation in vitro; however, adding a K63 polyubiquitin chain to p62 induces p62
      phase separation, which results in enrichment of high-molecular weight ubiquitin 
      signals in p62 droplets. Mixing recombinant p62 with cytosol from p62(-/-) cells 
      also results in p62 phase separation in a polyubiquitination-dependent manner.
      Mechanistically, p62 phase separation is dependent on p62 polymerization, the
      interaction between p62 and ubiquitin, and the valence of the polyubiquitin
      chain. Moreover, p62 phase separation can be regulated by post-translational
      modifications such as phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that
      disease-associated mutations in p62 can affect phase separation. We propose that 
      polyubiquitin chain-induced p62 phase separation drives autophagic cargo
      concentration and segregation.

TI  - Anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics promote apoptosis through TL1A-activated death
      receptor 3 in cancer cells.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0018-6 [doi]
AB  - The commonly used antimitotic chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol and
      vinblastine arrest cell cycle progression by disrupting mitotic spindles, and
      cause cancer cells to undergo apoptosis through 'mitotic catastrophe'. The
      molecular mechanisms by which these drugs induce apoptosis and their relevance to
      clinical efficacy are not known. Facilitated by a new spindle poison diazonamide,
      we found that apoptosis induced by these agents requires death receptor 3 (DR3). 
      Mitotic arrest by these agents induces lysosome-dependent secretion of the DR3
      ligand, TL1A. Engagement of TL1A with DR3 stimulates the formation of
      FADD-containing and caspase-8-containing death-inducing signaling complex (DISC),
      which subsequently activates apoptosis in cells that express DR3. Expression of
      DR3 and TL1A correlates with the apoptotic response of human tumor xenograft
      models and human cancer cell lines to antimitotic drugs, providing further
      evidence that these drugs kill cancer cells through the DR3/TL1A-mediated
      pathway. These results suggest that TL1A and DR3 may hold promise to be used as
      biomarkers for predicting clinical response to antimitotic therapeutics.

TI  - m-AAA proteases, mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and neurodegeneration.
PG  - 296-306
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.17 [doi]
AB  - The function of mitochondria depends on ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary
      conserved m-AAA proteases in the inner membrane. These ATP-dependent peptidases
      form hexameric complexes built up of homologous subunits. AFG3L2 subunits
      assemble either into homo-oligomeric isoenzymes or with SPG7 (paraplegin)
      subunits into hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes. Mutations in AFG3L2 are
      associated with dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28) characterized by the loss
      of Purkinje cells, whereas mutations in SPG7 cause a recessive form of hereditary
      spastic paraplegia (HSP7) with motor neurons of the cortico-spinal tract being
      predominantly affected. Pleiotropic functions have been assigned to m-AAA
      proteases, which act as quality control and regulatory enzymes in mitochondria.
      Loss of m-AAA proteases affects mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration
      and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and deficiencies in the axonal transport
      of mitochondria. Moreover m-AAA proteases regulate the assembly of the
      mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. Impaired degradation of the MCU
      subunit EMRE in AFG3L2-deficient mitochondria results in the formation of
      deregulated MCU complexes, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake and increased
      vulnerability of neurons for calcium-induced cell death. A reduction of calcium
      influx into the cytosol of Purkinje cells rescues ataxia in an AFG3L2-deficient
      mouse model. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the m-AAA
      protease and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and its relevance for
      neurodegeneration and describe a novel mouse model lacking MCU specifically in
      Purkinje cells. Our results pledge for a novel view on m-AAA proteases that
      integrates their pleiotropic functions in mitochondria to explain the
      pathogenesis of associated neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - UPR(mt) regulation and output: a stress response mediated by
      mitochondrial-nuclear communication.
PG  - 281-295
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.16 [doi]
AB  - The mitochondrial network is not only required for the production of energy,
      essential cofactors and amino acids, but also serves as a signaling hub for
      innate immune and apoptotic pathways. Multiple mechanisms have evolved to
      identify and combat mitochondrial dysfunction to maintain the health of the
      organism. One such pathway is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response
      (UPR(mt)), which is regulated by the mitochondrial import efficiency of the
      transcription factor ATFS-1 in C. elegans and potentially orthologous
      transcription factors in mammals (ATF4, ATF5, CHOP). Upon mitochondrial
      dysfunction, import of ATFS-1 into mitochondria is reduced, allowing it to be
      trafficked to the nucleus where it promotes the expression of genes that promote 
      survival and recovery of the mitochondrial network. Here, we discuss recent
      findings underlying UPR(mt) signal transduction and how this adaptive
      transcriptional response may interact with other mitochondrial stress response
      pathways.

TI  - Tamoxifen enhances stemness and promotes metastasis of ERalpha36(+) breast cancer
      by upregulating ALDH1A1 in cancer cells.
PG  - 336-358
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.15 [doi]
AB  - The 66 kDa estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha66) is the main molecular target for
      endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen treatment. However, many patients develop
      resistance with unclear mechanisms. In a large cohort study of breast cancer
      patients who underwent surgery followed by tamoxifen treatment, we demonstrate
      that ERalpha36, a variant of ERalpha66, correlates with poor prognosis.
      Mechanistically, tamoxifen directly binds and activates ERalpha36 to enhance the 
      stemness and metastasis of breast cancer cells via transcriptional stimulation of
      aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1). Consistently, the tamoxifen-induced
      stemness and metastasis can be attenuated by either ALDH1 inhibitors or a
      specific ERalpha36 antibody. Thus, tamoxifen acts as an agonist on ERalpha36 in
      breast cancer cells, which accounts for hormone therapy resistance and metastasis
      of breast cancer. Our study not only reveals ERalpha36 as a stratifying marker
      for endocrine therapy but also provides a promising therapeutic avenue for
      tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.

TI  - Structure of the human activated spliceosome in three conformational states.
PG  - 307-322
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.14 [doi]
AB  - During each cycle of pre-mRNA splicing, the pre-catalytic spliceosome (B complex)
      is converted into the activated spliceosome (B(act) complex), which has a
      well-formed active site but cannot proceed to the branching reaction. Here, we
      present the cryo-EM structure of the human B(act) complex in three distinct
      conformational states. The EM map allows atomic modeling of nearly all protein
      components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), including three of 
      the SF3a complex and seven of the SF3b complex. The structure of the human B(act)
      complex contains 52 proteins, U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and a
      pre-mRNA. Three distinct conformations have been captured, representing the
      early, mature, and late states of the human B(act) complex. These complexes
      differ in the orientation of the Switch loop of Prp8, the splicing factors
      RNF113A and NY-CO-10, and most components of the NineTeen complex (NTC) and the
      NTC-related complex. Analysis of these three complexes and comparison with the B 
      and C complexes reveal an ordered flux of components in the B-to-B(act) and the
      B(act)-to-B(*) transitions, which ultimately prime the active site for the
      branching reaction.

TI  - Eosinophil-derived CCL-6 impairs hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.
PG  - 323-335
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.2 [doi]
AB  - Eosinophils (Eos) have been long considered as end-stage effector cells in the
      hierarchical hematopoietic system. Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that
      Eos are multifunctional leukocytes with respect to the initiation, propagation
      and regulation of various inflammatory or immune reactions, especially in
      allergic diseases. Recent studies have shown that Eos are also required for
      maintenance of bone marrow plasma cells and differentiation of B cells. However, 
      it remains unclear whether Eos contributes to regulation of hematopoietic stem
      cell (HSC) homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that Eos disrupt HSC homeostasis by 
      impairing HSC quiescence and reconstitution ability in wild-type mice following
      ovalbumin (OVA) challenge and even by causing bone marrow HSC failure and
      exhaustion in Cd3delta-Il-5 transgenic mice. The impaired maintenance and
      function of HSCs were associated with Eos-induced redox imbalance (increased
      oxidative phosphorylation and decreased anti-oxidants levels). More importantly, 
      using mass spectrometry, we determined that CCL-6 is expressed at a high level
      under eosinophilia. We demonstrate that CCL-6 is Eos-derived and responsible for 
      the impaired HSC homeostasis. Interestingly, blockage of CCL-6 with a specific
      neutralizing antibody, restored the reconstitution ability of HSCs while
      exacerbating eosinophilia airway inflammation in OVA-challenged mice. Thus, our
      study reveals an unexpected function of Eos/CCL-6 in HSC homeostasis.

TI  - Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma
      revealed by single-cell genome sequencing.
PG  - 359-373
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.11 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a cancer of substantial morphologic, genetic
      and phenotypic diversity. Yet we do not understand the relationship between
      intratumor heterogeneity and the associated morphologic/histological
      characteristics of the tumor. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing to
      profile 96 tumor cells (30-36 each) and 15 normal liver cells (5 each), collected
      from three male patients with HBV-associated HCC, we confirmed that copy number
      variations occur early in hepatocarcinogenesis but thereafter remain relatively
      stable throughout tumor progression. Importantly, we showed that specific HCCs
      can be of monoclonal or polyclonal origins. Tumors with confluent multinodular
      morphology are the typical polyclonal tumors and display the highest intratumor
      heterogeneity. In addition to mutational and copy number profiles, we dissected
      the clonal origins of HCC using HBV-derived foreign genomic markers. In
      monoclonal HCC, all the tumor single cells exhibit the same HBV integrations,
      indicating that HBV integration is an early driver event and remains extremely
      stable during tumor progression. In addition, our results indicated that both
      models of metastasis, late dissemination and early seeding, have a role in HCC
      progression. Notably, early intrahepatic spreading of the initiating clone leads 
      to the formation of synchronous multifocal tumors. Meanwhile, we identified a
      potential driver gene ZNF717 in HCC, which exhibits a high frequency of mutation 
      at both single-cell and population levels, as a tumor suppressor acting through
      regulating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. These findings highlight multiple distinct
      tumor evolutionary mechanisms in HCC, which suggests the need for specific
      treatment strategies.

AB  - Glycolysis has long been considered as the major metabolic process for energy
      production and anabolic growth in cancer cells. Although such a view has been
      instrumental for the development of powerful imaging tools that are still used in
      the clinics, it is now clear that mitochondria play a key role in oncogenesis.
      Besides exerting central bioenergetic functions, mitochondria provide indeed
      building blocks for tumor anabolism, control redox and calcium homeostasis,
      participate in transcriptional regulation, and govern cell death. Thus,
      mitochondria constitute promising targets for the development of novel anticancer
      agents. However, tumors arise, progress, and respond to therapy in the context of
      an intimate crosstalk with the host immune system, and many immunological
      functions rely on intact mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we review the cancer
      cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms through which mitochondria influence
      all steps of oncogenesis, with a focus on the therapeutic potential of targeting 
      mitochondrial metabolism for cancer therapy.

TI  - A reappraisal of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0011-0 [doi]
AB  - It is assumed that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies cause tumor rejection by blocking
      negative signaling from B7-CTLA-4 interactions. Surprisingly, at concentrations
      considerably higher than plasma levels achieved by clinically effective dosing,
      the anti-CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab blocks neither B7 trans-endocytosis by CTLA-4
      nor CTLA-4 binding to immobilized or cell-associated B7. Consequently, Ipilimumab
      does not increase B7 on dendritic cells (DCs) from either CTLA4 gene humanized
      (Ctla4 (h/h) ) or human CD34(+) stem cell-reconstituted NSG mice. In Ctla4 (h/m) 
      mice expressing both human and mouse CTLA4 genes, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that
      bind to human but not mouse CTLA-4 efficiently induce Treg depletion and Fc
      receptor-dependent tumor rejection. The blocking antibody L3D10 is comparable to 
      the non-blocking Ipilimumab in causing tumor rejection. Remarkably, L3D10
      progenies that lose blocking activity during humanization remain fully competent 
      in inducing Treg depletion and tumor rejection. Anti-B7 antibodies that
      effectively block CD4 T cell activation and de novo CD8 T cell priming in
      lymphoid organs do not negatively affect the immunotherapeutic effect of
      Ipilimumab. Thus, clinically effective anti-CTLA-4 mAb causes tumor rejection by 
      mechanisms that are independent of checkpoint blockade but dependent on the host 
      Fc receptor. Our data call for a reappraisal of the CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade
      hypothesis and provide new insights for the next generation of safe and effective
      anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.

TI  - KRAB-type zinc-finger proteins PITA and PISA specifically regulate p53-dependent 
      glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0008-8 [doi]
AB  - Few p53 regulators participate in selective control of p53-mediated cellular
      metabolism. How p53-mediated aerobic and glycolytic pathways are negatively
      regulated remains largely unclear. Here, we identified two KRAB-type zinc-finger 
      proteins, PITA (p53 inhibitor of TIGAR activation) and PISA (p53 inhibitor of
      SCO2 activation), as selective regulators of p53 in metabolic control. PITA and
      PISA interact with p53 and specifically suppress transcription of the glycolysis 
      regulator TIGAR and the oxidation phosphorylation regulator SCO2, respectively.
      Importantly, PITA transgenic mice exhibited increased 6-phosphofructokinase 1
      (PFK1) activity and an elevated glycolytic rate, whereas PISA transgenic mice had
      decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and reduced mitochondrial respiration. In
      response to glucose starvation, PITA dissociates from p53, resulting in
      activation of p53 and induction of TIGAR, which inhibited aerobic glycolysis.
      Prolonged starvation leads to PISA dissociation from p53 and induction of SCO2
      and p53-promoted mitochondrial respiration. The dynamic regulation of PITA and
      PISA upon metabolic stress is dependent on ATM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of
      PITA and PISA. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancers, the elevated expression 
      of PITA and PISA correlates with cancer progression. Depletion of PITA or PISA in
      colorectal cancer cells reduced the cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
      These results identify PITA and PISA as selective regulators of p53-mediated
      glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration and provide novel insights into the role
      of p53 network in cell metabolic control.

TI  - Poly(ADP-ribose) mediates asymmetric division of mouse oocyte.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0009-7 [doi]
AB  - Before fertilization, mammalian oocyte undergoes an asymmetric division which
      depends on eccentric positioning of the spindle at the oocyte cortex to form a
      polar body and an egg. Since the centriole is absent and, as a result, the polar 
      array microtubules are not fully developed in oocytes, microtubules have seldom
      been considered as required for eccentric positioning of the spindle, while
      actin-related forces have instead been proposed to be primarily responsible for
      this process. However, the existing models are largely conflicting and the
      underlying mechanism of asymmetric division is still elusive. Here we show that
      poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is enriched at mouse oocyte cortical area throughout
      meiosis. Specific removal of cortical PAR results in an ectopic spindle and a
      failure of asymmetric division. During spindle migration, when the spindle
      deviates from the center of oocyte by a pushing force of cytoplasmic actin, the
      short polar array microtubules emanating from the juxtacortical spindle pole
      extend to the cortex and penetrate into cortical PAR, docking and stabilizing the
      spindle at the cortex which facilitates the asymmetric division. This process
      depends on the affinity between PAR and microtubule-associated proteins such as
      Spindly, which contributes to a physical link for cortical PAR and the spindle.
      Notably, fusing a PAR-binding domain to end-binding protein 3, a plus-end
      tracking protein at the polar array microtubules, restores the asymmetric
      division of oocytes with Spindly knockdown. Thus, our work demonstrates a
      comprehensive mechanism for oocyte spindle positioning and asymmetric division.

TI  - Modifications and functional genomics of human transfer RNA.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0013-y [doi]
AB  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) is present at tens of millions of transcripts in a human cell
      and is the most abundant RNA in moles among all cellular RNAs. tRNA is also the
      most extensively modified RNA with, on an average, 13 modifications per molecule.
      The primary function of tRNA as the adaptor of amino acids and the genetic code
      in protein synthesis is well known. tRNA modifications play multi-faceted roles
      in decoding and other cellular processes. The abundance, modification, and
      aminoacylation (charging) levels of tRNAs contribute to mRNA decoding in ways
      that reflect the cell type and its environment; however, how these factors work
      together to maximize translation efficiency remains to be understood. tRNAs also 
      interact with many proteins not involved in translation and this may coordinate
      translation activity and other processes in the cell. This review focuses on the 
      modifications and the functional genomics of human tRNA and discusses future
      perspectives on the explorations of human tRNA biology.

TI  - Uncoupling therapeutic from immunotherapy-related adverse effects for safer and
      effective anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in CTLA4 humanized mice.
LID - 10.1038/s41422-018-0012-z [doi]
AB  - Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confer a cancer immunotherapeutic effect
      (CITE) but cause severe immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAE). Targeting
      CTLA-4 has shown remarkable long-term benefit and thus remains a valuable tool
      for cancer immunotherapy if the irAE can be brought under control. An animal
      model, which recapitulates clinical irAE and CITE, would be valuable for
      developing safer CTLA-4-targeting reagents. Here, we report such a model using
      mice harboring the humanized Ctla4 gene. In this model, the clinically used drug,
      Ipilimumab, induced severe irAE especially when combined with an anti-PD-1
      antibody; whereas another mAb, L3D10, induced comparable CITE with very mild irAE
      under the same conditions. The irAE corresponded to systemic T cell activation
      and resulted in reduced ratios of regulatory to effector T cells (Treg/Teff)
      among autoreactive T cells. Using mice that were either homozygous or
      heterozygous for the human allele, we found that the irAE required bi-allelic
      engagement, while CITE only required monoallelic engagement. As with the
      immunological distinction for monoallelic vs bi-allelic engagement, we found that
      bi-allelic engagement of the Ctla4 gene was necessary for preventing conversion
      of autoreactive T cells into Treg cells. Humanization of L3D10, which led to loss
      of blocking activity, further increased safety without affecting the therapeutic 
      effect. Taken together, our data demonstrate that complete CTLA-4 occupation,
      systemic T cell activation and preferential expansion of self-reactive T cells
      are dispensable for tumor rejection but correlate with irAE, while blocking
      B7-CTLA-4 interaction impacts neither safety nor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4
      antibodies. These data provide important insights for the clinical development of
      safer and potentially more effective CTLA-4-targeting immunotherapy.

TI  - H5N1 influenza virus-specific miRNA-like small RNA increases cytokine production 
      and mouse mortality via targeting poly(rC)-binding protein 2.
PG  - 157-171
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.3 [doi]
AB  - Infection of H5N1 influenza virus causes the highest mortality among all
      influenza viruses. The mechanisms underlying such high viral pathogenicity are
      incompletely understood. Here, we report that the H5N1 influenza virus encodes a 
      microRNA-like small RNA, miR-HA-3p, which is processed from a stem
      loop-containing viral RNA precursor by Argonaute 2, and plays a role in enhancing
      cytokine production during H5N1 infection. Mechanistic study shows that miR-HA-3p
      targets poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and suppresses its expression.
      Consistent with PCBP2 being an important negative regulator of
      RIG-I/MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, suppression of PCBP2 expression by
      miR-HA-3p promotes cytokine production in human macrophages and mice infected
      with H5N1 virus. We conclude that miR-HA-3p is the first identified influenza
      virus-encoded microRNA-like functional RNA fragment and a novel virulence factor 
      contributing to H5N1-induced 'cytokine storm' and mortality.

TI  - Whole-genome sequencing reveals principles of brain retrotransposition in
      neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG  - 187-203
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.8 [doi]
AB  - Neural progenitor cells undergo somatic retrotransposition events, mainly
      involving L1 elements, which can be potentially deleterious. Here, we analyze the
      whole genomes of 20 brain samples and 80 non-brain samples, and characterized the
      retrotransposition landscape of patients affected by a variety of
      neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis,
      ataxia-telangiectasia and autism. We report that the number of
      retrotranspositions in brain tissues is higher than that observed in non-brain
      samples and even higher in pathologic vs normal brains. The majority of somatic
      brain retrotransposons integrate into pre-existing repetitive elements,
      preferentially A/T rich L1 sequences, resulting in nested insertions. Our
      findings document the fingerprints of encoded endonuclease independent mechanisms
      in the majority of L1 brain insertion events. The insertions are "non-classical" 
      in that they are truncated at both ends, integrate in the same orientation as the
      host element, and their target sequences are enriched with a CCATT motif in
      contrast to the classical endonuclease motif of most other retrotranspositions.
      We show that L1Hs elements integrate preferentially into genes associated with
      neural functions and diseases. We propose that pre-existing retrotransposons act 
      as "lightning rods" for novel insertions, which may give fine modulation of gene 
      expression while safeguarding from deleterious events. Overwhelmingly
      uncontrolled retrotransposition may breach this safeguard mechanism and increase 
      the risk of harmful mutagenesis in neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - Histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation modulates long-range chromatin interactions
      at enhancers.
PG  - 204-220
LID - 10.1038/cr.2018.1 [doi]
AB  - Long-range chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters are essential
      for transcription of many developmentally controlled genes in mammals and other
      metazoans. Currently, the exact mechanisms that connect distal enhancers to their
      specific target promoters remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that the
      enhancer-specific histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and the histone
      methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 (MLL3/4) play an active role in this process. We
      demonstrate that in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, MLL3/4-dependent 
      deposition of H3K4me1 at enhancers correlates with increased levels of chromatin 
      interactions, whereas loss of this histone modification leads to reduced levels
      of chromatin interactions and defects in gene activation during differentiation. 
      H3K4me1 facilitates recruitment of the Cohesin complex, a known regulator of
      chromatin organization, to chromatin in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential 
      mechanism for MLL3/4 to promote chromatin interactions between enhancers and
      promoters. Taken together, our results support a role for MLL3/4-dependent
      H3K4me1 in orchestrating long-range chromatin interactions at enhancers in
      mammalian cells.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of human ATR-ATRIP complex.
PG  - 143-156
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.158 [doi]
AB  - ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) protein kinase and ATRIP
      (ATR-interacting protein) form a complex and play a critical role in response to 
      replication stress and DNA damage. Here, we determined the cryo-electron
      microscopy (EM) structure of the human ATR-ATRIP complex at 4.7 A resolution and 
      built an atomic model of the C-terminal catalytic core of ATR (residues 1 521-2
      644) at 3.9 A resolution. The complex adopts a hollow "heart" shape, consisting
      of two ATR monomers in distinct conformations. The EM map for ATRIP reveals 14
      HEAT repeats in an extended "S" shape. The conformational flexibility of ATR
      allows ATRIP to properly lock the N-termini of the two ATR monomers to favor
      ATR-ATRIP complex formation and functional diversity. The isolated "head-head"
      and "tail-tail" each adopts a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. The catalytic pockets face 
      outward and substrate access is not restricted by inhibitory elements. Our
      studies provide a structural basis for understanding the assembly of the
      ATR-ATRIP complex and a framework for characterizing ATR-mediated DNA repair
      pathways.

      novel lncRNA in directly binding an essential metabolic enzyme,
      glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2); this interaction benefits viral
      replication via alteration of host metabolism.

TI  - Integrated genomic analysis identifies deregulated JAK/STAT-MYC-biosynthesis axis
      in aggressive NK-cell leukemia.
PG  - 172-186
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.146 [doi]
AB  - Aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) is a rare form of NK cell neoplasm that is
      more prevalent among people from Asia and Central and South America. Patients
      usually die within days to months, even after receiving prompt therapeutic
      management. Here we performed the first comprehensive study of ANKL by
      integrating whole genome, transcriptome and targeted sequencing, cytokine array
      as well as functional assays. Mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway were identified
      in 48% (14/29) of ANKL patients, while the extracellular STAT3 stimulator IL10
      was elevated by an average of 56-fold (P < 0.0001) in the plasma of all patients 
      examined. Additional frequently mutated genes included TP53 (34%), TET2 (28%),
      CREBBP (21%) and MLL2 (21%). Patient NK leukemia cells showed prominent
      activation of STAT3 phosphorylation, MYC expression and transcriptional
      activities in multiple metabolic pathways. Functionally, STAT3 activation and MYC
      expression were critical for the proliferation and survival of ANKL cells. STAT
      signaling regulated the MYC transcription program, and both STAT signaling and
      MYC transcription were required to maintain the activation of nucleotide
      synthesis and glycolysis. Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway represents a major
      target for genomic alterations and IL10 stimulation in ANKL. This newly
      discovered JAK/STAT-MYC-biosynthesis axis may provide opportunities for the
      development of novel therapeutic strategies in treating this subtype of leukemia.

TI  - Endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling modulates neuronal migration and
      postnatal behavior.
PG  - 221-248
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.135 [doi]
AB  - The cerebral cortex is essential for integration and processing of information
      that is required for most behaviors. The exquisitely precise laminar organization
      of the cerebral cortex arises during embryonic development when neurons migrate
      successively from ventricular zones to coalesce into specific cortical layers.
      While radial glia act as guide rails for projection neuron migration, pre-formed 
      vascular networks provide support and guidance cues for GABAergic interneuron
      migration. This study provides novel conceptual and mechanistic insights into
      this paradigm of vascular-neuronal interactions, revealing new mechanisms of GABA
      and its receptor-mediated signaling via embryonic forebrain endothelial cells.
      With the use of two new endothelial cell specific conditional mouse models of the
      GABA pathway (Gabrb3(DeltaTie2-Cre) and Vgat(DeltaTie2-Cre)), we show that
      partial or complete loss of GABA release from endothelial cells during
      embryogenesis results in vascular defects and impairs long-distance migration and
      positioning of cortical interneurons. The downstream effects of perturbed
      endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling are critical, leading to lasting changes 
      to cortical circuits and persistent behavioral deficits. Furthermore, we
      illustrate new mechanisms of activation of GABA signaling in forebrain
      endothelial cells that promotes their migration, angiogenesis and acquisition of 
      blood-brain barrier properties. Our findings uncover and elucidate a novel
      endothelial GABA signaling pathway in the CNS that is distinct from the classical
      neuronal GABA signaling pathway and shed new light on the etiology and
      pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders, 
      epilepsy, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia.

AB  - B cells undergo stringent selection in germinal centers (GCs) for expression of
      high-affinity antibodies, however, mechanisms of negative selection of
      low-affinity B cell clones remain elusive. A new study by Michel Nussenzweig's
      group published in Science leverages a new reporter system that marks
      pre-apoptotic GC B cells to dissect microanatomic regions of GCs and their role
      in affinity maturation.

TI  - Landscape of the regulatory elements for lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation pathway.
PG  - 111-125
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.149 [doi]
AB  - Short-chain fatty acids and their corresponding acyl-CoAs sit at the crossroads
      of metabolic pathways and play important roles in diverse cellular processes.
      They are also precursors for protein post-translational lysine acylation
      modifications. A noteworthy example is the newly identified lysine
      2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) that is derived from 2-hydroxyisobutyrate and
      2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA. Histone Khib has been shown to be associated with active
      gene expression in spermatogenic cells. However, the key elements that regulate
      this post-translational lysine acylation pathway remain unknown. This has
      hindered characterization of the mechanisms by which this modification exerts its
      biological functions. Here we show that Esa1p in budding yeast and its homologue 
      Tip60 in human could add Khib to substrate proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In
      addition, we have identified HDAC2 and HDAC3 as the major enzymes to remove Khib.
      Moreover, we report the first global profiling of Khib proteome in mammalian
      cells, identifying 6 548 Khib sites on 1 725 substrate proteins. Our study has
      thus discovered both the "writers" and "erasers" for histone Khib marks, and
      major Khib protein substrates. These results not only illustrate the landscape of
      this new lysine acylation pathway, but also open new avenues for studying diverse
      functions of cellular metabolites associated with this pathway.

AB  - Two articles in Cell Research focus on the structure-function relationships in
      the shelterin complex that binds to telomeres and is essential for their
      stability and functions. These studies concerning both mammalian and
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins reveal unexpected structural conservation of a
      motif called TRFH (Telomeric Repeat Factors Homology) domain between several
      subunits in these complexes, providing a rationale for further dissection of the 
      role of telomeres in chromosome stability, aging and cancer, and encouraging us
      to revisit the evolution of telomere proteins.

TI  - Structural basis for specific flagellin recognition by the NLR protein NAIP5.
PG  - 35-47
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.148 [doi]
AB  - The nucleotide-binding domain- and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins 
      (NLRs) function as intracellular immune receptors to detect the presence of
      pathogen- or host-derived signals. The mechanisms of how NLRs sense their ligands
      remain elusive. Here we report the structure of a bacterial flagellin derivative 
      in complex with the NLR proteins NAIP5 and NLRC4 determined by cryo-electron
      microscopy at 4.28 A resolution. The structure revealed that the flagellin
      derivative forms two parallel helices interacting with multiple domains including
      BIR1 and LRR of NAIP5. Binding to NAIP5 results in a nearly complete burial of
      the flagellin derivative, thus stabilizing the active conformation of NAIP5. The 
      extreme C-terminal side of the flagellin is anchored to a sterically constrained 
      binding pocket of NAIP5, which likely acts as a structural determinant for
      discrimination of different bacterial flagellins by NAIP5, a notion further
      supported by biochemical data. Taken together, our results shed light on the
      molecular mechanisms underlying NLR ligand perception.

AB  - In an elegant publication in Cell Research, Tan and colleagues showed that
      ablation of PRRT2 in cerebellar granule cells is sufficient to induce paroxysmal 
      kinesigenic dyskinesia. PRRT2 turns out to downregulate the presynaptic SNARE
      complex in granule cell axons, which in turn controls the activity patterns of
      Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex.

TI  - Mouse embryonic stem cells have increased capacity for replication fork restart
      driven by the specific Filia-Floped protein complex.
PG  - 69-89

AB  - Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) harbor constitutive DNA replication stress during
      their rapid proliferation and the consequent genome instability hampers their
      applications in regenerative medicine. It is therefore important to understand
      the regulatory mechanisms of replication stress response in PSCs. Here, we report
      that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are superior to differentiated cells in
      resolving replication stress. Specifically, ESCs utilize a unique Filia-Floped
      protein complex-dependent mechanism to efficiently promote the restart of stalled
      replication forks, therefore maintaining genomic stability. The ESC-specific
      Filia-Floped complex resides on replication forks under normal conditions.
      Replication stress stimulates their recruitment to stalling forks and the serine 
      151 residue of Filia is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner. This
      modification enables the Filia-Floped complex to act as a functional scaffold,
      which then promotes the stalling fork restart through a dual mechanism: both
      enhancing recruitment of the replication fork restart protein, Blm, and
      stimulating ATR kinase activation. In the Blm pathway, the scaffolds recruit the 
      E3 ubiquitin ligase, Trim25, to the stalled replication forks, and in turn Trim25
      tethers and concentrates Blm at stalled replication forks through ubiquitination.
      In differentiated cells, the recruitment of the Trim25-Blm complex to replication
      forks and the activation of ATR signaling are much less robust due to lack of the
      ESC-specific Filia-Floped scaffold. Thus, our study reveals that ESCs utilize an 
      additional and unique regulatory layer to efficiently promote the stalled fork
      restart and maintain genomic stability.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.132 [doi]
AB  - The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a collection of human neurological
      disorders with heterogeneous etiologies. Hyperactivity of E3 ubiquitin (Ub)
      ligase UBE3A, stemming from 15q11-q13 copy number variations, accounts for 1%-3% 
      of ASD cases worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely
      characterized. Here we report that the functionality of ALDH1A2, the
      rate-limiting enzyme of retinoic acid (RA) synthesis, is negatively regulated by 
      UBE3A in a ubiquitylation-dependent manner. Excessive UBE3A dosage was found to
      impair RA-mediated neuronal homeostatic synaptic plasticity. ASD-like symptoms
      were recapitulated in mice by overexpressing UBE3A in the prefrontal cortex or by
      administration of an ALDH1A antagonist, whereas RA supplements significantly
      alleviated excessive UBE3A dosage-induced ASD-like phenotypes. By identifying
      reduced RA signaling as an underlying mechanism in ASD phenotypes linked to UBE3A
      hyperactivities, our findings introduce a new vista of ASD etiology and
      facilitate a mode of therapeutic development against this increasingly prevalent 
      disease.

PG  - 22-34
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.134 [doi]
AB  - Naive hypomethylated embryonic pluripotent stem cells (ESCs) are developmentally 
      closest to the preimplantation epiblast of blastocysts, with the potential to
      contribute to all embryonic tissues and the germline, excepting the
      extra-embryonic tissues in chimeric embryos. By contrast, epiblast stem cells
      (EpiSCs) resembling postimplantation epiblast are relatively more methylated and 
      show a limited potential for chimerism. Here, for the first time, we reveal
      advanced pluripotent stem cells (ASCs), which are developmentally beyond the
      pluripotent cells in the inner cell mass but with higher potency than EpiSCs.
      Accordingly, a single ASC contributes very efficiently to the fetus, germline,
      yolk sac and the placental labyrinth in chimeras. Since they are developmentally 
      more advanced, ASCs do not contribute to the trophoblast. ASCs were derived from 
      blastocysts in two steps in a chemically defined medium supplemented with Activin
      A and basic fibroblast growth factor, followed by culturing in ABCL medium
      containing ActA, BMP4, CHIR99021 and leukemia inhibitory factor. Notably, ASCs
      exhibit a distinct transcriptome with the expression of both naive pluripotency
      genes, as well as mesodermal somatic genes; Eomes, Eras, Tdgf1, Evx1, hand1,
      Wnt5a and distinct repetitive elements. Conversion of established ESCs to ASCs is
      also achievable. Importantly, ASCs exhibit a stable hypermethylated epigenome and
      mostly intact imprints as compared to the hypomethylated inner cell mass of
      blastocysts and naive ESCs. Properties of ASCs suggest that they represent cells 
      at an intermediate cellular state between the naive and primed states of
      pluripotency.

TI  - Plasma membrane changes during programmed cell deaths.
PG  - 9-21
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.133 [doi]
AB  - Ruptured and intact plasma membranes are classically considered as hallmarks of
      necrotic and apoptotic cell death, respectively. As such, apoptosis is usually
      considered a non-inflammatory process while necrosis triggers inflammation.
      Recent studies on necroptosis and pyroptosis, two types of programmed necrosis,
      revealed that plasma membrane rupture is mediated by MLKL channels during
      necroptosis but depends on non-selective gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores during
      pyroptosis. Importantly, the morphology of dying cells executed by MLKL channels 
      can be distinguished from that executed by GSDMD pores. Interestingly, it was
      found recently that secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, a previously believed 
      non-regulated form of cell lysis that occurs after apoptosis, can be programmed
      and executed by plasma membrane pore formation like that of pyroptosis. In
      addition, pyroptosis is associated with pyroptotic bodies, which have some
      similarities to apoptotic bodies. Therefore, different cell death programs induce
      distinctive reshuffling processes of the plasma membrane. Given the fact that the
      nature of released intracellular contents plays a crucial role in dying/dead
      cell-induced immunogenicity, not only membrane rupture or integrity but also the 
      nature of plasma membrane breakdown would determine the fate of a cell as well as
      its ability to elicit an immune response. In this review, we will discuss recent 
      advances in the field of apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, with an emphasis 
      on the mechanisms underlying plasma membrane changes observed on dying cells and 
      their implication in cell death-elicited immunogenicity.

TI  - PRRT2 deficiency induces paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia by regulating synaptic
      transmission in cerebellum.
PG  - 90-110
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.128 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) are associated with
      paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and several other paroxysmal neurological
      diseases, but the PRRT2 function and pathogenic mechanisms remain largely
      obscure. Here we show that PRRT2 is a presynaptic protein that interacts with
      components of the SNARE complex and downregulates its formation. Loss-of-function
      mutant mice showed PKD-like phenotypes triggered by generalized seizures,
      hyperthermia, or optogenetic stimulation of the cerebellum. Mutant mice with
      specific PRRT2 deletion in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) recapitulate the
      behavioral phenotypes seen in Prrt2-null mice. Furthermore, recording made in
      cerebellar slices showed that optogenetic stimulation of GCs results in transient
      elevation followed by suppression of Purkinje cell firing. The anticonvulsant
      drug carbamazepine used in PKD treatment also relieved PKD-like behaviors in
      mutant mice. Together, our findings identify PRRT2 as a novel regulator of the
      SNARE complex and provide a circuit mechanism underlying the PRRT2-related
      behaviors.

      complex.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.144 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that play essential roles in protecting
      chromosome ends. Mammalian telomeres consist of repetitive DNA sequences bound by
      the shelterin complex. In this complex, the POT1-TPP1 heterodimer binds to
      single-stranded telomeric DNAs, while TRF1 and TRF2-RAP1 interact with
      double-stranded telomeric DNAs. TIN2, the linchpin of this complex,
      simultaneously interacts with TRF1, TRF2, and TPP1 to mediate the stable assembly
      of the shelterin complex. However, the molecular mechanism by which TIN2
      interacts with these proteins to orchestrate telomere protection remains poorly
      understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of
      TIN2 in complex with TIN2-binding motifs from TPP1 and TRF2, revealing how TIN2
      interacts cooperatively with TPP1 and TRF2. Unexpectedly, TIN2 contains a
      telomeric repeat factor homology (TRFH)-like domain that functions as a
      protein-protein interaction platform. Structure-based mutagenesis analyses
      suggest that TIN2 plays an important role in maintaining the stable shelterin
      complex required for proper telomere end protection.

PG  - 1503-1520
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.145 [doi]
AB  - Telomeric shelterin complex caps chromosome ends and plays a crucial role in
      telomere maintenance and protection. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
      pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric single- and double-stranded DNA-binding
      protein subcomplexes Pot1-Tpz1 and Taz1-Rap1, which are bridged by their
      interacting protein Poz1. However, the structure of Poz1 and how Poz1 functions
      as an interaction hub in the shelterin complex remain unclear. Here we report the
      crystal structure of Poz1 in complex with Poz1-binding motifs of Tpz1 and Rap1.
      The crystal structure shows that Poz1 employs two different binding surfaces to
      interact with Tpz1 and Rap1. Unexpectedly, the structure also reveals that Poz1
      adopts a dimeric conformation. Mutational analyses suggest that proper
      interactions between Tpz1, Poz1, and Rap1 in the shelterin core complex are
      required for telomere length homeostasis and heterochromatin structure
      maintenance at telomeres. Structural resemblance between Poz1 and the TRFH
      domains of other shelterin proteins in fission yeast and humans suggests a model 
      for the evolution of shelterin proteins.

      disease models.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.113 [doi]
AB  - Most neurodegenerative disorders are associated with accumulation of
      disease-relevant proteins. Among them, Huntington disease (HD) is of particular
      interest because of its monogenetic nature. HD is mainly caused by cytotoxicity
      of the defective protein encoded by the mutant Huntingtin gene (HTT). Thus,
      lowering mutant HTT protein (mHTT) levels would be a promising treatment strategy
      for HD. Here we report two kinases HIPK3 and MAPK11 as positive modulators of
      mHTT levels both in cells and in vivo. Both kinases regulate mHTT via their
      kinase activities, suggesting that inhibiting these kinases may have therapeutic 
      values. Interestingly, their effects on HTT levels are mHTT-dependent, providing 
      a feedback mechanism in which mHTT enhances its own level thus contributing to
      mHTT accumulation and disease progression. Importantly, knockout of MAPK11
      significantly rescues disease-relevant behavioral phenotypes in a knockin HD
      mouse model. Collectively, our data reveal new therapeutic entry points for HD
      and target-discovery approaches for similar diseases.

TI  - H7N9 virulent mutants detected in chickens in China pose an increased threat to
      humans.
PG  - 1409-1421
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.129 [doi]
AB  - Certain low pathogenic avian influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic
      viruses when they circulate in domestic poultry, at which point they can cause
      devastating poultry diseases and severe economic damage. The H7N9 influenza
      viruses that emerged in 2013 in China had caused severe human infections and
      deaths. However, these viruses were nonlethal in poultry. It is unknown whether
      the H7N9 viruses can acquire additional mutations during their circulation in
      nature and become lethal to poultry and more dangerous for humans. Here, we
      evaluated the evolution of H7N9 viruses isolated from avian species between 2013 
      and 2017 in China and found 23 different genotypes, 7 of which were detected only
      in ducks and were genetically distinct from the other 16 genotypes that evolved
      from the 2013 H7N9 viruses. Importantly, some H7N9 viruses obtained an insertion 
      of four amino acids in their hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site and were lethal in 
      chickens. The index strain was not lethal in mice or ferrets, but readily
      obtained the 627K or 701N mutation in its PB2 segment upon replication in
      ferrets, causing it to become highly lethal in mice and ferrets and to be
      transmitted efficiently in ferrets by respiratory droplet. H7N9 viruses bearing
      the HA insertion and PB2 627K mutation have been detected in humans in China. Our
      study indicates that the new H7N9 mutants are lethal to chickens and pose an
      increased threat to human health, and thus highlights the need to control and
      eradicate the H7N9 viruses to prevent a possible pandemic.

TI  - Wnt-induced Vangl2 phosphorylation is dose-dependently required for planar cell
      polarity in mammalian development.
PG  - 1466-1484

AB  - Planar cell polarity (PCP) is an evolutionarily conserved essential mechanism
      that provides directional information to control and coordinate polarized
      cellular and tissue behavior during embryonic development. Disruption of PCP
      leads to severe morphological defects in vertebrates and its dysregulation
      results in a variety of human diseases such as neural tube defects and skeletal
      dysplasia. PCP is governed by a set of highly conserved core proteins that are
      asymmetrically localized at the cell surface throughout the polarized tissues.
      The uniform directionality of PCP is established by global cues, such as Wg/Wnt
      signaling gradients that break the original symmetrical localization of core PCP 
      proteins including Vang/Vangl and Fz/Fzd. However, the exact mechanism remains
      elusive. In this study, we found that Vangl2 phosphorylation, which was
      previously identified to be induced by Wnt5a signaling, is required for Vangl2
      functions in mammalian PCP in multiple tissues. The in vivo activities of Vangl2 
      are determined by its phosphorylation level. Phospho-mutant Vangl2 exhibits
      dominant negative effects, whereas Vangl2 with reduced phosphorylation is
      hypomorphic. We show that Vangl2 phosphorylation is essential for its uniform
      polarization pattern. Moreover, serine/threonine kinases CK1varepsilon and
      CK1delta are redundantly required for Wnt5a-induced Vangl2 phosphorylation. Dvl
      family members are also required for Wnt5a-induced Vangl2 phosphorylation by
      enhancing the interaction of CK1 and Vangl2. These findings demonstrate that
      induction of Vangl protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in transducing
      Wnt5a signaling to establish PCP in mammalian development, suggesting a
      phosphorylation-regulated "Vangl activity gradient" model in addition to the
      well-documented "Fz activity gradient" model in Wnt/PCP signaling.

TI  - Twa1/Gid8 is a beta-catenin nuclear retention factor in Wnt signaling and
      colorectal tumorigenesis.
PG  - 1422-1440
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.107 [doi]
AB  - Hyperactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is one of the major causes of human
      colorectal cancer (CRC). A hallmark of Wnt signaling is the nuclear accumulation 
      of beta-catenin. Although beta-catenin nuclear import and export have been widely
      investigated, the underlying mechanism of beta-catenin's nuclear retention
      remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Twa1/Gid8 is a key nuclear
      retention factor for beta-catenin during Wnt signaling and colorectal
      carcinogenesis. In the absence of Wnt, Twa1 exists together with beta-catenin in 
      the Axin complex and undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. Upon Wnt
      signaling, Twa1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds and retains
      beta-catenin. Depletion of Twa1 attenuates Wnt-stimulated gene expression, dorsal
      development of zebrafish embryos and xenograft tumor growth of CRC cells.
      Moreover, nuclear Twa1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues,
      correlating with the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and poor prognosis.
      Thus, our results identify Twa1 as a previously undescribed regulator of the Wnt 
      pathway for promoting colorectal tumorigenesis by facilitating beta-catenin
      nuclear retention.

TI  - Molecular mechanism of directional CTCF recognition of a diverse range of genomic
      sites.
PG  - 1365-1377
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.131 [doi]
AB  - CTCF, a conserved 3D genome architecture protein, determines proper genome-wide
      chromatin looping interactions through directional binding to specific sequence
      elements of four modules within numerous CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) by its 11 zinc
      fingers (ZFs). Here, we report four crystal structures of human CTCF in complex
      with CBSs of the protocadherin (Pcdh) clusters. We show that directional CTCF
      binding to cognate CBSs of the Pcdh enhancers and promoters is achieved through
      inserting its ZF3, ZFs 4-7, and ZFs 9-11 into the major groove along CBSs,
      resulting in a sequence-specific recognition of module 4, modules 3 and 2, and
      module 1, respectively; and ZF8 serves as a spacer element for variable distances
      between modules 1 and 2. In addition, the base contact with the asymmetric "A" in
      the central position of modules 2-3, is essential for directional recognition of 
      the CBSs with symmetric core sequences but lacking module 1. Furthermore, CTCF
      tolerates base changes at specific positions within the degenerated CBS
      sequences, permitting genome-wide CTCF binding to a diverse range of CBSs.
      Together, these complex structures provide important insights into the molecular 
      mechanisms for the directionality, diversity, flexibility, dynamics, and
      conservation of multivalent CTCF binding to its cognate sites across the entire
      human genome.

TI  - Intermittent fasting promotes adipose thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis via
      VEGF-mediated alternative activation of macrophage.
PG  - 1309-1326
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.126 [doi]
AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF), a periodic energy restriction, has been shown to
      provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction.
      However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IF-mediated metabolic 
      benefits is limited. Here we show that isocaloric IF improves metabolic
      homeostasis against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction primarily
      through adipose thermogenesis in mice. IF-induced metabolic benefits require
      fasting-mediated increases of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      expression in white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, periodic adipose-VEGF
      overexpression could recapitulate the metabolic improvement of IF in non-fasted
      animals. Importantly, fasting and adipose-VEGF induce alternative activation of
      adipose macrophage, which is critical for thermogenesis. Human adipose gene
      analysis further revealed a positive correlation of adipose VEGF-M2
      macrophage-WAT browning axis. The present study uncovers the molecular mechanism 
      of IF-mediated metabolic benefit and suggests that isocaloric IF can be a
      preventive and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders.

TI  - A high-quality genome assembly of quinoa provides insights into the molecular
      basis of salt bladder-based salinity tolerance and the exceptional nutritional
      value.
PG  - 1327-1340
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.124 [doi]
AB  - Chenopodium quinoa is a halophytic pseudocereal crop that is being cultivated in 
      an ever-growing number of countries. Because quinoa is highly resistant to
      multiple abiotic stresses and its seed has a better nutritional value than any
      other major cereals, it is regarded as a future crop to ensure global food
      security. We generated a high-quality genome draft using an inbred line of the
      quinoa cultivar Real. The quinoa genome experienced one recent genome duplication
      about 4.3 million years ago, likely reflecting the genome fusion of two
      Chenopodium parents, in addition to the gamma paleohexaploidization reported for 
      most eudicots. The genome is highly repetitive (64.5% repeat content) and
      contains 54 438 protein-coding genes and 192 microRNA genes, with more than 99.3%
      having orthologous genes from glycophylic species. Stress tolerance in quinoa is 
      associated with the expansion of genes involved in ion and nutrient transport,
      ABA homeostasis and signaling, and enhanced basal-level ABA responses. Epidermal 
      salt bladder cells exhibit similar characteristics as trichomes, with a
      significantly higher expression of genes related to energy import and ABA
      biosynthesis compared with the leaf lamina. The quinoa genome sequence provides
      insights into its exceptional nutritional value and the evolution of halophytes, 
      enabling the identification of genes involved in salinity tolerance, and
      providing the basis for molecular breeding in quinoa.

      chemistry between these kingdoms. Whereas the membranes of bacteria and
      eukaryotes primarily consist of straight fatty acids ester-bonded to
      glycerol-3-phosphate, archaeal phospholipids consist of isoprenoid chains
      ether-bonded to glycerol-1-phosphate. Notably, the mechanisms underlying the
      biosynthesis of these lipids remain elusive. Here, we report the structure of the
      CDP-archaeol synthase (CarS) of Aeropyrum pernix (ApCarS) in the CTP- and
      Mg(2+)-bound state at a resolution of 2.4 A. The enzyme comprises a transmembrane
      domain with five helices and cytoplasmic loops that together form a large charged
      cavity providing a binding site for CTP. Identification of the binding location
      of CTP and Mg(2+) enabled modeling of the specific lipophilic substrate-binding
      site, which was supported by site-directed mutagenesis, substrate-binding
      affinity analyses, and enzyme assays. We propose that archaeol binds within two
      hydrophobic membrane-embedded grooves formed by the flexible transmembrane helix 
      5 (TM5), together with TM1 and TM4. Collectively, structural comparisons and
      analyses, combined with functional studies, not only elucidated the mechanism
      governing the biosynthesis of phospholipids with ether-bonded isoprenoid chains
      by CTP transferase, but also provided insights into the evolution of this enzyme 
      superfamily from archaea to bacteria and eukaryotes.

AB  - In a recent paper published in Cell Research, a cryo-EM structure reveals the
      interface between DNA-PKcs and the Ku70/80:DNA complex, together forming the
      DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme in non-homologous DNA end joining.
      Insight from this structure suggests how an allosteric rearrangement of DNA-PKcs 
      driven by Ku70/80:DNA binding regulates kinase activity in this largest member of
      a family of structurally homologous phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein
      kinases that includes mTOR, ATR, and ATM.

TI  - A vital sugar code for ricin toxicity.
PG  - 1351-1364
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Ricin is one of the most feared bioweapons in the world due to its extreme
      toxicity and easy access. Since no antidote exists, it is of paramount importance
      to identify the pathways underlying ricin toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the
      Golgi GDP-fucose transporter Slc35c1 and fucosyltransferase Fut9 are key
      regulators of ricin toxicity. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of
      fucosylation renders diverse cell types resistant to ricin via deregulated
      intracellular trafficking. Importantly, cells from a patient with SLC35C1
      deficiency are also resistant to ricin. Mechanistically, we confirm that reduced 
      fucosylation leads to increased sialylation of Lewis X structures and thus
      masking of ricin-binding sites. Inactivation of the sialyltransferase responsible
      for modifications of Lewis X (St3Gal4) increases the sensitivity of cells to
      ricin, whereas its overexpression renders cells more resistant to the toxin.
      Thus, we have provided unprecedented insights into an evolutionary conserved
      modular sugar code that can be manipulated to control ricin toxicity.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure of human DNA-PK holoenzyme.
PG  - 1341-1350
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.110 [doi]
AB  - DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase
      complex composed of a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and KU70/80 heterodimer bound 
      to DNA. DNA-PK holoenzyme plays a critical role in non-homologous end joining
      (NHEJ), the major DNA repair pathway. Here, we determined cryo-electron
      microscopy structure of human DNA-PK holoenzyme at 6.6 A resolution. In the
      complex structure, DNA-PKcs, KU70, KU80 and DNA duplex form a 650-kDa
      heterotetramer with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. The N-terminal alpha-solenoid (
      approximately 2 800 residues) of DNA-PKcs adopts a double-ring fold and connects 
      the catalytic core domain of DNA-PKcs and KU70/80-DNA. DNA-PKcs and KU70/80
      together form a DNA-binding tunnel, which cradles approximately 30-bp DNA and
      prevents sliding inward of DNA-PKcs along with DNA duplex, suggesting a mechanism
      by which the broken DNA end is protected from unnecessary processing. Structural 
      and biochemical analyses indicate that KU70/80 and DNA coordinately induce
      conformational changes of DNA-PKcs and allosterically stimulate its kinase
      activity. We propose a model for activation of DNA-PKcs in which allosteric
      signals are generated upon DNA-PK holoenzyme formation and transmitted to the
      kinase domain through N-terminal HEAT repeats and FAT domain of DNA-PKcs. Our
      studies suggest a mechanism for recognition and protection of broken DNA ends and
      provide a structural basis for understanding the activation of DNA-PKcs and
      DNA-PK-mediated NHEJ pathway.

TI  - 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in circulating cell-free DNA as diagnostic
      biomarkers for human cancers.
PG  - 1243-1257
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.121 [doi]
AB  - DNA modifications such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
      (5hmC) are epigenetic marks known to affect global gene expression in mammals.
      Given their prevalence in the human genome, close correlation with gene
      expression and high chemical stability, these DNA epigenetic marks could serve as
      ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Taking advantage of a highly sensitive and
      selective chemical labeling technology, we report here the genome-wide profiling 
      of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and in genomic DNA (gDNA) of paired 
      tumor and adjacent tissues collected from a cohort of 260 patients recently
      diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, liver or thyroid cancer and
      normal tissues from 90 healthy individuals. 5hmC was mainly distributed in
      transcriptionally active regions coincident with open chromatin and permissive
      histone modifications. Robust cancer-associated 5hmC signatures were identified
      in cfDNA that were characteristic for specific cancer types. 5hmC-based
      biomarkers of circulating cfDNA were highly predictive of colorectal and gastric 
      cancers and were superior to conventional biomarkers and comparable to 5hmC
      biomarkers from tissue biopsies. Thus, this new strategy could lead to the
      development of effective, minimally invasive methods for diagnosis and prognosis 
      of cancer from the analyses of blood samples.

AB  - In a recent paper published in Cell Research, Abdul-Ghani and colleagues show
      that the cytokine, cardiotrophin-1 (CT1), drives a protective form of reversible 
      cardiac hypertrophy that acts through a nonapoptotic caspase-dependent mechanism.
      Since CT1 can be delivered as exogenous protein, these studies provide new
      biological insights and potential translational opportunities.

TI  - Mettl3-/Mettl14-mediated mRNA N(6)-methyladenosine modulates murine
      spermatogenesis.
PG  - 1216-1230
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.117 [doi]
AB  - Spermatogenesis is a differentiation process during which diploid spermatogonial 
      stem cells (SSCs) produce haploid spermatozoa. This highly specialized process is
      precisely controlled at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and
      translational levels. Here we report that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), an
      epitranscriptomic mark regulating gene expression, plays essential roles during
      spermatogenesis. We present comprehensive m(6)A mRNA methylomes of mouse
      spermatogenic cells from five developmental stages: undifferentiated
      spermatogonia, type A1 spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes,
      pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Germ cell-specific
      inactivation of the m(6)A RNA methyltransferase Mettl3 or Mettl14 with Vasa-Cre
      causes loss of m(6)A and depletion of SSCs. m(6)A depletion dysregulates
      translation of transcripts that are required for SSC
      proliferation/differentiation. Combined deletion of Mettl3 and Mettl14 in
      advanced germ cells with Stra8-GFPCre disrupts spermiogenesis, whereas mice with 
      single deletion of either Mettl3 or Mettl14 in advanced germ cells show normal
      spermatogenesis. The spermatids from double-mutant mice exhibit impaired
      translation of haploid-specific genes that are essential for spermiogenesis. This
      study highlights crucial roles of mRNA m(6)A modification in germline
      development, potentially ensuring coordinated translation at different stages of 
      spermatogenesis.

      with better lodging resistance. In a recent paper in Cell Research, Wang et al.
      describe how a QTL they identified could bring about the desired NPT architecture
      by elucidating the role of its encoded gene in controlling the stability of
      IPA1/OsSPL14, a previously reported NPT protein, in the context of
      ubiquitination.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of histone H2A and histone variant H2A.Z-interacting
      proteins by bPPI-seq.
PG  - 1258-1274
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.112 [doi]
AB  - H2A is a nucleosome core subunit involved in organizing DNA into a chromatin
      structure that is often inaccessible to regulatory enzymes. Replacement of H2A by
      its variant H2A.Z renders chromatin accessible at enhancers and promoters.
      However, it remains unclear how H2A.Z functions so differently from canonical
      H2A. Here we report the genome-wide identification of proteins that directly
      interact with H2A and H2A.Z in vivo using a novel strategy, bPPI-seq. We show
      that bPPI-seq is a sensitive and robust technique to identify protein-protein
      interactions in vivo. Our data indicate that H2A.Z-interacting proteins and
      H2A-interacting proteins participate in distinct biological processes. In
      contrast to H2A-interacting proteins, the H2A.Z-interacting proteins are involved
      in transcriptional regulation. We found that the transcription factor Osr1
      interacts with H2A.Z both in vitro and in vivo. It also mediates H2A.Z
      incorporation to a large number of target sites and regulates gene expression.
      Our data indicate that bPPI-seq can be widely applied to identify genome-wide
      interacting proteins under physiological conditions.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important mammalian DNA epigenetic
      modification that has been linked to gene regulation and cancer pathogenesis.
      Here we explored the diagnostic potential of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA
      (cfDNA) using a sensitive chemical labeling-based low-input shotgun sequencing
      approach. We sequenced cell-free 5hmC from 49 patients of seven different cancer 
      types and found distinct features that could be used to predict cancer types and 
      stages with high accuracy. Specifically, we discovered that lung cancer leads to 
      a progressive global loss of 5hmC in cfDNA, whereas hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      pancreatic cancer lead to disease-specific changes in the cell-free
      hydroxymethylome. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that cell-free 5hmC
      signatures may potentially be used not only to identify cancer types but also to 
      track tumor stage in some cancers.

AB  - As an indispensable molecular machine universal in all living organisms, the
      ribosome has been selected by evolution to be the natural target of many
      antibiotics and small-molecule inhibitors. High-resolution structures of pathogen
      ribosomes are crucial for understanding the general and unique aspects of
      translation control in disease-causing microbes. With cryo-electron microscopy
      technique, we have determined structures of the cytosolic ribosomes from two
      human parasites, Trichomonas vaginalis and Toxoplasma gondii, at resolution of
      3.2-3.4 A. Although the ribosomal proteins from both pathogens are typical
      members of eukaryotic families, with a co-evolution pattern between certain
      species-specific insertions/extensions and neighboring ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
      expansion segments, the sizes of their rRNAs are sharply different. Very
      interestingly, rRNAs of T. vaginalis are in size comparable to prokaryotic
      counterparts, with nearly all the eukaryote-specific rRNA expansion segments
      missing. These structures facilitate the dissection of evolution path for
      ribosomal proteins and RNAs, and may aid in design of novel translation
      inhibitors.

      heart.

AB  - The post-natal heart adapts to stress and overload through hypertrophic growth, a
      process that may be pathologic or beneficial (physiologic hypertrophy).
      Physiologic hypertrophy improves cardiac performance in both healthy and diseased
      individuals, yet the mechanisms that propagate this favorable adaptation remain
      poorly defined. We identify the cytokine cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) as a factor
      capable of recapitulating the key features of physiologic growth of the heart
      including transient and reversible hypertrophy of the myocardium, and stimulation
      of cardiomyocyte-derived angiogenic signals leading to increased vascularity. The
      capacity of CT1 to induce physiologic hypertrophy originates from a CK2-mediated 
      restraining of caspase activation, preventing the transition to unrestrained
      pathologic growth. Exogenous CT1 protein delivery attenuated pathology and
      restored contractile function in a severe model of right heart failure,
      suggesting a novel treatment option for this intractable cardiac disease.

TI  - Fibroblasts in an endocardial fibroelastosis disease model mainly originate from 
      mesenchymal derivatives of epicardium.
PG  - 1157-1177
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.103 [doi]
AB  - Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) refers to the thickening of the ventricular
      endocardium as a result of de novo deposition of subendocardial fibrous tissue
      layers during neonatal heart development. The origin of EFE fibroblasts is
      proposed to be postnatal endocardial cells that undergo an aberrant
      endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Genetic lineage tracing of
      endocardial cells with the inducible endocardial Cre line Npr3-CreER and the
      endothelial cell tracing line Cdh5-CreER on an EFE-like model did not reveal any 
      contribution of neonatal endocardial cells to fibroblasts in the EFE-like
      tissues. Instead, lineage tracing of embryonic epicardium by Wt1-CreER suggested 
      that epicardium-derived mesenchymal cells (MCs) served as the major source of EFE
      fibroblasts. By labeling MCs using Sox9-CreER, we confirmed that MCs of the
      embryonic heart expand and contribute to the majority of neonatal EFE
      fibroblasts. During this pathological process, TGFbeta signaling, the key
      mediator of fibroblasts activation, was highly upregulated in the EFE-like
      tissues. Targeting TGFbeta signaling by administration of its antagonist bone
      morphogenetic protein 7 effectively reduced fibroblast accumulation and tissue
      fibrosis in the EFE-like model. Our study provides genetic evidence that
      excessive fibroblasts in the EFE-like tissues mainly originate from the
      epicardium-derived MCs through epicardial to mesenchymal transition (EpiMT).
      These EpiMT-derived fibroblasts within the EFE-like tissues could serve as a
      potential therapeutic target.

TI  - IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in
      strigolactone signaling in rice.
PG  - 1128-1141
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.102 [doi]
AB  - Strigolactones (SLs), a group of carotenoid derived terpenoid lactones, are
      root-to-shoot phytohormones suppressing shoot branching by inhibiting the
      outgrowth of axillary buds. DWARF 53 (D53), the key repressor of the SL signaling
      pathway, is speculated to regulate the downstream transcriptional network of the 
      SL response. However, no downstream transcription factor targeted by D53 has yet 
      been reported. Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key
      regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream
      component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression. We
      showed that D53 interacts with IPA1 in vivo and in vitro and suppresses the
      transcriptional activation activity of IPA1. We further showed that IPA1 could
      directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback
      regulation of SL-induced D53 expression. These findings reveal that IPA1 is
      likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to
      mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice.

      modulating the bioenergetic homeostasis (i.e., glycolysis and mitochondrial
      respiration) of cells in response to fluctuations in intracellular pH that is
      independent of receptor signaling.

TI  - Ythdc2 is an N(6)-methyladenosine binding protein that regulates mammalian
      spermatogenesis.
PG  - 1115-1127
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.99 [doi]
AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common internal modification in
      eukaryotic mRNA. It is dynamically installed and removed, and acts as a new layer
      of mRNA metabolism, regulating biological processes including stem cell
      pluripotency, cell differentiation, and energy homeostasis. m(6)A is recognized
      by selective binding proteins; YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 work in concert to affect the
      translation of m(6)A-containing mRNAs, YTHDF2 expedites mRNA decay, and YTHDC1
      affects the nuclear processing of its targets. The biological function of YTHDC2,
      the final member of the YTH protein family, remains unknown. We report that
      YTHDC2 selectively binds m(6)A at its consensus motif. YTHDC2 enhances the
      translation efficiency of its targets and also decreases their mRNA abundance.
      Ythdc2 knockout mice are infertile; males have significantly smaller testes and
      females have significantly smaller ovaries compared to those of littermates. The 
      germ cells of Ythdc2 knockout mice do not develop past the zygotene stage and
      accordingly, Ythdc2 is upregulated in the testes as meiosis begins. Thus, YTHDC2 
      is an m(6)A-binding protein that plays critical roles during spermatogenesis.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.100 [doi]
AB  - METTL3 catalyzes the formation of N(6)-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) which has
      important roles in regulating various biological processes. However, the in vivo 
      function of Mettl3 remains largely unknown in mammals. Here we generated germ
      cell-specific Mettl3 knockout mice and demonstrated that Mettl3 was essential for
      male fertility and spermatogenesis. The ablation of Mettl3 in germ cells severely
      inhibited spermatogonial differentiation and blocked the initiation of meiosis.
      Transcriptome and m(6)A profiling analysis revealed that genes functioning in
      spermatogenesis had altered profiles of expression and alternative splicing. Our 
      findings provide novel insights into the function and regulatory mechanisms of
      Mettl3-mediated m(6)A modification in spermatogenesis and reproduction in
      mammals.

PG  - 1142-1156
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.98 [doi]
AB  - Achieving increased grain productivity has long been the overriding focus of
      cereal breeding programs. The ideotype approach has been used to improve rice
      yield potential at the International Rice Research Institute and in China.
      However, the genetic basis of yield-related traits in rice remains unclear. Here,
      we show that a major quantitative trait locus, qNPT1, acts through the
      determination of a 'new plant type' (NPT) architecture characterized by fewer
      tillers, sturdier culms and larger panicles, and it encodes a deubiquitinating
      enzyme with homology to human OTUB1. Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances
      meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain
      number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice.
      Unlike human OTUB1, OsOTUB1 can cleave both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin.
      OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the
      squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14. OsOTUB1 and 
      OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits
      K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes
      K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14. Conversely, loss-of-function 
      of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14,
      resulting in the NPT architecture. We also demonstrated that pyramiding of
      high-yielding npt1 and dep1-1 alleles provides a new strategy for increasing rice
      yield potential above what is currently achievable.

TI  - Smad5 acts as an intracellular pH messenger and maintains bioenergetic
      homeostasis.
PG  - 1083-1099
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.85 [doi]
AB  - Both environmental cues and intracellular bioenergetic states profoundly affect
      intracellular pH (pHi). How a cell responds to pHi changes to maintain
      bioenergetic homeostasis remains elusive. Here we show that Smad5, a
      well-characterized downstream component of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
      signaling responds to pHi changes. Cold, basic or hypertonic conditions increase 
      pHi, which in turn dissociates protons from the charged amino acid clusters
      within the MH1 domain of Smad5, prompting its relocation from the nucleus to the 
      cytoplasm. On the other hand, heat, acidic or hypotonic conditions decrease pHi, 
      blocking the nuclear export of Smad5, and thus causing its nuclear accumulation. 
      Active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad5 induced by environmental changes and 
      pHi fluctuation is independent of BMP signaling, carboxyl terminus
      phosphorylation and Smad4. In addition, ablation of Smad5 causes chronic and
      irreversible dysregulation of cellular bioenergetic homeostasis and disrupted
      normal neural developmental processes as identified in a differentiation model of
      human pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, these metabolic and developmental
      deficits in Smad5-deficient cells could be rescued only by cytoplasmic Smad5.
      Cytoplasmic Smad5 physically interacts with hexokinase 1 and accelerates
      glycolysis. Together, our findings indicate that Smad5 acts as a pHi messenger
      and maintains the bioenergetic homeostasis of cells by regulating cytoplasmic
      metabolic machinery.

AB  - There has been a long-standing controversy of whether megakaryocytes release
      platelets in the marrow or travel to the lungs and release platelets there. Using
      two-photon electron microscopy and orthotopic lung transplantation, Lefrancais et
      al. now document that platelet release occurs physiologically in the lungs of
      mice from extrapulmonary megakaryocytes and that this release accounts for
      approximately 50% of total platelet production.

TI  - Cryo-EM structure and biochemical analysis reveal the basis of the functional
      difference between human PI3KC3-C1 and -C2.
PG  - 989-1001
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.94 [doi]
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) plays essential roles in vesicular
      trafficking, organelle biogenesis and autophagy. Two class III
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes have been identified in mammals,
      the ATG14L complex (PI3KC3-C1) and the UVRAG complex (PI3KC3-C2). PI3KC3-C1 is
      crucial for autophagosome biogenesis, and PI3KC3-C2 is involved in various
      membrane trafficking events. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of human
      PI3KC3-C1 and PI3KC3-C2 at sub-nanometer resolution. The two structures share a
      common L-shaped overall architecture with distinct features. EM examination
      revealed that PI3KC3-C1 "stands up" on lipid monolayers, with the ATG14L BATs
      domain and the VPS34 C-terminal domain (CTD) directly contacting the membrane.
      Biochemical dissection indicated that the ATG14L BATs domain is responsible for
      membrane anchoring, whereas the CTD of VPS34 determines the orientation.
      Furthermore, PI3KC3-C2 binds much more weakly than PI3KC3-C1 to both
      PI-containing liposomes and purified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles, a
      property that is specifically determined by the ATG14L BATs domain. The in vivo
      ER localization analysis indicated that the BATs domain was required for ER
      localization of PI3KC3. We propose that the different lipid binding capacity is
      the key factor that differentiates the functions of PI3KC3-C1 and PI3KC3-C2 in
      autophagy.

TI  - Inhibition of the B7-H3 immune checkpoint limits tumor growth by enhancing
      cytotoxic lymphocyte function.
PG  - 1034-1045
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.90 [doi]
AB  - The interaction between tumor and the immune system is still poorly understood.
      Significant clinical responses have been achieved in cancer patients treated with
      antibodies against the CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints; however, only a small
      portion of patients responded to the therapies, indicating a need to explore
      additional co-inhibitory molecules for cancer treatment. B7-H3, a member of the
      B7 superfamily, was previously shown by us to inhibit T-cell activation and
      autoimmunity. In this study, we have analyzed the function of B7-H3 in tumor
      immunity. Expression of B7-H3 was found in multiple tumor lines,
      tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells, and macrophages. B7-H3-deficient mice or mice
      treated with an antagonistic antibody to B7-H3 showed reduced growth of multiple 
      tumors, which depended on NK and CD8(+) T cells. With a putative receptor
      expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes, B7-H3 inhibited their activation, and its
      deficiency resulted in increased cytotoxic lymphocyte function in tumor-bearing
      mice. Combining blockades of B7-H3 and PD-1 resulted in further enhanced
      therapeutic control of late-stage tumors. Taken together, our results indicate
      that the B7-H3 checkpoint may serve as a novel target for immunotherapy against
      cancer.

AB  - Membrane transporter proteins are critical for cellular uptake and export of
      molecules, and are reported to function by a number of different molecular
      mechanisms. The new occluded state structure of the uracil transporter, UraA,
      from Escherichia coli, reveals that both coordinated movement of the two domains 
      of a single protomer together with dimer formation are important for transport
      activity.

      targeting NS2B-NS3 interaction.
PG  - 1046-1064
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.88 [doi]
AB  - Recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) highlight an urgent need for therapeutics. 
      The protease complex NS2B-NS3 plays essential roles during flaviviral polyprotein
      processing, and thus represents an attractive drug target. Here, we developed a
      split luciferase complementation-based high-throughput screening assay to
      identify orthosteric inhibitors that directly target flavivirus NS2B-NS3
      interactions. By screening a total of 2 816 approved and investigational drugs,
      we identified three potent candidates, temoporfin, niclosamide, and nitazoxanide,
      as flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interaction inhibitors with nanomolar potencies.
      Significantly, the most potent compound, temoporfin, not only inhibited ZIKV
      replication in human placental and neural progenitor cells, but also prevented
      ZIKV-induced viremia and mortality in mouse models. Structural docking suggests
      that temoporfin potentially binds NS3 pockets that hold critical NS2B residues,
      thus inhibiting flaviviral polyprotein processing in a non-competitive manner. As
      these drugs have already been approved for clinical use in other indications
      either in the USA or other countries, they represent promising and easily
      developed therapies for the management of infections by ZIKV and other
      flaviviruses.

TI  - Single-cell multi-omics sequencing of mouse early embryos and embryonic stem
      cells.
PG  - 967-988
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.82 [doi]
AB  - Single-cell epigenome sequencing techniques have recently been developed.
      However, the combination of different layers of epigenome sequencing in an
      individual cell has not yet been achieved. Here, we developed a single-cell
      multi-omics sequencing technology (single-cell COOL-seq) that can analyze the
      chromatin state/nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, copy number variation
      and ploidy simultaneously from the same individual mammalian cell. We used this
      method to analyze the reprogramming of the chromatin state and DNA methylation in
      mouse preimplantation embryos. We found that within < 12 h of fertilization, each
      individual cell undergoes global genome demethylation together with the rapid and
      global reprogramming of both maternal and paternal genomes to a highly opened
      chromatin state. This was followed by decreased openness after the late zygote
      stage. Furthermore, from the late zygote to the 4-cell stage, the residual DNA
      methylation is preferentially preserved on intergenic regions of the paternal
      alleles and intragenic regions of maternal alleles in each individual blastomere.
      However, chromatin accessibility is similar between paternal and maternal alleles
      in each individual cell from the late zygote to the blastocyst stage. The binding
      motifs of several pluripotency regulators are enriched at distal nucleosome
      depleted regions from as early as the 2-cell stage. This indicates that the
      cis-regulatory elements of such target genes have been primed to an open state
      from the 2-cell stage onward, long before pluripotency is eventually established 
      in the ICM of the blastocyst. Genes may be classified into homogeneously open,
      homogeneously closed and divergent states based on the chromatin accessibility of
      their promoter regions among individual cells. This can be traced to step-wise
      transitions during preimplantation development. Our study offers the first
      single-cell and parental allele-specific analysis of the genome-scale chromatin
      state and DNA methylation dynamics at single-base resolution in early mouse
      embryos and provides new insights into the heterogeneous yet highly ordered
      features of epigenomic reprogramming during this process.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.84 [doi]
AB  - Zebrafish can efficiently regenerate their heart through cardiomyocyte
      proliferation. In contrast, mammalian cardiomyocytes stop proliferating shortly
      after birth, limiting the regenerative capacity of the postnatal mammalian heart.
      Therefore, if the endogenous potential of postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation
      could be enhanced, it could offer a promising future therapy for heart failure
      patients. Here, we set out to systematically identify small molecules triggering 
      postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. By screening chemical compound libraries
      utilizing a Fucci-based system for assessing cell cycle stages, we identified
      carbacyclin as an inducer of postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. In vitro,
      carbacyclin induced proliferation of neonatal and adult mononuclear rat
      cardiomyocytes via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta
      (PPARdelta)/PDK1/p308Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway. Inhibition of PPARdelta
      reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during zebrafish heart regeneration. Notably,
      inducible cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of constitutively active
      PPARdelta as well as treatment with PPARdelta agonist after myocardial infarction
      in mice induced cell cycle progression in cardiomyocytes, reduced scarring, and
      improved cardiac function. Collectively, we established a cardiomyocyte
      proliferation screening system and present a new drugable target with promise for
      the treatment of cardiac pathologies caused by cardiomyocyte loss.

TI  - Dimeric structure of the uracil:proton symporter UraA provides mechanistic
      insights into the SLC4/23/26 transporters.
PG  - 1020-1033
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.83 [doi]
AB  - The Escherichia coli uracil:proton symporter UraA is a prototypical member of the
      nucleobase/ascorbate transporter (NAT) or nucleobase/cation symporter 2 (NCS2)
      family, which corresponds to the human solute carrier family SLC23. UraA consists
      of 14 transmembrane segments (TMs) that are organized into two distinct domains, 
      the core domain and the gate domain, a structural fold that is also shared by the
      SLC4 and SLC26 transporters. Here we present the crystal structure of UraA bound 
      to uracil in an occluded state at 2.5 A resolution. Structural comparison with
      the previously reported inward-open UraA reveals pronounced relative motions
      between the core domain and the gate domain as well as intra-domain rearrangement
      of the gate domain. The occluded UraA forms a dimer in the structure wherein the 
      gate domains are sandwiched by two core domains. In vitro and in vivo biochemical
      characterizations show that UraA is at equilibrium between dimer and monomer in
      all tested detergent micelles, while dimer formation is necessary for the
      transport activity. Structural comparison between the dimeric UraA and the
      recently reported inward-facing dimeric UapA provides important insight into the 
      transport mechanism of SLC23 transporters.

TI  - One-step generation of complete gene knockout mice and monkeys by
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing with multiple sgRNAs.
PG  - 933-945
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.81 [doi]
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an efficient gene-editing method, but the majority of
      gene-edited animals showed mosaicism, with editing occurring only in a portion of
      cells. Here we show that single gene or multiple genes can be completely knocked 
      out in mouse and monkey embryos by zygotic injection of Cas9 mRNA and multiple
      adjacent single-guide RNAs (spaced 10-200 bp apart) that target only a single key
      exon of each gene. Phenotypic analysis of F0 mice following targeted deletion of 
      eight genes on the Y chromosome individually demonstrated the robustness of this 
      approach in generating knockout mice. Importantly, this approach delivers
      complete gene knockout at high efficiencies (100% on Arntl and 91% on Prrt2) in
      monkey embryos. Finally, we could generate a complete Prrt2 knockout monkey in a 
      single step, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach in rapidly
      establishing gene-edited monkey models.

AB  - Recently, a Legionella pneumophila effector protein was shown to have an
      unprecedented ATP-independent ubiquitin ligase activity that couples
      phosphoribosylated ubiquitin (PR-Ub) to serine residues of host proteins. A new

      effector protein, SidJ, catalyzes deubiquitination of PR-Ub by cleavage of the
      substrate-linked phosphodiester bond.

      surveillance complex revealed by cryo-EM structures.
PG  - 853-864
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.79 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages encode anti-CRISPR suppressors to counteract the CRISPR/Cas
      immunity of their bacterial hosts, thus facilitating their survival and
      replication. Previous studies have shown that two phage-encoded anti-CRISPR
      proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, suppress the type I-F CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa by preventing target DNA recognition by the Csy surveillance complex, 
      but the precise underlying mechanism was unknown. Here we present the structure
      of AcrF1/2 bound to the Csy complex determined by cryo-EM single-particle
      reconstruction. By structural analysis, we found that AcrF1 inhibits target DNA
      recognition of the Csy complex by interfering with base pairing between the DNA
      target strand and crRNA spacer. In addition, multiple copies of AcrF1 bind to the
      Csy complex with different modes when working individually or cooperating with
      AcrF2, which might exclude target DNA binding through different mechanisms.
      Together with previous reports, we provide a comprehensive working scenario for
      the two anti-CRISPR suppressors, AcrF1 and AcrF2, which silence CRISPR/Cas
      immunity by targeting the Csy surveillance complex.

TI  - Class I histone deacetylases are major histone decrotonylases: evidence for
      critical and broad function of histone crotonylation in transcription.
PG  - 898-915
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.68 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies on enzymes and reader proteins for histone crotonylation support a
      function of histone crotonylation in transcription. However, the enzyme(s)
      responsible for histone decrotonylation (HDCR) remains poorly defined. Moreover, 
      it remains to be determined if histone crotonylation is physiologically
      significant and functionally distinct from or redundant to histone acetylation.
      Here we present evidence that class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) rather than
      sirtuin family deacetylases (SIRTs) are the major histone decrotonylases, and
      that histone crotonylation is as dynamic as histone acetylation in mammalian
      cells. Notably, we have generated novel HDAC1 and HDAC3 mutants with impaired
      HDAC but intact HDCR activity. Using these mutants we demonstrate that selective 
      HDCR in mammalian cells correlates with a broad transcriptional repression and
      diminished promoter association of crotonylation but not acetylation reader
      proteins. Furthermore, we show that histone crotonylation is enriched in and
      required for self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.

AB  - Ubiquitination regulates many aspects of host immunity and thus is a common
      target for infectious agents. Recent studies have revealed that members of the
      SidE effector family of the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila attack
      several small GTPases associated with the endoplasmic reticulum by a novel
      ubiquitination mechanism that does not require the E1 and E2 enzymes of the host 
      ubiquitination machinery. In this case, ubiquitin is first activated by
      ADP-ribosylation at Arg42 by a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity; the
      intermediate is then cleaved by a phosphodiesterase activity also residing within
      SdeA, concomitant with the attachment of ubiquitin to serine residues of
      substrate proteins via a phosphoribosyl linker. Here we demonstrate that the
      effect of SidEs is antagonized by SidJ, an effector encoded by a gene situated in
      the locus coding for three members of the SidE family (SdeC, SdeB and SdeA). SidJ
      reverses ubiquitination of SidEs-modified substrates by cleaving the
      phosphodiester bond that links phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to protein
      substrates. SidJ also displays classical deubiquitinase activity but does not
      require catalytic cysteine residues. Further, these deubiquitinase activities of 
      SidJ are essential for its role in L. pneumophila infection. Finally, the
      activity of SidJ is required for efficiently reducing the abundance of
      ubiquitinated Rab33b in infected cells within a few hours after bacterial uptake.
      Our results establish SidJ as a ubiquitin-deconjugating enzyme that functions to 
      impose temporal regulation on the activity of SidE effectors. SidJ may be
      important in future studies of signaling cascades mediated by this unique
      ubiquitination, one that also potentially regulates cellular processes in
      eukaryotic cells.

TI  - Neurons secrete miR-132-containing exosomes to regulate brain vascular integrity.
PG  - 882-897
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.62 [doi]
AB  - Vascular integrity helps maintain brain microenvironment homeostasis, which is
      critical for the normal development and function of the central nervous system.
      It is known that neural cells can regulate brain vascular integrity. However, due
      to the high complexity of neurovascular interactions involved, understanding of
      the neural regulation of brain vascular integrity is still rudimentary. Using
      intact zebrafish larvae and cultured rodent brain cells, we find that neurons
      transfer miR-132, a highly conserved and neuron-enriched microRNA, via secreting 
      exosomes to endothelial cells (ECs) to maintain brain vascular integrity.
      Following translocation to ECs through exosome internalization, miR-132 regulates
      the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), an important
      adherens junction protein, by directly targeting eukaryotic elongation factor 2
      kinase (eef2k). Disruption of neuronal miR-132 expression or exosome secretion,
      or overexpression of vascular eef2k impairs VE-cadherin expression and brain
      vascular integrity. Our study indicates that miR-132 acts as an intercellular
      signal mediating neural regulation of the brain vascular integrity and suggests
      that the neuronal exosome is a novel avenue for neurovascular communication.

TI  - Intracellular HMGB1 as a novel tumor suppressor of pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 916-932
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.51 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) driven by oncogenic K-Ras remains among
      the most lethal human cancers despite recent advances in modern medicine. The
      pathogenesis of PDAC is partly attributable to intrinsic chromosome instability
      and extrinsic inflammation activation. However, the molecular link between these 
      two events in pancreatic tumorigenesis has not yet been fully established. Here, 
      we show that intracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) remarkably
      suppresses oncogenic K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis by inhibiting
      chromosome instability-mediated pro-inflammatory nucleosome release. Conditional 
      genetic ablation of either single or both alleles of HMGB1 in the pancreas
      renders mice extremely sensitive to oncogenic K-Ras-driven initiation of
      precursor lesions at birth, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms,
      intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Loss of 
      HMGB1 in the pancreas is associated with oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal
      instability characterized by chromosome rearrangements and telomere
      abnormalities. These lead to inflammatory nucleosome release and propagate
      K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis. Extracellular nucleosomes promote
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion by infiltrating macrophages/neutrophils and
      enhance oncogenic K-Ras signaling activation in pancreatic lesions. Neutralizing 
      antibodies to IL-6 or histone H3 or knockout of the receptor for advanced
      glycation end products all limit K-Ras signaling activation, prevent cancer
      development and metastasis/invasion, and prolong animal survival in
      Pdx1-Cre;K-Ras(G12D/+);Hmgb1(-/-) mice. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGB1 loss 
      by glycyrrhizin limits oncogenic K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis in mice under
      inflammatory conditions. Diminished nuclear and total cellular expression of
      HMGB1 in PDAC patients correlates with poor overall survival, supporting
      intracellular HMGB1 as a novel tumor suppressor with prognostic and therapeutic
      relevance in PDAC.

TI  - Homology-mediated end joining-based targeted integration using CRISPR/Cas9.
PG  - 801-814
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.76 [doi]
AB  - Targeted integration of transgenes can be achieved by strategies based on
      homologous recombination (HR), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) or
      non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The more generally used HR is inefficient for 
      achieving gene integration in animal embryos and tissues, because it occurs only 
      during cell division, although MMEJ and NHEJ can elevate the efficiency in some
      systems. Here we devise a homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ)-based strategy,
      using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of both transgene donor vector that contains 
      guide RNA target sites and approximately 800 bp of homology arms, and the
      targeted genome. We found no significant improvement of the targeting efficiency 
      by the HMEJ-based method in either mouse embryonic stem cells or the
      neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, compared to the HR-based method. However, the
      HMEJ-based method yielded a higher knock-in efficiency in HEK293T cells, primary 
      astrocytes and neurons. More importantly, this approach achieved transgene
      integration in mouse and monkey embryos, as well as in hepatocytes and neurons in
      vivo, with an efficiency much greater than HR-, NHEJ- and MMEJ-based strategies. 
      Thus, the HMEJ-based strategy may be useful for a variety of applications,
      including gene editing to generate animal models and for targeted gene therapies.

PG  - 728-747
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.72 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play pivotal roles in desensitizing
      GPCR signaling but little is known about how GRKs recognize and phosphorylate
      GPCRs due to the technical difficulties in detecting the highly dynamic GPCR/GRK 
      interaction. By combining a genetic approach with multiple biochemical assays, we
      identified the key determinants for the assembly of the prototypical GPCR
      rhodopsin with its kinase GRK1. Our work reveals that the regulatory G-protein
      signaling homology (RH) domain of GRKs is the primary binding site to GPCRs and
      an active conformation of the GRK1 kinase domain is required for efficient
      interaction with rhodopsin. In addition, we provide a mechanistic solution for
      the longstanding puzzle about the gain-of-function Q41L mutation in GRK5. This
      mutation is in the RH domain and increases the capacity of the GRK mutant to
      interact with and to desensitize GPCRs. Finally we present the principal
      architecture of a rhodopsin/GRK complex through negative stain electron
      microscopy reconstruction. Together, these data define the key components for the
      rhodopsin/GRK1 interaction and provide a framework for understanding GRK-mediated
      desensitization of GPCRs.

      noncoding RNAs, functionally still largely uncharacterized. Three publications
      that appeared concurrently in Cell Research and Molecular Cell provide initial
      evidence for certain endogenous circRNAs coding for proteins.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in one blastomere of two-cell embryos reveals
      a novel Tet3 function in regulating neocortical development.
PG  - 815-829
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.58 [doi]
AB  - Studying the early function of essential genes is an important and challenging
      problem in developmental biology. Here, we established a method for rapidly
      inducing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutations in one blastomere of two-cell stage
      embryos, termed 2-cell embryo-CRISPR-Cas9 injection (2CC), to study the in vivo
      function of essential (or unknown) genes in founder chimeric mice. By injecting
      both Cre mRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the gene of interest into fluorescent
      reporter mice, the 2CC method can trace both wild-type and mutant cells at
      different developmental stages, offering internal control for phenotypic analyses
      of mutant cells. Using this method, we identified novel functions of the
      essential gene Tet3 in regulating excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission
      in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. By generating chimeric mutant mice, the 
      2CC method allows for the rapid screening of gene function in multiple tissues
      and cell types in founder chimeric mice, significantly expanding the current
      armamentarium of genetic tools.

TI  - Chemotherapy-induced intestinal inflammatory responses are mediated by exosome
      secretion of double-strand DNA via AIM2 inflammasome activation.
PG  - 784-800
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.54 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapies are known often to induce severe gastrointestinal tract toxicity
      but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study considers the widely
      applied cytotoxic agent irinotecan (CPT-11) as a representative agent and
      demonstrates that treatment induces massive release of double-strand DNA from the
      intestine that accounts for the dose-limiting intestinal toxicity of the
      compound. Specifically, "self-DNA" released through exosome secretion enters the 
      cytosol of innate immune cells and activates the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2)
      inflammasome. This leads to mature IL-1beta and IL-18 secretion and induces
      intestinal mucositis and late-onset diarrhoea. Interestingly, abrogation of AIM2 
      signalling, either in AIM2-deficient mice or by a pharmacological inhibitor such 
      as thalidomide, significantly reduces the incidence of drug-induced diarrhoea
      without affecting the anticancer efficacy of CPT-11. These findings provide
      mechanistic insights into how chemotherapy triggers innate immune responses
      causing intestinal toxicity, and reveal new chemotherapy regimens that maintain
      anti-tumour effects but circumvent the associated adverse inflammatory response.

AB  - Lysosomes are centers for nutrient sensing and recycling that allow mammals to
      adapt to starvation. Regulation of lysosome dynamics by internal nutrient
      signaling is well described, but the mechanisms by which external cues modulate
      lysosomal function are unclear. Here, we describe an essential role of the
      fasting-induced hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in lysosome
      homeostasis in mice. Fgf21 deficiency impairs hepatic lysosomal function by
      blocking transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome
      biogenesis and autophagy. FGF21 induces mobilization of calcium from the
      endoplasmic reticulum, which activates the transcriptional repressor downstream
      regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM), and thereby inhibits expression 
      of Mid1 (encoding the E3 ligase Midline-1). Protein phosphatase PP2A, a substrate
      of MID1, accumulates and dephosphorylates TFEB, thereby upregulating genes
      involved in lysosome biogenesis, autophagy and lipid metabolism. Thus, an
      FGF21-TFEB signaling axis links lysosome homeostasis with extracellular hormonal 
      signaling to orchestrate lipid metabolism during fasting.

PG  - 764-783
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.41 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are traditionally associated with cancer through 
      their abilities to cause chromosomal instabilities or gene mutations. Here we
      report a new class of self-inflicted DNA DSBs that can drive tumor growth
      irrespective of their effects on genomic stability. We discover a mechanism
      through which cancer cells cause DSBs in their own genome spontaneously
      independent of reactive oxygen species or replication stress. In this mechanism, 
      low-level cytochrome c leakage from the mitochondria leads to sublethal
      activation of apoptotic caspases and nucleases, which causes DNA DSBs. In
      response to these spontaneous DNA DSBs, ATM, a key factor involved in DNA damage 
      response, is constitutively activated. Activated ATM leads to activation of
      transcription factors NF-kappaB and STAT3, known drivers of tumor growth.
      Moreover, self-inflicted DNA DSB formation and ATM activation are important in
      sustaining the stemness of patient-derived glioma cells. In human tumor tissues, 
      elevated levels of activated ATM correlate with poor patient survival.
      Self-inflicted DNA DSBs therefore are functionally important for maintaining the 
      malignancy of cancer cells.

TI  - 5-methylcytosine promotes mRNA export - NSUN2 as the methyltransferase and ALYREF
      as an m(5)C reader.
PG  - 606-625
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.55 [doi]
AB  - 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification identified in
      both stable and highly abundant tRNAs and rRNAs, and in mRNAs. However, its
      regulatory role in mRNA metabolism is still largely unknown. Here, we reveal that
      m(5)C modi fi cation is enriched in CG-rich regions and in regions immediately
      downstream of translation initiation sites and has conserved, tissue-specific and
      dynamic features across mammalian transcriptomes. Moreover, m(5)C formation in
      mRNAs is mainly catalyzed by the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2, and m(5)C is
      specifically recognized by the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF as shown by in vitro
      and in vivo studies. NSUN2 modulates ALYREF's nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling,
      RNA-binding affinity and associated mRNA export. Dysregulation of ALYREF-mediated
      mRNA export upon NSUN2 depletion could be restored by reconstitution of wild-type
      but not methyltransferase-defective NSUN2. Our study provides comprehensive m(5)C
      profiles of mammalian transcriptomes and suggests an essential role for m(5)C
      modification in mRNA export and post-transcriptional regulation.

TI  - PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation mediate human globin mRNA splicing
      at spliceosome assembly.
PG  - 688-704
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.39 [doi]
AB  - Short elements in mammalian mRNA can control gene expression by activating the
      RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR that attenuates translation by phosphorylating
      cytoplasmic eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). We demonstrate a
      novel, positive role for PKR activation and eIF2alpha phosphorylation in human
      globin mRNA splicing. PKR localizes in splicing complexes and associates with
      splicing factor SC35. Splicing and early-stage spliceosome assembly on
      beta-globin pre-mRNA depend strictly on activation of PKR by a codon-containing
      RNA fragment within exon 1 and on phosphorylation of nuclear eIF2alpha on Serine 
      51. Nonphosphorylatable mutant eIF2alphaS51A blocked beta-globin mRNA splicing in
      cells and nuclear extract. Mutations of the beta-globin RNA activator abrogated
      PKR activation and profoundly affected mRNA splicing efficiency. PKR depletion
      abrogated splicing and spliceosome assembly; recombinant PKR effectively restored
      splicing. Excision of the first intron of beta-globin induces strand displacement
      within the RNA activator of PKR by a sequence from exon 2, a structural
      rearrangement that silences the ability of spliced beta-globin mRNA to activate
      PKR. Thus, the ability to activate PKR is transient, serving solely to enable
      splicing. alpha-Globin pre-mRNA splicing is controlled likewise but positions of 
      PKR activator and silencer are reversed, demonstrating evolutionary flexibility
      in how PKR activation regulates globin mRNA splicing through eIF2alpha
      phosphorylation.

TI  - Cell fate conversion: a chromatin remodeling checkpoint revealed.
PG  - 598-599
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.44 [doi]
AB  - In a new paper in Cell Research, Ji et al. find that transcription
      factor-instigated opening of chromatin, during cell reprogramming, can be sensed 
      by the Baf60b-containing chromatin remodeling complex, which then activates the
      ATM-p53 pathway, leading to cell death. These findings from reprogramming studies
      unveil what I term a "chromatin remodeling checkpoint" whereby extensive,
      inappropriate chromatin opening events lead to cell elimination, thus preventing 
      cell fate conversion that might occur upon tissue damage; if unchecked, such
      conversion could lead to metaplasia and cancer.

TI  - Ubiquitylation of p62/sequestosome1 activates its autophagy receptor function and
      controls selective autophagy upon ubiquitin stress.
PG  - 657-674
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.40 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in cellular ubiquitin (Ub) homeostasis, known as Ub stress, feature
      and affect cellular responses in multiple conditions, yet the underlying
      mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we report that autophagy receptor
      p62/sequestosome-1 interacts with E2 Ub conjugating enzymes, UBE2D2 and UBE2D3.
      Endogenous p62 undergoes E2-dependent ubiquitylation during upregulation of Ub
      homeostasis, a condition termed as Ub(+) stress, that is intrinsic to Ub
      overexpression, heat shock or prolonged proteasomal inhibition by bortezomib, a
      chemotherapeutic drug. Ubiquitylation of p62 disrupts dimerization of the UBA
      domain of p62, liberating its ability to recognize polyubiquitylated cargoes for 
      selective autophagy. We further demonstrate that this mechanism might be critical
      for autophagy activation upon Ub(+) stress conditions. Delineation of the
      mechanism and regulatory roles of p62 in sensing Ub stress and controlling
      selective autophagy could help to understand and modulate cellular responses to a
      variety of endogenous and environmental challenges, potentially opening a new
      avenue for the development of therapeutic strategies against autophagy-related
      maladies.

TI  - Structure and mechanism of a group-I cobalt energy coupling factor transporter.
PG  - 675-687
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.38 [doi]
AB  - Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a large family of ATP-binding
      cassette transporters recently identified in microorganisms. Responsible for
      micronutrient uptake from the environment, ECF transporters are modular
      transporters composed of a membrane substrate-binding component EcfS and an ECF
      module consisting of an integral membrane scaffold component EcfT and two
      cytoplasmic ATP binding/hydrolysis components EcfA/A'. ECF transporters are
      classified into groups I and II. Currently, the molecular understanding of
      group-I ECF transporters is very limited, partly due to a lack of transporter
      complex structural information. Here, we present structures and structure-based
      analyses of the group-I cobalt ECF transporter CbiMNQO, whose constituting
      subunits CbiM/CbiN, CbiQ, and CbiO correspond to the EcfS, EcfT, and EcfA
      components of group-II ECF transporters, respectively. Through reconstitution of 
      different CbiMNQO subunits and determination of related ATPase and transporter
      activities, the substrate-binding subunit CbiM was found to stimulate CbiQO's
      basal ATPase activity. The structure of CbiMQO complex was determined in its
      inward-open conformation and that of CbiO in beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine
      5'-triphosphate-bound closed conformation. Structure-based analyses revealed
      interactions between different components, substrate-gating function of the L1
      loop of CbiM, and conformational changes of CbiO induced by ATP binding and
      product release within the CbiMNQO transporter complex. These findings enabled us
      to propose a working model of the CbiMNQO transporter, in which the transport
      process requires the rotation or toppling of both CbiQ and CbiM, and CbiN might
      function in coupling conformational changes between CbiQ and CbiM.

TI  - Baf60b-mediated ATM-p53 activation blocks cell identity conversion by sensing
      chromatin opening.
PG  - 642-656
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.36 [doi]
AB  - Lineage conversion by expression of lineage-specific transcription factors is a
      process of epigenetic remodeling that has low efficiency. The mechanism by which 
      a cell resists lineage conversion is largely unknown. Using hepatic-specific
      transcription factors Foxa3, Hnf1alpha and Gata4 (3TF) to induce hepatic
      conversion in mouse fibroblasts, we showed that 3TF induced strong activation of 
      the ATM-p53 pathway, which led to proliferation arrest and cell death, and it
      further prevented hepatic conversion. Notably, ATM activation, independent of DNA
      damage, responded to chromatin opening during hepatic conversion. By
      characterizing the early molecular events during hepatic conversion, we found
      that Baf60b, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, links
      chromatin opening to ATM activation by facilitating ATM recruitment to the open
      chromatin regions of a panel of hepatic gene loci. These findings shed light on
      cellular responses to lineage conversion by revealing a function of the ATM-p53
      pathway in sensing chromatin opening.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to the ever-increasing number of
      transcripts that are thought not to encode proteins. A recent study has now
      identified a small polypeptide encoded by the lncRNA LINC00961 that inhibits
      amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation in skeletal muscle.

TI  - Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N(6)-methyladenosine.
PG  - 626-641
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.31 [doi]
AB  - Extensive pre-mRNA back-splicing generates numerous circular RNAs (circRNAs) in
      human transcriptome. However, the biological functions of these circRNAs remain
      largely unclear. Here we report that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most
      abundant base modification of RNA, promotes efficient initiation of protein
      translation from circRNAs in human cells. We discover that consensus m(6)A motifs
      are enriched in circRNAs and a single m(6)A site is sufficient to drive
      translation initiation. This m(6)A-driven translation requires initiation factor 
      eIF4G2 and m(6)A reader YTHDF3, and is enhanced by methyltransferase METTL3/14,
      inhibited by demethylase FTO, and upregulated upon heat shock. Further analyses
      through polysome profiling, computational prediction and mass spectrometry reveal
      that m(6)A-driven translation of circRNAs is widespread, with hundreds of
      endogenous circRNAs having translation potential. Our study expands the coding
      landscape of human transcriptome, and suggests a role of circRNA-derived proteins
      in cellular responses to environmental stress.

AB  - Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to form an entire embryo, including
      extraembryonic tissues, an ability we have yet to recapitalize, in vitro. In a
      recent paper published in Science, Choi et al. showed that pluripotent stem cells
      lacking microRNA miR-34a, have an expanded cell fate potential allowing
      differentiation into not only embryonic but also extraembryonic lineages.

AB  - T-cell receptor-CD3 complex (TCR) is a versatile signaling machine that can
      initiate antigen-specific immune responses based on various biochemical changes
      of CD3 cytoplasmic domains, but the underlying structural basis remains elusive. 
      Here we developed biophysical approaches to study the conformational dynamics of 
      CD3epsilon cytoplasmic domain (CD3epsilonCD). At the single-molecule level, we
      found that CD3epsilonCD could have multiple conformational states with different 
      openness of three functional motifs, i.e., ITAM, BRS and PRS. These conformations
      were generated because different regions of CD3epsilonCD had heterogeneous
      lipid-binding properties and therefore had heterogeneous dynamics. Live-cell
      imaging experiments demonstrated that different antigen stimulations could
      stabilize CD3epsilonCD at different conformations. Lipid-dependent conformational
      dynamics thus provide structural basis for the versatile signaling property of
      TCR.

TI  - Blocking the recruitment of naive CD4(+) T cells reverses immunosuppression in
      breast cancer.
PG  - 461-482
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.34 [doi]
AB  - The origin of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, critical mediators of tumor
      immunosuppression, is unclear. Here, we show that tumor-infiltrating naive CD4(+)
      T cells and Tregs in human breast cancer have overlapping TCR repertoires, while 
      hardly overlap with circulating Tregs, suggesting that intratumoral Tregs mainly 
      develop from naive T cells in situ rather than from recruited Tregs. Furthermore,
      the abundance of naive CD4(+) T cells and Tregs is closely correlated, both
      indicating poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Naive CD4(+) T cells adhere
      to tumor slices in proportion to the abundance of CCL18-producing macrophages.
      Moreover, adoptively transferred human naive CD4(+) T cells infiltrate human
      breast cancer orthotopic xenografts in a CCL18-dependent manner. In human breast 
      cancer xenografts in humanized mice, blocking the recruitment of naive CD4(+) T
      cells into tumor by knocking down the expression of PITPNM3, a CCL18 receptor,
      significantly reduces intratumoral Tregs and inhibits tumor progression. These
      findings suggest that breast tumor-infiltrating Tregs arise from chemotaxis of
      circulating naive CD4(+) T cells that differentiate into Tregs in situ.
      Inhibiting naive CD4(+) T cell recruitment into tumors by interfering with
      PITPNM3 recognition of CCL18 may be an attractive strategy for anticancer
      immunotherapy.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms governing self-renewal and differentiation of the
      mammary epithelium are incompletely defined; a better understanding of the events
      implicated in the specification and expansion of luminal progenitors is of
      particular importance as many breast cancers originate from their transformation.
      Britschgi et al. found that, in addition to phosphorylating and inactivating YAP,
      LATS functions as a scaffold to facilitate estrogen receptor-alpha ubiquitylation
      by the E3 ligase CRL4 and consequently suppresses luminal progenitor
      specification and expansion.

TI  - De novo DNA methylation during monkey pre-implantation embryogenesis.
PG  - 526-539
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.25 [doi]
AB  - Critical epigenetic regulation of primate embryogenesis entails DNA methylome
      changes. Here we report genome-wide composition, patterning, and stage-specific
      dynamics of DNA methylation in pre-implantation rhesus monkey embryos as well as 
      male and female gametes studied using an optimized tagmentation-based
      whole-genome bisulfite sequencing method. We show that upon fertilization, both
      paternal and maternal genomes undergo active DNA demethylation, and genome-wide
      de novo DNA methylation is also initiated in the same period. By the 8-cell
      stage, remethylation becomes more pronounced than demethylation, resulting in an 
      increase in global DNA methylation. Promoters of genes associated with oxidative 
      phosphorylation are preferentially remethylated at the 8-cell stage, suggesting
      that this mode of energy metabolism may not be favored. Unlike in rodents, X
      chromosome inactivation is not observed during monkey pre-implantation
      development. Our study provides the first comprehensive illustration of the 'wax 
      and wane' phases of DNA methylation dynamics. Most importantly, our DNA
      methyltransferase loss-of-function analysis indicates that DNA methylation
      influences early monkey embryogenesis.

PG  - 455-456
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.19 [doi]
AB  - EGF, a well-studied mitogen for cancer cells, is revealed to induce an E3
      ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPSB1, which recruits the Elongin B/C-Collin complex to 
      trigger ubiquitylation of the negative splicing regulator hnRNP A1. This event is
      synergized with EGF-activated SR proteins to alter alternative splicing of a key 
      small GTPase Rac1 to enhance cell migration, highlighting converging EGF signals 
      on both negative and positive splicing regulators to jointly promote a key cancer
      pathway.

TI  - Visualization of aging-associated chromatin alterations with an engineered TALE
      system.
PG  - 483-504
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.18 [doi]
AB  - Visualization of specific genomic loci in live cells is a prerequisite for the
      investigation of dynamic changes in chromatin architecture during diverse
      biological processes, such as cellular aging. However, current precision genomic 
      imaging methods are hampered by the lack of fluorescent probes with high
      specificity and signal-to-noise contrast. We find that conventional transcription
      activator-like effectors (TALEs) tend to form protein aggregates, thereby
      compromising their performance in imaging applications. Through screening, we
      found that fusing thioredoxin with TALEs prevented aggregate formation, unlocking
      the full power of TALE-based genomic imaging. Using thioredoxin-fused TALEs
      (TTALEs), we achieved high-quality imaging at various genomic loci and observed
      aging-associated (epi) genomic alterations at telomeres and centromeres in human 
      and mouse premature aging models. Importantly, we identified attrition of
      ribosomal DNA repeats as a molecular marker for human aging. Our study
      establishes a simple and robust imaging method for precisely monitoring chromatin
      dynamics in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in tight-skin mice identifies miR-151-5p as
      a therapeutic target for systemic sclerosis.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease, may cause significant osteopenia
      due to activation of the IL4Ralpha/mTOR pathway. Mesenchymal stem cell
      transplantation (MSCT) can ameliorate immune disorders in SSc via inducing immune
      tolerance. However, it is unknown whether MSCT rescues osteopenia phenotype in
      SSc. Here we show that MSCT can effectively ameliorate osteopenia in SSc mice by 
      rescuing impaired lineage differentiation of the recipient bone marrow MSCs.
      Mechanistically, we show that donor MSCs transfer miR-151-5p to the recipient
      bone marrow MSCs in SSc mice to inhibit IL4Ralpha expression, thus downregulating
      mTOR pathway activation to enhance osteogenic differentiation and reduce
      adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, systemic delivery of miR-151-5p is capable 
      of rescuing osteopenia, impaired bone marrow MSCs, tight skin, and immune
      disorders in SSc mice, suggesting that miR-151-5p may be a specific target for
      SSc treatment. Our finding identifies a previously unrecognized role of MSCT in
      transferring miRNAs to recipient stem cells to ameliorate osteopenia via rescuing
      a non-coding RNA pathway.

TI  - SPSB1-mediated HnRNP A1 ubiquitylation regulates alternative splicing and cell
      migration in EGF signaling.
PG  - 540-558
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.7 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular signals have been shown to impact on alternative pre-mRNA splicing;
      however, the molecular mechanisms and biological significance of signal-induced
      splicing regulation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that epidermal growth
      factor (EGF) induces splicing changes through ubiquitylation of a well-known
      splicing regulator, hnRNP A1. EGF signaling upregulates an E3 ubiquitin (Ub)
      ligase adaptor, SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 1 (SPSB1), which recruits
      Elongin B/C-Cullin complexes to conjugate lysine 29-linked polyUb chains onto
      hnRNP A1. Importantly, SPSB1 and ubiquitylation of hnRNP A1 have a critical role 
      in EGF-driven cell migration. Mechanistically, EGF-induced ubiquitylation of
      hnRNP A1 together with the activation of SR protein kinases (SRPKs) results in
      the upregulation of a Rac1 splicing isoform, Rac1b, to promote cell motility.
      These findings unravel a novel crosstalk between protein ubiquitylation and
      alternative splicing in EGF/EGF receptor signaling, and identify a new
      EGF/SPSB1/hnRNP A1/Rac1 axis in modulating cell migration, which may have
      important implications for cancer treatment.

TI  - The RNA-binding protein QKI5 regulates primary miR-124-1 processing via a distal 
      RNA motif during erythropoiesis.
PG  - 416-439
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.26 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is finely controlled by complex layers of
      post-transcriptional regulators, including RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Here, we 
      show that an RBP, QKI5, activates the processing of primary miR-124-1 (pri-124-1)
      during erythropoiesis. QKI5 recognizes a distal QKI response element and recruits
      Microprocessor through interaction with DGCR8. Furthermore, the recruited
      Microprocessor is brought to pri-124-1 stem loops by a spatial RNA-RNA
      interaction between two complementary sequences. Thus, mutations disrupting their
      base-pairing affect the strength of QKI5 activation. When erythropoiesis
      proceeds, the concomitant decrease of QKI5 releases Microprocessor from pri-124-1
      and reduces mature miR-124 levels to facilitate erythrocyte maturation.
      Mechanistically, miR-124 targets TAL1 and c-MYB, two transcription factors
      involved in normal erythropoiesis. Importantly, this QKI5-mediated regulation
      also gives rise to a unique miRNA signature, which is required for erythroid
      differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of
      QKI5 in primary miRNA processing during erythropoiesis and provide new insights
      into how a distal element on primary transcripts affects miRNA biogenesis.

TI  - A molecular roadmap for induced multi-lineage trans-differentiation of
      fibroblasts by chemical combinations.
PG  - 386-401
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.17 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have demonstrated the power of small molecules in promoting
      cellular reprogramming. Yet, the full potential of such chemicals in cell fate
      manipulation and the underlying mechanisms require further characterization.
      Through functional screening assays, we find that mouse embryonic fibroblast
      cells can be induced to trans-differentiate into a wide range of somatic lineages
      simultaneously by treatment with a combination of four chemicals. Genomic
      analysis of the process indicates activation of multi-lineage modules and
      relaxation of epigenetic silencing programs. In addition, we identify Sox2 as an 
      important regulator within the induced network. Single cell analysis uncovers a
      novel priming state that enables transition from fibroblast cells to diverse
      somatic lineages. Finally, we demonstrate that modification of the culture system
      enables directional trans-differentiation towards myocytic, glial or adipocytic
      lineages. Our study describes a cell fate control system that may be harnessed
      for regenerative medicine.

TI  - High-resolution cryo-EM structure of the proteasome in complex with ADP-AlFx.
PG  - 373-385
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.12 [doi]
AB  - The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent dynamic 2.5 MDa protease that regulates
      numerous essential cellular functions through degradation of ubiquitinated
      substrates. Here we present a near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM map of the S.
      cerevisiae 26S proteasome in complex with ADP-AlFx. Our biochemical and
      structural data reveal that the proteasome-ADP-AlFx is in an activated state,
      displaying a distinct conformational configuration especially in the AAA-ATPase
      motor region. Noteworthy, this map demonstrates an asymmetric nucleotide binding 
      pattern with four consecutive AAA-ATPase subunits bound with nucleotide. The
      remaining two subunits, Rpt2 and Rpt6, with empty or only partially occupied
      nucleotide pocket exhibit pronounced conformational changes in the AAA-ATPase
      ring, which may represent a collective result of allosteric cooperativity of all 
      the AAA-ATPase subunits responding to ATP hydrolysis. This collective motion of
      Rpt2 and Rpt6 results in an elevation of their pore loops, which could play an
      important role in substrate processing of proteasome. Our data also imply that
      the nucleotide occupancy pattern could be related to the activation status of the
      complex. Moreover, the HbYX tail insertion may not be sufficient to maintain the 
      gate opening of 20S core particle. Our results provide new insights into the
      mechanisms of nucleotide-driven allosteric cooperativity of the complex and of
      the substrate processing by the proteasome.

TI  - YTHDF3 facilitates translation and decay of N(6)-methyladenosine-modified RNA.
PG  - 315-328
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.15 [doi]
AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant internal modification in
      eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and plays important roles in cell
      differentiation and tissue development. It regulates multiple steps throughout
      the RNA life cycle including RNA processing, translation, and decay, via the
      recognition by selective binding proteins. In the cytoplasm, m(6)A binding
      protein YTHDF1 facilitates translation of m(6)A-modified mRNAs, and YTHDF2
      accelerates the decay of m(6)A-modified transcripts. The biological function of
      YTHDF3, another cytoplasmic m(6)A binder of the YTH (YT521-B homology) domain
      family, remains unknown. Here, we report that YTHDF3 promotes protein synthesis
      in synergy with YTHDF1, and affects methylated mRNA decay mediated through
      YTHDF2. Cells deficient in all three YTHDF proteins experience the most dramatic 
      accumulation of m(6)A-modified transcripts. These results indicate that together 
      with YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, YTHDF3 plays critical roles to accelerate metabolism of
      m(6)A-modified mRNAs in the cytoplasm. All three YTHDF proteins may act in an
      integrated and cooperative manner to impact fundamental biological processes
      related to m(6)A RNA methylation.

AB  - The persistence of cholesterol-engorged macrophages (foam cells) in the artery
      wall fuels the development of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism that
      regulates the formation of macrophage foam cells and impedes their emigration out
      of inflamed plaques is still elusive. Here, we report that adhesion receptor
      CD146 controls the formation of macrophage foam cells and their retention within 
      the plaque during atherosclerosis exacerbation. CD146 is expressed on the
      macrophages in human and mouse atheroma and can be upregulated by oxidized
      low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). CD146 triggers macrophage activation by driving 
      the internalization of scavenger receptor CD36 during lipid uptake. In response
      to oxLDL, macrophages show reduced migratory capacity toward chemokines CCL19 and
      CCL21; this capacity can be restored by blocking CD146. Genetic deletion of
      macrophagic CD146 or targeting of CD146 with an antibody result in much less
      complex plaques in high-fat diet-fed ApoE(-/-) mice by causing lipid-loaded
      macrophages to leave plaques. Collectively, our findings identify CD146 as a
      novel retention signal that traps macrophages within the artery wall, and a
      promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis treatment.

TI  - Viral effector protein manipulates host hormone signaling to attract insect
      vectors.
PG  - 402-415
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.2 [doi]
AB  - Some plant and animal pathogens can manipulate their hosts to cause them to
      release odors that are attractive to the pathogens' arthropod vectors. However,
      the molecular mechanism underlying this process is largely unexplored, and the
      specific effectors the pathogens employ as well as the pathways within the hosts 
      they target are currently unknown. Here we reveal that the aphid-borne cucumber
      mosaic virus (CMV) employs its 2b protein, a well-characterized viral suppressor 
      of host RNA interference (VSR), to target the host's jasmonate (JA) hormone
      pathway, thus acting as a viral inducer of host attractiveness to insect vectors 
      (VIA). 2b inhibits JA signaling by directly interacting with and repressing
      JA-induced degradation of host jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins, instead of using
      its VSR activity. Our findings identify a previously defined VSR protein as a VIA
      and uncover a molecular mechanism CMV uses to manipulate host's attractiveness to
      insect vectors by targeting host hormone signaling.

TI  - Mitochondrial PKM2 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing
      Bcl2.
PG  - 329-351
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.159 [doi]
AB  - Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays
      an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that 
      PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of 
      PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to mitochondria under
      oxidative stress. In the mitochondria, PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates
      Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based
      E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein,
      HSP90alpha1, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90alpha1's ATPase activity
      launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2
      and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A 
      mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs 
      brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that
      is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which
      PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and
      impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation,
      conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in
      specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69
      phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and
      prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through
      which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly,
      highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and
      implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention
      in glioblastoma.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate regulates neurite initiation and dendrite
      morphogenesis via actin aggregation.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.13 [doi]
AB  - Neurite initiation is critical for neuronal morphogenesis and early neural
      circuit development. Recent studies showed that local actin aggregation
      underneath the cell membrane determined the site of neurite initiation. An
      immediately arising question is what signaling mechanism initiated actin
      aggregation. Here we demonstrate that local clustering of phosphatidylinositol
      3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), a phospholipid with relatively few known signaling 
      functions, is necessary and sufficient for aggregating actin and promoting
      neuritogenesis. In contrast, the related and more extensively studied
      phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol
      (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) molecules did not have such functions. Specifically,
      we showed that beads coated with PI(3,4)P2 promoted actin aggregation and neurite
      initiation, while pharmacological interference with PI(3,4)P2 synthesis inhibited
      both processes. PI(3,4)P2 clustering occurred even when actin aggregation was
      pharmacologically blocked, demonstrating that PI(3,4)P2 functioned as the
      upstream signaling molecule. Two enzymes critical for PI(3,4)P2 generation,
      namely, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase and class II
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha, were complementarily and non-redundantly
      required for actin aggregation and neuritogenesis, as well as for subsequent
      dendritogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
      protein and the Arp2/3 complex functioned downstream of PI(3,4)P2 to mediate
      neuritogenesis and dendritogenesis. Together, our results identify PI(3,4)P2 as
      an important signaling molecule during early development and demonstrate its
      critical role in regulating actin aggregation and neuritogenesis.

PG  - 161-162
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.4 [doi]
AB  - One of the key questions regarding macroautophagy/autophagy is the mechanism
      through which the transmembrane protein ATG9 functions in delivering membrane to 
      the expanding phagophore, the sequestering compartment that matures into an
      autophagosome. In a recent study, Zhou et al. identified a novel mechanism that
      regulates ATG9 trafficking from the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network,
      which involves two conserved sorting signals required for ATG9 interaction with
      the AP1/2 adaptor complex and phosphorylation of ATG9 at Tyr8 by SRC kinase and
      at Ser14 by ULK1 for proper function during basal and starvation-induced
      autophagy.

      successful generation of transgenic offspring.
PG  - 241-252
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.156 [doi]
AB  - Tree shrews have a close relationship to primates and have many advantages over
      rodents in biomedical research. However, the lack of gene manipulation methods
      has hindered the wider use of this animal. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have 
      been successfully expanded in culture to permit sophisticated gene editing in the
      mouse and rat. Here, we describe a culture system for the long-term expansion of 
      tree shrew SSCs without the loss of stem cell properties. In our study, thymus
      cell antigen 1 was used to enrich tree shrew SSCs. RNA-sequencing analysis
      revealed that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was active in
      undifferentiated SSCs, but was downregulated upon the initiation of SSC
      differentiation. Exposure of tree shrew primary SSCs to recombinant Wnt3a protein
      during the initial passages of culture enhanced the survival of SSCs. Use of tree
      shrew Sertoli cells, but not mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as feeder was found to 
      be necessary for tree shrew SSC proliferation, leading to a robust cell expansion
      and long-term culture. The expanded tree shrew SSCs were transfected with
      enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing lentiviral vectors. After
      transplantation into sterilized adult male tree shrew's testes, the EGFP-tagged
      SSCs were able to restore spermatogenesis and successfully generate transgenic
      offspring. Moreover, these SSCs were suitable for the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
      modification. The development of a culture system to expand tree shrew SSCs in
      combination with a gene editing approach paves the way for precise genome
      manipulation using the tree shrew.

TI  - WSB1 overcomes oncogene-induced senescence by targeting ATM for degradation.
PG  - 274-293
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.148 [doi]
AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) or apoptosis through the DNA-damage response is
      an important barrier of tumorigenesis. Overcoming this barrier leads to abnormal 
      cell proliferation, genomic instability, and cellular transformation, and finally
      allows cancers to develop. However, it remains unclear how the OIS barrier is
      overcome. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase WD repeat and SOCS
      box-containing protein 1 (WSB1) plays a role in overcoming OIS. WSB1 expression
      in primary cells helps the bypass of OIS, leading to abnormal proliferation and
      cellular transformation. Mechanistically, WSB1 promotes ATM ubiquitination,
      resulting in ATM degradation and the escape from OIS. Furthermore, we identify
      CDKs as the upstream kinase of WSB1. CDK-mediated phosphorylation activates WSB1 
      by promoting its monomerization. In human cancer tissue and in vitro models,
      WSB1-induced ATM degradation is an early event during tumorigenic progression. We
      suggest that WSB1 is one of the key players of early oncogenic events through ATM
      degradation and destruction of the tumorigenesis barrier. Our work establishes an
      important mechanism of cancer development and progression in premalignant
      lesions.

AB  - Transposons are generally kept silent by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA
      methylation. Here, we identified a pair of Harbinger transposon-derived proteins 
      (HDPs), HDP1 and HDP2, as anti-silencing factors in Arabidopsis. hdp1 and hdp2
      mutants displayed an enhanced silencing of transgenes and some transposons.
      Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HDP1 and HDP2 were co-domesticated from the
      Harbinger transposon-encoded transposase and DNA-binding protein, respectively.
      HDP1 interacts with HDP2 in the nucleus, analogous to their transposon
      counterparts. Moreover, HDP1 and HDP2 are associated with IDM1, IDM2, IDM3 and
      MBD7 that constitute a histone acetyltransferase complex functioning in DNA
      demethylation. HDP2 and the methyl-DNA-binding protein MBD7 share a large set of 
      common genomic binding sites, indicating that they jointly determine the target
      specificity of the histone acetyltransferase complex. Thus, our data revealed
      that HDP1 and HDP2 constitute a functional module that has been recruited to a
      histone acetyltransferase complex to prevent DNA hypermethylation and epigenetic 
      silencing.

TI  - Regulation of mATG9 trafficking by Src- and ULK1-mediated phosphorylation in
      basal and starvation-induced autophagy.
PG  - 184-201
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.146 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy requires diverse membrane sources and involves membrane trafficking of 
      mATG9, the only membrane protein in the ATG family. However, the molecular
      regulation of mATG9 trafficking for autophagy initiation remains unclear. Here we
      identified two conserved classic adaptor protein sorting signals within the
      cytosolic N-terminus of mATG9, which mediate trafficking of mATG9 from the plasma
      membrane and trans-Golgi network (TGN) via interaction with the AP1/2 complex.
      Src phosphorylates mATG9 at Tyr8 to maintain its endocytic and constitutive
      trafficking in unstressed conditions. In response to starvation, phosphorylation 
      of mATG9 at Tyr8 by Src and at Ser14 by ULK1 functionally cooperate to promote
      interactions between mATG9 and the AP1/2 complex, leading to redistribution of
      mATG9 from the plasma membrane and juxta-nuclear region to the peripheral pool
      for autophagy initiation. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of mATG9
      trafficking and suggest a coordination of basal and stress-induced autophagy.

TI  - The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Net1 facilitates the specification of
      dorsal cell fates in zebrafish embryos by promoting maternal beta-catenin
      activation.
PG  - 202-225
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.141 [doi]
AB  - Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for the initiation of dorsal-ventral
      patterning during vertebrate embryogenesis. Maternal beta-catenin accumulates in 
      dorsal marginal nuclei during cleavage stages, but its critical target genes
      essential for dorsalization are silent until mid-blastula transition (MBT). Here,
      we find that zebrafish net1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is
      specifically expressed in dorsal marginal blastomeres after MBT, and acts as a
      zygotic factor to promote the specification of dorsal cell fates. Loss- and
      gain-of-function experiments show that the GEF activity of Net1 is required for
      the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in zebrafish embryos and mammalian
      cells. Net1 dissociates and activates PAK1 dimers, and PAK1 kinase activation
      causes phosphorylation of S675 of beta-catenin after MBT, which ultimately leads 
      to the transcription of downstream target genes. In summary, our results reveal
      that Net1-regulated beta-catenin activation plays a crucial role in the dorsal
      axis formation during zebrafish development.

AB  - Chromatin remodeling is important for the epigenetic reprogramming of human
      primordial germ cells. However, the comprehensive chromatin state has not yet
      been analyzed for human fetal germ cells (FGCs). Here we use nucleosome occupancy
      and methylation sequencing method to analyze both the genome-wide chromatin
      accessibility and DNA methylome at a series of crucial time points during fetal
      germ cell development in both human and mouse. We find 116 887 and 137 557
      nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in human and mouse FGCs, covering a large set 
      of germline-specific and highly dynamic regulatory genomic elements, such as
      enhancers. Moreover, we find that the distal NDRs are enriched specifically for
      binding motifs of the pluripotency and germ cell master regulators such as NANOG,
      SOX17, AP2gamma and OCT4 in human FGCs, indicating the existence of a delicate
      regulatory balance between pluripotency-related genes and germ cell-specific
      genes in human FGCs, and the functional significance of these genes for germ cell
      development in vivo. Our work offers a comprehensive and high-resolution roadmap 
      for dissecting chromatin state transition dynamics during the epigenomic
      reprogramming of human and mouse FGCs.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene-engineered T cell therapy holds the
      potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with terminal 
      cancers. For decades, cancer therapy was based on biophysical parameters, with
      surgical resection to debulk, followed by radiation and chemotherapy to target
      the rapidly growing tumor cells, while mostly sparing quiescent normal tissues.
      One breakthrough occurred with allogeneic bone-marrow transplant for patients
      with leukemia, which provided a sometimes curative therapy. The field of adoptive
      cell therapy for solid tumors was established with the discovery that
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be expanded and used to treat and even cure 
      patients with metastatic melanoma. Tumor-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) were
      identified and engineered into patient peripheral blood lymphocytes, which were
      also found to treat tumors. However, these were limited by patient
      HLA-restriction. Close behind came generation of CAR, combining the exquisite
      recognition of an antibody with the effector function of a T cell. The advent of 
      CD19-targeted CARs for treating patients with multiple forms of advanced B-cell
      malignancies met with great success, with up to 95% response rates. Applying CAR 
      treatment to solid tumors, however, has just begun, but already certain factors
      have been made clear: the tumor target is of utmost importance for clinicians to 
      do no harm; and solid tumors respond differently to CAR therapy compared with
      hematologic ones. Here we review the state of clinical gene-engineered T cell
      immunotherapy, its successes, challenges, and future.

AB  - Harnessing the immune system to eradicate malignant cells is becoming a most
      powerful new approach to cancer therapy. FDA approval of the immunotherapy-based 
      drugs, sipuleucel-T (Provenge), ipilimumab (Yervoy, anti-CTLA-4), and more
      recently, the programmed cell death (PD)-1 antibody (pembrolizumab, Keytruda),
      for the treatment of multiple types of cancer has greatly advanced research and
      clinical studies in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, recent
      clinical trials, using NY-ESO-1-specific T cell receptor (TCR) or CD19-chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR), have shown promising clinical results for patients with
      metastatic cancer. Current success of cancer immunotherapy is built upon the work
      of cancer antigens and co-inhibitory signaling molecules identified 20 years ago.
      Among the large numbers of target antigens, CD19 is the best target for CAR T
      cell therapy for blood cancer, but CAR-engineered T cell immunotherapy does not
      yet work in solid cancer. NY-ESO-1 is one of the best targets for TCR-based
      immunotherapy in solid cancer. Despite the great success of checkpoint blockade
      therapy, more than 50% of cancer patients fail to respond to blockade therapy.
      The advent of new technologies such as next-generation sequencing has enhanced
      our ability to search for new immune targets in onco-immunology and accelerated
      the development of immunotherapy with potentially broader coverage of cancer
      patients. In this review, we will discuss the recent progresses of cancer
      immunotherapy and novel strategies in the identification of new immune targets
      and mutation-derived antigens (neoantigens) for cancer immunotherapy and
      immunoprecision medicine.

AB  - Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) factors have long been known in some wild
      plants, and also in some domesticated species, where they are used to produce
      plants to be used as maternal parents, for example to breed hybrids that display 
      hybrid vigor. Their origins have been mystifying, and now a study recently
      published in Cell Research helps understand how one widely-used rice CMS factor
      evolved.

AB  - Immunotherapy using dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination is an approved approach
      for harnessing the potential of a patient's own immune system to eliminate tumor 
      cells in metastatic hormone-refractory cancer. Overall, although many DC vaccines
      have been tested in the clinic and proven to be immunogenic, and in some cases
      associated with clinical outcome, there remains no consensus on how to
      manufacture DC vaccines. In this review we will discuss what has been learned
      thus far about human DC biology from clinical studies, and how current approaches
      to apply DC vaccines in the clinic could be improved to enhance anti-tumor
      immunity.

TI  - Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein reveal a
      prerequisite conformational state for receptor binding.
PG  - 119-129
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.152 [doi]
AB  - The global outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003 was caused by the infection of a new
      human coronavirus SARS-CoV. The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through 
      the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form
      trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain
      structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational
      states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1
      determined at 4.3 A resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three
      receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in "down"
      positions. The binding of the "down" CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not
      possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a
      receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8
      A resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the "down"
      position by different angles to an "up" position. The "up" CTD1 exposes the
      receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 
      represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also
      required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. 
      This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of
      the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the
      intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.

AB  - Approximately 12% of all cancers worldwide are associated with viral infections. 
      To date, eight viruses have been shown to contribute to the development of human 
      cancers, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B and C viruses, and Human
      papilloma virus, among others. These DNA and RNA viruses produce oncogenic
      effects through distinct mechanisms. First, viruses may induce sustained
      disorders of host cell growth and survival through the genes they express, or may
      induce DNA damage response in host cells, which in turn increases host genome
      instability. Second, they may induce chronic inflammation and secondary tissue
      damage favoring the development of oncogenic processes in host cells. Viruses
      like HIV can create a more permissive environment for cancer development through 
      immune inhibition, but we will focus on the previous two mechanisms in this
      review. Unlike traditional cancer therapies that cannot distinguish infected
      cells from non-infected cells, immunotherapies are uniquely equipped to target
      virus-associated malignancies. The targeting and functioning mechanisms
      associated with the immune response can be exploited to prevent viral infections 
      by vaccination, and can also be used to treat infection before cancer
      establishment. Successes in using the immune system to eradicate established
      malignancy by selective recognition of virus-associated tumor cells are currently
      being reported. For example, numerous clinical trials of adoptive transfer of ex 
      vivo generated virus-specific T cells have shown benefit even for established
      tumors in patients with EBV-associated malignancies. Additional studies in other 
      virus-associated tumors have also been initiated and in this review we describe
      the current status of immunotherapy for virus-associated malignancies and discuss
      future prospects.

PG  - 109-118
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.151 [doi]
AB  - FOXP3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress aberrant immune
      response against self-antigens, also suppress anti-tumor immune response.
      Infiltration of a large number of Treg cells into tumor tissues is often
      associated with poor prognosis. There is accumulating evidence that the removal
      of Treg cells is able to evoke and enhance anti-tumor immune response. However,
      systemic depletion of Treg cells may concurrently elicit deleterious
      autoimmunity. One strategy for evoking effective tumor immunity without
      autoimmunity is to specifically target terminally differentiated effector Treg
      cells rather than all FOXP3(+) T cells, because effector Treg cells are the
      predominant cell type in tumor tissues. Various cell surface molecules, including
      chemokine receptors such as CCR4, that are specifically expressed by effector
      Treg cells can be the candidates for depleting effector Treg cells by specific
      cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies. In addition, other immunological
      characteristics of effector Treg cells, such as their high expression of CTLA-4, 
      active proliferation, and apoptosis-prone tendency, can be exploited to control
      specifically their functions. For example, anti-CTLA-4 antibody may kill effector
      Treg cells or attenuate their suppressive activity. It is hoped that combination 
      of Treg-cell targeting (e.g., by reducing Treg cells or attenuating their
      suppressive activity in tumor tissues) with the activation of tumor-specific
      effector T cells (e.g., by cancer vaccine or immune checkpoint blockade) will
      make the current cancer immunotherapy more effective.

PG  - 96-108
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.149 [doi]
AB  - A pre-existing T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment has prognostic utility and 
      also can be predictive for response to contemporary cancer immunotherapies. The
      generation of a spontaneous T cell response against tumor-associated antigens
      depends on innate immune activation, which drives type I interferon (IFN)
      production. Recent work has revealed a major role for the STING pathway of
      cytosolic DNA sensing in this process. This cascade of events contributes to the 
      activation of Batf3-lineage dendritic cells (DCs), which appear to be central to 
      anti-tumor immunity. Non-T cell-inflamed tumors lack chemokines for Batf3 DC
      recruitment, have few Batf3 DCs, and lack a type I IFN gene signature, suggesting
      that failed innate immune activation may be the ultimate cause for lack of
      spontaneous T cell activation and accumulation. With this information in hand,
      new strategies for triggering innate immune activation and Batf3 DC recruitment
      are being developed, including novel STING agonists for de novo immune priming.
      Ultimately, the successful development of effective innate immune activators
      should expand the fraction of patients that can respond to immunotherapies, such 
      as with checkpoint blockade antibodies.

AB  - A recent study makes the surprising observation that autophagosomes can still
      form in the absence of the core conjugation machinery. Furthermore, while such
      autophagosomes can fuse with lysosomes, their degradation is delayed, and this is
      associated with delayed destruction of the inner autophagosomal double membrane, 
      highlighting a new role for proteins thought to act exclusively in the formation 
      of autophagosomes in late stages of the autophagic itinerary within
      autolysosomes.

TI  - Multi-step formation, evolution, and functionalization of new cytoplasmic male
      sterility genes in the plant mitochondrial genomes.
PG  - 130-146
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.115 [doi]
AB  - New gene origination is a major source of genomic innovations that confer
      phenotypic changes and biological diversity. Generation of new mitochondrial
      genes in plants may cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which can promote
      outcrossing and increase fitness. However, how mitochondrial genes originate and 
      evolve in structure and function remains unclear. The rice Wild Abortive type of 
      CMS is conferred by the mitochondrial gene WA352c (previously named WA352) and
      has been widely exploited in hybrid rice breeding. Here, we reconstruct the
      evolutionary trajectory of WA352c by the identification and analyses of 11
      mitochondrial genomic recombinant structures related to WA352c in wild and
      cultivated rice. We deduce that these structures arose through multiple
      rearrangements among conserved mitochondrial sequences in the mitochondrial
      genome of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon, coupled with substoichiometric shifting 
      and sequence variation. We identify two expressed but nonfunctional protogenes
      among these structures, and show that they could evolve into functional CMS genes
      via sequence variations that could relieve the self-inhibitory potential of the
      proteins. These sequence changes would endow the proteins the ability to interact
      with the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11, resulting in premature
      programmed cell death in the anther tapetum and male sterility. Furthermore, we
      show that the sequences that encode the COX11-interaction domains in these
      WA352c-related genes have experienced purifying selection during evolution. We
      propose a model for the formation and evolution of new CMS genes via a
      "multi-recombination/protogene formation/functionalization" mechanism involving
      gradual variations in the structure, sequence, copy number, and function.

AB  - Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER) is crucial for muscle contraction, cell growth, apoptosis, learning and
      memory. The trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels were recently
      identified as cation channels balancing the SR and ER membrane potentials, and
      are implicated in Ca(2+) signaling and homeostasis. Here we present the crystal
      structures of prokaryotic TRIC channels in the closed state and structure-based
      functional analyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic TRIC channels. Each trimer
      subunit consists of seven transmembrane (TM) helices with two inverted repeated
      regions. The electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical analyses revealed 
      that TRIC channels possess an ion-conducting pore within each subunit, and that
      the trimer formation contributes to the stability of the protein. The
      symmetrically related TM2 and TM5 helices are kinked at the conserved glycine
      clusters, and these kinks are important for the channel activity. Furthermore,
      the kinks of the TM2 and TM5 helices generate lateral fenestrations at each
      subunit interface. Unexpectedly, these lateral fenestrations are occupied with
      lipid molecules. This study provides the structural and functional framework for 
      the molecular mechanism of this ion channel superfamily.

TI  - Crystal structure of FabZ-ACP complex reveals a dynamic seesaw-like catalytic
      mechanism of dehydratase in fatty acid biosynthesis.
PG  - 1330-1344
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.136 [doi]
AB  - Fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is a vital process in cells. Fatty acids are
      essential for cell assembly and cellular metabolism. Abnormal FAS directly
      correlates with cell growth delay and human diseases, such as metabolic syndromes
      and various cancers. The FAS system utilizes an acyl carrier protein (ACP) as a
      transporter to stabilize and shuttle the growing fatty acid chain throughout
      enzymatic modules for stepwise catalysis. Studying the interactions between
      enzymatic modules and ACP is, therefore, critical for understanding the
      biological function of the FAS system. However, the information remains unclear
      due to the high flexibility of ACP and its weak interaction with enzymatic
      modules. We present here a 2.55 A crystal structure of type II FAS dehydratase
      FabZ in complex with holo-ACP, which exhibits a highly symmetrical FabZ
      hexamer-ACP3 stoichiometry with each ACP binding to a FabZ dimer subunit. Further
      structural analysis, together with biophysical and computational results, reveals
      a novel dynamic seesaw-like ACP binding and catalysis mechanism for the
      dehydratase module in the FAS system, which is regulated by a critical gatekeeper
      residue (Tyr100 in FabZ) that manipulates the movements of the beta-sheet layer. 
      These findings improve the general understanding of the dehydration process in
      the FAS system and will potentially facilitate drug and therapeutic design for
      diseases associated with abnormalities in FAS.

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
      (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems in bacteria and archaea provide adaptive
      immunity against invading foreign nucleic acids. Previous studies suggest that
      certain bacteria employ their Type II CRISPR-Cas systems to target their own
      genes, thus evading host immunity. However, whether other CRISPR-Cas systems have
      similar functions during bacterial invasion of host cells remains unknown. Here
      we identify a novel role for Type I CRISPR-Cas systems in evading host defenses
      in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14. The Type I CRISPR-Cas system of PA14
      targets the mRNA of the bacterial quorum-sensing regulator LasR to dampen the
      recognition by toll-like receptor 4, thus diminishing the pro-inflammatory
      responses of the host in cell and mouse models. Mechanistically, this
      nuclease-mediated RNA degradation requires a "5'-GGN-3'" recognition motif in the
      target mRNA, and HD and DExD/H domains in Cas3 of the Type I CRISPR-Cas system.
      As LasR and Type I CRISPR-Cas systems are ubiquitously present in bacteria, our
      findings elucidate an important common mechanism underlying bacterial virulence.

TI  - Structural basis for specific self-incompatibility response in Brassica.
PG  - 1320-1329
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.129 [doi]
AB  - Self-incompatibility (SI) is a widespread mechanism in flowering plants which
      prevents self-fertilization and inbreeding. In Brassica, recognition of the
      highly polymorphic S-locus cysteine-rich protein (SCR; or S-locus protein 11) by 
      the similarly polymorphic S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) dictates the SI
      specificity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of
      SRK9 (eSRK9) in complex with SCR9 from Brassica rapa. SCR9 binding induces eSRK9 
      homodimerization, forming a 2:2 eSRK:SCR heterotetramer with a shape like the
      letter "A". Specific recognition of SCR9 is mediated through three hyper-variable
      (hv) regions of eSRK9. Each SCR9 simultaneously interacts with hvI and one-half
      of hvII from one eSRK9 monomer and the other half of hvII from the second eSRK9
      monomer, playing a major role in mediating SRK9 homodimerization without
      involving interaction between the two SCR9 molecules. Single mutations of
      residues critical for the eSRK9-SCR9 interaction disrupt their binding in vitro. 
      Our study rationalizes a body of data on specific recognition of SCR by SRK and
      provides a structural template for understanding the co-evolution between SRK and
      SCR.

TI  - USP18 recruits USP20 to promote innate antiviral response through
      deubiquitinating STING/MITA.
PG  - 1302-1319
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.125 [doi]
AB  - STING (also known as MITA) mediates the innate antiviral signaling and
      ubiquitination of STING is key to its function. However, the deubiquitination
      process of STING is unclear. Here we report that USP18 recruits USP20 to
      deconjugate K48-linked ubiquitination chains from STING and promotes the
      stability of STING and the expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory
      cytokines after DNA virus infection. USP18 deficiency or knockdown of USP20
      resulted in enhanced K48-linked ubiquitination and accelerated degradation of
      STING, and impaired activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB as well as induction of
      downstream genes after infection with DNA virus HSV-1 or transfection of various 
      DNA ligands. In addition, Usp18(-/-) mice were more susceptible to HSV-1
      infection compared with the wild-type littermates. USP18 did not deubiquitinate
      STING in vitro but facilitated USP20 to catalyze deubiquitination of STING in a
      manner independent of the enzymatic activity of USP18. In addition,
      reconstitution of STING into Usp18(-/-) MEFs restored HSV-1-induced expression of
      downstream genes and cellular antiviral responses. Our findings thus uncover
      previously uncharacterized roles of USP18 and USP20 in mediating virus-triggered 
      signaling and contribute to the understanding of the complicated regulatory
      system of the innate antiviral responses.

TI  - Scaffolding protein Gab1 regulates myeloid dendritic cell migration in allergic
      asthma.
PG  - 1226-1241
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.124 [doi]
AB  - Asthma is a common allergic disorder involving a complex interplay among multiple
      genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies identified genetic variants of 
      human GAB1 as a novel asthma susceptibility factor. However, the functions of
      Gab1 in lung remain largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed an
      elevation of Gab1 level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatic
      patients during acute exacerbation compared with convalescence. Mice with a
      selectively disrupted Gab1 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) considerably
      attenuated allergic inflammation in experimental models of asthma. Further
      investigations revealed a prominent reduction in CCL19-mediated migration of
      Gab1-deficient mDCs to draining lymph nodes and subsequent impairment of
      Th2-driven adaptive activation. Mechanistically, Gab1 is an essential component
      of the CCL19/CCR7 chemokine axis that regulates mDC migration during asthmatic
      responses. Together, these findings provide the first evidence for the roles of
      Gab1 in lung, giving us deeper understanding of asthmatic pathogenesis.

TI  - Complex structure of the fission yeast SREBP-SCAP binding domains reveals an
      oligomeric organization.
PG  - 1197-1211
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.123 [doi]
AB  - Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors are
      master regulators of cellular lipid homeostasis in mammals and oxygen-responsive 
      regulators of hypoxic adaptation in fungi. SREBP C-terminus binds to the WD40
      domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which confers sterol
      regulation by controlling the ER-to-Golgi transport of the SREBP-SCAP complex and
      access to the activating proteases in the Golgi. Here, we biochemically and
      structurally show that the carboxyl terminal domains (CTD) of Sre1 and Scp1, the 
      fission yeast SREBP and SCAP, form a functional 4:4 oligomer and Sre1-CTD forms a
      dimer of dimers. The crystal structure of Sre1-CTD at 3.5 A and cryo-EM structure
      of the complex at 5.4 A together with in vitro biochemical evidence elucidate
      three distinct regions in Sre1-CTD required for Scp1 binding, Sre1-CTD
      dimerization and tetrameric formation. Finally, these structurally identified
      domains are validated in a cellular context, demonstrating that the proper 4:4
      oligomeric complex formation is required for Sre1 activation.

PG  - 1182-1196
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.118 [doi]
AB  - Neurons have a central role in the systemic coordination of mitochondrial
      unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and the cell non-autonomous modulation of
      longevity. However, the mechanism by which the nervous system senses
      mitochondrial stress and communicates to the distal tissues to induce UPR(mt)
      remains unclear. Here we employ the tissue-specific CRISPR-Cas9 approach to
      disrupt mitochondrial function only in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis
      elegans, and reveal a cell non-autonomous induction of UPR(mt) in peripheral
      cells. We further show that a neural sub-circuit composed of three types of
      sensory neurons, and one interneuron is required for sensing and transducing
      neuronal mitochondrial stress. In addition, neuropeptide FLP-2 functions in this 
      neural sub-circuit to signal the non-autonomous UPR(mt). Taken together, our
      results suggest a neuropeptide coordination of mitochondrial stress response in
      the nervous system.

TI  - Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 mediates prolonged prophase I arrest in female
      germ cells and is essential for female reproductive lifespan.
PG  - 1212-1225
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.119 [doi]
AB  - A unique feature of female germ cell development in mammals is their remarkably
      long arrest at the prophase of meiosis I, which lasts up to 50 years in humans.
      Both dormant and growing oocytes are arrested at prophase I and completely lack
      the ability to resume meiosis. Here, we show that the prolonged meiotic arrest of
      female germ cells is largely achieved via the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 
      (cyclin-dependent kinase 1). In two mouse models where we have introduced mutant 
      Cdk1(T14AY15F) which cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation (Cdk1AF) in small
      meiotically incompetent oocytes, the prophase I arrest is interrupted, leading to
      a premature loss of female germ cells. We show that in growing oocytes, Cdk1AF
      leads to premature resumption of meiosis with condensed chromosomes and germinal 
      vesicle breakdown followed by oocyte death, whereas in dormant oocytes, Cdk1AF
      leads to oocyte death directly, and both situations damage the ovarian reserve
      that maintains the female reproductive lifespan, which should be around 1 year in
      mice. Furthermore, interruption of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 results
      in DNA damage, which is accompanied by induction of the Chk2 (checkpoint kinase
      2)-p53/p63-dependent cell death pathway, which eventually causes global oocyte
      death. Together, our data demonstrate that the phosphorylation-mediated
      suppression of Cdk1 activity is one of the crucial factors that maintain the
      lengthy prophase arrest in mammalian female germ cells, which is essential for
      preserving the germ cell pool and reproductive lifespan in female mammals.

TI  - Turning rice meiosis into mitosis.
PG  - 1242-1254
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.117 [doi]
AB  - Introduction of clonal reproduction through seeds (apomixis) in crops has the
      potential to revolutionize agriculture by allowing self-propagation of any elite 
      variety, in particular F1 hybrids. In the sexual model plant Arabidopsis thaliana
      synthetic clonal reproduction through seeds can be artificially implemented by
      (i) combining three mutations to turn meiosis into mitosis (MiMe) and (ii)
      crossing the obtained clonal gametes with a line expressing modified CENH3 and
      whose genome is eliminated in the zygote. Here we show that additional
      combinations of mutations can turn Arabidopsis meiosis into mitosis and that a
      combination of three mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) efficiently turns meiosis
      into mitosis, leading to the production of male and female clonal diploid gametes
      in this major crop. Successful implementation of the MiMe technology in the
      phylogenetically distant eudicot Arabidopsis and monocot rice opens doors for its
      application to any flowering plant and paves the way for introducing apomixis in 
      crop species.

AB  - In a recent paper published in Cell, Matheoud et al. demonstrated that, in
      response to cellular stress, self-antigens can be extracted from mitochondria via
      mitochondrial-derived vesicles and presented at the cell surface to trigger an
      immune response; this pathway, termed mitochondrial antigen presentation (MitAP),
      is repressed by PINK1 and Parkin. These findings implicate autoimmune mechanisms 
      in Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Identification of TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion as a novel oncogenic driver in human lung
      squamous cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1149-1164
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.111 [doi]
AB  - Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the major subtypes of lung cancer.
      Our current knowledge of oncogenic drivers in this specific subtype of lung
      cancer is largely limited compared with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). Through exon
      array analyses, molecular analyses and functional studies, we here identify the
      TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion as a novel oncogenic driver in lung SCC. We found that this
      gene fusion occurs exclusively in lung SCC (3.1%, 5/163), but not in lung ADC
      (0/119). Through mechanistic studies, we further revealed that this TRA2B-DNAH5
      fusion promotes lung SCC malignant progression through regulating a
      SIRT6-ERK1/2-MMP1 signaling axis. We show that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation
      using selumetinib efficiently inhibits the growth of lung SCC with TRA2B-DNAH5
      fusion expression. These findings improve our current knowledge of oncogenic
      drivers in lung SCC and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for lung SCC
      patients with TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion.

LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.112 [doi]
AB  - The migration of cortical interneurons is a fundamental process for the
      establishment of cortical connectivity and its impairment underlies several
      neurological disorders. During development, these neurons are born in the
      ganglionic eminences and they migrate tangentially to populate the cortical
      layers. This process relies on various morphological changes that are driven by
      dynamic cytoskeleton remodelings. By coupling time lapse imaging with molecular
      analyses, we show that the Elongator complex controls cortical interneuron
      migration in mouse embryos by regulating nucleokinesis and branching dynamics. At
      the molecular level, Elongator fine-tunes actomyosin forces by regulating the
      distribution and turnover of actin microfilaments during cell migration. Thus, we
      demonstrate that Elongator cell-autonomously promotes cortical interneuron
      migration by controlling actin cytoskeletal dynamics.

      deprivation stress.
PG  - 1112-1130
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.109 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells are known for their capacity to rewire metabolic pathways to support
      survival and proliferation under various stress conditions. Ketone bodies, though
      produced in the liver, are not consumed in normal adult liver cells. We find here
      that ketone catabolism or ketolysis is re-activated in hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) cells under nutrition deprivation conditions. Mechanistically, 3-oxoacid
      CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), a rate-limiting ketolytic enzyme whose expression is
      suppressed in normal adult liver tissues, is re-induced by serum
      starvation-triggered mTORC2-AKT-SP1 signaling in HCC cells. Moreover, we observe 
      that enhanced ketolysis in HCC is critical for repression of AMPK activation and 
      protects HCC cells from excessive autophagy, thereby enhancing tumor growth.
      Importantly, analysis of clinical HCC samples reveals that increased OXCT1
      expression predicts higher patient mortality. Taken together, we uncover here a
      novel metabolic adaptation by which nutrition-deprived HCC cells employ ketone
      bodies for energy supply and cancer progression.

TI  - Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 in postnatal mice corrects PRKAG2 cardiac
      syndrome.
PG  - 1099-1111
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.101 [doi]
AB  - PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disease resulted from 
      mutations in the PRKAG2 gene that encodes gamma2 regulatory subunit of
      AMP-activated protein kinase. Affected patients usually develop ventricular
      tachyarrhythmia and experience progressive heart failure that is refractory to
      medical treatment and requires cardiac transplantation. In this study, we
      identify a H530R mutation in PRKAG2 from patients with familial
      Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. By generating H530R PRKAG2 transgenic and
      knock-in mice, we show that both models recapitulate human symptoms including
      cardiac hypertrophy and glycogen storage, confirming that the H530R mutation is
      causally related to PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome. We further combine adeno-associated 
      virus-9 (AAV9) and the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to disrupt the mutant
      PRKAG2 allele encoding H530R while leaving the wild-type allele intact. A single 
      systemic injection of AAV9-Cas9/sgRNA at postnatal day 4 or day 42 substantially 
      restores the morphology and function of the heart in H530R PRKAG2 transgenic and 
      knock-in mice. Together, our work suggests that in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome
      editing is an effective tool in the treatment of PRKAG2 cardiac syndrome and
      other dominant inherited cardiac diseases by selectively disrupting
      disease-causing mutations.

AB  - Vascular growth and remodeling are dependent on the generation of new endothelial
      cells from stem cells and the involvement of perivascular cells to maintain
      vessel integrity and function. The existence and cellular identity of vascular
      endothelial stem cells (VESCs) remain unclear. The perivascular pericytes in
      adult tissues are thought to arise from the recruitment and differentiation of
      mesenchymal progenitors during early development. In this study, we identified
      Protein C receptor-expressing (Procr(+)) endothelial cells as VESCs in multiple
      tissues. Procr(+) VESCs exhibit robust clonogenicity in culture, high vessel
      reconstitution efficiency in transplantation, long-term clonal expansion in
      lineage tracing, and EndMT characteristics. Moreover, Procr(+) VESCs are
      bipotent, giving rise to de novo formation of endothelial cells and pericytes.
      This represents a novel origin of pericytes in adult angiogenesis, reshaping our 
      understanding of blood vessel development and homeostatic process. Our study may 
      also provide a more precise therapeutic target to inhibit pathological
      angiogenesis and tumor growth.

TI  - Structural insights into Ca(2+)-activated long-range allosteric channel gating of
      RyR1.
PG  - 977-94
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.99 [doi]
AB  - Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a class of giant ion channels with molecular mass 
      over 2.2 mega-Daltons. These channels mediate calcium signaling in a variety of
      cells. Since more than 80% of the RyR protein is folded into the cytoplasmic
      assembly and the remaining residues form the transmembrane domain, it has been
      hypothesized that the activation and regulation of RyR channels occur through an 
      as yet uncharacterized long-range allosteric mechanism. Here we report the
      characterization of a Ca(2+)-activated open-state RyR1 structure by cryo-electron
      microscopy. The structure has an overall resolution of 4.9 A and a resolution of 
      4.2 A for the core region. In comparison with the previously determined
      apo/closed-state structure, we observed long-range allosteric gating of the
      channel upon Ca(2+) activation. In-depth structural analyses elucidated a novel
      channel-gating mechanism and a novel ion selectivity mechanism of RyR1. Our work 
      not only provides structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of channel
      gating and regulation of RyRs, but also sheds light on structural basis for
      channel-gating and ion selectivity mechanisms for the six-transmembrane-helix
      cation channel family.

TI  - Pyroptosis is driven by non-selective gasdermin-D pore and its morphology is
      different from MLKL channel-mediated necroptosis.
PG  - 1007-20
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.100 [doi]
AB  - Necroptosis and pyroptosis are two forms of programmed cell death with a common
      feature of plasma membrane rupture. Here we studied the morphology and mechanism 
      of pyroptosis in comparison with necroptosis. Different from necroptosis,
      pyroptosis undergoes membrane blebbing and produces apoptotic body-like cell
      protrusions (termed pyroptotic bodies) prior to plasma membrane rupture. The
      rupture in necroptosis is explosion-like, whereas in pyroptosis it leads to
      flattening of cells. It is known that the execution of necroptosis is mediated by
      mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) oligomers in the plasma membrane, whereas
      gasdermin-D (GSDMD) mediates pyroptosis after its cleavage by caspase-1 or
      caspase-11. We show that N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N) generated by
      caspase cleavage also forms oligomer and migrates to the plasma membrane to kill 
      cells. Both MLKL and GSDMD-N are lipophilic and the N-terminal sequences of both 
      proteins are important for their oligomerization and plasma membrane
      translocation. Unlike MLKL which forms channels on the plasma membrane that
      induces influx of selected ions which osmotically swell the cells to burst,
      GSDMD-N forms non-selective pores and does not rely on increased osmolarity to
      disrupt cells. Our study reveals the pore-forming activity of GSDMD and
      channel-forming activity of MLKL determine different ways of plasma membrane
      rupture in pyroptosis and necroptosis.

TI  - Ferroptosis is an autophagic cell death process.
PG  - 1021-32
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.95 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated necrosis. It is implicated in 
      various human diseases, including ischemic organ damage and cancer. Here, we
      report the crucial role of autophagy, particularly autophagic degradation of
      cellular iron storage proteins (a process known as ferritinophagy), in
      ferroptosis. Using RNAi screening coupled with subsequent genetic analysis, we
      identified multiple autophagy-related genes as positive regulators of
      ferroptosis. Ferroptosis induction led to autophagy activation and consequent
      degradation of ferritin and ferritinophagy cargo receptor NCOA4. Consistently,
      inhibition of ferritinophagy by blockage of autophagy or knockdown of NCOA4
      abrogated the accumulation of ferroptosis-associated cellular labile iron and
      reactive oxygen species, as well as eventual ferroptotic cell death. Therefore,
      ferroptosis is an autophagic cell death process, and NCOA4-mediated
      ferritinophagy supports ferroptosis by controlling cellular iron homeostasis.

      microcephaly.
PG  - 1048-61
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.93 [doi]
AB  - Gene editing in non-human primates may lead to valuable models for exploring the 
      etiologies and therapeutic strategies of genetically based neurological disorders
      in humans. However, a monkey model of neurological disorders that closely mimics 
      pathological and behavioral deficits in humans has not yet been successfully
      generated. Microcephalin 1 (MCPH1) is implicated in the evolution of the human
      brain, and MCPH1 mutation causes microcephaly accompanied by mental retardation. 
      Here we generated a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) carrying biallelic
      MCPH1 mutations using transcription activator-like effector nucleases. The monkey
      recapitulated most of the important clinical features observed in patients,
      including marked reductions in head circumference, premature chromosome
      condensation (PCC), hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and upper limb spasticity. 
      Moreover, overexpression of MCPH1 in mutated dermal fibroblasts rescued the PCC
      syndrome. This monkey model may help us elucidate the role of MCPH1 in the
      pathogenesis of human microcephaly and better understand the function of this
      protein in the evolution of primate brain size.

TI  - The Central domain of RyR1 is the transducer for long-range allosteric gating of 
      channel opening.
PG  - 995-1006
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.89 [doi]
AB  - The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular calcium channels responsible for
      rapid release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) to
      the cytoplasm, which is essential for the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling
      of cardiac and skeletal muscles. The near-atomic resolution structure of closed
      RyR1 revealed the molecular details of this colossal channel, while the
      long-range allosteric gating mechanism awaits elucidation. Here, we report the
      cryo-EM structures of rabbit RyR1 in three closed conformations at about 4 A
      resolution and an open state at 5.7 A. Comparison of the closed RyR1 structures
      shows a breathing motion of the cytoplasmic platform, while the channel domain
      and its contiguous Central domain remain nearly unchanged. Comparison of the open
      and closed structures shows a dilation of the S6 tetrahelical bundle at the
      cytoplasmic gate that leads to channel opening. During the pore opening, the
      cytoplasmic "O-ring" motif of the channel domain and the U-motif of the Central
      domain exhibit coupled motion, while the Central domain undergoes domain-wise
      displacement. These structural analyses provide important insight into the E-C
      coupling in skeletal muscles and identify the Central domain as the transducer
      that couples the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic platform to the gating
      of the central pore.

AB  - The loss of stem cells, through cell dysfunction or senescence, is thought to
      contribute to biological aging. Recently, Hongbo Zhang and colleagues have shown 
      that activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, a retrograde
      stress response, through administration with an NAD-raising compound, can
      rejuvenate stem cells and extend lifespan in mice.

TI  - Cortical neurons gradually attain a post-mitotic state.
PG  - 1033-47
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.76 [doi]
AB  - Once generated, neurons are thought to permanently exit the cell cycle and become
      irreversibly differentiated. However, neither the precise point at which this
      post-mitotic state is attained nor the extent of its irreversibility is clearly
      defined. Here we report that newly born neurons from the upper layers of the
      mouse cortex, despite initiating axon and dendrite elongation, continue to drive 
      gene expression from the neural progenitor tubulin alpha1 promoter (Talpha1p).
      These observations suggest an ambiguous post-mitotic neuronal state. Whole
      transcriptome analysis of sorted upper cortical neurons further revealed that
      neurons continue to express genes related to cell cycle progression long after
      mitotic exit until at least post-natal day 3 (P3). These genes are however
      down-regulated thereafter, associated with a concomitant up-regulation of tumor
      suppressors at P5. Interestingly, newly born neurons located in the cortical
      plate (CP) at embryonic day 18-19 (E18-E19) and P3 challenged with calcium influx
      are found in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and still able to undergo division 
      at E18-E19 but not at P3. At P5 however, calcium influx becomes neurotoxic and
      leads instead to neuronal loss. Our data delineate an unexpected flexibility of
      cell cycle control in early born neurons, and describe how neurons transit to a
      post-mitotic state.

TI  - Type V CRISPR-Cas Cpf1 endonuclease employs a unique mechanism for crRNA-mediated
      target DNA recognition.
PG  - 901-13
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.88 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cpf1 systems have been successfully harnessed for genome
      editing. In the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the preordered A-form RNA seed sequence and
      preformed protein PAM-interacting cleft are essential for Cas9 to form a DNA
      recognition-competent structure. Whether the CRISPR-Cpf1 system employs a similar
      mechanism for target DNA recognition remains unclear. Here, we have determined
      the crystal structure of Acidaminococcus sp. Cpf1 (AsCpf1) in complex with crRNA 
      and target DNA. Structural comparison between the AsCpf1-crRNA-DNA ternary
      complex and the recently reported Lachnospiraceae bacterium Cpf1 (LbCpf1)-crRNA
      binary complex identifies a unique mechanism employed by Cpf1 for target
      recognition. The seed sequence required for initial DNA interrogation is
      disordered in the Cpf1-cRNA binary complex, but becomes ordered upon ternary
      complex formation. Further, the PAM interacting cleft of Cpf1 undergoes an
      "open-to-closed" conformational change upon target DNA binding, which in turn
      induces structural changes within Cpf1 to accommodate the ordered A-form seed RNA
      segment. This unique mechanism of target recognition by Cpf1 is distinct from
      that reported previously for Cas9.

AB  - Necroptosis is a programmed, caspase-independent cell death that is
      morphologically similar to necrosis. TNF-induced necroptosis is mediated by
      receptor-interacting protein kinases, RIP1 and RIP3, and the mixed lineage kinase
      domain-like (MLKL). After being phosphorylated by RIP3, MLKL is translocated to
      the plasma membrane and mediates necroptosis. However, the execution of
      necroptosis and its role in inflammation and other cellular responses remain
      largely elusive. In this study, we report that MLKL-mediated activation of
      cell-surface proteases of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family
      promotes necroptosis, inflammation and cell migration. ADAMs are specifically
      activated at the early stage of necroptosis when MLKL is phosphorylated and
      translocated to the cell plasma membrane. Activation of ADAMs induces ectodomain 
      shedding of diverse cell-surface proteins including adhesion molecules,
      receptors, growth factors and cytokines. Importantly, the shedding of
      cell-surface proteins disrupts cell adhesion and accelerates necroptosis, while
      the soluble fragments of the cleaved proteins trigger the inflammatory responses.
      We also demonstrate that the shedding of E-cadherin ectodomain from necroptotic
      cells promotes cell migration. Thus, our study provides a novel mechanism of
      necroptosis-induced inflammation and new insights into the physiological and
      pathological functions of this unique form of cell death.

TI  - A high-resolution transcriptome map of cell cycle reveals novel connections
      between periodic genes and cancer.
PG  - 946-62
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.84 [doi]
AB  - Progression through the cell cycle is largely dependent on waves of periodic gene
      expression, and the regulatory networks for these transcriptome dynamics have
      emerged as critical points of vulnerability in various aspects of tumor biology. 
      Through RNA-sequencing of human cells during two continuous cell cycles (>2.3
      billion paired reads), we identified over 1 000 mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and
      pseudogenes with periodic expression. Periodic transcripts are enriched in
      functions related to DNA metabolism, mitosis, and DNA damage response, indicating
      these genes likely represent putative cell cycle regulators. Using our set of
      periodic genes, we developed a new approach termed "mitotic trait" that can
      classify primary tumors and normal tissues by their transcriptome similarity to
      different cell cycle stages. By analyzing >4 000 tumor samples in The Cancer
      Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other expression data sets, we found that mitotic trait
      significantly correlates with genetic alterations, tumor subtype and, notably,
      patient survival. We further defined a core set of 67 genes with robust periodic 
      expression in multiple cell types. Proteins encoded by these genes function as
      major hubs of protein-protein interaction and are mostly required for cell cycle 
      progression. The core genes also have unique chromatin features including
      increased levels of CTCF/RAD21 binding and H3K36me3. Loss of these features in
      uterine and kidney cancers is associated with altered expression of the core 67
      genes. Our study suggests new chromatin-associated mechanisms for periodic gene
      regulation and offers a predictor of cancer patient outcomes.

TI  - Ligand stimulation of CD95 induces activation of Plk3 followed by phosphorylation
      of caspase-8.
PG  - 914-34
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.78 [doi]
AB  - Upon interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand, sequential association of 
      the adaptor molecule FADD (MORT1), pro-forms of caspases-8/10, and the
      caspase-8/10 regulator c-FLIP leads to the formation of a death-inducing
      signaling complex. Here, we identify polo-like kinase (Plk) 3 as a new
      interaction partner of the death receptor CD95. The enzymatic activity of Plk3
      increases following interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand. Knockout
      (KO) or knockdown of caspase-8, CD95 or FADD prevents activation of Plk3 upon
      CD95 stimulation, suggesting a requirement of a functional DISC for Plk3
      activation. Furthermore, we identify caspase-8 as a new substrate for Plk3.
      Phosphorylation occurs on T273 and results in stimulation of caspase-8
      proapoptotic function. Stimulation of CD95 in cells expressing a
      non-phosphorylatable caspase-8-T273A mutant in a rescue experiment or in Plk3-KO 
      cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the processing of caspase-8 prominently.
      Low T273 phosphorylation correlates significantly with low Plk3 expression in a
      cohort of 95 anal tumor patients. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of kinase
      activation within the Plk family and propose a new model for the stimulation of
      the extrinsic death pathway in tumors with high Plk3 expression.

AB  - The autophagy-related process LC3-Associated Phagocytosis, or LAP, is known to
      control the degradation of engulfed cells and microorganisms. Now Martinez et al.
      discover that LAP controls immune responses to dying cells and its inhibition
      leads to development of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-like disease.

TI  - Grafting voltage and pharmacological sensitivity in potassium channels.
PG  - 935-45
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.57 [doi]
AB  - A classical voltage-gated ion channel consists of four voltage-sensing domains
      (VSDs). However, the roles of each VSD in the channels remain elusive. We
      developed a GVTDT (Graft VSD To Dimeric TASK3 channels that lack endogenous VSDs)
      strategy to produce voltage-gated channels with a reduced number of VSDs. TASK3
      channels exhibit a high host tolerance to VSDs of various voltage-gated ion
      channels without interfering with the intrinsic properties of the TASK3
      selectivity filter. The constructed channels, exemplified by the channels grafted
      with one or two VSDs from Kv7.1 channels, exhibit classical voltage sensitivity, 
      including voltage-dependent opening and closing. Furthermore, the grafted Kv7.1
      VSD transfers the potentiation activity of benzbromarone, an activator that acts 
      on the VSDs of the donor channels, to the constructed channels. Our study
      indicates that one VSD is sufficient to voltage-dependently gate the pore and
      provides new insight into the roles of VSDs.

TI  - Mea6 controls VLDL transport through the coordinated regulation of COPII
      assembly.
PG  - 787-804
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.75 [doi]
AB  - Lipid accumulation, which may be caused by the disturbance in very low density
      lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion in the liver, can lead to fatty liver disease. VLDL 
      is synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to Golgi apparatus
      for secretion into plasma. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for VLDL
      transport is still poorly understood. Here we show that hepatocyte-specific
      deletion of meningioma-expressed antigen 6 (Mea6)/cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma-associated antigen 5C (cTAGE5C) leads to severe fatty liver and
      hypolipemia in mice. Quantitative lipidomic and proteomic analyses indicate that 
      Mea6/cTAGE5 deletion impairs the secretion of different types of lipids and
      proteins, including VLDL, from the liver. Moreover, we demonstrate that
      Mea6/cTAGE5 interacts with components of the ER coat protein complex II (COPII)
      which, when depleted, also cause lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Our findings 
      not only reveal several novel factors that regulate lipid transport, but also
      provide evidence that Mea6 plays a critical role in lipid transportation through 
      the coordinated regulation of the COPII machinery.

TI  - MutSbeta promotes trinucleotide repeat expansion by recruiting DNA polymerase
      beta to nascent (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins for error-prone DNA synthesis.
PG  - 775-86
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.66 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of (CAG)*(CTG) repeats causes a number of familial neurodegenerative
      disorders. Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components 
      involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein
      MutSbeta (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG)*(CTG) repeat
      expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs,
      MutSbeta also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed
      within (CAG)n*(CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSbeta binding 
      triggers expansion of (CAG)*(CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that
      purified recombinant MutSbeta physically interacts with DNA polymerase beta
      (Polbeta) and stimulates Polbeta-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention.
      Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSbeta and Polbeta interact with
      each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG)*(CTG) repeats during DNA replication.
      Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins 
      by MutSbeta and Polbeta during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSbeta recognizes
      (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polbeta 
      to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension,
      leading to (CAG)*(CTG) repeat expansion. This study provides a novel mechanism
      for trinucleotide repeat expansion in both dividing and non-dividing cells.

TI  - RANKL/RANK control Brca1 mutation-driven mammary tumors.
PG  - 761-74
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.69 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common female cancer, affecting approximately one in
      eight women during their life-time. Besides environmental triggers and hormones, 
      inherited mutations in the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2 genes markedly
      increase the risk for the development of breast cancer. Here, using two different
      mouse models, we show that genetic inactivation of the key osteoclast
      differentiation factor RANK in the mammary epithelium markedly delayed onset,
      reduced incidence, and attenuated progression of Brca1;p53 mutation-driven
      mammary cancer. Long-term pharmacological inhibition of the RANK ligand RANKL in 
      mice abolished the occurrence of Brca1 mutation-driven pre-neoplastic lesions.
      Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of Rank or RANKL/RANK blockade impaired
      proliferation and expansion of both murine Brca1;p53 mutant mammary stem cells
      and mammary progenitors from human BRCA1 mutation carriers. In addition, genome
      variations within the RANK locus were significantly associated with risk of
      developing breast cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations. Thus, RANKL/RANK control 
      progenitor cell expansion and tumorigenesis in inherited breast cancer. These
      results present a viable strategy for the possible prevention of breast cancer in
      BRCA1 mutant patients.

TI  - CryoEM structure of yeast cytoplasmic exosome complex.
PG  - 822-37
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.56 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic multi-subunit RNA exosome complex plays crucial roles in 3'-to-5' 
      RNA processing and decay. Rrp6 and Ski7 are the major cofactors for the nuclear
      and cytoplasmic exosomes, respectively. In the cytoplasm, Ski7 helps the exosome 
      to target mRNAs for degradation and turnover via a through-core pathway. However,
      the interaction between Ski7 and the exosome complex has remained unclear. The
      transaction of RNA substrates within the exosome is also elusive. In this work,
      we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structures of the
      Ski7-exosome complex in RNA-free and RNA-bound forms at resolutions of 4.2 A and 
      5.8 A, respectively. These structures reveal that the N-terminal domain of Ski7
      adopts a structural arrangement and interacts with the exosome in a similar
      fashion to the C-terminal domain of nuclear Rrp6. Further structural analysis of 
      exosomes with RNA substrates harboring 3' overhangs of different length suggests 
      a switch mechanism of RNA-induced exosome activation in the through-core pathway 
      of RNA processing.

      in adult-born juxtaglomerular cells of the mouse olfactory bulb.
PG  - 805-21
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.55 [doi]
AB  - The behavior of adult-born cells can be easily monitored in cell culture or in
      lower model organisms, but longitudinal observation of individual mammalian
      adult-born cells in their native microenvironment still proves to be a challenge.
      Here we have established an approach named optical cell positioning system for
      long-term in vivo single-cell tracking, which integrates red-green-blue cell
      labeling with repeated angiography. By combining this approach with in vivo
      two-photon imaging technique, we characterized the in vivo migration patterns of 
      adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb. In contrast to the traditional view of 
      mere radial migration of adult-born cells within the bulb, we found that
      juxtaglomerular cells switch from radial migration to long distance lateral
      migration upon arrival in their destination layer. This unique long-distance
      lateral migration has characteristic temporal (stop-and-go) and spatial
      (migratory, unidirectional or multidirectional) patterns, with a clear cell
      age-dependent decrease in the migration speed. The active migration of adult-born
      cells coincides with the time period of initial fate determination and is likely 
      to impact on the integration sites of adult-born cells, their odor
      responsiveness, as well as their survival rate.

TI  - Gastric Lgr5(+) stem cells are the cellular origin of invasive intestinal-type
      gastric cancer in mice.
PG  - 838-49
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.47 [doi]
AB  - The cellular origin of gastric cancer remains elusive. Leucine-rich
      repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is the first identified
      marker of gastric stem cells. However, the role of Lgr5(+) stem cells in driving 
      malignant gastric cancer is not fully validated. Here, we deleted Smad4 and PTEN 
      in murine gastric Lgr5(+) stem cells by the inducible Cre-LoxP system and marked 
      mutant Lgr5(+) stem cells and their progeny with Cre-reporter Rosa26(tdTomato).
      Rapid onset and progression from microadenoma and macroscopic adenoma to invasive
      intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) were found in the gastric antrum with the
      loss of Smad4 and PTEN. In addition, invasive IGC developed at the murine
      gastro-forestomach junction, where a few Lgr5(+) stem cells reside. In contrast, 
      Smad4 and PTEN deletions in differentiated cells, including antral parietal
      cells, pit cells and corpus Lgr5(+) chief cells, failed to initiate tumor growth.
      Furthermore, mutant Lgr5(+) cells were involved in IGC growth and progression. In
      the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, an increase in LGR5 expression was
      manifested in the human IGC that occurred at the gastric antrum and
      gastro-esophageal junction. In addition, the concurrent deletion of SMAD4 and
      PTEN, as well as their reduced expression and deregulated downstream pathways,
      were associated with human IGC. Thus, we demonstrated that gastric Lgr5(+) stem
      cells were cancer-initiating cells and might act as cancer-propagating cells to
      contribute to malignant progression.

TI  - RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1 to 5, a group of LRR receptor-like kinases, are essential for 
      the perception of root meristem growth factor 1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 686-98
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.63 [doi]
AB  - RGF1, a secreted peptide hormone, plays key roles in root meristem development in
      Arabidopsis. Previous studies indicated that a functional RGF1 needs to be
      sulfated at a tyrosine residue by a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase and that RGF1
      regulates the root meristem activity mainly via two downstream transcription
      factors, PLETHORA 1 (PLT1) and PLT2. How extracellular RGF1 is perceived by a
      plant cell, however, is unclear. Using genetic approaches, we discovered a clade 
      of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, designated as RGF1 INSENSITIVE 1
      (RGI1) to RGI5, serving as receptors of RGF1. Two independent rgi1 rgi2 rgi3 rgi4
      rgi5 quintuple mutants display a consistent short primary root phenotype with a
      small size of meristem. An rgi1 rgi2 rgi3 rgi4 quadruple mutant shows a
      significantly reduced sensitivity to RGF1, and the quintuple mutant is completely
      insensitive to RGF1. The expression of PLT1 and PLT2 is almost undetectable in
      the quintuple mutant. Ectopic expression of PLT2 driven by an RGI2 promoter in
      the quintuple mutant greatly rescued its root meristem defects. One of the RGIs, 
      RGI1, was subsequently analyzed biochemically in detail. In vitro dot blotting
      and pull-down analyses indicated that RGI1 can physically interact with RGF1.
      Exogenous application of RGF1 can quickly and simultaneously induce the
      phosphorylation and ubiquitination of RGI1, indicating that RGI1 can perceive and
      transduce the RGF1 peptide signal. Yet, the activated RGI1 is likely turned over 
      rapidly. These results demonstrate that RGIs, acting as the receptors of RGF1,
      play essential roles in RGF1-PLT-mediated root meristem development in
      Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - Peptide-mediated cell-to-cell signaling has crucial roles in coordination and
      definition of cellular functions in plants. Peptide-receptor matching is
      important for understanding the mechanisms underlying peptide-mediated signaling.
      Here we report the structure-guided identification of root meristem growth factor
      (RGF) receptors important for plant development. An assay based on a signature
      ligand recognition motif (Arg-x-Arg) conserved in a subfamily of leucine-rich
      repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) identified the functionally uncharacterized
      LRR-RK At4g26540 as a receptor of RGF1 (RGFR1). We further solved the crystal
      structure of RGF1 in complex with the LRR domain of RGFR1 at a resolution of 2.6 
      A, which reveals that the Arg-x-Gly-Gly (RxGG) motif is responsible for specific 
      recognition of the sulfate group of RGF1 by RGFR1. Based on the RxGG motif, we
      identified additional four RGFRs. Participation of the five RGFRs in RGF-induced 
      signaling is supported by biochemical and genetic data. We also offer evidence
      showing that SERKs function as co-receptors for RGFs. Taken together, our study
      identifies RGF receptors and co-receptors that can link RGF signals with their
      downstream components and provides a proof of principle for structure-based
      matching of LRR-RKs with their peptide ligands.

      cortex development of offspring mice.
PG  - 645-54
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.58 [doi]
AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America coincided with a marked
      increase in microcephaly in newborns. However, the causal link between maternal
      ZIKV infection and malformation of the fetal brain has not been firmly
      established. Here we show a vertical transmission of ZIKV in mice and a marked
      effect on fetal brain development. We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
      of a contemporary ZIKV strain in pregnant mice led to the infection of radial
      glia cells (RGs) of dorsal ventricular zone of the fetuses, the primary neural
      progenitors responsible for cortex development, and caused a marked reduction of 
      these cortex founder cells in the fetuses. Interestingly, the infected fetal mice
      exhibited a reduced cavity of lateral ventricles and a discernable decrease in
      surface areas of the cortex. This study thus supports the conclusion that
      vertically transmitted ZIKV affects fetal brain development and provides a
      valuable animal model for the evaluation of potential therapeutic or preventative
      strategies.

AB  - Developing novel approaches to reverse the drug resistance of tumor-repopulating 
      cells (TRCs) or stem cell-like cancer cells is an urgent clinical need to improve
      outcomes of cancer patients. Here we show an innovative approach that reverses
      drug resistance of TRCs using tumor cell-derived microparticles (T-MPs)
      containing anti-tumor drugs. TRCs, by virtue of being more deformable than
      differentiated cancer cells, preferentially take up T-MPs that release anti-tumor
      drugs after entering cells, which in turn lead to death of TRCs. The underlying
      mechanisms include interfering with drug efflux and promoting nuclear entry of
      the drugs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tumor cell softness in
      uptake of T-MPs and effectiveness of a novel approach in reversing drug
      resistance of TRCs with promising clinical applications.

TI  - Cdh1 regulates craniofacial development via APC-dependent ubiquitination and
      activation of Goosecoid.
PG  - 699-712
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.51 [doi]
AB  - Craniofacial anomalies (CFAs) characterized by birth defects of skull and facial 
      bones are the most frequent congenital disease. Genomic analysis has identified
      multiple genes responsible for CFAs; however, the underlying genetic mechanisms
      for the majority of CFAs remain largely unclear. Our previous study revealed that
      the Wwp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase facilitates craniofacial development in part through
      inducing monoubiquitination and activation of the paired-like homeobox
      transcription factor, Goosecoid (Gsc). Here we report that Gsc is also
      ubiquitinated and activated by the APC(Cdh1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to
      transcriptional activation of various Gsc target genes crucial for craniofacial
      development. Consistenly, neural crest-specific Cdh1-knockout mice display
      similar bone malformation as Wwp2-deficient mice in the craniofacial region,
      characterized by a domed skull, a short snout and a twisted nasal bone.
      Mechanistically, like Wwp2-deficient mice, mice with Cdh1 deficiency in neural
      crest cells exhibit reduced Gsc/Sox6 transcriptional activities. Simultaneous
      deletion of Cdh1 and Wwp2 results in a more severe craniofacial defect compared
      with single gene deletion, suggesting a synergistic augmentation of Gsc activity 
      by these two E3 ubiquitin ligases. Hence, our study reveals a novel role for Cdh1
      in craniofacial development through promoting APC-dependent non-proteolytic
      ubiquitination and activation of Gsc.

      alpha7 receptor in hippocampus.
PG  - 728-42
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.48 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an autism
      spectrum disorder characterized by impaired social interactions, motor
      abnormalities, cognitive defects and a high risk of epilepsy. Here, we showed
      that conditional deletion of Mecp2 in cholinergic neurons caused part of RTT-like
      phenotypes, which could be rescued by re-expressing Mecp2 in the basal forebrain 
      (BF) cholinergic neurons rather than in the caudate putamen of conditional
      knockout (Chat-Mecp2(-/y)) mice. We found that choline acetyltransferase
      expression was decreased in the BF and that alpha7 nicotine acetylcholine
      receptor signaling was strongly impaired in the hippocampus of Chat-Mecp2(-/y)
      mice, which is sufficient to produce neuronal hyperexcitation and increase
      seizure susceptibility. Application of PNU282987 or nicotine in the hippocampus
      rescued these phenotypes in Chat-Mecp2(-/y) mice. Taken together, our findings
      suggest that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of cholinergic neurons and
      dysfunction of cholinergic neurons can contribute to numerous neuropsychiatric
      phenotypes.

TI  - CCAR1 5' UTR as a natural miRancer of miR-1254 overrides tamoxifen resistance.
PG  - 655-73
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.32 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) typically bind to unstructured miRNA-binding sites in target
      RNAs, leading to a mutual repression of expression. Here, we report that miR-1254
      interacts with structured elements in cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1
      (CCAR1) 5' untranslated region (UTR) and this interaction enhances the stability 
      of both molecules. miR-1254 can also act as a repressor when binding to
      unstructured sites in its targets. Interestingly, structured miR-1254-targeting
      sites act as both a functional RNA motif-sensing unit, and an independent RNA
      functional unit that enhances miR-1254 expression. Artificially designed miRNA
      enhancers, termed "miRancers", can stabilize and enhance the activity of miRNAs
      of interest. We further demonstrate that CCAR1 5' UTR as a natural miRancer of
      endogenous miR-1254 re-sensitizes tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells to
      tamoxifen. Thus, our study presents a novel model of miRNA function, wherein
      highly structured miRancer-like motif-containing RNA fragments or miRancer
      molecules specifically interact with miRNAs, leading to reciprocal stabilization.

      among CLE peptide-receptor pairs.

AB  - Plants can achieve amazing lifespans because of their continuous and repetitive
      formation of new organs by stem cells present within meristems. The balance
      between proliferation and differentiation of meristem cells is largely regulated 
      by the CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide hormones. One of the
      well-characterized CLE peptides, CLE41/TDIF (tracheary elements differentiation
      inhibitory factor), functions to suppress tracheary element differentiation and
      promote procambial cell proliferation, playing important roles in vascular
      development and wood formation. The recognition mechanisms of TDIF or other CLE
      peptides by their respective receptors, however, remain largely elusive. Here we 
      report the crystal structure of TDIF in complex with its receptor PXY, a
      leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). Our structure reveals that TDIF
      mainly adopts an "Omega"-like conformation binding to the inner surface of the
      LRR domain of PXY. Interaction between TDIF and PXY is predominately mediated by 
      the relatively conserved amino acids of TDIF. Structure-based sequence alignment 
      showed that the TDIF-interacting motifs are also conserved among other known CLE 
      receptors. Our data provide a structural template for understanding the
      recognition mechanism of CLE peptides by their receptors, offering an opportunity
      for the identification of receptors of other uncharacterized CLE peptides.

TI  - MLKL forms cation channels.
PG  - 517-28
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.26 [doi]
AB  - The mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein is a key factor in tumor
      necrosis factor-induced necroptosis. Recent studies on necroptosis execution
      revealed a commitment role of MLKL in membrane disruption. However, our knowledge
      of how MLKL functions on membrane remains very limited. Here we demonstrate that 
      MLKL forms cation channels that are permeable preferentially to Mg(2+) rather
      than Ca(2+) in the presence of Na(+) and K(+). Moreover, the N-terminal domain
      containing six helices (H1-H6) is sufficient to form channels. Using the
      substituted cysteine accessibility method, we further determine that helix H1,
      H2, H3, H5 and H6 are transmembrane segments, while H4 is located in the
      cytoplasm. Finally, MLKL-induced membrane depolarization and cell death exhibit a
      positive correlation to its channel activity. The Mg(2+)-preferred permeability
      and five transmembrane segment topology distinguish MLKL from previously
      identified Mg(2+)-permeable channels and thus establish MLKL as a novel class of 
      cation channels.

TI  - Positive selection rather than relaxation of functional constraint drives the
      evolution of vision during chicken domestication.
PG  - 556-73
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.44 [doi]
AB  - As noted by Darwin, chickens have the greatest phenotypic diversity of all birds,
      but an interesting evolutionary difference between domestic chickens and their
      wild ancestor, the Red Junglefowl, is their comparatively weaker vision. Existing
      theories suggest that diminished visual prowess among domestic chickens reflect
      changes driven by the relaxation of functional constraints on vision, but the
      evidence identifying the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for this
      change has not been definitively characterized. Here, a genome-wide analysis of
      the domestic chicken and Red Junglefowl genomes showed significant enrichment for
      positively selected genes involved in the development of vision. There were
      significant differences between domestic chickens and their wild ancestors
      regarding the level of mRNA expression for these genes in the retina. Numerous
      additional genes involved in the development of vision also showed significant
      differences in mRNA expression between domestic chickens and their wild
      ancestors, particularly for genes associated with phototransduction and
      photoreceptor development, such as RHO (rhodopsin), GUCA1A, PDE6B and NR2E3.
      Finally, we characterized the potential role of the VIT gene in vision, which
      experienced positive selection and downregulated expression in the retina of the 
      village chicken. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection, rather
      than relaxation of purifying selection, contributed to the evolution of vision in
      domestic chickens. The progenitors of domestic chickens harboring weaker vision
      may have showed a reduced fear response and vigilance, making them easier to be
      unconsciously selected and/or domesticated.

TI  - Towards a structural understanding of allosteric drugs at the human
      calcium-sensing receptor.
PG  - 574-92
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.36 [doi]
AB  - Drugs that allosterically target the human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) have
      substantial therapeutic potential, but are currently limited. Given the absence
      of high-resolution structures of the CaSR, we combined mutagenesis with a novel
      analytical approach and molecular modeling to develop an "enriched" picture of
      structure-function requirements for interaction between Ca(2+)o and allosteric
      modulators within the CaSR's 7 transmembrane (7TM) domain. An extended cavity
      that accommodates multiple binding sites for structurally diverse ligands was
      identified. Phenylalkylamines bind to a site that overlaps with a putative
      Ca(2+)o-binding site and extends towards an extracellular vestibule. In contrast,
      the structurally and pharmacologically distinct AC-265347 binds deeper within the
      7TM domains. Furthermore, distinct amino acid networks were found to mediate
      cooperativity by different modulators. These findings may facilitate the rational
      design of allosteric modulators with distinct and potentially pathway-biased
      pharmacological effects.

TI  - A positive role for polycomb in transcriptional regulation via H4K20me1.
PG  - 529-42
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.33 [doi]
AB  - The highly conserved polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain heritable
      transcription repression of the genes essential for development from fly to
      mammals. However, sporadic reports imply a potential role of PcGs in positive
      regulation of gene transcription, although systematic investigation of such
      function and the underlying mechanism has rarely been reported. Here, we report a
      Pc-mediated, H3K27me3-dependent positive transcriptional regulation of Senseless 
      (Sens), a key transcription factor required for development. Mechanistic studies 
      show that Pc regulates Sens expression by promoting H4K20me1 at the Sens locus.
      Further bioinformatic analysis at genome-wide level indicates that the existence 
      of H4K20me1 acts as a selective mark for positive transcriptional regulation by
      Pc/H3K27me3. Both the intensities and specific patterns of Pc and H3K27me3 are
      important for the fates of target gene transcription. Moreover, binding of
      transcription factor Broad (Br), which physically interacts with Pc and
      positively regulates the transcription of Sens, is observed in
      Pc(+)H3K27me3(+)H4K20me1(+) genes, but not in Pc(+)H3K27me3(+)H4K20me1(-) genes. 
      Taken together, our study reveals that, coupling with the transcription factor
      Br, Pc positively regulates transcription of Pc(+)H3K27me3(+)H4K20me1(+) genes in
      developing Drosophila wing disc.

TI  - Numb regulates vesicular docking for homotypic fusion of early endosomes via
      membrane recruitment of Mon1b.
PG  - 593-612
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.34 [doi]
AB  - Numb is an endocytic protein that plays crucial roles in diverse cellular
      processes such as asymmetric cell division, cell migration and differentiation.
      However, the molecular mechanism by which Numb regulates endocytic trafficking is
      poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Numb is a docking regulator for
      homotypic fusion of early endosomes (EEs). Numb depletion causes clustered but
      unfused EEs, which can be rescued by overexpressing cytosolic Numb 65 and Numb 71
      but not plasma membrane-attached Numb 66 or Numb 72. Time-lapse analysis reveals 
      that paired vesicles tend to tether but not fuse with each other in the absence
      of Numb. We further show that Numb binds to another docking regulator, Mon1b, and
      is required for the recruitment of cytosolic Mon1b to the EE membrane. Consistent
      with this, deletion of Mon1b causes similar defects in EE fusion. Our study thus 
      identifies a novel mechanism by which Numb regulates endocytic sorting by
      mediating EE fusion.

TI  - TRIM9 short isoform preferentially promotes DNA and RNA virus-induced production 
      of type I interferon by recruiting GSK3beta to TBK1.
PG  - 613-28
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.27 [doi]
AB  - Type I interferon (IFN) is an important component of antiviral innate immune
      signaling mediated by viral DNA and RNA recognition by the DNA sensor cGAS and
      RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5. Activation of these DNA and RNA sensors leads to the 
      recruitment of STING and MAVS, respectively, and converges on TANK-binding kinase
      1 (TBK1) signaling for subsequent phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3
      (IRF3). However, the mechanisms that control TBK1 activation are still poorly
      defined. Here, we identify tripartite motif 9 short isoform (TRIM9s) as a
      positive regulator in type I IFN signaling. Upon viral infection, TRIM9s
      undergoes Lys-63-linked auto-polyubiquitination and serves as a platform to
      bridge GSK3beta to TBK1, leading to the activation of IRF3 signaling.
      Interestingly, we found that TRIM9s selectively inhibits the production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, but enhances the expression of type I IFNs as well as
      IFN-stimulated genes, in response to viral infection. Our findings reveal novel
      dual functions of TRIM9s in antiviral immunity, which serve to balance
      pro-inflammatory response and production of type I IFNs.

PG  - 441-56
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.38 [doi]
AB  - Conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) to 
      cellular proteins are highly regulated processes integral to cellular
      homeostasis. Most often, the C-termini of these small polypeptides are attached
      to lysine side chains of target proteins by an amide (isopeptide) linkage.
      Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and Ubl-specific proteases (ULPs) comprise a
      diverse group of proteases that recognize and remove ubiquitin and Ubls from
      their substrates. How DUBs and ULPs distinguish among different modifiers, or
      different polymeric forms of these modifiers, remains poorly understood. The
      specificity of ubiquitin/Ubl-deconjugating enzymes for particular substrates
      depends on multiple factors, ranging from the topography of specific substrate
      features, as in different polyubiquitin chain types, to structural elements
      unique to each enzyme. Here we summarize recent structural and biochemical
      studies that provide insights into mechanisms of substrate specificity among
      various DUBs and ULPs. We also discuss the unexpected specificities of
      non-eukaryotic proteases in these families.

TI  - Ubiquitin signaling in immune responses.
PG  - 457-83
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.40 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitination has emerged as a crucial mechanism that regulates signal
      transduction in diverse biological processes, including different aspects of
      immune functions. Ubiquitination regulates pattern-recognition receptor signaling
      that mediates both innate immune responses and dendritic cell maturation required
      for initiation of adaptive immune responses. Ubiquitination also regulates the
      development, activation, and differentiation of T cells, thereby maintaining
      efficient adaptive immune responses to pathogens and immunological tolerance to
      self-tissues. Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination is a reversible reaction
      tightly controlled by the opposing actions of ubiquitin ligases and
      deubiquitinases. Deregulated ubiquitination events are associated with
      immunological disorders, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Ubiquitin modifications.
PG  - 399-422
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.39 [doi]
AB  - Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic multifaceted post-translational modification 
      involved in nearly all aspects of eukaryotic biology. Once attached to a
      substrate, the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is subjected to further
      modifications, creating a multitude of distinct signals with distinct cellular
      outcomes, referred to as the 'ubiquitin code'. Ubiquitin can be ubiquitinated on 
      seven lysine (Lys) residues or on the N-terminus, leading to polyubiquitin chains
      that can encompass complex topologies. Alternatively or in addition, ubiquitin
      Lys residues can be modified by ubiquitin-like molecules (such as SUMO or NEDD8).
      Finally, ubiquitin can also be acetylated on Lys, or phosphorylated on Ser, Thr
      or Tyr residues, and each modification has the potential to dramatically alter
      the signaling outcome. While the number of distinctly modified ubiquitin species 
      in cells is mind-boggling, much progress has been made to characterize the roles 
      of distinct ubiquitin modifications, and many enzymes and receptors have been
      identified that create, recognize or remove these ubiquitin modifications. We
      here provide an overview of the various ubiquitin modifications present in cells,
      and highlight recent progress on ubiquitin chain biology. We then discuss the
      recent findings in the field of ubiquitin acetylation and phosphorylation, with a
      focus on Ser65-phosphorylation and its role in mitophagy and Parkin activation.

AB  - Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are the central players in the trio of
      enzymes responsible for the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to cellular proteins.
      Humans have approximately 40 E2s that are involved in the transfer of Ub or
      Ub-like (Ubl) proteins (e.g., SUMO and NEDD8). Although the majority of E2s are
      only twice the size of Ub, this remarkable family of enzymes performs a variety
      of functional roles. In this review, we summarize common functional and
      structural features that define unifying themes among E2s and highlight emerging 
      concepts in the mechanism and regulation of E2s.

AB  - Dynamic modulation of protein levels is tightly controlled in response to
      physiological cues. In mammalian cells, much of the protein degradation is
      carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Similar to kinases,
      components of the ubiquitin system are often dysregulated, leading to a variety
      of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, making them attractive drug 
      targets. However, so far there are only a handful of drugs targeting the
      ubiquitin system that have been approved by the FDA. Here, we review possible
      therapeutic intervention nodes in the ubiquitin system, analyze the challenges,
      and highlight the most promising strategies to target the UPS.

TI  - Bacteria-host relationship: ubiquitin ligases as weapons of invasion.
PG  - 499-510
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.30 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic cells utilize the ubiquitin (Ub) system for maintaining a balanced
      functioning of cellular pathways. Although the Ub system is exclusive to
      eukaryotes, prokaryotic bacteria have developed an armory of Ub ligase enzymes
      that are capable of employing the Ub systems of various hosts, ranging from plant
      to animal cells. These enzymes have been acquired through the evolution and can
      be classified into three main classes, RING (really interesting new gene), HECT
      (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) and NEL (novel E3 ligases). In this
      review we describe the roles played by different classes of bacterial Ub ligases 
      in infection and pathogenicity. We also provide an overview of the different
      mechanisms by which bacteria mimic specific components of the host Ub system and 
      outline the gaps in our current understanding of their functions. Additionally,
      we discuss approaches and experimental tools for validating this class of enzymes
      as potential novel antibacterial therapy targets.

TI  - Mex3B: a coreceptor to present dsRNA to TLR3.
PG  - 391-2
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.29 [doi]
AB  - Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the early innate immune
      response to invading pathogens by sensing microorganisms; a number of accessory
      molecules have been shown to assist microbial recognition by TLRs. In a recent
      paper in Cell Research, Yang et al. demonstrate that Mex3B is associated with
      TLR3 in the endosomes and promotes dsRNA binding and proteolytic processing of
      TLR3, suggesting that Mex3B acts as a coreceptor of TLR3 in response to dsRNA.

AB  - Non-genetic inheritance is an evocative topic; in the past few years, the debate 
      around potential inheritance of life-time experiences independent of social
      factors in mammals has become highly prominent due to increasing evidence for
      phenotypes in the offspring after paternal environmental exposures. Strikingly,
      two independent studies published in Science newly implicate a special class of
      RNA, transfer RNA fragments, in the intergenerational effects of paternal dietary
      intervention.

TI  - Oocyte-expressed yes-associated protein is a key activator of the early zygotic
      genome in mouse.
PG  - 275-87
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.20 [doi]
AB  - In early mammalian embryos, the genome is transcriptionally quiescent until the
      zygotic genome activation (ZGA) which occurs 2-3 days after fertilization.
      Despite a long-standing effort, maternal transcription factors regulating this
      crucial developmental event remain largely elusive. Here, using maternal and
      paternal mouse models of Yap1 deletion, we show that maternally accumulated
      yes-associated protein (YAP) in oocyte is essential for ZGA. Maternal
      Yap1-knockout embryos exhibit a prolonged two-cell stage and develop into the
      four-cell stage at a much slower pace than the wild-type controls. Transcriptome 
      analyses identify YAP target genes in early blastomeres; two of which, Rpl13 and 
      Rrm2, are required to mediate maternal YAP's effect in conferring developmental
      competence on preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, the physiological YAP
      activator, lysophosphatidic acid, can substantially improve early development of 
      wild-type, but not maternal Yap1-knockout embryos in both oviduct and culture.
      These observations provide insights into the mechanisms of ZGA, and suggest
      potentials of YAP activators in improving the developmental competence of
      cultured embryos in assisted human reproduction and animal biotechnology.

TI  - saRNA-guided Ago2 targets the RITA complex to promoters to stimulate
      transcription.
PG  - 320-35
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.22 [doi]
AB  - Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) targeting specific promoter regions are able to
      stimulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon known as RNA
      activation (RNAa). It is known that RNAa depends on Ago2 and is associated with
      epigenetic changes at the target promoters. However, the precise molecular
      mechanism of RNAa remains elusive. Using human CDKN1A (p21) as a model gene, we
      characterized the molecular nature of RNAa. We show that saRNAs guide Ago2 to and
      associate with target promoters. saRNA-loaded Ago2 facilitates the assembly of an
      RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex, which, in addition to
      saRNA-Ago2 complex, includes RHA and CTR9, the latter being a component of the
      PAF1 complex. RITA interacts with RNA polymerase II to stimulate transcription
      initiation and productive elongation, accompanied by monoubiquitination of
      histone 2B. Our results establish the existence of a cellular RNA-guided
      genome-targeting and transcriptional activation mechanism and provide important
      new mechanistic insights into the RNAa process.

TI  - Single-cell triple omics sequencing reveals genetic, epigenetic, and
      transcriptomic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinomas.
PG  - 304-19
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.23 [doi]
AB  - Single-cell genome, DNA methylome, and transcriptome sequencing methods have been
      separately developed. However, to accurately analyze the mechanism by which
      transcriptome, genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic methods
      need to be performed in the same single cell. Here we demonstrate a single-cell
      triple omics sequencing technique, scTrio-seq, that can be used to simultaneously
      analyze the genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), DNA methylome, and
      transcriptome of an individual mammalian cell. We show that large-scale CNVs
      cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost
      genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in
      these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells
      derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two
      subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome 
      of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex
      contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic
      heterogeneity within a population of cells.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that leukocytes dynamically regulate cancer
      progression and metastasis, and among leukocytes, granulocytic cells abundantly
      accumulate in metastatic organs; however, their function in metastasis remains
      controversial. In a recent report in Nature, Wculek and Malanchi clarify the role
      of mature neutrophils as mediators of metastatic initiation and provide a
      targeted approach to prevent the pro-metastatic activity of neutrophils in breast
      cancer models.

TI  - The RNA-binding protein Mex3B is a coreceptor of Toll-like receptor 3 in innate
      antiviral response.
PG  - 288-303
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.16 [doi]
AB  - Recognition of viral dsRNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) leads to induction of
      interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, and innate antiviral response. 
      Here we identified the RNA-binding protein Mex3B as a positive regulator of
      TLR3-mediated signaling by expression cloning screens. Cells from Mex3b(-/-) mice
      exhibited reduced production of IFN-beta in response to the dsRNA analog
      poly(I:C) but not infection with RNA viruses. Mex3b(-/-) mice injected with
      poly(I:C) was more resistant to poly(I:C)-induced death. Mex3B was associated
      with TLR3 in the endosomes. It bound to dsRNA and increased the dsRNA-binding
      activity of TLR3. Mex3B also promoted the proteolytic processing of TLR3, which
      is critical for its activation. Mutants of Mex3B lacking its RNA-binding activity
      inhibited TLR3-mediated IFN-beta induction. These findings suggest that Mex3B
      acts as a coreceptor of TLR3 in innate antiviral response.

TI  - Cooperative autoinhibition and multi-level activation mechanisms of calcineurin.
PG  - 336-49
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.14 [doi]
AB  - The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), a
      heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit A and an essential regulatory subunit
      B, plays critical functions in various cellular processes such as cardiac
      hypertrophy and T cell activation. It is the target of the most widely used
      immunosuppressants for transplantation, tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporin A.
      However, the structure of a large part of the CNA regulatory region remains to be
      determined, and there has been considerable debate concerning the regulation of
      CN activity. Here, we report the crystal structure of full-length CN (beta
      isoform), which revealed a novel autoinhibitory segment (AIS) in addition to the 
      well-known autoinhibitory domain (AID). The AIS nestles in a hydrophobic
      intersubunit groove, which overlaps the recognition site for substrates and
      immunosuppressant-immunophilin complexes. Indeed, disruption of this AIS
      interaction results in partial stimulation of CN activity. More importantly, our 
      biochemical studies demonstrate that calmodulin does not remove AID from the
      active site, but only regulates the orientation of AID with respect to the
      catalytic core, causing incomplete activation of CN. Our findings challenge the
      current model for CN activation, and provide a better understanding of molecular 
      mechanisms of CN activity regulation.

AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also known as the mechanistic target of
      rapamycin, is a central cell growth regulating kinase that forms large molecular 
      complexes in all eukaryotic cells. A paper recently published in Science reports 
      the architecture of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and provides molecular insights into 
      the regulation and substrate selectivity of mTORC1.

TI  - The kinase activity of PKR represses inflammasome activity.
PG  - 367-79
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.11 [doi]
AB  - The protein kinase R (PKR) functions in the antiviral response by controlling
      protein translation and inflammatory cell signaling pathways. We generated a
      transgenic, knock-in mouse in which the endogenous PKR is expressed with a point 
      mutation that ablates its kinase activity. This novel animal allows us to probe
      the kinase-dependent and -independent functions of PKR. We used this animal
      together with a previously generated transgenic mouse that is ablated for PKR
      expression to determine the role of PKR in regulating the activity of the
      cryopyrin inflammasome. Our data demonstrate that, in contradiction to earlier
      reports, PKR represses cryopyrin inflammasome activity. We demonstrate that this 
      control is mediated through the established function of PKR to inhibit protein
      translation of constituents of the inflammasome to prevent initial priming during
      innate immune signaling. These findings identify an important role for PKR to
      dampen inflammation during the innate immune response and caution against the
      previously proposed therapeutic strategy to inhibit PKR to treat inflammation.

TI  - Pluripotency-associated miR-290/302 family of microRNAs promote the dismantling
      of naive pluripotency.
PG  - 350-66
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.2 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanism controlling the dismantling of naive pluripotency is
      poorly understood. Here we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles
      during naive to primed pluripotency transition. Dgcr8(-/-) embryonic stem cells
      (ESCs) failed to completely silence the naive pluripotency program, as well as to
      establish the primed pluripotency program during differentiation. miRNA profiling
      revealed that expression levels of a large number of miRNAs changed dynamically
      and rapidly during naive to primed pluripotency transition. Furthermore, a miRNA 
      screen identified numerous miRNAs promoting naive to primed pluripotency
      transition. Unexpectedly, multiple miRNAs from miR-290 and miR-302 clusters,
      previously shown as pluripotency-promoting miRNAs, demonstrated the strongest
      effects in silencing naive pluripotency. Knockout of both miR-290 and miR-302
      clusters but not either alone blocked the silencing of naive pluripotency
      program. Mechanistically, the miR-290/302 family of miRNAs may facilitate the
      exit of naive pluripotency in part by promoting the activity of MEK pathway and
      through directly repressing Akt1. Our study reveals miRNAs as an important class 
      of regulators potentiating ESCs to transition from naive to primed pluripotency, 
      and uncovers context-dependent functions of the miR-290/302 family of miRNAs at
      different developmental stages.

TI  - Comprehensive profiling reveals mechanisms of SOX2-mediated cell fate
      specification in human ESCs and NPCs.
PG  - 171-89
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.15 [doi]
AB  - SOX2 is a key regulator of multiple types of stem cells, especially embryonic
      stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Understanding the mechanism
      underlying the function of SOX2 is of great importance for realizing the full
      potential of ESCs and NPCs. Here, through genome-wide comparative studies, we
      show that SOX2 executes its distinct functions in human ESCs (hESCs) and
      hESC-derived NPCs (hNPCs) through cell type- and stage-dependent transcription
      programs. Importantly, SOX2 suppresses non-neural lineages in hESCs and regulates
      neurogenesis from hNPCs by inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. In hESCs, SOX2
      achieves such inhibition by direct transcriptional regulation of important Wnt
      signaling modulators, WLS and SFRP2. Moreover, SOX2 ensures pluripotent
      epigenetic landscapes via interacting with histone variant H2A.Z and recruiting
      polycomb repressor complex 2 to poise developmental genes in hESCs. Together, our
      results advance our understanding of the mechanism by which cell type-specific
      transcription factors control lineage-specific gene expression programs and
      specify cell fate.

      nuclear transfer, cell fusion or genetic manipulation. Two recent papers from
      Hongkui Deng's group now show various cell types can be reprogrammed simply by

      streak-like mesendoderm induced by Yamanaka factors.

TI  - Cross-kingdom inhibition of breast cancer growth by plant miR159.
PG  - 217-28
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.13 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression, and exert
      extensive impacts on development, physiology, and disease of eukaryotes. A high
      degree of parallelism is found in the molecular basis of miRNA biogenesis and
      action in plants and animals. Recent studies interestingly suggest a potential
      cross-kingdom action of plant-derived miRNAs, through dietary intake, in
      regulating mammalian gene expression. Although the source and scope of plant
      miRNAs detected in mammalian specimens remain controversial, these initial
      studies inspired us to determine whether plant miRNAs can be detected in Western 
      human sera and whether these plant miRNAs are able to influence gene expression
      and cellular processes related to human diseases such as cancer. Here we found
      that Western donor sera contained the plant miRNA miR159, whose abundance in the 
      serum was inversely correlated with breast cancer incidence and progression in
      patients. In human sera, miR159 was predominantly detected in the extracellular
      vesicles, and was resistant to sodium periodate oxidation suggesting the
      plant-originated 2'-O-methylation on the 3' terminal ribose. In breast cancer
      cells but not non-cancerous mammary epithelial cells, a synthetic mimic of miR159
      was capable of inhibiting proliferation by targeting TCF7 that encodes a Wnt
      signaling transcription factor, leading to a decrease in MYC protein levels. Oral
      administration of miR159 mimic significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft
      breast tumors in mice. These results demonstrate for the first time that a plant 
      miRNA can inhibit cancer growth in mammals.

TI  - SIRT6 safeguards human mesenchymal stem cells from oxidative stress by
      coactivating NRF2.
PG  - 190-205
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.4 [doi]
AB  - SIRT6 belongs to the mammalian homologs of Sir2 histone NAD(+)-dependent
      deacylase family. In rodents, SIRT6 deficiency leads to aging-associated
      degeneration of mesodermal tissues. It remains unknown whether human SIRT6 has a 
      direct role in maintaining the homeostasis of mesodermal tissues. To this end, we
      generated SIRT6 knockout human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by targeted gene
      editing. SIRT6-deficient hMSCs exhibited accelerated functional decay, a feature 
      distinct from typical premature cellular senescence. Rather than compromised
      chromosomal stability, SIRT6-null hMSCs were predominately characterized by
      dysregulated redox metabolism and increased sensitivity to the oxidative stress. 
      In addition, we found SIRT6 in a protein complex with both nuclear factor
      erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and RNA polymerase II, which was required for
      the transactivation of NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase
      1 (HO-1). Overexpression of HO-1 in SIRT6-null hMSCs rescued premature cellular
      attrition. Our study uncovers a novel function of SIRT6 in maintaining hMSC
      homeostasis by serving as a NRF2 coactivator, which represents a new layer of
      regulation of oxidative stress-associated stem cell decay.

AB  - Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening illness. The extracorporeal
      cell-based bioartificial liver (BAL) system could bridge liver transplantation
      and facilitate liver regeneration for ALF patients by providing metabolic
      detoxification and synthetic functions. Previous BAL systems, based on hepatoma
      cells and non-human hepatocytes, achieved limited clinical advances, largely due 
      to poor hepatic functions, cumbersome preparation or safety concerns of these
      cells. We previously generated human functional hepatocytes by lineage conversion
      (hiHeps). Here, by improving functional maturity of hiHeps and producing hiHeps
      at clinical scales (3 billion cells), we developed a hiHep-based BAL system
      (hiHep-BAL). In a porcine ALF model, hiHep-BAL treatment restored liver
      functions, corrected blood levels of ammonia and bilirubin, and prolonged
      survival. Importantly, human albumin and alpha-1-antitrypsin were detectable in
      hiHep-BAL-treated ALF pigs. Moreover, hiHep-BAL treatment led to attenuated liver
      damage, resolved inflammation and enhanced liver regeneration. Our findings
      indicate a promising clinical application of the hiHep-BAL system.

TI  - The transcriptional regulator network of human inflammatory macrophages is
      defined by open chromatin.
PG  - 151-70
LID - 10.1038/cr.2016.1 [doi]
AB  - Differentiation of inflammatory macrophages from monocytes is characterized by an
      orderly integration of epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
      guided by lineage-determining transcription factors such as PU.1. Further
      activation of macrophages leads to a stimulus- or microenvironment-specific
      signal integration with subsequent transcriptional control established by the
      action of tissue- or signal-associated transcription factors. Here, we assess
      four histone modifications during human macrophage activation and integrate this 
      information with the gene expression data from 28 different macrophage activation
      conditions in combination with GM-CSF. Bioinformatically, for inflammatory
      macrophages we define a unique network of transcriptional and epigenetic
      regulators (TRs), which was characterized by accessible promoters independent of 
      the activation signal. In contrast to the general accessibility of promoters of
      TRs, mRNA expression of central TRs belonging to the TR network displayed
      stimulus-specific expression patterns, indicating a second level of
      transcriptional regulation beyond epigenetic chromatin changes. In contrast,
      stringent integration of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation was observed
      in networks of TRs established from somatic tissues and tissue macrophages. In
      these networks, clusters of TRs with permissive histone marks were associated
      with high gene expression whereas clusters with repressive chromatin marks were
      associated with absent gene expression. Collectively, these results support that 
      macrophage activation during inflammation in contrast to lineage determination is
      mainly regulated transcriptionally by a pre-defined TR network.

TI  - NudC regulates actin dynamics and ciliogenesis by stabilizing cofilin 1.
PG  - 239-53
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.152 [doi]
AB  - Emerging data indicate that actin dynamics is associated with ciliogenesis.
      However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we find that nuclear
      distribution gene C (NudC), an Hsp90 co-chaperone, is required for actin
      organization and dynamics. Depletion of NudC promotes cilia elongation and
      increases the percentage of ciliated cells. Further results show that NudC binds 
      to and stabilizes cofilin 1, a key regulator of actin dynamics. Knockdown of
      cofilin 1 also facilitates ciliogenesis. Moreover, depletion of either NudC or
      cofilin 1 causes similar ciliary defects in zebrafish, including curved body,
      pericardial edema and defective left-right asymmetry. Ectopic expression of
      cofilin 1 significantly reverses the phenotypes induced by NudC depletion in both
      cultured cells and zebrafish. Thus, our data suggest that NudC regulates actin
      cytoskeleton and ciliogenesis by stabilizing cofilin 1.

TI  - Mutation of C. elegans demethylase spr-5 extends transgenerational longevity.
PG  - 229-38
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.148 [doi]
AB  - Complex organismal properties such as longevity can be transmitted across
      generations by non-genetic factors. Here we demonstrate that deletion of the C.
      elegans histone H3 lysine 4 dimethyl (H3K4me2) demethylase, spr-5, causes a
      trans-generational increase in lifespan. We identify a chromatin-modifying
      network, which regulates this lifespan extension. We further show that this
      trans-generational lifespan extension is dependent on a hormonal signaling
      pathway involving the steroid dafachronic acid, an activator of the nuclear
      receptor DAF-12. These findings suggest that loss of the demethylase SPR-5 causes
      H3K4me2 mis-regulation and activation of a known lifespan-regulating signaling
      pathway, leading to trans-generational lifespan extension.

TI  - Pluripotent stem cells induced from mouse neural stem cells and small intestinal 
      epithelial cells by small molecule compounds.
PG  - 34-45
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.142 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we reported a chemical approach to generate pluripotent stem cells from
      mouse fibroblasts. However, whether chemically induced pluripotent stem cells
      (CiPSCs) can be derived from other cell types remains to be demonstrated. Here,
      using lineage tracing, we first verify the generation of CiPSCs from fibroblasts.
      Next, we demonstrate that neural stem cells (NSCs) from the ectoderm and small
      intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from the endoderm can be chemically
      reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells. CiPSCs derived from NSCs and IECs
      resemble mouse embryonic stem cells in proliferation rate, global gene expression
      profile, epigenetic status, self-renewal and differentiation capacity, and
      germline transmission competency. Interestingly, the pluripotency gene Sall4 is
      expressed at the initial stage in the chemical reprogramming process from
      different cell types, and the same core small molecules are required for the
      reprogramming, suggesting conservation in the molecular mechanism underlying
      chemical reprogramming from these diverse cell types. Our analysis also shows
      that the use of these small molecules should be fine-tuned to meet the
      requirement of reprogramming from different cell types. Together, these findings 
      demonstrate that full chemical reprogramming approach can be applied in cells of 
      different tissue origins and suggest that chemical reprogramming is a promising
      strategy with the potential to be extended to more initial types.

TI  - Somatosensory neuron types identified by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing
      and functional heterogeneity.
PG  - 83-102
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.149 [doi]
AB  - Sensory neurons are distinguished by distinct signaling networks and receptive
      characteristics. Thus, sensory neuron types can be defined by linking
      transcriptome-based neuron typing with the sensory phenotypes. Here we classify
      somatosensory neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by high-coverage
      single-cell RNA-sequencing (10 950 +/- 1 218 genes per neuron) and neuron
      size-based hierarchical clustering. Moreover, single DRG neurons responding to
      cutaneous stimuli are recorded using an in vivo whole-cell patch clamp technique 
      and classified by neuron-type genetic markers. Small diameter DRG neurons are
      classified into one type of low-threshold mechanoreceptor and five types of
      mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs). Each of the MHN types is further categorized into
      two subtypes. Large DRG neurons are categorized into four types, including
      neurexophilin 1-expressing MHNs and mechanical nociceptors (MNs) expressing
      BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (Baiap2l1). Mechanoreceptors expressing
      trafficking protein particle complex 3-like and Baiap2l1-marked MNs are
      subdivided into two subtypes each. These results provide a new system for
      cataloging somatosensory neurons and their transcriptome databases.

TI  - Loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is linked to gene body hypermethylation in kidney
      cancer.
PG  - 103-18
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.150 [doi]
AB  - Both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) 
      have been proposed to be involved in tumorigenesis. Because the readout of the
      broadly used 5mC mapping method, bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), is the sum of 5mC
      and 5hmC levels, the 5mC/5hmC patterns and relationship of these two
      modifications remain poorly understood. By profiling real 5mC (BS-seq corrected
      by Tet-assisted BS-seq, TAB-seq) and 5hmC (TAB-seq) levels simultaneously at
      single-nucleotide resolution, we here demonstrate that there is no global loss of
      5mC in kidney tumors compared with matched normal tissues. Conversely, 5hmC was
      globally lost in virtually all kidney tumor tissues. The 5hmC level in tumor
      tissues is an independent prognostic marker for kidney cancer, with lower levels 
      of 5hmC associated with shorter overall survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated
      that loss of 5hmC is linked to hypermethylation in tumors compared with matched
      normal tissues, particularly in gene body regions. Strikingly, gene body
      hypermethylation was significantly associated with silencing of the tumor-related
      genes. Downregulation of IDH1 was identified as a mechanism underlying 5hmC loss 
      in kidney cancer. Restoring 5hmC levels attenuated the invasion capacity of tumor
      cells and suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft model. Collectively, our results
      demonstrate that loss of 5hmC is both a prognostic marker and an oncogenic event 
      in kidney cancer by remodeling the DNA methylation pattern.

TI  - Out of southern East Asia: the natural history of domestic dogs across the world.
PG  - 21-33
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.147 [doi]
AB  - The origin and evolution of the domestic dog remains a controversial question for
      the scientific community, with basic aspects such as the place and date of
      origin, and the number of times dogs were domesticated, open to dispute. Using
      whole genome sequences from a total of 58 canids (12 gray wolves, 27 primitive
      dogs from Asia and Africa, and a collection of 19 diverse breeds from across the 
      world), we find that dogs from southern East Asia have significantly higher
      genetic diversity compared to other populations, and are the most basal group
      relating to gray wolves, indicating an ancient origin of domestic dogs in
      southern East Asia 33 000 years ago. Around 15 000 years ago, a subset of
      ancestral dogs started migrating to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, arriving 
      in Europe at about 10 000 years ago. One of the out of Asia lineages also
      migrated back to the east, creating a series of admixed populations with the
      endemic Asian lineages in northern China before migrating to the New World. For
      the first time, our study unravels an extraordinary journey that the domestic dog
      has traveled on earth.

AB  - The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a master
      regulator of cell growth and metabolism. In mammals, growth factors and cellular 
      energy stimulate mTORC1 activity through inhibition of the TSC complex
      (TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7), a negative regulator of mTORC1. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 
      independently of the TSC complex. Here, we review recently identified regulators 
      that link amino acid sufficiency to mTORC1 activity and how mutations affecting
      these regulators cause human disease.

TI  - Dicer-independent RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 66-82
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.145 [doi]
AB  - RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is an important de novo DNA methylation
      pathway in plants. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by Dicers from RNA
      polymerase IV (Pol IV) transcripts are thought to guide sequence-specific DNA
      methylation. To gain insight into the mechanism of RdDM, we performed
      whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of a collection of Arabidopsis mutants,
      including plants deficient in Pol IV (nrpd1) or Dicer (dcl1/2/3/4) activity.
      Unexpectedly, of the RdDM target loci that required Pol IV and/or Pol V, only 16%
      were fully dependent on Dicer activity. DNA methylation was partly or completely 
      independent of Dicer activity at the remaining Pol IV- and/or Pol V-dependent
      loci, despite the loss of 24-nt siRNAs. Instead, DNA methylation levels
      correlated with the accumulation of Pol IV-dependent 25-50 nt RNAs at most loci
      in Dicer mutant plants. Our results suggest that RdDM in plants is largely guided
      by a previously unappreciated class of Dicer-independent non-coding RNAs, and
      that siRNAs are required to maintain DNA methylation at only a subset of loci.

PG  - 119-30
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.143 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac cells marked by c-Kit or Kit, dubbed cardiac stem cells (CSCs), are in
      clinical trials to investigate their ability to stimulate cardiac regeneration
      and repair. These studies were initially motivated by the purported cardiogenic
      activity of these cells. Recent lineage tracing studies using Kit promoter to
      drive expression of the inducible Cre recombinase showed that these CSCs had
      highly limited cardiogenic activity, inadequate to support efficient cardiac
      repair. Here we reassess the lineage tracing data by investigating the identity
      of cells immediately after Cre labeling. Our instant lineage tracing approach
      identifies Kit-expressing cardiomyocytes, which are labeled immediately after
      tamoxifen induction. In combination with long-term lineage tracing experiments,
      these data reveal that the large majority of long-term labeled cardiomyocytes are
      pre-existing Kit-expressing cardiomyocytes rather than cardiomyocytes formed de
      novo from CSCs. This study presents a new interpretation for the contribution of 
      Kit(+) cells to cardiomyocytes and shows that Kit genetic lineage tracing
      over-estimates the cardiogenic activity of Kit(+) CSCs.

TI  - mTORC2 promotes type I insulin-like growth factor receptor and insulin receptor
      activation through the tyrosine kinase activity of mTOR.
PG  - 46-65
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.133 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a core component of raptor-mTOR (mTORC1) 
      and rictor-mTOR (mTORC2) complexes that control diverse cellular processes. Both 
      mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate several elements downstream of type I insulin-like
      growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (InsR). However, it is
      unknown whether and how mTOR regulates IGF-IR and InsR themselves. Here we show
      that mTOR possesses unexpected tyrosine kinase activity and activates
      IGF-IR/InsR. Rapamycin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of
      IGF-IR/InsR, which is largely dependent on rictor and mTOR. Moreover, mTORC2
      promotes ligand-induced activation of IGF-IR/InsR. IGF- and insulin-induced
      IGF-IR/InsR phosphorylation is significantly compromised in rictor-null cells.
      Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) directly interacts with SIN1 thereby recruiting 
      mTORC2 to IGF-IR/InsR and promoting rapamycin- or ligand-induced phosphorylation 
      of IGF-IR/InsR. mTOR exhibits tyrosine kinase activity towards the general
      tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu-Tyr) and IGF-IR/InsR. Both recombinant mTOR
      and immunoprecipitated mTORC2 phosphorylate IGF-IR and InsR on Tyr1131/1136 and
      Tyr1146/1151, respectively. These effects are independent of the intrinsic kinase
      activity of IGF-IR/InsR, as determined by assays on kinase-dead IGF-IR/InsR
      mutants. While both rictor and mTOR immunoprecitates from rictor(+/+) MCF-10A
      cells exhibit tyrosine kinase activity towards IGF-IR and InsR, mTOR
      immunoprecipitates from rictor(-/-) MCF-10A cells do not induce IGF-IR and InsR
      phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-deficient mutation of residue Tyr1131 in IGF-IR 
      or Tyr1146 in InsR abrogates the activation of IGF-IR/InsR by mTOR. Finally,
      overexpression of rictor promotes IGF-induced cell proliferation. Our work
      identifies mTOR as a dual-specificity kinase and clarifies how mTORC2 promotes
      IGF-IR/InsR activation.
