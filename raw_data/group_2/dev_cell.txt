TI  - Spatial-Temporal Lineage Restrictions of Embryonic p63(+) Progenitors Establish
      Distinct Stem Cell Pools in Adult Airways.

AB  - Basal cells (BCs) are p63-expressing multipotent progenitors of skin,
      tracheoesophageal and urinary tracts. p63 is abundant in developing airways;
      however, it remains largely unclear how embryonic p63(+) cells contribute to the 
      developing and postnatal respiratory tract epithelium, and ultimately how they
      relate to adult BCs. Using lineage-tracing and functional approaches in vivo, we 
      show that p63(+) cells arising from the lung primordium are initially multipotent
      progenitors of airway and alveolar lineages but later become restricted
      proximally to generate the tracheal adult stem cell pool. In intrapulmonary
      airways, these cells are maintained immature to adulthood in bronchi,
      establishing a rare p63(+)Krt5(-) progenitor cell population that responds to
      H1N1 virus-induced severe injury. Intriguingly, this pool includes a CC10
      lineage-labeled p63(+)Krt5(-) cell subpopulation required for a full
      H1N1-response. These data elucidate key aspects in the establishment of
      regionally distinct adult stem cell pools in the respiratory system, potentially 
      with relevance to other organs.

      Drosophila Intestine.

AB  - The intestine has direct contact with nutritional information. The mechanisms by 
      which particular dietary molecules affect intestinal homeostasis are not fully
      understood. In this study, we identified S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal 
      methyl donor synthesized from dietary methionine, as a critical molecule that
      regulates stem cell division in Drosophila midgut. Depletion of either dietary
      methionine or SAM synthesis reduces division rate of intestinal stem cells.
      Genetic screening for putative SAM-dependent methyltransferases has identified
      protein synthesis as a regulator of the stem cells, partially through a unique
      diphthamide modification on eukaryotic elongation factor 2. In contrast, SAM in
      nutrient-absorptive enterocytes controls the interleukin-6-like protein Unpaired 
      3, which is required for rapid division of the stem cells after refeeding. Our
      study sheds light upon a link between diet and intestinal homeostasis and
      highlights the key metabolite SAM as a mediator of cell-type-specific starvation 
      response.

AB  - Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins (PITPs) stimulate PtdIns-4-P
      synthesis and signaling in eukaryotic cells, but to what biological outcomes such
      signaling circuits are coupled remains unclear. Herein, we show that two highly
      related StART-like PITPs, PITPNA and PITPNB, act in a redundant fashion to
      support development of the embryonic mammalian neocortex. PITPNA/PITPNB do so by 
      driving PtdIns-4-P-dependent recruitment of GOLPH3, and likely ceramide transfer 
      protein (CERT), to Golgi membranes with GOLPH3 recruitment serving to promote
      MYO18A- and F-actin-directed loading of the Golgi network to apical processes of 
      neural stem cells (NSCs). We propose the primary role for
      PITP/PtdIns-4-P/GOLPH3/CERT signaling in NSC Golgi is not in regulating bulk
      membrane trafficking but in optimizing apically directed membrane trafficking
      and/or apical membrane signaling during neurogenesis.

AB  - We show that the loss or gain of transcription factor programs that govern
      embryonic cell-fate specification is associated with a form of tumor plasticity
      characterized by the acquisition of alternative cell fates normally
      characteristic of adjacent organs. In human non-small cell lung cancers,
      downregulation of the lung lineage-specifying TF NKX2-1 is associated with tumors
      bearing features of various gut tissues. Loss of Nkx2-1 from murine alveolar, but
      not airway, epithelium results in conversion of lung cells to gastric-like cells.
      Superimposing oncogenic Kras activation enables further plasticity in both
      alveolar and airway epithelium, producing tumors that adopt midgut and hindgut
      fates. Conversely, coupling Nkx2-1 loss with foregut lineage-specifying SOX2
      overexpression drives the formation of squamous cancers with features of
      esophageal differentiation. These findings demonstrate that elements of
      pathologic tumor plasticity mirror the normal developmental history of organs in 
      that cancer cells acquire cell fates associated with developmentally related
      neighboring organs.

AB  - Protein phosphorylation is a dynamic post-translational modification critical for
      biological responses. At the level of individual molecules, phosphorylation
      dynamics can have important functional implications, but this information is
      rarely quantified. We discuss how rapid phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles 
      could underlie important signaling properties, including the ability to rapidly
      bind and release proteins.

      (2018) identify rules for piRNA target recognition in Caenorhabditis elegans.
      Permissive pairing rules allow targeting of essentially all germline mRNAs, while
      protective mechanisms prevent silencing self-genes.

AB  - CFTR biosynthesis is highly dynamic. In this issue of Developmental Cell,
      Okiyoneda et al. (2018) show that RFFL serves as a CFTR conformation scrutinizer 
      at the plasma membrane. It recognizes misfolded CFTR proteins and marks them for 
      degradation. This quality control mechanism may be explored to benefit cystic
      fibrosis patients.

AB  - Basal cells are an important stem cell lineage in many tissues, including the
      lung. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Yang et. al. (2018) find that basal
      cells emerge very early in lung development and that a subset of these
      contributes to the expansive epithelial wound response observed after influenza
      injury.

AB  - Recurrent mutations in chromatin modifiers are specifically prevalent in
      adolescent or adult patients with Sonic hedgehog-associated medulloblastoma (SHH 
      MB). Here, we report that mutations in the acetyltransferase CREBBP have opposing
      effects during the development of the cerebellum, the primary site of origin of
      SHH MB. Our data reveal that loss of Crebbp in cerebellar granule neuron
      progenitors (GNPs) during embryonic development of mice compromises GNP
      development, in part by downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (Bdnf). Interestingly, concomitant cerebellar hypoplasia was also observed in
      patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by germline
      mutations of CREBBP. By contrast, loss of Crebbp in GNPs during postnatal
      development synergizes with oncogenic activation of SHH signaling to drive MB
      growth, thereby explaining the enrichment of somatic CREBBP mutations in SHH MB
      of adult patients. Together, our data provide insights into time-sensitive
      consequences of CREBBP mutations and corresponding associations with human
      diseases.

AB  - The peripheral protein quality control (QC) system removes non-native membrane
      proteins, including DeltaF508-CFTR, the most common CFTR mutant in cystic
      fibrosis (CF), from the plasma membrane (PM) for lysosomal degradation by
      ubiquitination. It remains unclear how unfolded membrane proteins are recognized 
      and targeted for ubiquitination and how they are removed from the apical PM.
      Using comprehensive siRNA screens, we identified RFFL, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub)
      ligase that directly and selectively recognizes unfolded DeltaF508-CFTR through
      its disordered regions. RFFL retrieves the unfolded CFTR from the PM for
      lysosomal degradation by chaperone-independent K63-linked poly-ubiquitination.
      RFFL ablation enhanced the functional expression of cell-surface DeltaF508-CFTR
      in the presence of folding corrector molecules, and this effect was further
      improved by inhibiting the Hsc70-dependent ubiquitination machinery. We propose
      that multiple peripheral QC mechanisms evolved to dispose of non-native PM
      proteins and to preserve cellular proteostasis, even at the cost of eliminating
      partially functional polypeptides.

AB  - In metazoans, Piwi-related Argonaute proteins engage piRNAs (Piwi-interacting
      small RNAs) to defend the genome against invasive nucleic acids, such as
      transposable elements. Yet many organisms-including worms and humans-express
      thousands of piRNAs that do not target transposons, suggesting that piRNA
      function extends beyond genome defense. Here, we show that the X
      chromosome-derived piRNA 21ux-1 downregulates XOL-1 (XO Lethal), a master
      regulator of X chromosome dosage compensation and sex determination in
      Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in 21ux-1 and several Piwi-pathway components
      sensitize hermaphrodites to dosage compensation and sex determination defects. We
      show that the piRNA pathway also targets xol-1 in C. briggsae, a nematode species
      related to C. elegans. Our findings reveal physiologically important piRNA-mRNA
      interactions, raising the possibility that piRNAs function broadly to ensure
      robust gene expression and germline development.

AB  - The murine embryonic blood-brain barrier (BBB) consists of endothelial cells
      (ECs), pericytes (PCs), and basement membrane. Although PCs are critical for
      inducing vascular stability, signaling pathways in PCs that regulate EC
      morphogenesis during BBB development remain unexplored. Herein, we find that
      murine embryos lacking the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor
      activin receptor-like kinase 5 (Alk5) in brain PCs (mutants) develop gross
      germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH). The germinal
      matrix (GM) is a highly vascularized structure rich in neuronal and glial
      precursors. We show that GM microvessels of mutants display abnormal dilation,
      reduced PC coverage, EC hyperproliferation, reduced basement membrane collagen,
      and enhanced perivascular matrix metalloproteinase activity. Furthermore,
      ALK5-depleted PCs downregulate tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3
      (TIMP3), and TIMP3 administration to mutants improves endothelial morphogenesis
      and attenuates GMH-IVH. Overall, our findings reveal a key role for PC ALK5 in
      regulating brain endothelial morphogenesis and a substantial therapeutic
      potential for TIMP3 during GMH-IVH.

AB  - The importance of producing the correct numbers of neurons during development is 
      illustrated by both evolutionary enhancement of cognitive capacities in larger
      brains, and developmental disorders of brain size. In humans, increased neuronal 
      numbers during development is speculated to partly derive from a unique subtype
      of neural stem cells (NSCs) that undergo a phase of expansion through symmetric
      self-amplifying divisions before generating neurons. Symmetric amplification also
      appears to underlie adult neural stem maintenance in the mouse. However, the
      mechanisms regulating this behavior are unclear. We report the discovery of
      self-amplifying NSCs in Drosophila and show that they arise by a spatiotemporal
      conversion of classical self-renewing NSCs. This conversion is regulated by a
      temporal transition in the expression of proneural transcription factors prior to
      cell division. We find a causal link between stem cell self-amplification and
      increased neuronal numbers. We further show that the temporal transcriptional
      switch controls both stem cell division and subsequent neuronal differentiation.

AB  - The circadian clock and cell cycle as separate pathways have been well documented
      in plants. Elucidating whether these two oscillators are connected is critical
      for understanding plant growth. We found that a slow-running circadian clock
      decelerates the cell cycle and, conversely, a fast clock speeds it up. The clock 
      component TOC1 safeguards the G1-to-S transition and controls the timing of the
      mitotic cycle at early stages of leaf development. TOC1 also regulates somatic
      ploidy at later stages of leaf development and in hypocotyl cells. The S-phase is
      shorter and delayed in TOC1 overexpressing plants, which correlates with the
      diurnal repression of the DNA replication licensing gene CDC6 through binding of 
      TOC1 to the CDC6 promoter. The slow cell-cycle pace in TOC1-ox also results in
      delayed tumor progression in inflorescence stalks. Thus, TOC1 sets the time of
      the DNA pre-replicative machinery to control plant growth in resonance with the
      environment.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms of how self-renewing cells are controlled in
      regenerating tissues and cancer remain ambiguous. PCNA-associated factor (PAF)
      modulates DNA repair via PCNA. Also, PAF hyperactivates Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling independently of PCNA interaction. We found that PAF is expressed in
      intestinal stem and progenitor cells (ISCs and IPCs) and markedly upregulated
      during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Whereas PAF is dispensable for 
      intestinal homeostasis, upon radiation injury, genetic ablation of PAF impairs
      intestinal regeneration along with the severe loss of ISCs and Myc expression.
      Mechanistically, PAF conditionally occupies and transactivates the c-Myc
      promoter, which induces the expansion of ISCs/IPCs during intestinal
      regeneration. In mouse models, PAF knockout inhibits Apc inactivation-driven
      intestinal tumorigenesis with reduced tumor cell stemness and suppressed
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity, supported by transcriptome profiling.
      Collectively, our results unveil that the PAF-Myc signaling axis is indispensable
      for intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis by positively regulating
      self-renewing cells.

AB  - Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations cause Wnt pathway activation in human 
      cancers. Current models for APC action emphasize its role in promoting
      beta-catenin degradation downstream of Wnt receptors. Unexpectedly, we find that 
      blocking Wnt receptor activity in APC-deficient cells inhibits Wnt signaling
      independently of Wnt ligand. We also show that inducible loss of APC is rapidly
      followed by Wnt receptor activation and increased beta-catenin levels. In
      contrast, APC2 loss does not promote receptor activation. We show that APC exists
      in a complex with clathrin and that Wnt pathway activation in APC-deficient cells
      requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate conservation of
      this mechanism in Drosophila intestinal stem cells. We propose a model in which
      APC and APC2 function to promote beta-catenin degradation, and APC also acts as a
      molecular "gatekeeper" to block receptor activation via the clathrin pathway.

      Relieving FOXO3a Turnover.

AB  - Macroautophagy (autophagy) is intimately linked with cell death and allows cells 
      to evade apoptosis. This has prompted clinical trials to combine autophagy
      inhibitors with other drugs with the aim of increasing the likelihood of cancer
      cells dying. However, the molecular basis for such effects is unknown. Here, we
      describe a transcriptional mechanism that connects autophagy to apoptosis. The
      autophagy-regulating transcription factor, FOXO3a, is itself turned over by basal
      autophagy creating a potential feedback loop. Increased FOXO3a upon autophagy
      inhibition stimulates transcription of the pro-apoptotic BBC3/PUMA gene to cause 
      apoptosis sensitization. This mechanism explains how autophagy inhibition can
      sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs and allows an autophagy inhibitor to 
      change the action of an MDM2-targeted drug from growth inhibition to apoptosis,
      reducing tumor burden in vivo. Thus, a link between two processes mediated via a 
      single transcription factor binding site in the genome can be leveraged to
      improve anti-cancer therapies.

AB  - Neutrophils are essential to the homeostatic mission of safeguarding host
      tissues, responding rapidly and diversely to breaches of the host's barriers to
      infection, and returning tissues to a sterile state. In response to specific
      stimuli, neutrophils extrude modified chromatin structures decorated with
      specific cytoplasmic and granular proteins called neutrophil extracellular traps 
      (NETs). Several pathways lead to this unique form of cell death (NETosis).
      Extracellular chromatin may have evolved to defend eukaryotic organisms against
      infection, and its release has at least three functions: trapping and killing of 
      microbes, amplifying immune responses, and inducing coagulation. Here we review
      neutrophil development and heterogeneity with a focus on NETs, NET formation, and
      their relevance in host defense and disease.

AB  - Genomic divergence can cause reproductive isolation between species. The
      molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation can thus reveal which
      genomic features evolve rapidly and become unstable or incompatible in hybrids.
      In a recent paper in Nature, Gibeaux et al. (2018) report paternal genome
      instability and metabolic imbalance in hybrids between frog species.

AB  - The scaffold protein APC has a well-known function in ensuring beta-catenin
      destruction. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Saito-Diaz et al. (2018)
      uncover another role for APC in Wnt signaling: to prevent clathrin-dependent
      signalosome formation in the absence of ligand.

AB  - Spatiotemporal regulation of kinesins is essential for microtubule-dependent
      intracellular transport. In plants, cell wall deposition depends on the FRA1
      kinesin, whose abundance and motility are tightly controlled to match cellular
      growth rate. Here, we show that an importin-beta, IMB4, regulates FRA1 activity
      in a developmental manner. IMB4 physically interacts with a PY motif in the FRA1 
      motor domain and inhibits its motility by preventing microtubule binding, while
      also protecting FRA1 against proteasome-mediated degradation, thus providing a
      mechanism to couple the motility and stability of FRA1. This regulatory mechanism
      is likely to be broadly applicable, based on the conservation of the PY motif in 
      the motor domains of plant and animal kinesins and the direct interaction of
      multiple plant kinesins with IMB4. Together, our data establish IMB4 as a
      multi-functional regulator of FRA1 and reveal a mechanism for how plants control 
      the magnitude of cargo transport needed for cell wall assembly.

      Intestinal Epithelial Growth and Organization.

AB  - The intestinal epithelium maintains a remarkable balance between proliferation
      and differentiation despite rapid cellular turnover. A central challenge is to
      elucidate mechanisms required for robust control of tissue renewal. Opposing WNT 
      and BMP signaling is essential in establishing epithelial homeostasis. However,
      it has been difficult to disentangle contributions from multiple sources of
      morphogen signals in the tissue. Here, to dissect epithelial-autonomous
      morphogenic signaling circuits, we developed an enteroid monolayer culture system
      that recapitulates four key properties of the intestinal epithelium, namely the
      ability to maintain proliferative and differentiated zones, self-renew, polarize,
      and generate major intestinal cell types. We systematically perturb intrinsic and
      extrinsic sources of WNT and BMP signals to reveal a core morphogenic circuit
      that controls proliferation, tissue organization, and cell fate. Our work
      demonstrates the ability of intestinal epithelium, even in the absence of 3D
      tissue architecture, to control its own growth and organization through
      morphogen-mediated feedback.

AB  - Antisense morpholino oligomers (MOs) have been indispensable tools for
      developmental biologists to transiently knock down (KD) genes rather than to
      knock them out (KO). Here we report on the implications of genetic KO versus
      MO-mediated KD of the mesoderm-specifying Brachyury paralogs in the frog Xenopus 
      tropicalis. While both KO and KD embryos fail to activate the same core gene
      regulatory network, resulting in virtually identical morphological defects,
      embryos injected with control or target MOs also show a systemic GC
      content-dependent immune response and many off-target splicing defects.
      Optimization of MO dosage and increasing incubation temperatures can mitigate,
      but not eliminate, these MO side effects, which are consistent with the high
      affinity measured between MO and off-target sequence in vitro. We conclude that
      while MOs can be useful to profile loss-of-function phenotypes at a molecular
      level, careful attention must be paid to their immunogenic and off-target side
      effects.

TI  - Activation of the Notch Signaling Pathway In Vivo Elicits Changes in CSL Nuclear 
      Dynamics.

AB  - A key feature of Notch signaling is that it directs immediate changes in
      transcription via the DNA-binding factor CSL, switching it from repression to
      activation. How Notch generates both a sensitive and accurate response-in the
      absence of any amplification step-remains to be elucidated. To address this
      question, we developed real-time analysis of CSL dynamics including
      single-molecule tracking in vivo. In Notch-OFF nuclei, a small proportion of CSL 
      molecules transiently binds DNA, while in Notch-ON conditions CSL recruitment
      increases dramatically at target loci, where complexes have longer dwell times
      conferred by the Notch co-activator Mastermind. Surprisingly, recruitment of
      CSL-related corepressors also increases in Notch-ON conditions, revealing that
      Notch induces cooperative or "assisted" loading by promoting local increase in
      chromatin accessibility. Thus, in vivo Notch activity triggers changes in CSL
      dwell times and chromatin accessibility, which we propose confer sensitivity to
      small input changes and facilitate timely shut-down.

AB  - The spatial localization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow
      (BM) remains controversial, with some studies suggesting that they are maintained
      in homogeneously distributed niches while others have suggested the contributions
      of distinct niche structures. Subsets of quiescent HSCs have been reported to
      associate with megakaryocytes (MK) or arterioles in the BM. However, these HSC
      subsets have not been prospectively defined. Here, we show that platelet and
      myeloid-biased HSCs, marked by von Willebrand factor (vWF) expression, are highly
      enriched in MK niches. Depletion of MK selectively expands vWF(+) HSCs, whereas
      the depletion of NG2(+) arteriolar niche cells selectively depletes vWF(-)
      lymphoid-biased HSCs. In addition, MK depletion compromises vWF(+) HSC function
      by reducing their long-term self-renewal capacity and eliminating their lineage
      bias after transplantation. These studies demonstrate the existence of two
      spatially and functionally separate BM niches for HSC subsets with distinct
      developmental potential.

AB  - Adipocytes have many functions in various tissues beyond energy storage,
      including regulating metabolism, growth, and immunity. However, little is known
      about their role in wound healing. Here we use live imaging of fat body cells,
      the equivalent of vertebrate adipocytes in Drosophila, to investigate their
      potential behaviors and functions following skin wounding. We find that pupal fat
      body cells are not immotile, as previously presumed, but actively migrate to
      wounds using an unusual adhesion-independent, actomyosin-driven, peristaltic mode
      of motility. Once at the wound, fat body cells collaborate with hemocytes,
      Drosophila macrophages, to clear the wound of cell debris; they also tightly seal
      the epithelial wound gap and locally release antimicrobial peptides to fight
      wound infection. Thus, fat body cells are motile cells, enabling them to migrate 
      to wounds to undertake several local functions needed to drive wound repair and
      prevent infections.

AB  - Correlative evidence suggests that polyploidization of heart muscle, which occurs
      naturally in post-natal mammals, creates a barrier to heart regeneration. Here,
      we move beyond a correlation by demonstrating that experimental polyploidization 
      of zebrafish cardiomyocytes is sufficient to suppress their proliferative
      potential during regeneration. Initially, we determined that zebrafish myocardium
      becomes susceptible to polyploidization upon transient cytokinesis inhibition
      mediated by dominant-negative Ect2. Using a transgenic strategy, we generated
      adult animals containing mosaic hearts composed of differentially labeled diploid
      and polyploid-enriched cardiomyocyte populations. Diploid cardiomyocytes
      outcompeted their polyploid neighbors in producing regenerated heart muscle.
      Moreover, hearts composed of equivalent proportions of diploid and polyploid
      cardiomyocytes failed to regenerate altogether, demonstrating that a critical
      percentage of diploid cardiomyocytes is required to achieve heart regeneration.
      Our data identify cardiomyocyte polyploidization as a barrier to heart
      regeneration and suggest that mobilizing rare diploid cardiomyocytes in the human
      heart will improve its regenerative capacity.

AB  - Aneuploidy, chromosome stoichiometry that deviates from exact multiples of the
      haploid compliment of an organism, exists in eukaryotic microbes, several normal 
      human tissues, and the majority of solid tumors. Here, we review the current
      understanding about the cellular stress states that may result from aneuploidy.
      The topics of aneuploidy-induced proteotoxic, metabolic, replication, and mitotic
      stress are assessed in the context of the gene dosage imbalance observed in
      aneuploid cells. We also highlight emerging findings related to the downstream
      effects of aneuploidy-induced cellular stress on the immune surveillance against 
      aneuploid cells.

AB  - A small number of signaling pathways are used ubiquitously throughout
      development. How can enough information be carried through such a small number of
      channels? Reporting in Cell, Nandagopal et al. (2018) reveal how different Notch 
      ligands can regulate different targets through the same receptor using
      differences in signaling dynamics.

AB  - Cell growth and cell differentiation are two distinct yet coupled developmental
      processes, but how they are coordinated is not well understood. During Drosophila
      oogenesis, we found that the growth-promoting InR/Akt/TOR pathway was involved in
      suppressing the fate determination of the migratory border cells. The InR/Akt/TOR
      pathway signals through TOR and Raptor, components of TORC1, to downregulate the 
      JAK/STAT pathway, which is necessary and sufficient for border cell fate
      determination. TORC1 promotes the protein stability of SOCS36E, the conserved
      negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling, through physical interaction,
      suggesting that TORC1 acts as a key regulator coordinating both cell growth and
      cell differentiation.

TI  - The Polyploid State Plays a Tumor-Suppressive Role in the Liver.

AB  - Most cells in the liver are polyploid, but the functional role of polyploidy is
      unknown. Polyploidization occurs through cytokinesis failure and
      endoreduplication around the time of weaning. To interrogate polyploidy while
      avoiding irreversible manipulations of essential cell-cycle genes, we developed
      orthogonal mouse models to transiently and potently alter liver ploidy. Premature
      weaning, as well as knockdown of E2f8 or Anln, allowed us to toggle between
      diploid and polyploid states. While there was no detectable impact of ploidy
      alterations on liver function, metabolism, or regeneration, mice with more
      polyploid hepatocytes suppressed tumorigenesis and mice with more diploid
      hepatocytes accelerated tumorigenesis in mutagen- and high-fat-induced models.
      Mechanistically, the diploid state was more susceptible to Cas9-mediated
      tumor-suppressor loss but was similarly susceptible to MYC oncogene activation,
      indicating that polyploidy differentially protected the liver from distinct
      genomic aberrations. This suggests that polyploidy evolved in part to prevent
      malignant outcomes of liver injury.

AB  - UV-B light (UV-B radiation) is known to inhibit plant growth, but the mechanism
      is not well understood. UVR8 (UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8) is a UV-B light
      photoreceptor that mediates UV-B light responses in plants. We report here that
      UV-B inhibits plant growth by repressing plant steroid hormone brassinosteroid
      (BR)-promoted plant growth. UVR8 physically interacts with the functional
      dephosphorylated BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1) and BIM1 (BES1-INTERACTING MYC-LIKE 
      1) transcription factors that mediate BR-regulated gene expression and plant
      growth to inhibit their activities. Genome-wide gene expression analysis defined 
      a BES1-dependent UV-B-regulated transcriptome, which is enriched with genes
      involved in cell elongation and plant growth. We further showed that
      UV-B-activated and nucleus-localized UVR8 inhibited the DNA-binding activities of
      BES1/BIM1 to directly regulate transcription of growth-related genes. Our results
      therefore establish that UVR8-BES1/BIM1 interaction represents an early
      photoreceptor signaling mechanism in plants and serves as an important module
      integrating light and BR signaling.

AB  - Mitochondrial quality control is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis and
      is achieved by removing damaged, ubiquitinated mitochondria via Parkin-mediated
      mitophagy. Here, we demonstrate that MYO6 (myosin VI), a unique myosin that moves
      toward the minus end of actin filaments, forms a complex with Parkin and is
      selectively recruited to damaged mitochondria via its ubiquitin-binding domain.
      This myosin motor initiates the assembly of F-actin cages to encapsulate damaged 
      mitochondria by forming a physical barrier that prevents refusion with
      neighboring populations. Loss of MYO6 results in an accumulation of
      mitophagosomes and an increase in mitochondrial mass. In addition, we observe
      downstream mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting as reduced respiratory capacity 
      and decreased ability to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production.
      Our work uncovers a crucial step in mitochondrial quality control: the formation 
      of MYO6-dependent actin cages that ensure isolation of damaged mitochondria from 
      the network.

AB  - Membrane vesicles delivered to the cell-division plane fuse with one another to
      form the partitioning membrane during plant cytokinesis, starting in the cell
      center. In Arabidopsis, this requires SNARE complexes involving the
      cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE KNOLLE. However, cytokinesis still occurs in knolle
      mutant embryos, suggesting contributions from KNOLLE-independent SNARE complexes.
      Here we show that Qa-SNARE SYP132, having counterparts in lower plants,
      functionally overlaps with the flowering plant-specific KNOLLE. SYP132 mutation
      causes cytokinesis defects, knolle syp132 double mutants consist of only one or a
      few multi-nucleate cells, and SYP132 has the same SNARE partners as KNOLLE.
      SYP132 and KNOLLE also have non-overlapping functions in secretion and in
      cellularization of the embryo-nourishing endosperm resulting from double
      fertilization unique to flowering plants. Evolutionarily ancient non-specialized 
      SNARE complexes originating in algae were thus amended by the appearance of
      cytokinesis-specific SNARE complexes, meeting the high demand for membrane-fusion
      capacity during endosperm cellularization in angiosperms.

AB  - Contractile forces eliminate cell contacts in many morphogenetic processes.
      However, mechanisms that balance contractile forces to promote subtler remodeling
      remain unknown. To address this gap, we investigated remodeling of Drosophila eye
      lattice cells (LCs), which preserve cell contacts as they narrow to form the
      edges of a multicellular hexagonal lattice. We found that during narrowing, LC-LC
      contacts dynamically constrict and expand. Similar to other systems,
      actomyosin-based contractile forces promote pulses of constriction. Conversely,
      we found that WAVE-dependent branched F-actin accumulates at LC-LC contacts
      during expansion and functions to expand the cell apical area, promote shape
      changes, and prevent elimination of LC-LC contacts. Finally, we found that small 
      Rho GTPases regulate the balance of contractile and protrusive dynamics. These
      data suggest a mechanism by which WAVE regulatory complex-based F-actin dynamics 
      antagonize contractile forces to regulate cell shape and tissue topology during
      remodeling and thus contribute to the robustness and precision of the process.

AB  - Global transcriptional silencing is a highly conserved mechanism central to the
      oocyte-to-embryo transition. We report the unexpected discovery that global
      transcriptional silencing in oocytes depends on an mRNA decay activator.
      Oocyte-specific loss of ZFP36L2 an RNA-binding protein that promotes AU-rich
      element-dependent mRNA decay prevents global transcriptional silencing and causes
      oocyte maturation and fertilization defects, as well as complete female
      infertility in the mouse. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that ZFP36L2
      downregulates mRNAs encoding transcription and chromatin modification regulators,
      including a large group of mRNAs for histone demethylases targeting H3K4 and
      H3K9, which we show are bound and degraded by ZFP36L2. Oocytes lacking Zfp36l2
      fail to accumulate histone methylation at H3K4 and H3K9, marks associated with
      the transcriptionally silent, developmentally competent oocyte state. Our results
      uncover a ZFP36L2-dependent mRNA decay mechanism that acts as a developmental
      switch during oocyte growth, triggering wide-spread shifts in chromatin
      modification and global transcription.

AB  - The differentiation of alveolar epithelial type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells
      is essential for the lung gas exchange function. Disruption of this process
      results in neonatal death or in severe lung diseases that last into adulthood. We
      developed live imaging techniques to characterize the mechanisms that control
      alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. We discovered that mechanical forces
      generated from the inhalation of amniotic fluid by fetal breathing movements are 
      essential for AT1 cell differentiation. We found that a large subset of alveolar 
      progenitor cells is able to protrude from the airway epithelium toward the
      mesenchyme in an FGF10/FGFR2 signaling-dependent manner. The cell protrusion
      process results in enrichment of myosin in the apical region of protruded cells; 
      this myosin prevents these cells from being flattened by mechanical forces,
      thereby ensuring their AT2 cell fate. Our study demonstrates that mechanical
      forces and local growth factors synergistically control alveolar epithelial cell

AB  - Epithelial tissues robustly respond to internal and external stressors via
      dynamic cellular rearrangements. Cell extrusion acts as a key regulator of
      epithelial homeostasis by removing apoptotic cells, orchestrating morphogenesis, 
      and mediating competitive cellular battles during tumorigenesis. Here, we
      delineate the diverse functions of cell extrusion during development and disease.
      We emphasize the expanding role for apoptotic cell extrusion in exerting
      morphogenetic forces, as well as the strong intersection of cell extrusion with
      cell competition, a homeostatic mechanism that eliminates aberrant or unfit
      cells. While cell competition and extrusion can exert potent, tumor-suppressive
      effects, dysregulation of either critical homeostatic program can fuel cancer
      progression.

AB  - Telomerase counteracts telomere shortening, preventing cellular senescence.
      Telomerase deficiency causes telomere syndromes because of premature telomere
      exhaustion in highly proliferative cells. Paradoxically, in a recent issue of
      Cell, Margalef et al. (2018) demonstrate that telomerase causes telomere loss in 
      cells lacking the RTEL1 helicase, which is defective in Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson
      syndrome (HHS).

AB  - Specific protection mechanisms are required to safeguard stem cell integrity. In 
      a recent issue of Cell, Wu et al. (2018) show that stem cells are equipped with
      high intrinsic expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) but remain

AB  - Kes1/Osh4 is a member of the conserved, but functionally enigmatic, oxysterol
      binding protein-related protein (ORP) superfamily that inhibits
      phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14)-dependent membrane trafficking
      through the trans-Golgi (TGN)/endosomal network. We now report that Kes1, and
      select other ORPs, execute cell-cycle control activities as functionally
      non-redundant inhibitors of the G1/S transition when cells confront nutrient-poor
      environments and promote replicative aging. Kes1-dependent cell-cycle regulation 
      requires the Greatwall/MASTL kinase ortholog Rim15, and is opposed by Sec14
      activity in a mechanism independent of Kes1/Sec14 bulk membrane-trafficking
      functions. Moreover, the data identify Kes1 as a non-histone target for NuA4
      through which this lysine acetyltransferase co-modulates membrane-trafficking and
      cell-cycle activities. We propose the Sec14/Kes1 lipid-exchange protein pair
      constitutes part of the mechanism for integrating TGN/endosomal lipid signaling
      with cell-cycle progression and hypothesize that ORPs define a family of
      stage-specific cell-cycle control factors that execute tumor-suppressor-like
      functions.

AB  - Mechanical properties are cues for many biological processes in health or
      disease. In the heart, changes to the extracellular matrix composition and
      cross-linking result in stiffening of the cellular microenvironment during
      development. Moreover, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathies lead to
      fibrosis and a stiffer environment, affecting cardiomyocyte behavior. Here, we
      identify that single cardiomyocyte adhesions sense simultaneous (fast
      oscillating) cardiac and (slow) non-muscle myosin contractions. Together, these
      lead to oscillating tension on the mechanosensitive adaptor protein talin on
      substrates with a stiffness of healthy adult heart tissue, compared with no
      tension on embryonic heart stiffness and continuous stretching on fibrotic
      stiffness. Moreover, we show that activation of PKC leads to the induction of
      cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a stiffness-dependent way, through activation of
      non-muscle myosin. Finally, PKC and non-muscle myosin are upregulated at the
      costameres in heart disease, indicating aberrant mechanosensing as a contributing
      factor to long-term remodeling and heart failure.

AB  - The jaw is central to the extensive variety of feeding and predatory behaviors
      across vertebrates. The bones of the lower but not upper jaw form around an
      early-developing cartilage template. Whereas Endothelin1 patterns the lower jaw, 
      the factors that specify upper-jaw morphology remain elusive. Here, we identify
      Nuclear Receptor 2f genes (Nr2fs) as enriched in and required for upper-jaw
      formation in zebrafish. Combinatorial loss of Nr2fs transforms maxillary
      components of the upper jaw into lower-jaw-like structures. Conversely, nr2f5
      misexpression disrupts lower-jaw development. Genome-wide analyses reveal that
      Nr2fs repress mandibular gene expression and early chondrogenesis in maxillary
      precursors. Rescue of lower-jaw defects in endothelin1 mutants by reducing Nr2f
      dosage further demonstrates that Nr2f expression must be suppressed for normal
      lower-jaw development. We propose that Nr2fs shape the upper jaw by protecting
      maxillary progenitors from early chondrogenesis, thus preserving cells for later 
      osteogenesis.

AB  - Oriented cell division plays a key role in controlling organogenesis. The
      mechanisms for regulating division orientation at the whole-organ level are only 
      starting to become understood. By combining 3D time-lapse imaging, mouse
      genetics, and mathematical modeling, we find that global orientation of cell
      division is the result of a combination of two types of spindles with distinct
      spindle dynamic behaviors in the developing airway epithelium. Fixed spindles
      follow the classic long-axis rule and establish their division orientation before
      metaphase. In contrast, rotating spindles do not strictly follow the long-axis
      rule and determine their division orientation during metaphase. By using both a
      cell-based mechanical model and stretching-lung-explant experiments, we showed
      that mechanical force can function as a regulatory signal in maintaining the
      stable ratio between fixed spindles and rotating spindles. Our findings
      demonstrate that mechanical forces, cell geometry, and oriented cell division
      function together in a highly coordinated manner to ensure normal airway tube
      morphogenesis.

AB  - Conventional RNA interference (RNAi) pathways suppress eukaryotic gene expression
      at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. At the core of RNAi are
      small RNAs (sRNAs) and effector Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Arabidopsis AGO1 is
      known to bind microRNAs (miRNAs) and post-transcriptionally repress target genes 
      in the cytoplasm. Here, we report that AGO1 also binds to the chromatin of active
      genes and promotes their transcription. We show that sRNAs and SWI/SNF complexes 
      associate with nuclear AGO1 and are required for AGO1 binding to chromatin.
      Moreover, we show that various stimuli, including plant hormones and stresses,
      specifically trigger AGO1 binding to stimulus-responsive genes. Finally, we show 
      that AGO1 facilitates the induction of genes in jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways
      and the activation of JA responses. Our findings suggest that, by binding and
      facilitating the expression of stimuli-specific genes, AGO1 may regulate diverse 
      signaling pathways and associated biological processes.

AB  - ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with childhood acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL)
      functioning as a first-hit mutation that initiates a clinically silent
      pre-leukemia in utero. Because lineage commitment hierarchies differ between
      embryo and adult, and the impact of oncogenes is cell-context dependent, we
      hypothesized that the childhood affiliation of ETV6-RUNX1 cALL reflects its
      origins in a progenitor unique to embryonic life. We characterize the first
      emerging B cells in first-trimester human embryos, identifying a developmentally 
      restricted CD19(-)IL-7R(+) progenitor compartment, which transitions from a
      myeloid to lymphoid program during ontogeny. This developmental series is
      recapitulated in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), thereby
      providing a model for the initiation of cALL. Genome-engineered hPSCs expressing 
      ETV6-RUNX1 from the endogenous ETV6 locus show expansion of the CD19(-)IL-7R(+)
      compartment, show a partial block in B lineage commitment, and produce proB cells
      with aberrant myeloid gene expression signatures and potential: features
      (collectively) consistent with a pre-leukemic state.

TI  - Cooperative Accumulation of Dynein-Dynactin at Microtubule Minus-Ends Drives
      Microtubule Network Reorganization.

AB  - Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is a minus-end-directed motor protein that transports cargo 
      over long distances and organizes the intracellular microtubule (MT) network. How
      dynein motor activity is harnessed for these diverse functions remains unknown.
      Here, we have uncovered a mechanism for how processive dynein-dynactin complexes 
      drive MT-MT sliding, reorganization, and focusing, activities required for
      mitotic spindle assembly. We find that motors cooperatively accumulate, in
      limited numbers, at MT minus-ends. Minus-end accumulations drive MT-MT sliding,
      independent of MT orientation, resulting in the clustering of MT minus-ends. At a
      mesoscale level, activated dynein-dynactin drives the formation and coalescence
      of MT asters. Macroscopically, dynein-dynactin activity leads to bulk contraction
      of millimeter-scale MT networks, suggesting that minus-end accumulations of
      motors produce network-scale contractile stresses. Our data provide a model for
      how localized dynein activity is harnessed by cells to produce contractile
      stresses within the cytoskeleton, for example, during mitotic spindle assembly.

AB  - Stem cells must balance self-renewal and differentiation; thus, their activities 
      are precisely controlled. In plants, the control circuits that underlie division 
      and differentiation within meristems have been well studied, but those that
      underlie feedback on meristems from lateral organs remain largely unknown. Here
      we show that long-distance auxin transport mediates this feedback in a
      non-cell-autonomous manner. A low-auxin zone is associated with the shoot apical 
      meristem (SAM) organization center, and auxin levels negatively affect SAM size. 
      Using computational model simulations, we show that auxin transport from lateral 
      organs can inhibit auxin transport from the SAM through an auxin transport switch
      and thus maintain SAM auxin homeostasis and SAM size. Genetic and microsurgical
      analyses confirmed the model's predictions. In addition, the model explains
      temporary change in SAM size of yabby mutants. Our study suggests that the
      canalization-based auxin flux can be widely adapted as a feedback control
      mechanism in plants.

AB  - There exists a phenomenon in aging research whereby early life stress can have
      positive impacts on longevity. The mechanisms underlying these observations
      suggest a robust, long-lasting induction of cellular defense mechanisms. These
      include the various unfolded protein responses of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
      cytosol, and mitochondria. Indeed, ectopic induction of these pathways, in the
      absence of stress, is sufficient to increase lifespan in organisms as diverse as 
      yeast, worms, and flies. Here, we provide an overview of the protein quality
      control mechanisms that operate in the cytosol, mitochondria, and ER and discuss 
      how they affect cellular health and viability during stress and aging.

AB  - Mechanisms of selective autophagy of the ER, known as ER-phagy, require molecular
      delineation, particularly in vivo. It is unclear how these events control ER
      proteostasis and cellular health. Here, we identify cell-cycle progression gene 1
      (CCPG1), an ER-resident protein with no known physiological role, as a
      non-canonical cargo receptor that directly binds to core autophagy proteins via
      an LIR motif to mammalian ATG8 proteins and, independently and via a discrete
      motif, to FIP200. These interactions facilitate ER-phagy. The CCPG1 gene is
      inducible by the unfolded protein response and thus directly links ER stress to
      ER-phagy. In vivo, CCPG1 protects against ER luminal protein aggregation and
      consequent unfolded protein response hyperactivation and tissue injury of the
      exocrine pancreas. Thus, via identification of this autophagy protein, we
      describe an unexpected molecular mechanism of ER-phagy and provide evidence that 
      this may be physiologically relevant in ER luminal proteostasis.

AB  - Canonical Wnt signaling coordinates many critical aspects of embryonic
      development, while dysregulated Wnt signaling contributes to common diseases,
      including congenital malformations and cancer. The nuclear localization of
      beta-catenin is the defining step in pathway activation. However, despite
      intensive investigation, the mechanisms regulating beta-catenin nuclear transport
      remain undefined. In a patient with congenital heart disease and heterotaxy, a
      disorder of left-right patterning, we previously identified the guanine
      nucleotide exchange factor, RAPGEF5. Here, we demonstrate that RAPGEF5 regulates 
      left-right patterning via Wnt signaling. In particular, RAPGEF5 regulates the
      nuclear translocation of beta-catenin independently of both beta-catenin
      cytoplasmic stabilization and the importin beta1/Ran-mediated transport system.
      We propose a model whereby RAPGEF5 activates the nuclear GTPases, Rap1a/b, to
      facilitate the nuclear transport of beta-catenin, defining a parallel nuclear
      transport pathway to Ran. Our results suggest new targets for modulating Wnt
      signaling in disease states.

AB  - Many tissues fold into complex shapes during development. Controlling this
      process in vitro would represent an important advance for tissue engineering. We 
      use embryonic tissue explants, finite element modeling, and 3D cell-patterning
      techniques to show that mechanical compaction of the extracellular matrix during 
      mesenchymal condensation is sufficient to drive tissue folding along programmed
      trajectories. The process requires cell contractility, generates strains at
      tissue interfaces, and causes patterns of collagen alignment around and between
      condensates. Aligned collagen fibers support elevated tensions that promote the
      folding of interfaces along paths that can be predicted by modeling. We
      demonstrate the robustness and versatility of this strategy for sculpting tissue 
      interfaces by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of folded tissue forms
      from patterns of mesenchymal condensates. These studies provide insight into the 
      active mechanical properties of the embryonic mesenchyme and establish
      engineering strategies for more robustly directing tissue morphogenesis ex vivo.

AB  - Spatial organization of phospholipid synthesis in eukaryotes is critical for
      cellular homeostasis. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most
      abundant cellular phospholipid, occurs redundantly via the ER-localized Kennedy
      pathway and a pathway that traverses the ER and mitochondria via membrane contact
      sites. The basis of the ER-mitochondrial PC synthesis pathway is the exclusive
      mitochondrial localization of a key pathway enzyme, phosphatidylserine
      decarboxylase Psd1, which generates phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). We find that
      Psd1 is localized to both mitochondria and the ER. Our data indicate that
      Psd1-dependent PE made at mitochondria and the ER has separable cellular
      functions. In addition, the relative organellar localization of Psd1 is
      dynamically modulated based on metabolic needs. These data reveal a critical role
      for ER-localized Psd1 in cellular phospholipid homeostasis, question the
      significance of an ER-mitochondrial PC synthesis pathway to cellular phospholipid
      homeostasis, and establish the importance of fine spatial regulation of lipid
      biosynthesis for cellular functions.

AB  - Specification of the three germ layers by graded Nodal signaling has long been
      seen as a paradigm for patterning through a single morphogen gradient. However,
      by exploiting the unique properties of the zebrafish embryo to capture the
      dynamics of signaling and cell fate allocation, we now demonstrate that Nodal
      functions in an incoherent feedforward loop, together with Fgf, to determine the 
      pattern of endoderm and mesoderm specification. We show that Nodal induces
      long-range Fgf signaling while simultaneously inducing the cell-autonomous Fgf
      signaling inhibitor Dusp4 within the first two cell tiers from the margin. The
      consequent attenuation of Fgf signaling in these cells allows specification of
      endoderm progenitors, while the cells further from the margin, which receive
      Nodal and/or Fgf signaling, are specified as mesoderm. This elegant model
      demonstrates the necessity of feedforward and feedback interactions between
      multiple signaling pathways for providing cells with temporal and positional
      information.

AB  - Understanding the molecular basis of morphological change remains a central
      challenge in evolutionary-developmental biology. The transition from outbreeding 
      to selfing is often associated with a dramatic reduction in reproductive
      structures and functions, such as the loss of attractive pheromones in
      hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis elegans and a reduced flower size in plants. Here, 
      we demonstrate that variation in the level of the brassinosteroid-biosynthesis
      enzyme CYP724A1 contributes to the reduced flower size of selfing Capsella
      rubella compared with its outbreeding ancestor Capsella grandiflora. The primary 
      transcript of the C. rubella allele is spliced more efficiently than that of C.
      grandiflora, resulting in higher brassinosteroid levels. These restrict organ
      growth by limiting cell proliferation. More efficient splicing of the C. rubella 
      allele results from two de novo mutations in the selfing lineage. Thus, our
      results highlight the potentially widespread importance of differential splicing 
      efficiency and higher-than-optimal hormone levels in generating phenotypic
      variation.

AB  - Truncating mutations in the sarcomere protein titin cause dilated cardiomyopathy 
      due to sarcomere insufficiency. However, it remains mechanistically unclear how
      these mutations decrease sarcomere content in cardiomyocytes. Utilizing human
      induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, CRISPR/Cas9, and live
      microscopy, we characterize the fundamental mechanisms of human cardiac sarcomere
      formation. We observe that sarcomerogenesis initiates at protocostameres, sites
      of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, where nucleation and centripetal assembly 
      of alpha-actinin-2-containing fibers provide a template for the fusion of Z-disk 
      precursors, Z bodies, and subsequent striation. We identify that beta-cardiac
      myosin-titin-protocostamere form an essential mechanical connection that
      transmits forces required to direct alpha-actinin-2 centripetal fiber assembly
      and sarcomere formation. Titin propagates diastolic traction stresses from
      beta-cardiac myosin, but not alpha-cardiac myosin or non-muscle myosin II, to
      protocostameres during sarcomerogenesis. Ablating protocostameres or decoupling
      titin from protocostameres abolishes sarcomere assembly. Together these results
      identify the mechanical and molecular components critical for human cardiac
      sarcomerogenesis.

AB  - Cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are the main storage organelles for metabolic
      energy in most cells. They are unusual organelles that are bounded by a
      phospholipid monolayer and specific surface proteins, including key enzymes of
      lipid and energy metabolism. Proteins targeting LDs from the cytoplasm often
      contain amphipathic helices, but how they bind to LDs is not well understood.
      Combining computer simulations with experimental studies in vitro and in cells,
      we uncover a general mechanism for targeting of cytosolic proteins to LDs: large 
      hydrophobic residues of amphipathic helices detect and bind to large, persistent 
      membrane packing defects that are unique to the LD surface. Surprisingly,
      amphipathic helices with large hydrophobic residues from many different proteins 
      are capable of binding to LDs. This suggests that LD protein composition is
      additionally determined by mechanisms that selectively prevent proteins from
      binding LDs, such as macromolecular crowding at the LD surface.

AB  - The endomembrane system consists of the secretory and endocytic pathways, which
      communicate by transport to and from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In mammalian 
      cells, the endocytic pathway includes early, late, and recycling endosomes. In
      budding yeast, different types of endosomes have been described, but the
      organization of the endocytic pathway has remained unclear. We performed a
      spatial and temporal analysis of yeast endosomal markers and endocytic cargoes.
      Our results indicate that the yeast TGN also serves as an early and recycling
      endosome. In addition, as previously described, yeast contains a late or
      prevacuolar endosome (PVE). Endocytic cargoes localize to the TGN shortly after
      internalization, and manipulations that perturb export from the TGN can slow the 
      passage of endocytic cargoes to the PVE. Yeast apparently lacks a distinct early 
      endosome. Thus, yeast has a simple endocytic pathway that may reflect the
      ancestral organization of the endomembrane system.

AB  - Wild-type Drosophila cells can remove cells heterozygous for ribosomal protein
      mutations (known as "Minute" mutant cells) from genetic mosaics, a process termed
      cell competition. The ribosomal protein S12 was unusual because cells
      heterozygous for rpS12 mutations were not competed by wild-type, and a viable
      missense mutation in rpS12 protected Minute cells from cell competition with
      wild-type cells. Furthermore, cells with Minute mutations were induced to compete
      with one another by altering the gene dose of rpS12, eliminating cells with more 
      rpS12 than their neighbors. Thus RpS12 has a special function in cell competition
      that defines the competitiveness of cells. We propose that cell competition
      between wild-type and Minute cells is initiated by a signal of ribosomal protein 
      haploinsufficiency mediated by RpS12. Since competition between cells expressing 
      different levels of Myc did not require RpS12, other kinds of cell competition
      may be initiated differently.

AB  - To uncover regulatory mechanisms in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, we conducted
      genome-wide screens to identify positive and negative pathway components and
      validated top hits using multiple signaling and differentiation assays in two
      different cell types. Most positive regulators identified in our screens,
      including Rab34, Pdcl, and Tubd1, were involved in ciliary functions, confirming 
      the central role for primary cilia in Hh signaling. Negative regulators
      identified included Megf8, Mgrn1, and an unannotated gene encoding a tetraspan
      protein we named Atthog. The function of these negative regulators converged on
      Smoothened (SMO), an oncoprotein that transduces the Hh signal across the
      membrane. In the absence of Atthog, SMO was stabilized at the cell surface and
      concentrated in the ciliary membrane, boosting cell sensitivity to the ligand
      Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and consequently altering SHH-guided neural cell-fate
      decisions. Thus, we uncovered genes that modify the interpretation of morphogen
      signals by regulating protein-trafficking events in target cells.

AB  - Lipid droplet (LD) functions are regulated by a complement of integral and
      peripheral proteins that associate with the bounding LD phospholipid monolayer.
      Defining the composition of the LD proteome has remained a challenge due to the
      presence of contaminating proteins in LD-enriched buoyant fractions. To overcome 
      this limitation, we developed a proximity labeling strategy that exploits
      LD-targeted APEX2 to biotinylate LD proteins in living cells. Application of this
      approach to two different cell types identified the vast majority of previously
      validated LD proteins, excluded common contaminating proteins, and revealed new
      LD proteins. Moreover, quantitative analysis of LD proteome dynamics uncovered a 
      role for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in controlling the
      composition of the LD proteome. These data provide an important resource for
      future LD studies and demonstrate the utility of proximity labeling to study the 
      regulation of LD proteomes.

AB  - The reduction in the red to far-red light ratio (R/FR) and photosynthetically
      active radiation caused by dense planting initiates shade avoidance responses
      (SARs) to help plants compete against their neighbors. However, deep shade
      attenuates shade-induced stem elongation to suppress excessive reversion toward
      skotomorphogenic development, in which photoreceptor phytochrome A (PHYA) has
      been known to play the major role. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
      PHYA function in deep shade is poorly understood. Here, we report that
      shade-accumulated PHYA can release auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA),
      suppressors in the auxin signaling pathway, from SCF(TIR1), an auxin receptor, to
      weaken auxin signaling and negatively regulate shade response. Corroborating
      this, phyA mutants display an enhanced auxin response to deep shade and auxin
      treatment. Specifically, PHYA competes with TIR1 by directly binding and
      stabilizing AUX/IAA. Our findings illustrate a mechanistic model of how plants
      sense different shade levels to fine-tune auxin signaling and generate
      appropriate SAR.

AB  - The optic neuroepithelial continuum of vertebrate eye develops into three
      differentially growing compartments: the retina, the ciliary margin (CM), and the
      retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Neurofibromin 2 (Nf2) is strongly expressed in 
      slowly expanding RPE and CM compartments, and the loss of mouse Nf2 causes
      hyperplasia in these compartments, replicating the ocular abnormalities seen in
      human NF2 patients. The hyperplastic ocular phenotypes were largely suppressed by
      heterozygous deletion of Yap and Taz, key targets of the Nf2-Hippo signaling
      pathway. We also found that, in addition to feedback transcriptional regulation
      of Nf2 by Yap/Taz in the CM, activation of Nf2 expression by Mitf in the RPE and 
      suppression by Sox2 in retinal progenitor cells are necessary for the
      differential growth of the corresponding cell populations. Together, our findings
      reveal that Nf2 is a key player that orchestrates the differential growth of
      optic neuroepithelial compartments during vertebrate eye development.

AB  - Cilia are organelles specialized for movement and signaling. To infer when during
      evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the
      proteomes of cilia from sea urchins, sea anemones, and choanoflagellates. We
      identified 437 high-confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals
      and discovered that Hedgehog and G-protein-coupled receptor pathways were linked 
      to cilia before the origin of bilateria and transient receptor potential (TRP)
      channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that candidates not
      previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further
      investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein identified in the cilia of 
      all three organisms. ENKUR localizes to motile cilia and is required for
      patterning the left-right axis in vertebrates. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes
      situs inversus in humans. Thus, proteomic profiling of cilia from diverse
      eukaryotes defines a conserved ciliary proteome, reveals ancient connections to
      signaling, and uncovers a ciliary protein that underlies development and human
      disease.

AB  - Improvement of chilling tolerance is a major target in rice breeding. The
      signaling pathways regulating chilling consist of complex networks, including key
      transcription factors and their targets. However, it remains largely unknown how 
      transcription factors are activated by chilling stress. Here, we report that the 
      transcription factor OsbHLH002/OsICE1 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3 under chilling
      stress. The osbhlh002-1 knockout mutant and antisense transgenic plants showed
      chilling hypersensitivity, whereas OsbHLH002-overexpressing plants exhibited
      enhanced chilling tolerance. OsbHLH002 can directly target OsTPP1, which encodes 
      a key enzyme for trehalose biosynthesis. OsMAPK3 interacts with OsbHLH002 to
      prevent its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase OsHOS1. Under chilling stress, active
      OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002,
      which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance
      to chilling damage. Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is
      phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target
      OsTPP1 during chilling stress.

AB  - Autophagy and autophagy-related genes (Atg) have been attributed prominent roles 
      in tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles called
      exosomes are also implicated in cancer metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that
      exosome production is strongly reduced in cells lacking Atg5 and Atg16L1, but
      this is independent of Atg7 and canonical autophagy. Atg5 specifically decreases 
      acidification of late endosomes where exosomes are produced, disrupting the
      acidifying V1V0-ATPase by removing a regulatory component, ATP6V1E1, into
      exosomes. The effect of Atg5 on exosome production promotes the migration and in 
      vivo metastasis of orthotopic breast cancer cells. These findings uncover
      mechanisms controlling exosome release and identify means by which
      autophagy-related genes can contribute to metastasis in autophagy-independent
      pathways.

AB  - Maintaining cell fate relies on robust mechanisms that prevent the
      differentiation of specified cells into other cell types. This is especially
      critical during embryogenesis, when extensive cell proliferation, patterning, and
      migration events take place. Here we show that vertebrate primordial germ cells
      (PGCs) are protected from reprogramming into other cell types by the RNA-binding 
      protein Dead end (Dnd). PGCs knocked down for Dnd lose their characteristic
      morphology and adopt various somatic cell fates. Concomitantly, they gain a gene 
      expression profile reflecting differentiation into cells of different germ
      layers, in a process that we could direct by expression of specific cell-fate
      determinants. Importantly, we visualized these events within live zebrafish
      embryos, which provide temporal information regarding cell reprogramming. Our
      results shed light on the mechanisms controlling germ cell fate maintenance and
      are relevant for the formation of teratoma, a tumor class composed of cells from 
      more than one germ layer.

AB  - The attenuation of ancestral pro-regenerative pathways may explain why humans do 
      not efficiently regenerate damaged organs. Vertebrate lineages that exhibit
      robust regeneration, including the teleost zebrafish, provide insights into the
      maintenance of adult regenerative capacity. Using established models of spinal
      cord, heart, and retina regeneration, we discovered that zebrafish Treg-like
      (zTreg) cells rapidly homed to damaged organs. Conditional ablation of zTreg
      cells blocked organ regeneration by impairing precursor cell proliferation. In
      addition to modulating inflammation, infiltrating zTreg cells stimulated
      regeneration through interleukin-10-independent secretion of organ-specific
      regenerative factors (Ntf3: spinal cord; Nrg1: heart; Igf1: retina). Recombinant 
      regeneration factors rescued the regeneration defects associated with zTreg cell 
      depletion, whereas Foxp3a-deficient zTreg cells infiltrated damaged organs but
      failed to express regenerative factors. Our data delineate organ-specific roles
      for Treg cells in maintaining pro-regenerative capacity that could potentially be
      harnessed for diverse regenerative therapies.

AB  - Clinical and genetic heterogeneity associated with retinal diseases makes
      stem-cell-based therapies an attractive strategy for personalized medicine.
      However, we have limited understanding of the timing of key events in the
      developing human retina, and in particular the factors critical for generating
      the unique architecture of the fovea and surrounding macula. Here we define three
      key epochs in the transcriptome dynamics of human retina from fetal day (D) 52 to
      136. Coincident histological analyses confirmed the cellular basis of
      transcriptional changes and highlighted the dramatic acceleration of development 
      in the fovea compared with peripheral retina. Human and mouse retinal
      transcriptomes show remarkable similarity in developmental stages, although
      morphogenesis was greatly expanded in humans. Integration of DNA accessibility
      data allowed us to reconstruct transcriptional networks controlling photoreceptor
      differentiation. Our studies provide insights into human retinal development and 
      serve as a resource for molecular staging of human stem-cell-derived retinal
      organoids.

      Suppressing dATM Expression.

AB  - To understand the consequences of the complete elimination of E2F regulation, we 
      profiled the proteome of Drosophila dDP mutants that lack functional E2F/DP
      complexes. The results uncovered changes in the larval fat body, a differentiated
      tissue that grows via endocycles. We report an unexpected mechanism of E2F/DP
      action that promotes quiescence in this tissue. In the fat body, dE2F/dDP limits 
      cell-cycle progression by suppressing DNA damage responses. Loss of dDP
      upregulates dATM, allowing cells to sense and repair DNA damage and increasing
      replication of loci that are normally under-replicated in wild-type tissues.
      Genetic experiments show that ectopic dATM is sufficient to promote DNA synthesis
      in wild-type fat body cells. Strikingly, reducing dATM levels in dDP-deficient
      fat bodies restores cell-cycle control, improves tissue morphology, and extends
      animal development. These results show that, in some cellular contexts,
      dE2F/dDP-dependent suppression of DNA damage signaling is key for cell-cycle
      control and needed for normal development.

AB  - Mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) cooperates with Hedgehog (HH) signaling,
      but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we provide
      genetic, biochemical, and pharmacologic evidence that MTOR complex 1
      (mTORC1)-dependent translation is a prerequisite for HH signaling. The genetic
      loss of mTORC1 function inhibited HH signaling-driven growth of the cerebellum
      and medulloblastoma. Inhibiting translation or mTORC1 blocked HH signaling.
      Depleting 4EBP1, an mTORC1 target that inhibits translation, alleviated the
      dependence of HH signaling on mTORC1. Consistent with this, phosphorylated 4EBP1 
      levels were elevated in HH signaling-driven medulloblastomas in mice and humans. 
      In mice, an mTORC1 inhibitor suppressed medulloblastoma driven by a mutant SMO
      that is inherently resistant to existing SMO inhibitors, prolonging the survival 
      of the mice. Our study reveals that mTORC1-mediated translation is a key
      component of HH signaling and an important target for treating medulloblastoma
      and other cancers driven by HH signaling.

      Survival and Affects Organ Size.

AB  - The Hippo/Yki and RB/E2F pathways both regulate tissue growth by affecting cell
      proliferation and survival, but interactions between these parallel control
      systems are poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that interaction
      between Drosophila E2F1 and Sd disrupts Yki/Sd complex formation and thereby
      suppresses Yki target gene expression. RBF modifies these effects by reducing
      E2F1/Sd interaction. This regulation has significant effects on apoptosis, organ 
      size, and progenitor cell proliferation. Using a combination of DamID-seq and
      RNA-seq, we identified a set of Yki targets that play a diversity of roles during
      development and are suppressed by E2F1. Further, we found that human E2F1
      competes with YAP for TEAD1 binding, affecting YAP activity, indicating that this
      mode of cross-regulation is conserved. In sum, our study uncovers a previously
      unknown mechanism in which RBF and E2F1 modify Hippo signaling responses to
      modulate apoptosis, organ growth, and homeostasis.

AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays a central role in diverse cellular
      processes. GSK3 has two mammalian isozymes, GSK3alpha and GSK3beta, whose
      functions remain ill-defined because of a lack of inhibitors that can distinguish
      between the two highly homologous isozymes. Here, we show that GSK3alpha and
      GSK3beta can be selectively inhibited in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using 
      a chemical-genetic approach. Selective inhibition of GSK3beta is sufficient to
      maintain mouse ESC self-renewal, whereas GSK3alpha inhibition promotes mouse ESC 
      differentiation toward neural lineages. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis
      reveals that GSK3alpha and GSK3beta have distinct sets of downstream targets.
      Furthermore, selective inhibition of individual GSK3 isozymes yields distinct
      phenotypes from gene deletion, highlighting the power of the chemical-genetic
      approach in dissecting kinase catalytic functions from the protein's scaffolding 
      functions. Our study opens new avenues for defining GSK3 isozyme-specific
      functions in various cellular processes.

AB  - Interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages play critical
      roles in the initiation of tumor cell motility. To capture the cellular
      interactions of the tumor microenvironment with high-resolution imaging, we
      directly visualized tumor cells and their interactions with macrophages in
      zebrafish. Live imaging in zebrafish revealed that macrophages are dynamic, yet
      maintain sustained contact with tumor cells. In addition, the recruitment of
      macrophages to tumor cells promotes tumor cell dissemination. Using a Cre/LoxP
      strategy, we found that macrophages transfer cytoplasm to tumor cells in
      zebrafish and mouse models. Remarkably, macrophage cytoplasmic transfer
      correlated with melanoma cell dissemination. We further found that macrophages
      transfer cytoplasm to tumor cells upon cell contact in vitro. Thus, we present a 
      model in which macrophage/tumor cell contact allows for the transfer of
      cytoplasmic molecules from macrophages to tumor cells corresponding to increased 
      tumor cell motility and dissemination.

AB  - Within tumors, macrophage infiltration can promote cancer cell invasiveness and, 
      consequently, metastatic dissemination. In this issue of Developmental Cell,
      Roh-Johnson et al. (2017) reveal that cytoplasmic transfer from macrophages to
      melanoma cells correlates with melanoma invasion and arises as a result of
      intimate cell-cell contact.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Goudarzi et al. (2017) examine the membrane 
      source that allows bleb-based cell migration in vivo. Their work reminds us of
      the fractal nature of cell surfaces and highlights how the unfolding of these
      convoluted surfaces contributes to physiologically relevant cell shape change in 
      intact organisms.

AB  - Oxysterol binding protein-related proteins (ORPs) are conserved lipid binding
      polypeptides, enriched at ER contacts sites. ORPs promote non-vesicular lipid
      transport and work as lipid sensors in the context of many cellular tasks, but
      the determinants of their distinct localization and function are not understood. 
      Here, we demonstrate that the yeast endocytic invaginations associate with the ER
      and that this association specifically requires the ORPs Osh2 and Osh3, which
      bridge the endocytic myosin-I Myo5 to the ER integral-membrane VAMP-associated
      protein (VAP) Scs2. Disruption of the ER contact with endocytic sites using ORP, 
      VAP, myosin-I, or reticulon mutants delays and weakens actin polymerization and
      interferes with vesicle scission. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that
      ORP-dependent sterol transfer facilitates actin polymerization at endocytic
      sites.

      Invaginations.

AB  - Cell migration is essential for morphogenesis, organ formation, and homeostasis, 
      with relevance for clinical conditions. The migration of primordial germ cells
      (PGCs) is a useful model for studying this process in the context of the
      developing embryo. Zebrafish PGC migration depends on the formation of cellular
      protrusions in form of blebs, a type of protrusion found in various cell types.
      Here we report on the mechanisms allowing the inflation of the membrane during
      bleb formation. We show that the rapid expansion of the protrusion depends on
      membrane invaginations that are localized preferentially at the cell front. The
      formation of these invaginations requires the function of Cdc42, and their
      unfolding allows bleb inflation and dynamic cell-shape changes performed by
      migrating cells. Inhibiting the formation and release of the invaginations
      strongly interfered with bleb formation, cell motility, and the ability of the
      cells to reach their target.

AB  - Mammals cannot re-form heavily damaged bones as in large fracture gaps, whereas
      zebrafish efficiently regenerate bones even after amputation of appendages.
      However, the source of osteoblasts that mediate appendage regeneration is
      controversial. Several studies in zebrafish have shown that osteoblasts are
      generated by dedifferentiation of existing osteoblasts at injured sites, but
      other observations suggest that de novo production of osteoblasts also occurs. In
      this study, we found from cell-lineage tracing and ablation experiments that a
      group of cells reserved in niches serves as osteoblast progenitor cells (OPCs)
      and has a significant role in fin ray regeneration. Besides regeneration, OPCs
      also supply osteoblasts for normal bone maintenance. We further showed that OPCs 
      are derived from embryonic somites, as is the case with embryonic osteoblasts,
      and are replenished from mesenchymal precursors in adult zebrafish. Our findings 
      reveal that reserved progenitors are a significant and complementary source of
      osteoblasts for zebrafish bone regeneration.

AB  - Low temperatures affect plant growth, development, productivity, and ecological
      distribution. Expression of the C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) transcription
      factors is induced by cold stress, which in turn activates downstream
      cold-responsive (COR) genes that are required for the acquisition of freezing
      tolerance. Inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1) is a master regulator of CBFs, and 
      ICE1 stability is crucial for its function. However, the regulation of ICE1 is
      not well understood. Here, we report that mitogen-activated protein kinase 3
      (MPK3) and MPK6 interact with and phosphorylate ICE1, which reduces its stability
      and transcriptional activity. Consistently, the mpk3 and mpk6 single mutants and 
      the mpk3 mpk6 double mutants show enhanced freezing tolerance, whereas MPK3/MPK6 
      activation attenuates freezing tolerance. Phosphor-inactive mutations of ICE1
      complement freezing sensitivity in the ice1-2 mutant. These combined results
      indicate that MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylate and destabilize ICE1, which negatively
      regulates CBF expression and freezing tolerance in plants.

AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades are important signaling modules that
      convert environmental stimuli into cellular responses. We show that MPK3, MPK4,
      and MPK6 are rapidly activated after cold treatment. The mpk3 and mpk6 mutants
      display increased expression of CBF genes and enhanced freezing tolerance,
      whereas constitutive activation of the MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade in plants causes
      reduced expression of CBF genes and hypersensitivity to freezing, suggesting that
      the MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade negatively regulates the cold response. MPK3 and MPK6
      can phosphorylate ICE1, a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor that
      regulates the expression of CBF genes, and the phosphorylation promotes the
      degradation of ICE1. Interestingly, the MEKK1-MKK2-MPK4 pathway constitutively
      suppresses MPK3 and MPK6 activities and has a positive role in the cold response.
      Furthermore, the MAPKKK YDA and two calcium/calmodulin-regulated receptor-like
      kinases, CRLK1 and CRLK2, negatively modulate the cold activation of MPK3/6. Our 
      results uncover important roles of MAPK cascades in the regulation of plant cold 
      response.

AB  - Single-cell measurements have broadened our understanding of heterogeneity in
      biology, yet have been limited to mostly observational studies of normal or
      globally perturbed systems. Typically, perturbations are utilized in an
      open-ended approach wherein an endpoint is assayed during or after the biological
      event of interest. Here we describe ShootingStar, a platform for perturbation
      analysis in vivo, which combines live imaging, real-time image analysis, and
      automated optical perturbations. ShootingStar builds a quantitative record of the
      state of the sample being analyzed, which is used to automate the identification 
      of target cells for perturbation, as well as to validate the impacts of the
      perturbation. We used ShootingStar to dissect the cellular basis of development, 
      morphogenesis, and polarity in the lateral line of Danio rerio and the embryo of 
      Caenorhabditis elegans. ShootingStar can be extended to diverse optical
      manipulations and enables more robust and informative single-cell perturbations
      in complex tissues.

AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs by bending and remodeling of the membrane
      underneath the coat. Bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domain proteins are crucial for
      endocytic membrane remodeling, but how their activity is spatiotemporally
      controlled is largely unknown. We demonstrate that the membrane remodeling
      activity of sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), a late-acting endocytic PX-BAR domain protein
      required for constriction of U-shaped endocytic intermediates, is controlled by
      an allosteric structural switch involving coincident detection of the clathrin
      adaptor AP2 and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) at endocytic
      sites. Structural, biochemical, and cell biological data show that SNX9 is
      autoinhibited in solution. Binding to PI(3,4)P2 via its PX-BAR domain, and
      concomitant association with AP2 via sequences in the linker region, releases
      SNX9 autoinhibitory contacts to enable membrane constriction. Our results reveal 
      a mechanism for restricting the latent membrane remodeling activity of BAR domain
      proteins to allow spatiotemporal coupling of membrane constriction to the
      progression of the endocytic pathway.

AB  - Assembly of the endocytic machinery is a constitutively active process that is
      important for the organization of the plasma membrane, signal transduction, and
      membrane trafficking. Existing research has focused on the stochastic nature of
      endocytosis. Here, we report the emergence of the collective dynamics of
      endocytic proteins as periodic traveling waves on the cell surface. Coordinated
      clathrin assembly provides the earliest spatial cue for cortical waves and sets
      the direction of propagation. Surprisingly, the onset of clathrin waves, but not 
      individual endocytic events, requires feedback from downstream factors, including
      FBP17, Cdc42, and N-WASP. In addition to the localized endocytic assembly at the 
      plasma membrane, intracellular clathrin and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate
      predict the excitability of the plasma membrane and modulate the geometry of
      traveling waves. Collectively, our data demonstrate the multiplicity of clathrin 
      functions in cortical pattern formation and provide important insights regarding 
      the nucleation and propagation of single-cell patterns.

AB  - Dynamic spatial patterns such as traveling waves could theoretically encode
      spatial information, but little is known about whether or how they are employed
      by biological systems, especially higher eukaryotes. Here, we show that
      concentric target or spiral waves of active Cdc42 and the F-BAR protein FBP17 are
      invoked in adherent cells at the onset of mitosis. These waves predict the future
      sites of cell divisions and represent the earliest known spatial cues for furrow 
      assembly. Unlike interphase waves, the frequencies and wavelengths of the mitotic
      waves display size-dependent scaling properties. While the positioning role of
      the metaphase waves requires microtubule dynamics, spindle and
      microtubule-independent inhibitory signals are propagated by the mitotic waves to
      ensure the singularity of furrow formation. Taken together, we propose that
      metaphase cortical waves integrate positional and cell size information for
      division-plane specification in adhesion-dependent cytokinesis.

      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous carcinoma
      in which various tumor-suppressor genes are lost by mutation, deletion, or
      silencing. Here we report a tumor-suppressive mode of action for
      growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and an unusual mechanism of its
      inactivation in TNBC. GDF11 promotes an epithelial, anti-invasive phenotype in 3D
      triple-negative cultures and intraductal xenografts by sustaining expression of
      E-cadherin and inhibitor of differentiation 2 (ID2). Surprisingly, clinical TNBCs
      retain the GDF11 locus and expression of the protein itself. GDF11 bioactivity is
      instead lost because of deficiencies in its convertase, proprotein convertase
      subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), causing inactive GDF11 precursor to accumulate
      intracellularly. PCSK5 reconstitution mobilizes the latent TNBC reservoir of
      GDF11 in vitro and suppresses triple-negative mammary cancer metastasis to the
      lung of syngeneic hosts. Intracellular GDF11 retention adds to the concept of
      tumor-suppressor inactivation and reveals a cell-biological vulnerability for
      TNBCs lacking therapeutically actionable mutations.

AB  - Invasive cells use small invadopodia to breach basement membrane (BM), a dense
      matrix that encases tissues. Following the breach, a large protrusion forms to
      clear a path for tissue entry by poorly understood mechanisms. Using RNAi
      screening for defects in Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell (AC) invasion, we
      found that UNC-6(netrin)/UNC-40(DCC) signaling at the BM breach site directs
      exocytosis of lysosomes using the exocyst and SNARE SNAP-29 to form a large
      protrusion that invades vulval tissue. Live-cell imaging revealed that the
      protrusion is enriched in the matrix metalloprotease ZMP-1 and transiently
      expands AC volume by more than 20%, displacing surrounding BM and vulval
      epithelium. Photobleaching and genetic perturbations showed that the BM receptor 
      dystroglycan forms a membrane diffusion barrier at the neck of the protrusion,
      which enables protrusion growth. Together these studies define a netrin-dependent
      pathway that builds an invasive protrusion, an isolated lysosome-derived membrane
      structure specialized to breach tissue barriers.

AB  - Tissues have a natural capacity to replace dying cells and to heal wounds. This
      ability resides in resident stem cells, which self-renew, preserve, and repair
      their tissue during homeostasis and following injury. The skin epidermis and its 
      appendages are subjected to daily assaults from the external environment. A high 
      demand is placed on renewal and regeneration of the skin's barrier in order to
      protect the body from infection and dehydration and to heal wounds. This review
      focuses on the epithelial stem cells of skin, where they come from, where they
      reside, and how they function in normal homeostasis and wound repair.

AB  - Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are critical for the clearance of large
      pathogens and are also implicated in thrombosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. In
      this issue of Developmental Cell, Amulic et al. (2017) show that the terminally
      differentiated, non-cycling neutrophils repurpose cell-cycle proteins and
      pathways to form NETs.

AB  - Cell invasion across basement membrane barriers is important in both normal
      development and cancer metastasis. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Naegeli
      et al. (2017) identify a mechanism for breaching basement membranes. Localized
      lysosome exocytosis fuels generation of large, invasive cellular protrusions that
      expand tiny basement membrane openings.

AB  - Under conditions of homeostasis, dynamic changes in the length of individual
      adherens junctions (AJs) provide epithelia with the fluidity required to maintain
      tissue integrity in the face of intrinsic and extrinsic forces. While the
      contribution of AJ remodeling to developmental morphogenesis has been intensively
      studied, less is known about AJ dynamics in other circumstances. Here, we study
      AJ dynamics in an epithelium that undergoes a gradual increase in packing order, 
      without concomitant large-scale changes in tissue size or shape. We find that
      neighbor exchange events are driven by stochastic fluctuations in junction
      length, regulated in part by junctional actomyosin. In this context, the
      developmental increase of isotropic junctional actomyosin reduces the rate of
      neighbor exchange, contributing to tissue order. We propose a model in which the 
      local variance in tension between junctions determines whether actomyosin-based
      forces will inhibit or drive the topological transitions that either refine or
      deform a tissue.

AB  - Neutrophils are essential for immune defense and can respond to infection by
      releasing chromatin in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Here we
      show that NETs are induced by mitogens and accompanied by induction of cell-cycle
      markers, including phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and lamins,
      nuclear envelope breakdown, and duplication of centrosomes. We identify
      cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) as essential regulators of NETs and
      show that the response is inhibited by the cell-cycle inhibitor p21(Cip). CDK6,
      in neutrophils, is required for clearance of the fungal pathogen Candida
      albicans. Our data describe a function for CDK4/6 in immunity.

AB  - Cell migration plays a pivotal role in morphogenetic and pathogenetic processes. 
      To achieve directional migration, cells must establish a front-to-rear axis of
      polarity. Here we show that components of the cadherin-catenin complex function
      to stabilize this front-rear polarity. Neural crest and glioblastoma cells
      undergo directional migration in vivo or in vitro. During this process,
      alphaE-catenin accumulated at lamellipodial membranes and then moved toward the
      rear with the support of a tyrosine-phosphorylated beta-catenin. This relocating 
      alphaE-catenin bound to p115RhoGEF, leading to gathering of active RhoA in front 
      of the nucleus where myosin-IIB arcs assemble. When catenins or p115RhoGEF were
      removed, cells lost the polarized myosin-IIB assembly, as well as the capability 
      for directional movement. These results suggest that, apart from its well-known
      function in cell adhesion, the beta-catenin/alphaE-catenin complex regulates
      directional cell migration by restricting active RhoA to perinuclear regions and 
      controlling myosin-IIB dynamics at these sites.

AB  - Puberty is characterized by dynamic tissue remodeling in the mammary gland
      involving ductal elongation, resolution into the mature epithelial bilayer, and
      lumen formation. To decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying these processes, 
      we studied the fate of putative stem cells, termed cap cells, present in terminal
      end buds of pubertal mice. Employing a p63(CreERT2)-based lineage-tracing
      strategy, we identified a unipotent fate for proliferative cap cells that only
      generated cells with basal features. Furthermore, we observed that dislocated
      "cap-in-body" cells underwent apoptosis, which aided lumen formation during
      ductal development. Basal lineage-specific profiling and genetic loss-of-function
      experiments revealed a critical role for FOXO transcription factors in mediating 
      these proliferative versus apoptotic fates. Importantly, these studies revealed a
      mode of WNT signaling-mediated FOXO1 inhibition, potentially mediated through
      AKT. Together, these data suggest that the WNT pathway confers proliferative and 
      survival advantages on cap cells via regulation of FOXO1 localization.

TI  - The Zygotic Transition Is Initiated in Unicellular Plant Zygotes with Asymmetric 
      Activation of Parental Genomes.

AB  - The zygotic transition, from a fertilized egg to an embryo, is central to animal 
      and plant reproduction. Animal embryos depend upon maternally provided factors
      until zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In plants, the timing and parental genome 
      contributions to ZGA are unresolved. Here, we use the flowering plant Oryza
      sativa (rice) to characterize transcriptomes of time-staged isogenic and hybrid
      zygotes following fertilization. Large-scale transcriptomic changes were observed
      in unicellular zygotes, including upregulation of S-phase genes, a characteristic
      of ZGA. The parental contributions to ZGA were highly asymmetric. Zygotic
      transcription was primarily from the maternal genome and included genes for basic
      cellular processes. Transcription of the paternal genome was highly restricted
      but unexpectedly included genes encoding putative pluripotency factors expressed 
      at the onset of ZGA. Thus, distinct transcriptional activities are exhibited by
      the parental genomes during the initiation of embryogenesis, which presumptively 
      derive from divergent pre-zygotic transcriptional states established in the
      gametes.

AB  - Great progress has been made in identifying transcriptional programs that
      establish stem cell identity. In contrast, we have limited insight into how these
      programs are down-graded in a timely manner to halt proliferation and allow for
      cellular differentiation. Drosophila embryonic neuroblasts undergo such a
      temporal progression, initially dividing to bud off daughters that divide once
      (type I), then switching to generating non-dividing daughters (type 0), and
      finally exiting the cell cycle. We identify six early transcription factors that 
      drive neuroblast and type I daughter proliferation. Early factors are gradually
      replaced by three late factors, acting to trigger the type I-->0 daughter
      proliferation switch and eventually to stop neuroblasts. Early and late factors
      regulate each other and four key cell-cycle genes, providing a logical genetic
      pathway for these transitions. The identification of this extensive
      driver-stopper temporal program controlling neuroblast lineage progression may
      have implications for studies in many other systems.

AB  - The biophysical framework of collective cell migration has been extensively
      investigated in recent years; however, it remains elusive how chemical inputs
      from neighboring cells are integrated to coordinate the collective movement.
      Here, we provide evidence that propagation waves of extracellular signal-related 
      kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase activation determine the direction 
      of the collective cell migration. A wound-healing assay of Mardin-Darby canine
      kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells revealed two distinct types of ERK activation
      wave, a "tidal wave" from the wound, and a self-organized "spontaneous wave" in
      regions distant from the wound. In both cases, MDCK cells collectively migrated
      against the direction of the ERK activation wave. The inhibition of ERK
      activation propagation suppressed collective cell migration. An ERK activation
      wave spatiotemporally controlled actomyosin contraction and cell density.
      Furthermore, an optogenetic ERK activation wave reproduced the collective cell
      migration. These data provide new mechanistic insight into how cells sense the
      direction of collective cell migration.

AB  - The epidermis of aerial plant organs is thought to be limiting for growth,
      because it acts as a continuous load-bearing layer, resisting tension. Leaf
      epidermis contains jigsaw puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells whose shape has been
      proposed to be a result of subcellular variations in expansion rate that induce
      local buckling events. Paradoxically, such local compressive buckling should not 
      occur given the tensile stresses across the epidermis. Using computational
      modeling, we show that the simplest scenario to explain pavement cell shapes
      within an epidermis under tension must involve mechanical wall heterogeneities
      across and along the anticlinal pavement cell walls between adjacent cells.
      Combining genetics, atomic force microscopy, and immunolabeling, we demonstrate
      that contiguous cell walls indeed exhibit hybrid mechanochemical properties. Such
      biochemical wall heterogeneities precede wall bending. Altogether, this provides 
      a possible mechanism for the generation of complex plant cell shapes.

      proteotoxic stress if not efficiently degraded. A recent paper by Izawa et al.
      (2017) identifies Vms1 as a key player in the regulation of ribosome quality

AB  - CpG island promoters are generally devoid of DNA methylation in somatic cells but
      are frequently methylated during tumorigenesis. Reporting recently in Nature,
      Smith et al. (2017) show that the signaling-induced methylome in early
      extraembryonic tissues resembles that of many cancers, suggesting that placental 
      nuclear programming might be co-opted in tumorigenesis.

AB  - X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X chromosome in the female mammal
      and is essential to peri-implantation development. XCI is thought to be cell
      autonomous, with all factors required being produced within each cell.
      Nevertheless, external cues may exist. Here, we search for such developmental
      signals by combining bioinformatic, biochemical, and genetic approaches. Using ex
      vivo and in vivo models, we identify the Hedgehog (HH) paracrine system as a
      candidate signaling cascade. HH signaling keeps XCI in check in pluripotent cells
      and is transduced by GLI transcription factors to binding sites in Tsix, the
      antisense repressor of XCI. GLI potentiates Tsix expression and impedes XCI. In
      vivo, mutating Indian Hedgehog results in a sex ratio bias against females, and
      the female lethality is rescued by a second-site mutation in Tsix. These data
      demonstrate a genetic and functional intersection between HH and XCI and support 
      a role for intercellular signaling during XCI.

TI  - ESRP1 Mutations Cause Hearing Loss due to Defects in Alternative Splicing that
      Disrupt Cochlear Development.

AB  - Alternative splicing contributes to gene expression dynamics in many tissues, yet
      its role in auditory development remains unclear. We performed whole-exome
      sequencing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and identified
      pathogenic mutations in Epithelial Splicing-Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1).
      Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells showed alternative splicing
      defects that were restored upon repair of an ESRP1 mutant allele. To determine
      how ESRP1 mutations cause hearing loss, we evaluated Esrp1(-/-) mouse embryos and
      uncovered alterations in cochlear morphogenesis, auditory hair cell
      differentiation, and cell fate specification. Transcriptome analysis revealed
      impaired expression and splicing of genes with essential roles in cochlea
      development and auditory function. Aberrant splicing of Fgfr2 blocked stria
      vascularis formation due to erroneous ligand usage, which was corrected by
      reducing Fgf9 gene dosage. These findings implicate mutations in ESRP1 as a cause
      of SNHL and demonstrate the complex interplay between alternative splicing, inner
      ear development, and auditory function.

AB  - Small RNAs have emerged as a new class of mobile signals. Here, we investigate
      their mechanism of action and show that mobile small RNAs generate sharply
      defined domains of target gene expression through an intrinsic and direct
      threshold-based readout of their mobility gradients. This readout is highly
      sensitive to small RNA levels at the source, allowing plasticity in the
      positioning of a target gene expression boundary. Besides patterning their
      immediate targets, the readouts of opposing small RNA gradients enable
      specification of robust, uniformly positioned developmental boundaries. These
      patterning properties of small RNAs are reminiscent of those of animal
      morphogens. However, their mode of action and the intrinsic nature of their
      gradients distinguish mobile small RNAs from classical morphogens and present a
      unique direct mechanism through which to relay positional information. Mobile
      small RNAs and their targets thus emerge as highly portable, evolutionarily
      tractable regulatory modules through which to create pattern.

      Signaling Axis.

AB  - Hemodynamic forces play an essential epigenetic role in heart valve development, 
      but how they do so is not known. Here, we show that the shear-responsive
      transcription factor KLF2 is required in endocardial cells to regulate the
      mesenchymal cell responses that remodel cardiac cushions to mature valves.
      Endocardial Klf2 deficiency results in defective valve formation associated with 
      loss of Wnt9b expression and reduced canonical WNT signaling in neighboring
      mesenchymal cells, a phenotype reproduced by endocardial-specific loss of Wnt9b. 
      Studies in zebrafish embryos reveal that wnt9b expression is similarly restricted
      to the endocardial cells overlying the developing heart valves and is dependent
      upon both hemodynamic shear forces and klf2a expression. These studies identify
      KLF2-WNT9B signaling as a conserved molecular mechanism by which fluid forces
      sensed by endothelial cells direct the complex cellular process of heart valve
      development and suggest that congenital valve defects may arise due to subtle
      defects in this mechanotransduction pathway.

AB  - Ribosome biogenesis regulates animal growth and is controlled by
      nutrient-responsive mTOR signaling. How ribosome biogenesis is regulated during
      the developmental growth of animals and how nutrient-responsive signaling adjusts
      ribosome biogenesis in this setting have remained insufficiently understood. We
      uncover PWP1 as a chromatin-associated regulator of developmental growth with a
      conserved role in RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated rRNA transcription. We
      further observed that PWP1 epigenetically maintains the rDNA loci in a
      transcription-competent state. PWP1 responds to nutrition in Drosophila larvae
      via mTOR signaling through gene expression and phosphorylation, which controls
      the nucleolar localization of dPWP1. Our data further imply that dPWP1 acts
      synergistically with mTOR signaling to regulate the nucleolar localization of
      TFIIH, a known elongation factor of Pol I. Ribosome biogenesis is often
      deregulated in cancer, and we demonstrate that high PWP1 levels in human head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors are associated with poor prognosis.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in animals and yeast assures equal
      segregation of chromosomes during cell division. The prevalent occurrence of
      polyploidy in flowering plants together with the observation that many plants can
      be readily forced to double their genomes by application of microtubule drugs
      raises the question of whether plants have a proper SAC. Here, we provide a
      functional framework of the core SAC proteins in Arabidopsis. We reveal that
      Arabidopsis will delay mitosis in a SAC-dependent manner if the spindle is
      perturbed. However, we also show that the molecular architecture of the SAC is
      unique in plants. Moreover, the SAC is short-lived and cannot stay active for
      more than 2 hr, after which the cell cycle is reset. This resetting opens the
      possibility for genome duplications and raises the hypothesis that a rapid
      termination of a SAC-induced mitotic arrest provides an adaptive advantage for
      plants impacting plant genome evolution.

AB  - In animal cells, nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) is required for proper
      chromosome segregation. Whereas mitotic kinases have been implicated in NEBD, how
      they coordinate their activity to trigger this event is unclear. Here, we show
      that both in human cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, the Polo-like kinase 1
      (PLK-1) is recruited to the nuclear pore complexes, just prior to NEBD, through
      its Polo-box domain (PBD). We provide evidence that PLK-1 localization to the
      nuclear envelope (NE) is required for efficient NEBD. We identify the central
      channel nucleoporins NPP-1/Nup58, NPP-4/Nup54, and NPP-11/Nup62 as the critical
      factors anchoring PLK-1 to the NE in C. elegans. In particular, NPP-1, NPP-4, and
      NPP-11 primed at multiple Polo-docking sites by Cdk1 and PLK-1 itself physically 
      interact with the PLK-1 PBD. We conclude that nucleoporins play an unanticipated 
      regulatory role in NEBD, by recruiting PLK-1 to the NE thereby facilitating
      phosphorylation of critical downstream targets.

AB  - During interphase, the nuclear envelope (NE) serves as a selective barrier
      between cytosol and nucleoplasm. When vertebrate cells enter mitosis, the NE is
      dismantled in the process of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Disassembly of
      nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) is a key aspect of NEBD, required for NE
      permeabilization and formation of a cytoplasmic mitotic spindle. Here, we show
      that both CDK1 and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) support mitotic NPC disintegration
      by hyperphosphorylation of Nup98, the gatekeeper nucleoporin, and Nup53, a
      central nucleoporin linking the inner NPC scaffold to the pore membrane.
      Multisite phosphorylation of Nup53 critically contributes to its liberation from 
      its partner nucleoporins, including the pore membrane protein NDC1. Initial steps
      of NPC disassembly in semi-permeabilized cells can be reconstituted by a cocktail
      of mitotic kinases including cyclinB-CDK1, NIMA, and PLK1, suggesting that the
      unzipping of nucleoporin interactions by protein phosphorylation is an important 
      principle underlying mitotic NE permeabilization.

AB  - Over 600 million years ago, animals evolved from a unicellular or colonial
      organism whose cell(s) captured bacteria with a collar complex, a flagellum
      surrounded by a microvillar collar. Using principles from evolutionary cell
      biology, we reason that the transition to multicellularity required modification 
      of pre-existing mechanisms for extracellular matrix synthesis and cytokinesis. We
      discuss two hypotheses for the origin of animal cell types: division of labor
      from ancient plurifunctional cells and conversion of temporally alternating
      phenotypes into spatially juxtaposed cell types. Mechanistic studies in diverse
      animals and their relatives promise to deepen our understanding of animal origins
      and cell biology.

AB  - The expression of segmentation clock genes is self-oscillatory due to a delayed
      negative-feedback mechanism. Hubaud et al. (2017), reporting in Cell, now reveal 
      that segmentation clock genes also exhibit properties of an excitable system,
      with Yap signaling setting the threshold for adopting an oscillatory state and
      Notch signaling triggering oscillations.

AB  - Both transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways play crucial roles in
      neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Caenorhabditis elegans possesses 19
      GABAergic motor neurons (MNs) called D MNs, which are divided into two subgroups:
      DD and VD. DD, but not VD, MNs reverse their cellular polarity in a developmental
      process called respecification. UNC-30 and UNC-55 are two critical transcription 
      factors in D MNs. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation with CRISPR/Cas9 knockin
      of GFP fusion, we uncovered the global targets of UNC-30 and UNC-55. UNC-30 and
      UNC-55 are largely converged to regulate over 1,300 noncoding and coding genes,
      and genes in multiple biological processes, including cAMP metabolism, are
      co-regulated. Increase in cAMP levels may serve as a timing signal for
      respecification, whereas UNC-55 regulates genes such as pde-4 to keep the cAMP
      levels low in VD. Other genes modulating DD respecification such as lin-14,
      irx-1, and oig-1 are also found to affect cAMP levels.

AB  - Cell-cell contact formation constitutes an essential step in evolution, leading
      to the differentiation of specialized cell types. However, remarkably little is
      known about whether and how the interplay between contact formation and fate
      specification affects development. Here, we identify a positive feedback loop
      between cell-cell contact duration, morphogen signaling, and mesendoderm
      cell-fate specification during zebrafish gastrulation. We show that long-lasting 
      cell-cell contacts enhance the competence of prechordal plate (ppl) progenitor
      cells to respond to Nodal signaling, required for ppl cell-fate specification. We
      further show that Nodal signaling promotes ppl cell-cell contact duration,
      generating a positive feedback loop between ppl cell-cell contact duration and
      cell-fate specification. Finally, by combining mathematical modeling and
      experimentation, we show that this feedback determines whether anterior axial
      mesendoderm cells become ppl or, instead, turn into endoderm. Thus, the
      interdependent activities of cell-cell signaling and contact formation control
      fate diversification within the developing embryo.

AB  - Little is known about the cellular events promoting metastasis. We show that
      knockout of phospholipase D2 (PLD2), which generates the signaling lipid
      phosphatidic acid (PA), inhibits lung metastases in the mammary tumor virus
      (MMTV)-Neu transgenic mouse breast cancer model. PLD2 promotes local invasion
      through the regulation of the plasma membrane targeting of MT1-MMP and its
      associated invadopodia. A liposome pull-down screen identifies KIF5B, the heavy
      chain of the motor protein kinesin-1, as a new PA-binding protein. In vitro
      assays reveal that PA specifically and directly binds to the C terminus of KIF5B.
      The binding between PLD2-generated PA and KIF5B is required for the vesicular
      association of KIF5B, surface localization of MT1-MMP, invadopodia, and invasion 
      in cancer cells. Taken together, these results identify a role of PLD2-generated 
      PA in the regulation of kinesin-1 motor functions and breast cancer metastasis
      and suggest PLD2 as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer.

AB  - Somatic progenitors sustain tissue self-renewal while suppressing premature
      differentiation. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) affect many
      processes; however, their role in progenitor function is incompletely understood.
      PRMT1 was found to be the most highly expressed PRMT in epidermal progenitors and
      the most downregulated PRMT during differentiation. In targeted mouse knockouts
      and in long-term regenerated human mosaic epidermis in vivo, epidermal PRMT1 loss
      abolished progenitor self-renewal and led to premature differentiation. Mass
      spectrometry of the PRMT1 protein interactome identified the CSNK1a1 kinase,
      which also proved essential for progenitor maintenance. CSNK1a1 directly bound
      and phosphorylated PRMT1 to control its genomic targeting to PRMT1-sustained
      proliferation genes as well as PRMT1-suppressed differentiation genes. Among the 
      latter were GRHL3, whose derepression was required for the premature
      differentiation seen with PRMT1 and CSNK1a1 loss. Maintenance of the progenitors 
      thus requires cooperation by PRMT1 and CSNK1a1 to sustain proliferation gene
      expression and suppress premature differentiation driven by GRHL3.

AB  - Adipocytes sense systemic nutrient status and systemically communicate this
      information by releasing adipokines. The mechanisms that couple nutritional state
      to adipokine release are unknown. Here, we investigated how Unpaired 2 (Upd2), a 
      structural and functional ortholog of the primary human adipokine leptin, is
      released from Drosophila fat cells. We find that Golgi reassembly stacking
      protein (GRASP), an unconventional secretion pathway component, is required for
      Upd2 secretion. In nutrient-rich fat cells, GRASP clusters in close proximity to 
      the apical side of lipid droplets (LDs). During nutrient deprivation,
      glucagon-mediated increase in calcium (Ca(2+)) levels, via calmodulin kinase II
      (CaMKII) phosphorylation, inhibits proximal GRASP localization to LDs. Using a
      heterologous cell system, we show that human leptin secretion is also regulated
      by Ca(2+) and CaMKII. In summary, we describe a mechanism by which increased
      cytosolic Ca(2+) negatively regulates adipokine secretion and have uncovered an
      evolutionarily conserved molecular link between intracellular Ca(2+) levels and
      energy homeostasis.

AB  - Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secreted signaling protein that is implicated 
      in cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and cancer. Outside of its role in
      lipid metabolism, ANGPTL4 signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we identify 
      ANGPTL4 as a Wnt signaling antagonist that binds to syndecans and forms a ternary
      complex with the Wnt co-receptor Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6).
      This protein complex is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and
      degraded in lysosomes, leading to attenuation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.
      Angptl4 is expressed in the Spemann organizer of Xenopus embryos and acts as a
      Wnt antagonist to promote notochord formation and prevent muscle differentiation.
      This unexpected function of ANGPTL4 invites re-interpretation of its diverse
      physiological effects in light of Wnt signaling and may open therapeutic avenues 
      for human disease.

AB  - The lung harbors its basal stem/progenitor cells (BSCs) in the protected
      environment of the cartilaginous airways. After major lung injuries, BSCs are
      activated and recruited to sites of injury. Here, we show that during
      homeostasis, BSCs in cartilaginous airways maintain their stem cell state by
      downregulating the Hippo pathway (resulting in increased nuclear Yap), which
      generates a localized Fgf10-expressing stromal niche; in contrast, differentiated
      epithelial cells in non-cartilaginous airways maintain quiescence by activating
      the Hippo pathway and inhibiting Fgf10 expression in airway smooth muscle cells
      (ASMCs). However, upon injury, surviving differentiated epithelial cells spread
      to maintain barrier function and recruit integrin-linked kinase to adhesion
      sites, which leads to Merlin degradation, downregulation of the Hippo pathway,
      nuclear Yap translocation, and expression and secretion of Wnt7b.
      Epithelial-derived Wnt7b, then in turn, induces Fgf10 expression in ASMCs, which 
      extends the BSC niche to promote regeneration.

TI  - Microtubule Sliding within the Bridging Fiber Pushes Kinetochore Fibers Apart to 
      Segregate Chromosomes.

AB  - During cell division, mitotic spindle microtubules segregate chromosomes by
      exerting forces on kinetochores. What forces drive chromosome segregation in
      anaphase remains a central question. The current model for anaphase in human
      cells includes shortening of kinetochore fibers and separation of spindle poles. 
      Both processes require kinetochores to be linked with the poles. Here we show, by
      combining laser ablation, photoactivation, and theoretical modeling, that
      kinetochores can separate without any attachment to one spindle pole. This
      separation requires the bridging fiber, a microtubule bundle that connects sister
      kinetochore fibers. Bridging fiber microtubules in intact spindles slide apart
      with kinetochore fibers, indicating strong crosslinks between them. We conclude
      that sliding of microtubules within the bridging fibers drives pole separation
      and pushes kinetochore fibers poleward by the friction of passive crosslinks
      between these fibers. Thus, sliding within the bridging fiber works together with
      the shortening of kinetochore fibers to segregate chromosomes.

TI  - HDAC6 Suppresses Age-Dependent Ectopic Fat Accumulation by Maintaining the

AB  - Age-dependent ectopic fat accumulation (EFA) in animals contributes to the
      progression of tissue aging and diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer.
      However, the primary causes of age-dependent EFA remain largely elusive. Here, we
      characterize the occurrence of age-dependent EFA in Drosophila and identify
      HDAC6, a cytosolic histone deacetylase, as a suppressor of EFA. Loss of HDAC6
      leads to significant age-dependent EFA, lipid composition imbalance, and reduced 
      animal longevity on a high-fat diet. The EFA and longevity phenotypes are
      ameliorated by a reduction of the lipid-droplet-resident protein PLIN2. We show
      that HDAC6 is associated physically with the chaperone protein dHsc4/Hsc70 to
      maintain the proteostasis of PLIN2. These findings indicate that proteostasis
      collapse serves as an intrinsic cue to cause age-dependent EFA. Our study
      suggests that manipulation of proteostasis could be an alternative approach to
      the treatment of age-related metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.

AB  - YAP/TAZ are the major mediators of mammalian Hippo signaling; however, their
      precise function in the gastrointestinal tract remains poorly understood. Here we
      dissect the distinct roles of YAP/TAZ in endodermal epithelium and mesenchyme and
      find that, although dispensable for gastrointestinal epithelial development and
      homeostasis, YAP/TAZ function as the critical molecular switch to coordinate
      growth and patterning in gut mesenchyme. Our genetic analyses reveal that Lats1/2
      kinases suppress expansion of the primitive mesenchymal progenitors, where YAP
      activation also prevents induction of the smooth muscle lineage through
      transcriptional repression of Myocardin. During later development,
      zone-restricted downregulation of YAP/TAZ provides the positional cue and allows 
      smooth muscle cell differentiation induced by Hedgehog signaling. Taken together,
      our studies identify the mesenchymal requirement of YAP/TAZ in the
      gastrointestinal tract and highlight the functional interplays between Hippo and 
      Hedgehog signaling underlying temporal and spatial control of tissue growth and
      specification in developing gut.

AB  - Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) critically modulate adhesion-, growth-, and
      migration-related processes. Here, we show that the transmembrane protein,
      Nogo-A, inhibits neurite outgrowth and cell spreading in neurons and
      Nogo-A-responsive cell lines via HSPGs. The extracellular, active 180 amino acid 
      Nogo-A region, named Nogo-A-Delta20, binds to heparin and brain-derived heparan
      sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) but not to the closely related chondroitin
      sulfate GAGs. HSPGs are required for Nogo-A-Delta20-induced inhibition of
      adhesion, cell spreading, and neurite outgrowth, as well as for RhoA activation. 
      Surprisingly, we show that Nogo-A-Delta20 can act via HSPGs independently of its 
      receptor, Sphingosine-1-Phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). We thereby identify the
      HSPG family members syndecan-3 and syndecan-4 as functional receptors for
      Nogo-A-Delta20. Finally, we show in explant cultures ex vivo that Nogo-A-Delta20 
      promotes the migration of neuroblasts via HSPGs but not S1PR2.

AB  - Reproductive isolation defines species divergence and is linked to adaptive
      evolution of hybrid incompatibility genes. Hybrids between Drosophila
      melanogaster and Drosophila simulans are sterile, and phenocopy mutations in the 
      PIWI interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which silences transposons and shows
      pervasive adaptive evolution, and Drosophila rhino and deadlock encode rapidly
      evolving components of a complex that binds to piRNA clusters. We show that Rhino
      and Deadlock interact and co-localize in simulans and melanogaster, but simulans 
      Rhino does not bind melanogaster Deadlock, due to substitutions in the rapidly
      evolving Shadow domain. Significantly, a chimera expressing the simulans Shadow
      domain in a melanogaster Rhino backbone fails to support piRNA production,
      disrupts binding to piRNA clusters, and leads to ectopic localization to bulk
      heterochromatin. Fusing melanogaster Deadlock to simulans Rhino, by contrast,
      restores localization to clusters. Deadlock binding thus directs Rhino to piRNA
      clusters, and Rhino-Deadlock co-evolution has produced cross-species
      incompatibilities, which may contribute to reproductive isolation.

AB  - Hyperactivating mutations in Ras signaling are hallmarks of carcinomas. Ras
      signaling mediates cell fate decisions as well as proliferation during
      development. It is not known what dictates whether Ras signaling drives
      differentiation versus proliferation. Here we show that the Hippo pathway is
      critical for this decision. Loss of Hippo switches Ras activation from promoting 
      cellular differentiation to aggressive cellular proliferation. Transcriptome
      analysis combined with genetic tests show that this excessive proliferation
      depends on the synergistic induction of Ras target genes. Using ChIP-nexus, we
      find that Hippo signaling keeps Ras targets in check by directly regulating the
      expression of two key downstream transcription factors of Ras signaling: the
      ETS-domain transcription factor Pointed and the repressor Capicua. Our results
      highlight how independent signaling pathways can impinge on each other at the
      level of transcription factors, thereby providing a safety mechanism to keep
      proliferation in check under normal developmental conditions.

AB  - The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) localizes to centromeres in early mitosis
      to activate its subunit Aurora B kinase. However, it is unclear whether
      centromeric CPC localization contributes to CPC functions beyond Aurora B
      activation. Here, we show that an activated CPC that cannot localize to
      centromeres supports functional assembly of the outer kinetochore but is unable
      to correct errors in kinetochore-microtubule attachment in Xenopus egg extracts. 
      We find that CPC has two distinct roles at centromeres: one to selectively
      phosphorylate Ndc80 to regulate attachment and a second, conserved
      kinase-independent role in the proper composition of inner kinetochore proteins. 
      Although a fully assembled inner kinetochore is not required for outer
      kinetochore assembly, we find it is essential to recruit tension indicators, such
      as BubR1 and 3F3/2, to erroneous attachments. We conclude centromeric CPC is
      necessary for tension-dependent removal of erroneous attachments and for the
      kinetochore composition required to detect tension loss.

      Epicardial Tissue.

AB  - Mechanisms that control cell-cycle dynamics during tissue regeneration require
      elucidation. Here we find in zebrafish that regeneration of the epicardium, the
      mesothelial covering of the heart, is mediated by two phenotypically distinct
      epicardial cell subpopulations. These include a front of large, multinucleate
      leader cells, trailed by follower cells that divide to produce small,
      mononucleate daughters. By using live imaging of cell-cycle dynamics, we show
      that leader cells form by spatiotemporally regulated endoreplication, caused
      primarily by cytokinesis failure. Leader cells display greater velocities and
      mechanical tension within the epicardial tissue sheet, and experimentally induced
      tension anisotropy stimulates ectopic endoreplication. Unbalancing epicardial
      cell-cycle dynamics with chemical modulators indicated autonomous regenerative
      capacity in both leader and follower cells, with leaders displaying an enhanced
      capacity for surface coverage. Our findings provide evidence that mechanical
      tension can regulate cell-cycle dynamics in regenerating tissue, stratifying the 
      source cell features to improve repair.

AB  - Our vasculature plays diverse and critical roles in homeostasis and disease. In
      recent decades, the use of zebrafish has driven our understanding of vascular
      development into new areas, identifying new genes and mechanisms controlling
      vessel formation and allowing unprecedented observation of the cellular and
      molecular events that shape the developing vasculature. Here, we highlight key
      mechanisms controlling formation of the zebrafish vasculature and investigate how
      knowledge from this highly tractable model system has informed our understanding 
      of vascular disease in humans.

AB  - Despite their fundamental importance in the regulation of cell physiology, the
      mechanisms that confer cell adaptability to changes in the microenvironment are
      poorly understood. A recent study in Cell (Mueller et al., 2017) examines the
      capability of branched actin networks to respond and adapt to mechanical load in 
      vivo.

AB  - Two recent papers in Science (Jiang and Berger, 2017 and Yang et al., 2017)
      reveal that an epigenetic mechanism, mediated by polycomb repressor complex 2
      (PRC2), induces flowering after prolonged cold. This repression is biphasic,
      requiring nucleation and propagation; and, strikingly, appears to be
      intrinsically linked with DNA replication.

AB  - The cellular mechanisms allowing tissues to efficiently regenerate are not fully 
      understood. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Cao et al. (2017) discover that 
      during zebrafish heart regeneration, epicardial cells at the leading edge of
      regenerating tissue undergo endoreplication, possibly due to increased tissue
      tension, thereby boosting their regenerative capacity.

AB  - Axonal targeting of signaling receptors is essential for neuronal responses to
      extracellular cues. Here, we report that retrograde signaling by target-derived
      nerve growth factor (NGF) is necessary for soma-to-axon transcytosis of TrkA
      receptors in sympathetic neurons, and we define the molecular underpinnings of
      this positive feedback regulation that enhances neuronal sensitivity to trophic
      factors. Activated TrkA receptors are retrogradely transported in signaling
      endosomes from distal axons to cell bodies, where they are inserted on soma
      surfaces and promote phosphorylation of resident naive receptors, resulting in
      their internalization. Endocytosed TrkA receptors are then dephosphorylated by
      PTP1B, an ER-resident protein tyrosine phosphatase, prior to axonal transport.
      PTP1B inactivation prevents TrkA exit from soma and causes receptor degradation, 
      suggesting a "gatekeeper" mechanism that ensures targeting of inactive receptors 
      to axons to engage with ligand. In mice, PTP1B deletion reduces axonal TrkA
      levels and attenuates neuron survival and target innervation under limiting NGF
      (NGF(+/-)) conditions.

AB  - The mammalian epiblast is formed by pluripotent cells able to differentiate into 
      all tissues of the new individual. In their progression to differentiation,
      epiblast cells and their in vitro counterparts, embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
      transit from naive pluripotency through a differentiation-primed pluripotent
      state. During these events, epiblast cells and ESCs are prone to death, driven by
      competition between Myc-high cells (winners) and Myc-low cells (losers). Using
      live tracking of Myc levels, we show that Myc-high ESCs approach the naive
      pluripotency state, whereas Myc-low ESCs are closer to the differentiation-primed
      state. In ESC colonies, naive cells eliminate differentiating cells by cell
      competition, which is determined by a limitation in the time losers are able to
      survive persistent contact with winners. In the mouse embryo, cell competition
      promotes pluripotency maintenance by elimination of primed lineages before
      gastrulation. The mechanism described here is relevant to mammalian embryo
      development and induced pluripotency.

AB  - Organogenesis during embryonic development occurs through the differentiation of 
      progenitor cells. This process is extraordinarily accurate, but the mechanisms
      ensuring high fidelity are poorly understood. Coronary vessels of the mouse heart
      derive from at least two progenitor pools, the sinus venosus and endocardium. We 
      find that the ELABELA (ELA)-APJ signaling axis is only required for sinus
      venosus-derived progenitors. Because they do not depend on ELA-APJ, endocardial
      progenitors are able to expand and compensate for faulty sinus venosus
      development in Apj mutants, leading to normal adult heart function. An
      upregulation of endocardial SOX17 accompanied compensation in Apj mutants, which 
      was also seen in Ccbe1 knockouts, indicating that the endocardium is activated in
      multiple cases where sinus venosus angiogenesis is stunted. Our data demonstrate 
      that by diversifying their responsivity to growth cues, distinct coronary
      progenitor pools are able to compensate for each other during coronary
      development, thereby providing robustness to organ development.

AB  - The liver is the only organ in mammals that fully regenerates even after major
      injury. To identify orchestrators of this regenerative response, we performed
      quantitative large-scale proteomics analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
      from normal versus regenerating mouse liver. Proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasome
      pathway were rapidly upregulated after two-third hepatectomy, with the ubiquitin 
      ligase Nedd4-1 being a top hit. In vivo knockdown of Nedd4-1 in hepatocytes
      through nanoparticle-mediated delivery of small interfering RNA caused severe
      liver damage and inhibition of cell proliferation after hepatectomy, resulting in
      liver failure. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Nedd4-1 is required for
      efficient internalization of major growth factor receptors involved in liver
      regeneration and their downstream mitogenic signaling. These results highlight
      the power of large-scale proteomics to identify key players in liver regeneration
      and the importance of posttranslational regulation of growth factor signaling in 
      this process. Finally, they identify an essential function of Nedd4-1 in tissue
      repair.

TI  - Difference in Dachsous Levels between Migrating Cells Coordinates the Direction
      of Collective Cell Migration.

AB  - In contrast to extracellular chemotactic gradients, how cell-adhesion molecules
      contribute to directing cell migration remains more elusive. Here we studied the 
      collective migration of Drosophila larval epidermal cells (LECs) along the
      anterior-posterior axis and propose a migrating cell group-autonomous mechanism
      in which an atypical cadherin Dachsous (Ds) plays a pivotal role. In each
      abdominal segment, the amount of Ds in each LEC varied along the axis of
      migration (Ds imbalance), which polarized Ds localization at cell boundaries.
      This Ds polarity was necessary for coordinating the migratory direction. Another 
      atypical cadherin, Fat (Ft), and an unconventional myosin Dachs, both of which
      bind to Ds, also showed biased cell-boundary localizations, and both were
      required for the migration. Altogether, we propose that the Ds imbalance within
      the migrating tissue provides the directional cue and that this is decoded by
      Ds-Ft-mediated cell-cell contacts, which restricts lamellipodia formation to the 
      posterior end of the cell.

AB  - Reporting in Developmental Cell, de la Cova et al. (2017) present a biosensor to 
      measure ERK activity dynamics in C. elegans larvae. They find that fate decision 
      signaling involves frequency-modulated, digital ERK activity pulses. These
      findings may explain how graded morphogen signals are converted into precise and 
      robust cell fate patterns.

AB  - Incorporating each set of daughter chromosomes into a single nucleus at the end
      of mitosis is essential for genome stability. In a recent Cell paper, Samwer et
      al. (2017) show that by non-covalently crosslinking DNA, BAF promotes chromosome 
      coalescence, preventing nuclear membranes from enwrapping individual chromosomes 
      to form micronuclei.

AB  - mRNA localization often contributes to translational control. Reporting in
      Science, Moor et al. (2017) now show that many mRNAs and ribosomes are
      asymmetrically distributed along the apical-basal axis of enterocytes.
      Remarkably, when starved mice are fed, mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins rapidly 
      move to the ribosome-rich apical side to activate translation.

AB  - The Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin networks and is thought to be
      essential for macrophage migration and phagocytosis. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Rotty et al. (2017) show that there is only a surprisingly
      specific requirement for Arp2/3 in integrin-dependent macrophage functions,
      including CR3 phagocytosis and haptotaxis on fibronectin.

AB  - Detailed molecular pathways for the specific growth of arteries and lymphatic
      vessels have been identified, but the mechanisms controlling venous vessel growth
      have been obscure. Tischfield and colleagues (2017) shed new light on this
      problem by identifying a role for BMP signaling in development of the cerebral
      venous system.

TI  - Quaking RNA-Binding Proteins Control Early Myofibril Formation by Modulating
      Tropomyosin.

AB  - Skeletal muscle contraction is mediated by myofibrils, complex multi-molecular
      scaffolds structured into repeated units, the sarcomeres. Myofibril structure and
      function have been extensively studied, but the molecular processes regulating
      its formation within the differentiating muscle cell remain largely unknown. Here
      we show in zebrafish that genetic interference with the Quaking RNA-binding
      proteins disrupts the initial steps of myofibril assembly without affecting early
      muscle differentiation. Using RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that Quaking is
      required for accumulation of the muscle-specific tropomyosin-3 transcript,
      tpm3.12. Further functional analyses reveal that Tpm3.12 mediates Quaking control
      of myofibril formation. Moreover, we identified a Quaking-binding site in the 3' 
      UTR of tpm3.12 transcript, which is required in vivo for tpm3.12 accumulation and
      myofibril formation. Our work uncovers a Quaking/Tpm3 pathway controlling de novo
      myofibril assembly. This unexpected developmental role for Tpm3 could be at the
      origin of muscle defects observed in human congenital myopathies associated with 
      tpm3 mutation.

TI  - Arp2/3 Complex Is Required for Macrophage Integrin Functions but Is Dispensable

AB  - The Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin, forming networks involved in
      lamellipodial protrusion, phagocytosis, and cell adhesion. We derived primary
      bone marrow macrophages lacking Arp2/3 complex (Arpc2(-/-)) and directly tested
      its role in macrophage functions. Despite protrusion and actin assembly defects, 
      Arpc2(-/-) macrophages competently phagocytose via FcR and chemotax toward CSF
      and CX3CL1. However, CR3 phagocytosis and fibronectin haptotaxis, both
      integrin-dependent processes, are disrupted. Integrin-responsive actin assembly
      and alphaM/beta2 integrin localization are compromised in Arpc2(-/-) cells. Using
      an in vivo system to observe endogenous monocytes migrating toward full-thickness
      ear wounds we found that Arpc2(-/-) monocytes maintain cell speeds and
      directionality similar to control. Our work reveals that the Arp2/3 complex is
      not a general requirement for phagocytosis or chemotaxis but is a critical driver
      of integrin-dependent processes. We demonstrate further that cells lacking Arp2/3
      complex function in vivo remain capable of executing important physiological
      responses that require rapid directional motility.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major driver of blood vessel
      formation. However, the signal transduction pathways culminating in the
      biological consequences of VEGF signaling are only partially understood. Here, we
      show that the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ work as crucial signal
      transducers to mediate VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling during angiogenesis. We demonstrate 
      that YAP/TAZ are essential for vascular development as endothelium-specific
      deletion of YAP/TAZ leads to impaired vascularization and embryonic lethality.
      Mechanistically, we show that VEGF activates YAP/TAZ via its effects on actin
      cytoskeleton and that activated YAP/TAZ induce a transcriptional program to
      further control cytoskeleton dynamics and thus establish a feedforward loop that 
      ensures a proper angiogenic response. Lack of YAP/TAZ also results in altered
      cellular distribution of VEGFR2 due to trafficking defects from the Golgi
      apparatus to the plasma membrane. Altogether, our study identifies YAP/TAZ as
      central mediators of VEGF signaling and therefore as important regulators of
      angiogenesis.

AB  - Dural cerebral veins (CV) are required for cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption and
      brain homeostasis, but mechanisms that regulate their growth and remodeling are
      unknown. We report molecular and cellular processes that regulate dural CV
      development in mammals and describe venous malformations in humans with
      craniosynostosis and TWIST1 mutations that are recapitulated in mouse models.
      Surprisingly, Twist1 is dispensable in endothelial cells but required for
      specification of osteoprogenitor cells that differentiate into preosteoblasts
      that produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Inactivation of Bmp2 and Bmp4 in
      preosteoblasts and periosteal dura causes skull and CV malformations, similar to 
      humans harboring TWIST1 mutations. Notably, arterial development appears normal, 
      suggesting that morphogens from the skull and dura establish optimal venous
      networks independent from arterial influences. Collectively, our work establishes
      a paradigm whereby CV malformations result from primary or secondary loss of
      paracrine BMP signaling from preosteoblasts and dura, highlighting unique
      cellular interactions that influence tissue-specific angiogenesis in mammals.

AB  - The spinal cord and mesodermal tissues of the trunk such as the vertebral column 
      and skeletal musculature derive from neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs). Sox2,
      Brachyury (T), and Tbx6 have been correlated with NMP potency and lineage choice;
      however, their exact role and interaction in these processes have not yet been
      revealed. Here we present a global analysis of NMPs and their descending lineages
      performed on purified cells from embryonic day 8.5 wild-type and mutant embryos. 
      We show that T, cooperatively with WNT signaling, controls the progenitor state
      and the switch toward the mesodermal fate. Sox2 acts antagonistically and
      promotes neural development. T is also involved in remodeling the chromatin for
      mesodermal development. Tbx6 reinforces the mesodermal fate choice, represses the
      progenitor state, and confers paraxial fate commitment. Our findings refine
      previous models and establish molecular principles underlying mammalian trunk
      development, comprising NMP maintenance, lineage choice, and mesoderm formation.

AB  - Kinase translocation reporters (KTRs) are genetically encoded fluorescent
      activity sensors that convert kinase activity into a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling 
      equilibrium for visualizing single-cell signaling dynamics. Here, we adapt the
      first-generation KTR for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) to allow
      easy implementation in vivo. This sensor, "ERK-nKTR," allows quantitative and
      qualitative assessment of ERK activity by analysis of individual nuclei and
      faithfully reports ERK activity during development and neural function in diverse
      cell contexts in Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of ERK activity over time in
      the vulval precursor cells, a well-characterized paradigm of epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR)-Ras-ERK signaling, has identified dynamic features not
      evident from analysis of developmental endpoints alone, including pulsatile
      frequency-modulated signaling associated with proximity to the EGF source. The
      toolkit described here will facilitate studies of ERK signaling in other C.
      elegans contexts, and the design features will enable implementation of this
      technology in other multicellular organisms.

AB  - Regulated protein-protein interactions are critical for cell signaling,
      differentiation, and development. For the study of dynamic regulation of protein 
      interactions in vivo, there is a need for techniques that can yield time-resolved
      information and probe multiple protein binding partners simultaneously, using
      small amounts of starting material. Here we describe a single-cell protein
      interaction assay. Single-cell lysates are generated at defined time points and
      analyzed using single-molecule pull-down, yielding information about dynamic
      protein complex regulation in vivo. We established the utility of this approach
      by studying PAR polarity proteins, which mediate polarization of many animal cell
      types. We uncovered striking regulation of PAR complex composition and
      stoichiometry during Caenorhabditis elegans zygote polarization, which takes
      place in less than 20 min. PAR complex dynamics are linked to the cell cycle by
      Polo-like kinase 1 and govern the movement of PAR proteins to establish polarity.
      Our results demonstrate an approach to study dynamic biochemical events in vivo.

AB  - Maintaining posture requires tight regulation of the position and orientation of 
      numerous spinal components. Yet, surprisingly little is known about this
      regulatory mechanism, whose failure may result in spinal deformity as in
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Here, we use genetic mouse models to demonstrate
      the involvement of proprioception in regulating spine alignment. Null mutants for
      Runx3 transcription factor, which lack TrkC neurons connecting between
      proprioceptive mechanoreceptors and spinal cord, developed peripubertal scoliosis
      not preceded by vertebral dysplasia or muscle asymmetry. Deletion of Runx3 in the
      peripheral nervous system or specifically in peripheral sensory neurons, or of
      enhancer elements driving Runx3 expression in proprioceptive neurons, induced a
      similar phenotype. Egr3 knockout mice, lacking muscle spindles, but not Golgi
      tendon organs, displayed a less severe phenotype, suggesting that both receptor
      types may be required for this regulatory mechanism. These findings uncover a
      central role for the proprioceptive system in maintaining spinal alignment.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms regulating animal tissue size during development are
      unclear. This question has been extensively studied in the Drosophila wing disc. 
      Although cell growth is regulated by the kinase TORC1, no readout exists to
      visualize TORC1 activity in situ in Drosophila. Both the cell cycle and the
      morphogen Dpp are linked to tissue growth, but whether they regulate TORC1
      activity is not known. We develop here an anti-phospho-dRpS6 antibody that
      detects TORC1 activity in situ. We find, unexpectedly, that TORC1 activity in the
      wing disc is patchy. This is caused by elevated TORC1 activity at the cell cycle 
      G1/S transition due to CycD/Cdk4 phosphorylating TSC1/2. We find that TORC1 is
      also activated independently of CycD/Cdk4 when cells with different levels of Dpp
      signaling or Brinker protein are juxtaposed. We thereby characterize the spatial 
      distribution of TORC1 activity in a developing organ.

AB  - Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) regulates cell growth in response to
      nutrients and growth factors. Although TORC1 signaling has been thoroughly
      studied at the cellular level, the regulation of TORC1 in multicellular tissues
      and organs has remained elusive. Here we found that TORC1 is selectively
      activated in the second mitotic wave (SMW), the terminal synchronous cell
      division, of the developing Drosophila eye. We demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh)
      signaling regulates TORC1 through E2F1 and the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in the SMW, 
      and this regulation is independent from insulin and amino acid signaling
      pathways. TORC1 is necessary for the proper G1/S transition of the cells, and the
      activation of TORC1 rescues the cell-cycle defect of Hh signaling-deficient cells
      in the SMW. Based on this evolutionarily conserved regulation of TORC1 by Hh
      signaling, we propose that Hh-dependent developmental signaling pathways
      spatially regulate TORC1 activity in multicellular organisms.

AB  - Cardiogenesis processes in human and animals have differential dynamics,
      suggesting the existence of species-specific regulators during heart development.
      However, it remains a challenge to discover the human-specific cardiac regulatory
      genes, given that most coding genes are conserved. Here, we report the
      identification of a human-specific long noncoding RNA, Heart Brake LncRNA 1
      (HBL1), which regulates cardiomyocyte development from human induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (hiPSCs). Overexpression of HBL1 repressed, whereas knockdown and
      knockout of HBL1 increased, cardiomyocyte differentiation from hiPSCs. HBL1
      physically interacted with MIR1 in an AGO2 complex. Disruption of MIR1 binding
      sites in HBL1 showed an effect similar to that of HBL1 knockout. SOX2 bound to
      HBL1 promoter and activated its transcription. Knockdown of SOX2 in hiPSCs led to
      decreased HBL1 expression and increased cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency.
      Thus, HBL1 plays a modulatory role in fine-tuning human-specific cardiomyocyte
      development by forming a regulatory network with SOX2 and MIR1.

AB  - The first major developmental transition in vertebrate embryos is the
      maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) when maternal mRNAs are degraded and zygotic
      transcription begins. During the MZT, the embryo takes charge of gene expression 
      to control cell differentiation and further development. This spectacular
      organismal transition requires nuclear reprogramming and the initiation of RNAPII
      at thousands of promoters. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is mechanistically
      coordinated with other embryonic events, including changes in the cell cycle,
      chromatin state, and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic component ratios. Here, we review
      progress in understanding vertebrate ZGA dynamics in frogs, fish, mice, and
      humans to explore differences and emphasize common features.

AB  - The cell and molecular mechanisms that cause a smooth epithelium to become
      topographically patterned during development are poorly understood. In a recent
      issue of Science, Shyer et al. (2017) show that myosin II contractility drives
      the smooth dermal mesenchyme into a pattern of surface bumps that triggers
      epithelial gene expression.

AB  - TORC1 is arguably the best-studied regulator of cellular growth in eukaryotes.
      However, its activity has not been assessed in vivo in developing multicellular
      organisms. Two studies in this issue of Developmental Cell (Kim et al., 2017;
      Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2017) surprisingly reveal a patchy, cell-cycle-controlled 
      pattern of TORC1 activation in Drosophila imaginal discs.

AB  - In mammals, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly expand in the
      fetal liver (FL), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we
      characterize zebrafish caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) and identify an
      important cellular and molecular mechanism of HSPC expansion. Time-lapse imaging 
      showed that HSPCs localize adjacent to vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and
      their migration and expansion display caudal vein-specific orientation in the
      CHT. RNA sequencing and functional analysis identified that an EC-expressed
      transcription factor, Kruppel-like factor 6a (Klf6a), is essential for the CHT
      niche. We further demonstrated that Klf6a directly regulates the expression of
      the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 25b to modulate HSPC lodgment and proliferation.
      Ex vivo culture results support the conserved role of Ccl21/Ccr7 signaling in
      promoting HSPC expansion in mammals. Together, we identify the Klf6a-Ccl25b/Ccr7 
      axis in controlling the complex HSPC-CHT niche interaction, which may be
      applicable to in vitro expansion or engraftment of HSPCs after transplantation.

      Polarity.

AB  - The conserved polarity effector proteins PAR-3, PAR-6, CDC-42, and atypical
      protein kinase C (aPKC) form a core unit of the PAR protein network, which plays 
      a central role in polarizing a broad range of animal cell types. To functionally 
      polarize cells, these proteins must activate aPKC within a spatially defined
      membrane domain on one side of the cell in response to symmetry-breaking cues.
      Using the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote as a model, we find that the localization
      and activation of aPKC involve distinct, specialized aPKC-containing assemblies: 
      a PAR-3-dependent assembly that responds to polarity cues and promotes efficient 
      segregation of aPKC toward the anterior but holds aPKC in an inactive state, and 
      a CDC-42-dependent assembly in which aPKC is active but poorly segregated.
      Cycling of aPKC between these distinct functional assemblies, which appears to
      depend on aPKC activity, effectively links cue-sensing and effector roles within 
      the PAR network to ensure robust establishment of polarity.

AB  - Appropriate growth and synaptic integration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons 
      are essential for functional neural circuits in the brain. Here, we demonstrate
      that disruption of primary cilia function following the selective loss of ciliary
      GTPase Arl13b in interneurons impairs interneuronal morphology and synaptic
      connectivity, leading to altered excitatory/inhibitory activity balance. The
      altered morphology and connectivity of cilia mutant interneurons and the
      functional deficits are rescued by either chemogenetic activation of ciliary
      G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling or the selective induction of Sstr3, 
      a ciliary GPCR, in Arl13b-deficient cilia. Our results thus define a specific
      requirement for primary cilia-mediated GPCR signaling in interneuronal
      connectivity and inhibitory circuit formation.

AB  - During epithelial tube morphogenesis, linear arrays of cells are converted into
      tubular structures through actomyosin-generated intracellular forces that induce 
      tissue invagination and lumen formation. We have investigated lumen morphogenesis
      in the C. elegans vulva. The first discernible event initiating lumen formation
      is the apical constriction of the two innermost primary cells (VulF). The VulF
      cells thereafter constrict their lateral membranes along the apicobasal axis to
      extend the lumen dorsally. Lateral, but not apical, VulF constriction requires
      the prior invasion of the anchor cell (AC). The invading AC extends actin-rich
      protrusions toward VulF, resulting in the formation of a direct AC-VulF
      interface. The recruitment of the F-BAR-domain protein TOCA-1 to the AC-VulF
      interface induces the accumulation of force-generating actomyosin, causing a
      switch from apical to lateral membrane constriction and the dorsal extension of
      the lumen. Invasive cells may induce shape changes in adjacent cells to penetrate
      their target tissues.

      Small RNA Pathways of C. elegans.

AB  - Proper regulation of the germline transcriptome is essential for fertility. In C.
      elegans, germline homeostasis hinges on a complex repertoire of both silencing
      and activating small RNA pathways, along with RNA processing. However, our
      understanding of how fundamental RNA processing steps intersect with small RNA
      machineries in the germline remains limited. Here, we link the conserved intron
      binding protein, EMB-4/AQR/IBP160, to the CSR-1 and HRDE-1 nuclear 22G-RNA
      pathways in the C. elegans germline. Loss of emb-4 leads to distinct alterations 
      in CSR-1- versus HRDE-1-associated small RNA and mRNA transcriptomes. Our
      transcriptome-wide analysis shows that EMB-4 is enriched along pre-mRNAs of
      nearly 8,000 transcripts. While EMB-4 complexes are enriched for both intronic
      and exonic sequences of HRDE-1 targets, CSR-1 pathway targets are enriched for
      intronic, but not exonic, sequences. These data suggest that EMB-4 could
      contribute to a molecular signature that distinguishes the targets of these two
      germline small RNA pathways.

AB  - Small RNAs play a crucial role in genome defense against transposable elements
      and guide Argonaute proteins to nascent RNA transcripts to induce
      co-transcriptional gene silencing. However, the molecular basis of this process
      remains unknown. Here, we identify the conserved RNA helicase Aquarius/EMB-4 as a
      direct and essential link between small RNA pathways and the transcriptional
      machinery in Caenorhabditis elegans. Aquarius physically interacts with the
      germline Argonaute HRDE-1. Aquarius is required to initiate small-RNA-induced
      heritable gene silencing. HRDE-1 and Aquarius silence overlapping sets of genes
      and transposable elements. Surprisingly, removal of introns from a target gene
      abolishes the requirement for Aquarius, but not HRDE-1, for small RNA-dependent
      gene silencing. We conclude that Aquarius allows small RNA pathways to compete
      for access to nascent transcripts undergoing co-transcriptional splicing in order
      to detect and silence transposable elements. Thus, Aquarius and HRDE-1 act as
      gatekeepers coordinating gene expression and genome defense.

TI  - Human Centromeres Produce Chromosome-Specific and Array-Specific Alpha Satellite 
      Transcripts that Are Complexed with CENP-A and CENP-C.

AB  - Human centromeres are defined by alpha satellite DNA arrays that are distinct and
      chromosome specific. Most human chromosomes contain multiple alpha satellite
      arrays that are competent for centromere assembly. Here, we show that human
      centromeres are defined by chromosome-specific RNAs linked to underlying
      organization of distinct alpha satellite arrays. Active and inactive arrays on
      the same chromosome produce discrete sets of transcripts in cis. Non-coding RNAs 
      produced from active arrays are complexed with CENP-A and CENP-C, while
      inactive-array transcripts associate with CENP-B and are generally less stable.
      Loss of CENP-A does not affect transcript abundance or stability. However,
      depletion of array-specific RNAs reduces CENP-A and CENP-C at the targeted
      centromere via faulty CENP-A loading, arresting cells before mitosis. This work
      shows that each human alpha satellite array produces a unique set of non-coding
      transcripts, and RNAs present at active centromeres are necessary for kinetochore
      assembly and cell-cycle progression.

TI  - GATA Factor-Regulated Samd14 Enhancer Confers Red Blood Cell Regeneration and
      Survival in Severe Anemia.

AB  - An enhancer with amalgamated E-box and GATA motifs (+9.5) controls expression of 
      the regulator of hematopoiesis GATA-2. While similar GATA-2-occupied elements are
      common in the genome, occupancy does not predict function, and GATA-2-dependent
      genetic networks are incompletely defined. A "+9.5-like" element resides in an
      intron of Samd14 (Samd14-Enh) encoding a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain
      protein. Deletion of Samd14-Enh in mice strongly decreased Samd14 expression in
      bone marrow and spleen. Although steady-state hematopoiesis was normal,
      Samd14-Enh(-/-) mice died in response to severe anemia. Samd14-Enh stimulated
      stem cell factor/c-Kit signaling, which promotes erythrocyte regeneration. Anemia
      activated Samd14-Enh by inducing enhancer components and enhancer chromatin
      accessibility. Thus, a GATA-2/anemia-regulated enhancer controls expression of an
      SAM domain protein that confers survival in anemia. We propose that Samd14-Enh
      and an ensemble of anemia-responsive enhancers are essential for erythrocyte
      regeneration in stress erythropoiesis, a vital process in pathologies, including 
      beta-thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and viral infection.

AB  - Although some genomic rearrangements are caused by replication or transcription, 
      the etiology of others is unclear. Reporting in Cell, Canela et al. (2017) reveal
      that type II topoisomerase-mediated release of torsional strain at chromosomal
      loop anchors generates DNA double-strand breaks that drive multiple oncogenic
      translocations in a transcription-independent manner.

AB  - Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)
      produce diverse olfactory bulb (OB) neurons. In a recent paper in Science, Paul
      et al. (2017) show that hypothalamic propiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons innervate 
      the anterior ventral V-SVZ and regulate deep granule interneuron production
      depending on feeding behavior.

      impose significant constraints on metabolic pathways. In this issue, Song et al. 
      (2017) show that Drosophila embryos synthesize a large fraction of nucleotides on
      the go and that negative feedback between dATP and ribonucleotide reductase
      ensures tight control of dNTP concentration.

AB  - Centromeric transcription is a common eukaryotic centromere feature, yet it is
      unclear how transcription is linked to underlying repetitive satellite sequences.
      In this issue of Developmental Cell, McNulty et al. (2017) show for human

AB  - Exponential increase of cell numbers in early embryos requires large amounts of
      DNA precursors (deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs)). Little is understood 
      about how embryos satisfy this demand. We examined dNTP metabolism in the early
      Drosophila embryo, in which gastrulation is preceded by 13 sequential nuclear
      cleavages within only 2 hr of fertilization. Surprisingly, despite the breakneck 
      speed at which Drosophila embryos synthesize DNA, maternally deposited dNTPs can 
      generate less than half of the genomes needed to reach gastrulation. The rest of 
      the dNTPs are synthesized "on the go." The rate-limiting enzyme of dNTP
      synthesis, ribonucleotide reductase, is inhibited by endogenous levels of
      deoxyATP (dATP) present at fertilization and is activated as dATP is depleted via
      DNA polymerization. This feedback inhibition renders the concentration of dNTPs
      at gastrulation robust, with respect to large variations in maternal supplies,
      and is essential for normal progression of embryogenesis.

AB  - Vertebrate centromeres are epigenetically defined by nucleosomes containing the
      histone H3 variant, CENP-A. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the three-protein
      Mis18 complex (Mis18alpha, Mis18beta, and M18BP1) that recruits the CENP-A
      chaperone HJURP to centromeres, but how the Mis18 complex recognizes centromeric 
      chromatin is unknown. Using Xenopus egg extract, we show that direct,
      cell-cycle-regulated binding of M18BP1 to CENP-A nucleosomes recruits the Mis18
      complex to interphase centromeres to promote new CENP-A nucleosome assembly. We
      demonstrate that Xenopus M18BP1 binds CENP-A nucleosomes using a motif that is
      widely conserved except in mammals. The M18BP1 motif resembles a CENP-A
      nucleosome binding motif in CENP-C, and we show that CENP-C competes with M18BP1 
      for CENP-A nucleosome binding at centromeres. We show that both CENP-C and M18BP1
      recruit HJURP to centromeres for new CENP-A assembly. This study defines cellular
      mechanisms for recruiting CENP-A assembly factors to existing CENP-A nucleosomes 
      for the epigenetic inheritance of centromeres.

AB  - Centromeres are specified and maintained by sequence-independent epigenetic
      mechanisms through the incorporation of CENP-A into centromeres. Given that
      CENP-A incorporation requires the Mis18 complex to be in the centromere region,
      it is necessary to precisely understand how the Mis18 complex localizes to the
      centromere region. Here, we showed that centromere localization of the Mis18
      complex depends on CENP-A, but not CENP-C or CENP-T, in chicken DT40 cells.
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that M18BP1/KNL2, a member of the Mis18 complex,
      contained the CENP-C-like motif in chicken and other vertebrates, which is
      essential for centromere localization and M18BP1/KNL2 function in DT40 cells. We 
      also showed that in vitro reconstituted CENP-A nucleosome, but not H3 nucleosome,
      bound to the CENP-C-like motif containing M18BP1/KNL2. Based on these results, we
      conclude that M18BP1/KNL2 is essential for centromere formation through direct
      binding to CENP-A nucleosome in non-mammalian vertebrates. This explains how new 
      CENP-A recognizes the centromere position.

AB  - The biomechanics of posterior embryonic growth must be dynamically regulated to
      ensure bilateral symmetry of the spinal column. Throughout vertebrate trunk
      elongation, motile mesodermal progenitors undergo an order-to-disorder transition
      via an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and sort symmetrically into the left 
      and right paraxial mesoderm. We combine theoretical modeling of cell migration in
      a tail-bud-like geometry with experimental data analysis to assess the importance
      of ordered and disordered cell motion. We find that increasing order in cell
      motion causes a phase transition from symmetric to asymmetric body elongation. In
      silico and in vivo, overly ordered cell motion converts normal anisotropic fluxes
      into stable vortices near the posterior tail bud, contributing to asymmetric cell
      sorting. Thus, disorder is a physical mechanism that ensures the bilateral
      symmetry of the spinal column. These physical properties of the tissue connect
      across scales such that patterned disorder at the cellular level leads to the
      emergence of organism-level order.

AB  - Eukaryotic genomes are broadly divided between gene-rich euchromatin and the
      highly repetitive heterochromatin domain, which is enriched for proteins critical
      for genome stability and transcriptional silencing. This study shows that
      Drosophila KDM4A (dKDM4A), previously characterized as a euchromatic histone H3
      K36 demethylase and transcriptional regulator, predominantly localizes to
      heterochromatin and regulates heterochromatin position-effect variegation (PEV), 
      organization of repetitive DNAs, and DNA repair. We demonstrate that dKDM4A
      demethylase activity is dispensable for PEV. In contrast, dKDM4A enzymatic
      activity is required to relocate heterochromatic double-strand breaks outside the
      domain, as well as for organismal survival when DNA repair is compromised.
      Finally, DNA damage triggers dKDM4A-dependent changes in the levels of H3K56me3, 
      suggesting that dKDM4A demethylates this heterochromatic mark to facilitate
      repair. We conclude that dKDM4A, in addition to its previously characterized role
      in euchromatin, utilizes both enzymatic and structural mechanisms to regulate
      heterochromatin organization and functions.

AB  - The separation of germline from somatic lineages is fundamental to reproduction
      and species preservation. Here, we show that Drosophila Germ cell-less (GCL) is a
      critical component in this process by acting as a switch that turns off a somatic
      lineage pathway. GCL, a conserved BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac)
      protein, is a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase
      complex (CRL3(GCL)). We show that CRL3(GCL) promotes PGC fate by mediating
      degradation of Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and major determinant of
      somatic cell fate. This mode of RTK degradation does not depend upon receptor
      activation but is prompted by release of GCL from the nuclear envelope during
      mitosis. The cell-cycle-dependent change in GCL localization provides
      spatiotemporal specificity for RTK degradation and sequesters CRL3(GCL) to
      prevent it from participating in excessive activities. This precisely
      orchestrated mechanism of CRL3(GCL) function and regulation defines cell fate at 
      the single-cell level.

AB  - The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major
      nutrient sensor and regulator of cellular metabolic flux. Reporting recently in
      Nature, Zabala-Letona et al. (2017) show that mTORC1 regulates an additional
      branch of metabolism in the cell-polyamine synthesis-that is important for
      prostate cancer tumorigenicity.

AB  - Cell and tissue morphogenesis depends on the correct regulation of non-muscle
      Myosin II, but how this motor protein is spatiotemporally controlled is
      incompletely understood. Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila
      neural stem cells, cell intrinsic polarity cues provide spatial and temporal
      information to regulate biased Myosin activity. Using live cell imaging and a
      genetically encoded Myosin activity sensor, we found that Drosophila Rho kinase
      (Rok) enriches for activated Myosin on the neuroblast cortex prior to nuclear
      envelope breakdown (NEB). After NEB, the conserved polarity protein Partner of
      Inscuteable (Pins) sequentially enriches Rok and Protein Kinase N (Pkn) on the
      apical neuroblast cortex. Our data suggest that apical Rok first increases
      phospho-Myosin, followed by Pkn-mediated Myosin downregulation, possibly through 
      Rok inhibition. We propose that polarity-induced spatiotemporal control of Rok
      and Pkn is important for unequal cortical expansion, ensuring correct cleavage
      furrow positioning and the establishment of physical asymmetry.

AB  - Extracellular cues that regulate cellular shape, motility, and navigation are
      generally classified as growth promoting (i.e., growth factors/chemoattractants
      and attractive guidance cues) or growth preventing (i.e., repellents and
      inhibitors). Yet, these designations are often based on complex assays and
      undefined signaling pathways and thus may misrepresent direct roles of specific
      cues. Here, we find that a recognized growth-promoting signaling pathway
      amplifies the F-actin disassembly and repulsive effects of a growth-preventing
      pathway. Focusing on Semaphorin/Plexin repulsion, we identified an interaction
      between the F-actin-disassembly enzyme Mical and the Abl tyrosine kinase.
      Biochemical assays revealed Abl phosphorylates Mical to directly amplify Mical
      Redox-mediated F-actin disassembly. Genetic assays revealed that Abl allows
      growth factors and Semaphorin/Plexin repellents to combinatorially increase
      Mical-mediated F-actin disassembly, cellular remodeling, and repulsive axon
      guidance. Similar roles for Mical in growth factor/Abl-related cancer cell
      behaviors further revealed contexts in which characterized positive effectors of 
      growth/guidance stimulate such negative cellular effects as F-actin
      disassembly/repulsion.

AB  - Basement membranes (BMs) are extracellular matrix polymers basally underlying
      epithelia, where they regulate cell signaling and tissue mechanics. Constriction 
      by the BM shapes Drosophila wing discs, a well-characterized model of tissue
      growth. Recently, the hypothesis that mechanical factors govern wing growth has
      received much attention, but it has not been definitively tested. In this study, 
      we manipulated BM composition to cause dramatic changes in tissue tension. We
      found that increased tissue compression when perlecan was knocked down did not
      affect adult wing size. BM elimination, decreasing compression, reduced wing size
      but did not visibly affect Hippo signaling, widely postulated to mediate growth
      mechanoregulation. BM elimination, in contrast, attenuated signaling by bone
      morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor beta ligand Dpp, which was not
      efficiently retained within the tissue and escaped to the body cavity. Our
      results challenge mechanoregulation of wing growth, while uncovering a function
      of BMs in preserving a growth-promoting tissue environment.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) provide an "on-demand" source of fatty acids (FAs) that can 
      be mobilized in response to fluctuations in nutrient abundance. Surprisingly, the
      amount of LDs increases during prolonged periods of nutrient deprivation. Why
      cells store FAs in LDs during an energy crisis is unknown. Our data demonstrate
      that mTORC1-regulated autophagy is necessary and sufficient for
      starvation-induced LD biogenesis. The ER-resident diacylglycerol acyltransferase 
      1 (DGAT1) selectively channels autophagy-liberated FAs into new, clustered LDs
      that are in close proximity to mitochondria and are lipolytically degraded.
      However, LDs are not required for FA delivery to mitochondria but instead
      function to prevent acylcarnitine accumulation and lipotoxic dysregulation of
      mitochondria. Our data support a model in which LDs provide a lipid buffering
      system that sequesters FAs released during the autophagic degradation of
      membranous organelles, reducing lipotoxicity. These findings reveal an
      unrecognized aspect of the cellular adaptive response to starvation, mediated by 
      LDs.

AB  - The early cell divisions of many metazoan embryos are rapid and occur in the near
      absence of transcription. At the mid-blastula transition (MBT), the cell cycle
      elongates and several processes become established including the onset of bulk
      transcription and cell-cycle checkpoints. How these events are timed and
      coordinated is poorly understood. Here we show in Xenopus laevis that
      developmental activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1 at the MBT results in the 
      SCF(beta-TRCP)-dependent degradation of a limiting replication initiation factor 
      Drf1. Inhibition of Drf1 is the primary mechanism by which Chk1 blocks cell-cycle
      progression in the early embryo and is an essential function of Chk1 at the
      blastula-to-gastrula stage of development. This study defines the downregulation 
      of Drf1 as an important mechanism to coordinate the lengthening of the cell cycle
      and subsequent developmental processes.

TI  - The DYT6 Dystonia Protein THAP1 Regulates Myelination within the Oligodendrocyte 
      Lineage.

AB  - The childhood-onset motor disorder DYT6 dystonia is caused by loss-of-function
      mutations in the transcription factor THAP1, but the neurodevelopmental processes
      in which THAP1 participates are unknown. We find that THAP1 is essential for the 
      timing of myelination initiation during CNS maturation. Conditional deletion of
      THAP1 in the CNS retards maturation of the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage, delaying
      myelination and causing persistent motor deficits. The CNS myelination defect
      results from a cell-autonomous requirement for THAP1 in the OL lineage and is
      recapitulated in developmental assays performed on OL progenitor cells purified
      from Thap1 null mice. Loss of THAP1 function disrupts a core set of OL maturation
      genes and reduces the DNA occupancy of YY1, a transcription factor required for
      OL maturation. These studies establish a role for THAP1 transcriptional
      regulation at the inception of myelination and implicate abnormal timing of
      myelination in the pathogenesis of childhood-onset dystonia.

AB  - Kinesin-8 motors regulate the size of microtubule structures, using
      length-dependent accumulation at the plus end to preferentially disassemble long 
      microtubules. Despite extensive study, the kinesin-8 depolymerase mechanism
      remains under debate. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative, tubulin
      curvature-sensing model of microtubule depolymerization by the budding yeast
      kinesin-8, Kip3. Kinesin-8/Kip3 uses ATP hydrolysis, like other kinesins, for
      stepping on the microtubule lattice, but at the plus end Kip3 undergoes a switch:
      its ATPase activity is suppressed when it binds tightly to the curved
      conformation of tubulin. This prolongs plus-end binding, stabilizes protofilament
      curvature, and ultimately promotes microtubule disassembly. The tubulin
      curvature-sensing model is supported by our identification of Kip3 structural
      elements necessary and sufficient for plus-end binding and depolymerase activity,
      as well as by the identification of an alpha-tubulin residue specifically
      required for the Kip3-curved tubulin interaction. Together, these findings
      elucidate a major regulatory mechanism controlling the size of cellular
      microtubule structures.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Nguyen et al. (2017) show that lipid
      droplets serve a dual purpose during starvation. First, they act as an energy
      source by supplying fatty acids for mitochondrial beta oxidation. Second, they
      sequester toxic lipids that arise during autophagic degradation of membranous
      organelles, thereby protecting mitochondria.

TI  - Fgf8 Expression and Degradation of Retinoic Acid Are Required for Patterning a
      High-Acuity Area in the Retina.

AB  - Species that are highly reliant on their visual system have a specialized retinal
      area subserving high-acuity vision, e.g., the fovea in humans. Although of
      critical importance for our daily activities, little is known about the
      mechanisms driving the development of retinal high-acuity areas (HAAs). Using the
      chick as a model, we found a precise and dynamic expression pattern of fibroblast
      growth factor 8 (Fgf8) in the HAA anlage, which was regulated by enzymes that
      degrade retinoic acid (RA). Transient manipulation of RA signaling, or reduction 
      of Fgf8 expression, disrupted several features of HAA patterning, including
      photoreceptor distribution, ganglion cell density, and organization of
      interneurons. Notably, patterned expression of RA signaling components was also
      found in humans, suggesting that RA also plays a role in setting up the human
      fovea.

TI  - The CEP19-RABL2 GTPase Complex Binds IFT-B to Initiate Intraflagellar Transport
      at the Ciliary Base.

AB  - Highly conserved intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein complexes direct both the
      assembly of primary cilia and the trafficking of signaling molecules. IFT
      complexes initially accumulate at the base of the cilium and periodically enter
      the cilium, suggesting an as-yet-unidentified mechanism that triggers ciliary
      entry of IFT complexes. Using affinity-purification and mass spectrometry of
      interactors of the centrosomal and ciliopathy protein, CEP19, we identify CEP350,
      FOP, and the RABL2B GTPase as proteins organizing the first known mechanism
      directing ciliary entry of IFT complexes. We discover that CEP19 is recruited to 
      the ciliary base by the centriolar CEP350/FOP complex and then specifically
      captures GTP-bound RABL2B, which is activated via its intrinsic nucleotide
      exchange. Activated RABL2B then captures and releases its single effector, the
      intraflagellar transport B holocomplex, from the large pool of pre-docked IFT-B
      complexes, and thus initiates ciliary entry of IFT.

AB  - Apoptosis has been implicated in compensatory proliferation signaling (CPS),
      whereby dying cells induce proliferation in neighboring cells as a means to
      restore homeostasis. The nature of signaling between apoptotic cells and their
      neighboring cells remains largely unknown. Here we show that a fraction of
      apoptotic cells produce and release CrkI-containing microvesicles (distinct from 
      exosomes and apoptotic bodies), which induce proliferation in neighboring cells
      upon contact. We provide visual evidence of CPS by videomicroscopy. We show that 
      purified vesicles in vitro and in vivo are sufficient to stimulate proliferation 
      in other cells. Our data demonstrate that CrkI inactivation by ExoT bacterial
      toxin or by mutagenesis blocks vesicle formation in apoptotic cells and inhibits 
      CPS, thus uncoupling apoptosis from CPS. We further show that c-Jun
      amino-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a pivotal role in mediating vesicle-induced CPS
      in recipient cells. CPS could have important ramifications in diseases that
      involve apoptotic cell death.

      Physiological Decline in Drosophila.

AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR), which protects cells against accumulation of
      misfolded proteins in the ER, is induced in several age-associated degenerative
      diseases. However, sustained UPR activation has negative effects on cellular
      functions and may worsen disease symptoms. It remains unknown whether and how UPR
      components can be utilized to counteract chronic ER proteinopathies. We found
      that promotion of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) through upregulation of
      ERAD-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) protected against chronic 
      ER proteinopathy without inducing toxicity in a Drosophila model. ERAD activity
      in the brain decreased with aging, and upregulation of EDEMs suppressed
      age-dependent behavioral decline and extended the lifespan without affecting the 
      UPR gene expression network. Intriguingly, EDEM mannosidase activity was
      dispensable for these protective effects. Therefore, upregulation of EDEM
      function in the ERAD protects against ER proteinopathy in vivo and thus
      represents a potential therapeutic target for chronic diseases.

TI  - Chromosome Mis-segregation Generates Cell-Cycle-Arrested Cells with Complex
      Karyotypes that Are Eliminated by the Immune System.

AB  - Aneuploidy, a state of karyotype imbalance, is a hallmark of cancer. Changes in
      chromosome copy number have been proposed to drive disease by modulating the
      dosage of cancer driver genes and by promoting cancer genome evolution. Given the
      potential of cells with abnormal karyotypes to become cancerous, do pathways that
      limit the prevalence of such cells exist? By investigating the immediate
      consequences of aneuploidy on cell physiology, we identified mechanisms that
      eliminate aneuploid cells. We find that chromosome mis-segregation leads to
      further genomic instability that ultimately causes cell-cycle arrest. We further 
      show that cells with complex karyotypes exhibit features of senescence and
      produce pro-inflammatory signals that promote their clearance by the immune
      system. We propose that cells with abnormal karyotypes generate a signal for
      their own elimination that may serve as a means for cancer cell
      immunosurveillance.

AB  - Small RNAs called PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) act as an immune system to
      suppress transposable elements in the animal gonads. A poorly understood adaptive
      pathway links cytoplasmic slicing of target RNA by the PIWI protein MILI to
      loading of target-derived piRNAs into nuclear MIWI2. Here we demonstrate that
      MILI slicing generates a 16-nt by-product that is discarded and a pre-piRNA
      intermediate that is used for phased piRNA production. The ATPase activity of
      Mouse Vasa Homolog (MVH) is essential for processing the intermediate into
      piRNAs, ensuring transposon silencing and male fertility. The ATPase activity
      controls dissociation of an MVH complex containing PIWI proteins, piRNAs, and
      slicer products, allowing safe handover of the intermediate. In contrast, ATPase 
      activity of TDRD9 is dispensable for piRNA biogenesis but is essential for
      transposon silencing and male fertility. Our work implicates distinct RNA
      helicases in specific steps along the nuclear piRNA pathway.

AB  - Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), along with multisubunit (WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L, and
      DPY30) complex catalyzes the trimethylation of H3K4, leading to gene activation. 
      Here, we characterize a chromatin-independent role for MLL during mitosis. MLL
      and WDR5 localize to the mitotic spindle apparatus, and loss of function of MLL
      complex by RNAi results in defects in chromosome congression and compromised
      spindle formation. We report interaction of MLL complex with several kinesin and 
      dynein motors. We further show that the MLL complex associates with Kif2A, a
      member of the Kinesin-13 family of microtubule depolymerase, and regulates the
      spindle localization of Kif2A during mitosis. We have identified a conserved WDR5
      interaction (Win) motif, so far unique to the MLL family, in Kif2A. The Win motif
      of Kif2A engages in direct interactions with WDR5 for its spindle localization.
      Our findings highlight a non-canonical mitotic function of MLL complex, which may
      have a direct impact on chromosomal stability, frequently compromised in cancer.

AB  - Although haploidy has not been observed in vertebrates, its natural occurrence in
      various eukaryotic species that had diverged from diploid ancestors suggests that
      there is an innate capacity for an organism to regain haploidy and that haploidy 
      may confer evolutionary benefits. Haploid embryonic stem cells have been
      experimentally generated from mouse, rat, monkey, and humans. Haploidy results in
      major differences in cell size and gene expression levels while also affecting
      parental imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and mitochondrial metabolism
      genes. We discuss here haploidy in evolution and the barriers to haploidy, in
      particular in the human context.

AB  - Blood vessel shape is malleable and dynamically regulated. In two recent papers
      in Nature Cell Biology, Jin et al. (2017) and Sugden et al. (2017) show that
      endoglin alters endothelial cell shape or behavior in response to blood flow,
      thus regulating vessel structure.

AB  - Caspases have apoptotic and non-apoptotic functions, both of which depend on
      their abilities to cleave proteins at specific sites. What distinguishes
      apoptotic from non-apoptotic substrates has so far been unclear. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Weaver et al. (2017) now provide an answer to this crucial
      question.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that components of the classical cell death machinery
      also have important non-cell-death (non-apoptotic) functions in flies, nematodes,
      and mammals. However, the mechanisms for non-canonical caspase substrate
      recognition and proteolysis, and the direct roles for caspases in gene expression
      regulation, remain largely unclear. Here we report that CED-3 caspase and the
      Arg/N-end rule pathway cooperate to inactivate the LIN-28 pluripotency factor in 
      seam cells, a stem-like cell type in Caenorhabditis elegans, thereby ensuring
      proper temporal cell fate patterning. Importantly, the caspase and the E3 ligase 
      execute this function in a non-additive manner. We show that CED-3 caspase and
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 form a complex that couples their in vivo
      activities, allowing for recognition and rapid degradation of LIN-28 and thus
      facilitating a switch in developmental programs. The interdependence of these
      proteolytic activities provides a paradigm for non-apoptotic caspase-mediated
      protein inactivation.

AB  - Cells convert excess energy into neutral lipids that are made in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER) bilayer. The lipids are then packaged into spherical or budded
      lipid droplets (LDs) covered by a phospholipid monolayer containing proteins. LDs
      play a key role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. A key unanswered
      question in the life of LDs is how they bud off from the ER. Here, we tackle this
      question by studying the budding of artificial LDs from model membranes. We find 
      that the bilayer phospholipid composition and surface tension are key parameters 
      of LD budding. Phospholipids have differential LD budding aptitudes, and those
      inducing budding decrease the bilayer tension. We observe that decreasing tension
      favors the egress of neutral lipids from the bilayer and LD budding. In cells,
      budding conditions favor the formation of small LDs. Our discovery reveals the
      importance of altering ER physical chemistry for controlled cellular LD
      formation.

AB  - Low inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability causes terminal differentiation of the 
      root apical meristem (RAM), a phenomenon known as root meristem exhaustion or
      determined growth. Here, we report that the CLE14 peptide acts as a key player in
      this process. Low Pi stress induces iron mobilization in the RAM through the
      action of LPR1/LPR2, causing expression of CLE14 in the proximal meristem region.
      CLV2 and PEPR2 receptors perceive CLE14 and trigger RAM differentiation, with
      concomitant downregulation of SHR/SCR and PIN/AUXIN pathway. Our results reveal
      multiple steps of the molecular mechanism of one of the most physiologically
      important root nutrient responses.

AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are multiprotein channels connecting the nucleus
      with the cytoplasm. NPCs have been shown to have tissue-specific composition,
      suggesting that their function can be specialized. However, the physiological
      roles of NPC composition changes and their impacts on cellular processes remain
      unclear. Here we show that the addition of the Nup210 nucleoporin to NPCs during 
      myoblast differentiation results in assembly of an Mef2C transcriptional complex 
      required for efficient expression of muscle structural genes and microRNAs. We
      show that this NPC-localized complex is essential for muscle growth, myofiber
      maturation, and muscle cell survival and that alterations in its activity result 
      in muscle degeneration. Our findings suggest that NPCs regulate the activity of
      functional gene groups by acting as scaffolds that promote the local assembly of 
      tissue-specific transcription complexes and show how nuclear pore composition
      changes can be exploited to regulate gene expression at the nuclear periphery.

TI  - The Protein Phosphatase 4 and SMEK1 Complex Dephosphorylates HYL1 to Promote
      miRNA Biogenesis by Antagonizing the MAPK Cascade in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Phosphorylation plays an essential role in microRNA (miRNA) processing by
      regulating co-factors of the miRNA biogenesis machinery. HYL1 (Hyponastic Leaves 
      1), a core co-factor in plant miRNA biogenesis, is a short-lived phosphoprotein. 
      However, the precise balance and regulatory mechanism of the stability and
      phosphorylation of HYL1 remain unclear. Here, we show that a highly conserved PP4
      (Protein Phosphatase 4) and SMEK1 (Suppressor of MEK 1) complex dephosphorylates 
      HYL1 to promote miRNA biogenesis, by antagonizing the MAPK cascade in
      Arabidopsis. The smek1 mutants exhibit defective miRNA biogenesis due to
      accelerated degradation of HYL1. SMEK1 stabilizes HYL1 in a dual manner: SMEK1,
      as a suppressor, inhibits MAPK activation to attenuate HYL1 phosphorylation;
      SMEK1 assembles a functional PP4 to target HYL1 for dephosphorylation. Moreover, 
      the protein level of SMEK1 is increased in response to abscisic acid. Our results
      provide insights into the delicate balance between a protein kinase and a
      phosphatase during miRNA biogenesis.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is frequently associated with bone-forming 
      lesions, but the source of the osteoblastic lesions remains unclear. We show that
      the tumor-induced bone derives partly from tumor-associated endothelial cells
      that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) conversion. The
      tumor-associated osteoblasts in PCa bone metastasis specimens and patient-derived
      xenografts (PDXs) were found to co-express endothelial marker Tie-2. BMP4,
      identified in PDX-conditioned medium, promoted EC-to-OSB conversion of 2H11
      endothelial cells. BMP4 overexpression in non-osteogenic C4-2b PCa cells led to
      ectopic bone formation under subcutaneous implantation. Tumor-induced bone was
      reduced in trigenic mice (Tie2(cre)/Osx(f/f)/SCID) with endothelial-specific
      deletion of osteoblast cell-fate determinant OSX compared with bigenic mice
      (Osx(f/f)/SCID). Thus, tumor-induced EC-to-OSB conversion is one mechanism that
      leads to osteoblastic bone metastasis of PCa.

AB  - Critical steps in forming the vertebrate limb include the positioning of digits
      and the positioning of joints within each digit. Recent studies have proposed
      that the iterative series of digits is established by a Turing-like mechanism
      generating stripes of chondrogenic domains. However, re-examination of available 
      data suggest that digits are actually patterned as evenly spaced spots, not
      stripes, which then elongate into rod-shaped digit rays by incorporating new
      cells at their tips. Moreover, extension of the digit rays and the patterning of 
      the joints occur simultaneously at the distal tip, implying that an integrated
      model is required to fully understand these processes.

AB  - The intestinal crypt and its stem cells are dependent on the Wnt pathway.
      Reporting in Nature, Yan et al. (2017) show that Wnts and Wnt signaling
      potentiator R-spondins have non-interchangeable roles. Both are necessary for
      intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance, and R-spondins are the limiting factor
      that defines ISC number.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Jossin et al. (2017) show that the tumor
      suppressor protein Lgl1 interacts with N-cadherin to stabilize apical junctions
      in brain stem cells. Neural progenitors lacking Lgl1 had decreased N-cadherin
      internalization and abnormal cell junctions, generating an ectopic neuronal layer
      that resembles cerebral cortex abnormalities in humans.

AB  - Prostate cancer bone metastases are primarily osteoblastic, but the source of
      bone-forming cells in these lesions remains poorly defined. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Lin et al. (2017) demonstrate that tumor-associated
      endothelial cells can give rise to osteoblasts in prostate cancer through
      endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) conversion.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) is the key signal driving specification of
      primitive endoderm (PrE) versus pluripotent epiblast (EPI) within the inner cell 
      mass (ICM) of the mouse blastocyst. To gain insight into the receptor(s)
      responding to FGF4 within ICM cells, we combined single-cell-resolution
      quantitative imaging with single-cell transcriptomics of wild-type and Fgf
      receptor (Fgfr) mutant embryos. Despite the PrE-specific expression of FGFR2, it 
      is FGFR1, expressed by all ICM cells, that is critical for establishment of a PrE
      identity. Signaling through FGFR1 is also required to constrain levels of the
      pluripotency-associated factor NANOG in EPI cells. However, the activity of both 
      receptors is required for lineage establishment within the ICM. Gene expression
      profiling of 534 single ICM cells identified distinct downstream targets
      associated with each receptor. These data lead us to propose a model whereby
      unique and additive activities of FGFR1 and FGFR2 within the ICM coordinate
      establishment of two distinct lineages.

AB  - Malformations of the cerebral cortex (MCCs) are devastating developmental
      disorders. We report here that mice with embryonic neural stem-cell-specific
      deletion of Llgl1 (Nestin-Cre/Llgl1(fl/fl)), a mammalian ortholog of the
      Drosophila cell polarity gene lgl, exhibit MCCs resembling severe periventricular
      heterotopia (PH). Immunohistochemical analyses and live cortical imaging of PH
      formation revealed that disruption of apical junctional complexes (AJCs) was
      responsible for PH in Nestin-Cre/Llgl1(fl/fl) brains. While it is well known that
      cell polarity proteins govern the formation of AJCs, the exact mechanisms remain 
      unclear. We show that LLGL1 directly binds to and promotes internalization of
      N-cadherin, and N-cadherin/LLGL1 interaction is inhibited by atypical protein
      kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of LLGL1, restricting the accumulation of AJCs 
      to the basolateral-apical boundary. Disruption of the N-cadherin-LLGL1
      interaction during cortical development in vivo is sufficient for PH. These
      findings reveal a mechanism responsible for the physical and functional
      connection between cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion machineries in mammalian 
      cells.

AB  - Activation of the FGF signaling pathway during preimplantation development of the
      mouse embryo is known to be essential for differentiation of the inner cell mass 
      and the formation of the primitive endoderm (PrE). We now show using fluorescent 
      reporter knockin lines that Fgfr1 is expressed in all cell populations of the
      blastocyst, while Fgfr2 expression becomes restricted to extraembryonic lineages,
      including the PrE. We further show that loss of both receptors prevents the
      development of the PrE and demonstrate that FGFR1 plays a more prominent role in 
      this process than FGFR2. Finally, we document an essential role for FGFRs in
      embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, with FGFR1 again having a greater
      influence than FGFR2 in ESC exit from the pluripotent state. Collectively, these 
      results identify mechanisms through which FGF signaling regulates inner cell mass
      lineage restriction and cell commitment during preimplantation development.

AB  - Yeast use the ring-shaped Dam1 complex to slide down depolymerizing microtubules 
      to move chromosomes, but current models suggest that other eukaryotes do not have
      a sliding ring. We visualized Ndc80 and Ska complexes on microtubules by electron
      microscopic tomography to identify the structure of the human
      kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Ndc80 recruits the Ska complex so that the V 
      shape of the Ska dimer interacts along protofilaments. We identify a mutant of
      the Ndc80 tail that is deficient in Ska recruitment to kinetochores and in
      orienting Ska along protofilaments in vitro. This mutant Ndc80 binds microtubules
      with normal affinity but is deficient in clustering along protofilaments. We
      propose that Ska is recruited to kinetochores by clusters of Ndc80 proteins and
      that our structure of Ndc80 and Ska complexes on microtubules suggests a
      mechanism for metazoan kinetochores to couple the depolymerization of
      microtubules to power the movement of chromosomes.

TI  - Dephosphorylation of the Ndc80 Tail Stabilizes Kinetochore-Microtubule
      Attachments via the Ska Complex.

AB  - During cell division, genome inheritance is orchestrated by microtubule
      attachments formed at kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes. The primary
      microtubule coupler at the kinetochore, the Ndc80 complex, is regulated by Aurora
      kinase phosphorylation of its N-terminal tail. Dephosphorylation is proposed to
      stabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments by strengthening electrostatic
      interactions of the tail with the microtubule lattice. Here, we show that removal
      of the Ndc80 tail, which compromises in vitro microtubule binding, has no effect 
      on kinetochore-microtubule attachments in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo.
      Despite this, preventing Aurora phosphorylation of the tail results in
      prematurely stable attachments that restrain spindle elongation. This premature
      stabilization requires the conserved microtubule-binding Ska complex, which
      enriches at attachment sites prior to anaphase onset to dampen chromosome motion.
      We propose that Ndc80-tail dephosphorylation promotes stabilization of
      kinetochore-microtubule attachments via the Ska complex and that this mechanism
      ensures accurate segregation by constraining chromosome motion following
      biorientation on the spindle.

AB  - Germline-expressed endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) transmit
      multigenerational epigenetic information to ensure fertility in subsequent
      generations. In Caenorhabditis elegans, nuclear RNAi ensures robust inheritance
      of endo-siRNAs and deposition of repressive H3K9me3 marks at target loci. How
      target silencing is maintained in subsequent generations is poorly understood. We
      discovered that morc-1 is essential for transgenerational fertility and acts as
      an effector of endo-siRNAs. Unexpectedly, morc-1 is dispensable for siRNA
      inheritance but is required for target silencing and maintenance of
      siRNA-dependent chromatin organization. A forward genetic screen identified
      mutations in met-1, which encodes an H3K36 methyltransferase, as potent
      suppressors of morc-1(-) and nuclear RNAi mutant phenotypes. Further analysis of 
      nuclear RNAi and morc-1(-) mutants revealed a progressive, met-1-dependent
      enrichment of H3K36me3, suggesting that robust fertility requires repression of
      MET-1 activity at nuclear RNAi targets. Without MORC-1 and nuclear RNAi,
      MET-1-mediated encroachment of euchromatin leads to detrimental decondensation of
      germline chromatin and germline mortality.

AB  - Mesodermal cells signal to neighboring epithelial cells to modulate their
      proliferation in both normal and disease states. We adapted a Caenorhabditis
      elegans organogenesis model to enable a genome-wide mesodermal-specific RNAi
      screen and discovered 39 factors in mesodermal cells that suppress the
      proliferation of adjacent Ras pathway-sensitized epithelial cells. These
      candidates encode components of protein complexes and signaling pathways that
      converge on the control of chromatin dynamics, cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and
      translation. Stromal fibroblast-specific deletion of mouse orthologs of several
      candidates resulted in the hyper-proliferation of mammary gland epithelium.
      Furthermore, a 33-gene signature of human orthologs was selectively enriched in
      the tumor stroma of breast cancer patients, and depletion of these factors from
      normal human breast fibroblasts increased proliferation of co-cultured breast
      cancer cells. This cross-species approach identified unanticipated regulatory
      networks in mesodermal cells with growth-suppressive function, exposing the
      conserved and selective nature of mesodermal-epithelial communication in
      development and cancer.

AB  - During mouse embryo development, both muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) and brown
      adipocytes (BAs) are known to derive from the same Pax7(+)/Myf5(+) progenitor
      cells. However, the underlying mechanisms for the cell fate control remain
      unclear. In Pax7-null MPCs from young mice, several BA-specific genes, including 
      Prdm16 and Ucp1 and many other adipocyte-related genes, were upregulated with a
      concomitant reduction of Myod and Myf5, two muscle lineage-determining genes.
      This suggests a cell fate switch from MPC to BA. Consistently, freshly isolated
      Pax7-null but not wild-type MPCs formed lipid-droplet-containing UCP1(+) BA in
      culture. Mechanistically, MyoD and Myf5, both known transcription targets of Pax7
      in MPC, potently repress Prdm16, a BA-specific lineage-determining gene, via the 
      E2F4/p107/p130 transcription repressor complex. Importantly, inducible Pax7
      ablation in developing mouse embryos promoted brown fat development. Thus, the
      MyoD/Myf5-E2F4/p107/p130 axis functions in both the Pax7(+)/Myf5(+) embryonic
      progenitor cells and postnatal myoblasts to repress the alternative BA fate.

AB  - Intimate communication between neural and vascular cells is critical for normal
      brain development and function. Germinal matrix (GM), a key primordium for the
      brain reward circuitry, is unique among brain regions for its distinct pace of
      angiogenesis and selective vulnerability to hemorrhage during development. A
      major neonatal condition, GM hemorrhage can lead to cerebral palsy,
      hydrocephalus, and mental retardation. Here we identify a brain-region-specific
      neural progenitor-based signaling pathway dedicated to regulating GM vessel
      development. This pathway consists of cell-surface sphingosine-1-phosphate
      receptors, an intracellular cascade including Galpha co-factor Ric8a and p38
      MAPK, and target gene integrin beta8, which in turn regulates vascular TGF-beta
      signaling. These findings provide insights into region-specific specialization of
      neurovascular communication, with special implications for deciphering potent
      early-life endocrine, as well as potential gut microbiota impacts on brain reward
      circuitry. They also identify tissue-specific molecular targets for GM hemorrhage
      intervention.

AB  - The kidney contains the functional units, the nephrons, surrounded by the renal
      interstitium. Previously we discovered that, once Six2-expressing nephron
      progenitor cells and Foxd1-expressing renal interstitial progenitor cells form at
      the onset of kidney development, descendant cells from these populations
      contribute exclusively to the main body of nephrons and renal interstitial
      tissues, respectively, indicating a lineage boundary between the nephron and
      renal interstitial compartments. Currently it is unclear how lineages are
      regulated during kidney organogenesis. We demonstrate that nephron progenitor
      cells lacking Pax2 fail to differentiate into nephron cells but can switch fates 
      into renal interstitium-like cell types. These data suggest that Pax2 function
      maintains nephron progenitor cells by repressing a renal interstitial cell
      program. Thus, the lineage boundary between the nephron and renal interstitial
      compartments is maintained by the Pax2 activity in nephron progenitor cells
      during kidney organogenesis.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms driving tissue and organ formation requires
      knowledge across scales. How do signaling pathways specify distinct tissue types?
      How does the patterning system control morphogenesis? How do these processes
      evolve? The Drosophila egg chamber, where EGF and BMP signaling intersect to
      specify unique cell types that construct epithelial tubes for specialized
      eggshell structures, has provided a tractable system to ask these questions. Work
      there has elucidated connections between scales of development, including across 
      evolutionary scales, and fostered the development of quantitative modeling tools.
      These tools and general principles can be applied to the understanding of other
      developmental processes across organisms.

AB  - The development of reproducible folding in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex is a
      topic of great interest to neuroscientists. In a recent paper in Cell, del Toro
      et al. (2017) show that changing the adhesive properties of neurons in the
      normally lissencephalic mouse cortex leads to the formation of stereotyped
      folding.

AB  - Developing kidneys have Foxd1(+) stromogenic stem cells and [Six2(+), Pax2(+)]
      nephrogenic stem cells. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Naiman et al. (2017)
      show that targeted Pax2 deletion converts nephrogenic cells to the stromogenic
      path, suggesting that Pax2 normally represses an otherwise inevitable transition 
      between sister lineages.

AB  - RhoA-mediated regulation of myosin-II activity in the actin cortex controls the
      ability of cells to contract and bleb during a variety of cellular processes,
      including cell migration and division. Cell contraction and blebbing also
      frequently occur as part of the cytopathic effect seen during many different
      viral infections. We now demonstrate that the vaccinia virus protein F11, which
      localizes to the plasma membrane, is required for ROCK-mediated cell contraction 
      from 2 hr post infection. Curiously, F11-induced cell contraction is dependent on
      RhoC and not RhoA signaling to ROCK. Moreover, RhoC-driven cell contraction
      depends on the upstream inhibition of RhoD signaling by F11. This inhibition
      prevents RhoD from regulating its downstream effector Pak6, alleviating the
      suppression of RhoC by the kinase. Our observations with vaccinia have now
      demonstrated that RhoD recruits Pak6 to the plasma membrane to antagonize RhoC
      signaling during cell contraction and blebbing.

AB  - Cell division site positioning is precisely regulated to generate correctly sized
      and shaped daughters. We uncover the strategy used by the social bacterium
      Myxococcus xanthus to position the FtsZ cytokinetic ring at midcell. PomX, PomY, 
      and the nucleoid-binding ParA/MinD ATPase PomZ self-assemble forming a large
      nucleoid-associated complex that localizes at the division site before FtsZ to
      directly guide and stimulate division. PomXYZ localization is generated through
      self-organized biased random motion on the nucleoid toward midcell and
      constrained motion at midcell. Experiments and theory show that PomXYZ motion is 
      produced by diffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the complex. Flux
      differences scale with the intracellular asymmetry of the complex and are
      converted into a local PomZ concentration gradient across the complex with
      translocation toward the higher PomZ concentration. At midcell, fluxes equalize
      resulting in constrained motion. Flux-based mechanisms may represent a general
      paradigm for positioning of macromolecular structures in bacteria.

AB  - Chromosome segregation during meiosis in oocytes is error prone. The uniquely
      large cytoplasmic size of oocytes, which provides support for embryogenesis after
      fertilization, might be a predisposing factor for meiotic errors. However, this
      hypothesis remains unproven. Here, we show that cytoplasmic size affects the
      functionality of the acentrosomal spindle. Artificially decreasing the
      cytoplasmic size in mouse oocytes allows the acentrosomal spindle poles to have a
      better-focused distribution of microtubule-organizing centers and to biorient
      chromosomes more efficiently, whereas enlargement of the cytoplasmic size has the
      opposite effects. Moreover, we found that the cytoplasmic size-dependent dilution
      of nuclear factors, including anaphase inhibitors that are preformed at the
      nuclear membrane, limits the spindle's capacity to prevent anaphase entry with
      misaligned chromosomes. The present study defines a large cytoplasmic volume as a
      cell-intrinsic feature linked to the error-prone nature of oocytes. This may
      represent a trade-off between meiotic fidelity and post-fertilization
      developmental competence.

AB  - Gastric acid secretion by parietal cells requires trafficking and exocytosis of
      H/K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles (TVs) toward apical membranes in response to
      histamine stimulation via cyclic AMP elevation. Here, we found that TRPML1 (ML1),
      a protein that is mutated in type IV mucolipidosis (ML-IV), is a tubulovesicular 
      channel essential for TV exocytosis and acid secretion. Whereas ML-IV patients
      are reportedly achlorhydric, transgenic overexpression of ML1 in mouse parietal
      cells induced constitutive acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion was blocked and
      stimulated by ML1 inhibitors and agonists, respectively. Organelle-targeted
      Ca(2+) imaging and direct patch-clamping of apical vacuolar membranes revealed
      that ML1 mediates a PKA-activated conductance on TV membranes that is required
      for histamine-induced Ca(2+) release from TV stores. Hence, we demonstrated that 
      ML1, acting as a Ca(2+) channel in TVs, links transmitter-initiated cyclic
      nucleotide signaling with Ca(2+)-dependent TV exocytosis in parietal cells,
      providing a regulatory mechanism that could be targeted to manage acid-related
      gastric diseases.

AB  - The Notch signaling pathway relies on a proteolytic cascade to release its
      transcriptionally active intracellular domain, on force to unfold a protective
      domain and permit proteolysis, on extracellular domain glycosylation to tune the 
      forces exerted by endocytosed ligands, and on a motley crew of nuclear proteins, 
      chromatin modifiers, ubiquitin ligases, and a few kinases to regulate activity
      and half-life. Herein we provide a review of recent molecular insights into how
      Notch signals are triggered and how cell shape affects these events, and we use
      the new insights to illuminate a few perplexing observations.

AB  - Pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells proliferate and transiently express the
      bHLH transcription factor Ngn3. In recent issues of Developmental Cell, Azzarelli
      et al. (2017) and Krentz et al. (2017) demonstrate how CDK phosphorylation of
      Ngn3 governs the switch between their renewal and differentiation. Lengthening
      the cell cycle allows Ngn3 accumulation, outpacing phosphorylation-induced
      degradation.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Kyogoku and Kitajima (2017) investigate the 
      effect of cytoplasmic volume on the fidelity of chromosome segregation during
      meiosis in mouse oocytes. The authors find that large cytoplasmic volume affects 
      spindle pole morphology, chromosome alignment, and stringency of checkpoint
      signaling, resulting in error-prone chromosome segregation.

TI  - Multi-site Neurogenin3 Phosphorylation Controls Pancreatic Endocrine
      Differentiation.
PG  - 274-286.e5
LID - S1534-5807(17)30297-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2017.04.004 [doi]
AB  - The proneural transcription factor Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) plays a critical role in
      pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, although regulation of Ngn3 protein is
      largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that Ngn3 protein undergoes
      cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-mediated phosphorylation on multiple serine-proline
      sites. Replacing wild-type protein with a phosphomutant form of Ngn3 increases
      alpha cell generation, the earliest endocrine cell type to be formed in the
      developing pancreas. Moreover, un(der)phosphorylated Ngn3 maintains insulin
      expression in adult beta cells in the presence of elevated c-Myc and enhances
      endocrine specification during ductal reprogramming. Mechanistically, preventing 
      multi-site phosphorylation enhances both Ngn3 stability and DNA binding,
      promoting the increased expression of target genes that drive differentiation.
      Therefore, multi-site phosphorylation of Ngn3 controls its ability to promote
      pancreatic endocrine differentiation and to maintain beta cell function in the
      presence of pro-proliferation cues and could be manipulated to promote and
      maintain endocrine differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Transcriptional networks, regulated by extracellular signals, control cell fate
      decisions and determine the size and composition of developing tissues. One
      example is the network controlling bipotent neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs)
      that fuel embryo elongation by generating spinal cord and trunk mesoderm tissue. 
      Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to identify the molecular signature of
      NMPs and reverse engineer the mechanism that regulates their differentiation.
      Together with genetic perturbations, this reveals a transcriptional network that 
      integrates opposing retinoic acid (RA) and Wnt signals to determine the rate at
      which cells enter and exit the NMP state. RA, produced by newly generated
      mesodermal cells, provides feedback that initiates NMP generation and induces
      neural differentiation, thereby coordinating the production of neural and
      mesodermal tissue. Together, the data define a regulatory network architecture
      that balances the generation of different cell types from bipotential progenitors
      in order to facilitate orderly axis elongation.

AB  - The Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is comprised of two cell types, hair and 
      nonhair cells, which differentiate from the same precursor. Although the
      transcriptional programs regulating these events are well studied,
      post-transcriptional factors functioning in this cell fate decision are mostly
      unknown. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary
      structure in hair and nonhair cell nuclei. This analysis reveals distinct
      structural and protein binding patterns across both transcriptomes, allowing
      identification of differential RNA binding protein (RBP) recognition sites. Using
      these sequences, we identify two RBPs that regulate hair cell development.
      Specifically, we find that SERRATE functions in a microRNA-dependent manner to
      inhibit hair cell fate, while also terminating growth of root hairs mostly
      independent of microRNA biogenesis. In addition, we show that GLYCINE-RICH
      PROTEIN 8 promotes hair cell fate while alleviating phosphate starvation stress. 
      In total, this global analysis reveals post-transcriptional regulators of plant
      root epidermal cell fate.

AB  - Formation and resolution of multicellular rosettes can drive convergent extension
      (CE) type cell rearrangements during tissue morphogenesis. Rosette dynamics are
      regulated by both planar cell polarity (PCP)-dependent and -independent pathways.
      Here we show that CE is involved in ventral nerve cord (VNC) assembly in
      Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that a VANG-1/Van Gogh and PRKL-1/Prickle
      containing PCP pathway and a Slit-independent SAX-3/Robo pathway cooperate to
      regulate, via rosette intermediaries, the intercalation of post-mitotic neuronal 
      cell bodies during VNC formation. We show that VANG-1 and SAX-3 are localized to 
      contracting edges and rosette foci and act to specify edge contraction during
      rosette formation and to mediate timely rosette resolution. Simultaneous loss of 
      both pathways severely curtails CE resulting in a shortened, anteriorly displaced
      distribution of VNC neurons at hatching. Our results establish rosette-based CE
      as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of nerve cord morphogenesis and reveal a
      role for SAX-3/Robo in this process.

AB  - Synaptic refinement is a critical step in nervous system maturation, requiring a 
      carefully timed reorganization and refinement of neuronal connections. We have
      identified myrf-1 and myrf-2, two C. elegans homologs of Myrf family
      transcription factors, as key regulators of synaptic rewiring. MYRF-1 and its
      paralog MYRF-2 are functionally redundant specifically in synaptic rewiring. They
      co-exist in the same protein complex and act cooperatively to regulate synaptic
      rewiring. We find that the MYRF proteins localize to the ER membrane and that
      they are cleaved into active N-terminal fragments, which then translocate into
      the nucleus to drive synaptic rewiring. Overexpression of active forms of MYRF is
      sufficient to accelerate synaptic rewiring. MYRF-1 and MYRF-2 are the first genes
      identified to be indispensable for promoting synaptic rewiring in C. elegans.
      These findings reveal a molecular mechanism underlying synaptic rewiring and
      developmental circuit plasticity.

AB  - Piwi family protein Aubergine (Aub) maintains genome integrity in late germ cells
      of the Drosophila ovary through Piwi-associated RNA-mediated repression of
      transposon activities. Although it is highly expressed in germline stem cells
      (GSCs) and early progeny, it remains unclear whether it plays any roles in early 
      GSC lineage development. Here we report that Aub promotes GSC self-renewal and
      GSC progeny differentiation. RNA-iCLIP results show that Aub binds the mRNAs
      encoding self-renewal and differentiation factors in cultured GSCs. Aub controls 
      GSC self-renewal by preventing DNA-damage-induced Chk2 activation and by
      translationally controlling the expression of self-renewal factors. It promotes
      GSC progeny differentiation by translationally controlling the expression of
      differentiation factors, including Bam. Therefore, this study reveals a function 
      of Aub in GSCs and their progeny, which promotes translation of self-renewal and 
      differentiation factors by directly binding to its target mRNAs and interacting
      with translational initiation factors.

      to Ensure Error-Free Chromosome Segregation.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1 not only inhibits anaphase but also
      corrects erroneous attachments that could lead to missegregation and aneuploidy. 
      However, Mps1's error correction-relevant substrates are unknown. Using a
      chemically tuned kinetochore-targeting assay, we show that Mps1 destabilizes
      microtubule attachments (K fibers) epistatically to Aurora B, the other major
      error-correcting kinase. Through quantitative proteomics, we identify multiple
      sites of Mps1-regulated phosphorylation at the outer kinetochore. Substrate
      modification was microtubule sensitive and opposed by PP2A-B56 phosphatases that 
      stabilize chromosome-spindle attachment. Consistently, Mps1 inhibition rescued
      K-fiber stability after depleting PP2A-B56. We also identify the Ska complex as a
      key effector of Mps1 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, as mutations that 
      mimic constitutive phosphorylation destabilized K fibers in vivo and reduced the 
      efficiency of the Ska complex's conversion from lattice diffusion to end-coupled 
      microtubule binding in vitro. Our results reveal how Mps1 dynamically modifies
      kinetochores to correct improper attachments and ensure faithful chromosome
      segregation.

AB  - During pancreatic development, proliferating pancreatic progenitors activate the 
      proendocrine transcription factor neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3), exit the cell cycle,
      and differentiate into islet cells. The mechanisms that direct robust NEUROG3
      expression within a subset of progenitor cells control the size of the endocrine 
      population. Here we demonstrate that NEUROG3 is phosphorylated within the nucleus
      on serine 183, which catalyzes its hyperphosphorylation and proteosomal
      degradation. During progression through the progenitor cell cycle, NEUROG3
      phosphorylation is driven by the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4/6 at
      G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint. Using models of mouse and human pancreas development,
      we show that lengthening of the G1 phase of the pancreatic progenitor cell cycle 
      is essential for proper induction of NEUROG3 and initiation of endocrine cell
      differentiation. In sum, these studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-cycle G1 
      lengthening, through its actions on stabilization of NEUROG3, is an essential
      variable in normal endocrine cell genesis.

AB  - The conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP/CHN-1 contributes to proteostasis by
      ubiquitylating HSP70 and HSP90-interacting proteins. In a recent issue of
      Cell,Tawo et al. (2017) show that CHIP/CHN-1 also directly ubiquitylates the
      insulin receptor INSR/DAF-2 to regulate its turnover. These findings suggest an
      unexpected interpretation of the effects of altered proteostasis on survival.

AB  - In a new report in Nature, Tian and colleagues (2017) describe that T cell
      activation in tumors induces blood vessel normalization. Because abnormal
      vasculature in tumors is known to reduce chemotherapy effectiveness and T
      lymphocyte infiltration and to increase metastasis, this suggests an exciting
      novel angle for checkpoint immunotherapy.

AB  - Chlorophyll biosynthesis enables autotrophic development of developing seedlings.
      Upon light exposure, the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide produces
      reactive oxygen species (ROS). Developing seedlings acquire photosynthetic
      competence through the action of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (PORs) that 
      convert protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide, reducing ROS production that would
      otherwise induce cellular damage and chlorophyll bleaching. Here, we show that
      FCA mediates the thermostabilization of PORs to trigger the conversion of
      protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide in developing seedlings. FCA also
      facilitates the thermal induction of POR genes through histone acetylation that
      promotes the accessibility of RNA polymerases to the gene promoters. The combined
      action of FCA maintains PORs at warm temperatures, shifting the chlorophyll-ROS
      balance toward autotrophic development. We propose that the FCA-mediated thermal 
      adaptation of autotrophic development allows developing seedlings to cope with
      the heat-absorbing soil surface layer under natural conditions. The thermal
      adaptive mechanism would provide a potential basis for studying crop performance 
      at warm temperatures.

AB  - Human susceptibility to obesity is mainly genetic, yet the underlying
      evolutionary drivers causing variation from person to person are not clear. One
      theory rationalizes that populations that have adapted to warmer climates have
      reduced their metabolic rates, thereby increasing their propensity to store
      energy. We uncover here the function of a gene that supports this theory. THADA
      is one of the genes most strongly selected during evolution as humans settled in 
      different climates. We report here that THADA knockout flies are obese,
      hyperphagic, have reduced energy production, and are sensitive to the cold. THADA
      binds the sarco/ER Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and acts on it as an uncoupler. Reducing
      SERCA activity in THADA mutant flies rescues their obesity, pinpointing SERCA as 
      a key effector of THADA function. In sum, this identifies THADA as a regulator of
      the balance between energy consumption and energy storage, which was selected
      during human evolution.

AB  - Differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into distinct cell types was thought 
      to occur through a series of discrete, stable progenitor states. Work from Velten
      et al. (2017) now shows that hematopoietic cells differentiate via a mechanism of
      continuous lineage priming and thus represent a CLOUD-HSPC.

      Deprivation-Induced Autophagy by Regulating Mitochondrial Respiration.

AB  - Autophagy is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, but the mechanism by 
      which energy deprivation activates autophagy is not fully understood. We show
      that Mec1/ATR, a member of the DNA damage response pathway, is essential for
      glucose starvation-induced autophagy. Mec1, Atg13, Atg1, and the energy-sensing
      kinase Snf1 are recruited to mitochondria shortly after glucose starvation. Mec1 
      is recruited through the adaptor protein Ggc1. Snf1 phosphorylates Mec1 on the
      mitochondrial surface, leading to recruitment of Atg1 to mitochondria.
      Furthermore, the Snf1-mediated Mec1 phosphorylation and mitochondrial recruitment
      of Atg1 are essential for maintaining mitochondrial respiration during glucose
      starvation, and active mitochondrial respiration is required for energy
      deprivation-activated autophagy. Thus, formation of a Snf1-Mec1-Atg1 module on
      mitochondria governs energy deprivation-induced autophagy by regulating
      mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Plants assemble beneficial root-associated microbiomes to support growth,
      especially in nutrient-poor conditions. To do so, however, plants have to
      suppress their immune system. Reporting in Nature, Castrillo et al. (2017)
      identified PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) as a central regulator in this
      balance between nutrient stress response and immune regulation.

AB  - The plant hormones brassinosteroids (BRs) participate in light-mediated
      regulation of plant growth, although the underlying mechanisms are far from being
      fully understood. In addition, the function of the core transcription factor in
      the BR signaling pathway, BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), largely depends on its
      phosphorylation status and its protein stability, but the regulation of BES1 is
      not well understood. Here, we report that SINA of Arabidopsis thaliana (SINATs)
      specifically interact with dephosphorylated BES1 and mediate its ubiquitination
      and degradation. Our genetic data demonstrated that SINATs inhibit BR signaling
      in a BES1-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that the protein levels of
      SINATs were decreased in the dark and increased in the light, which changed BES1 
      protein levels accordingly. Thus, our study not only uncovered a new mechanism of
      BES1 degradation but also provides significant insights into how light
      conditionally regulates plant growth through controlling accumulation of
      different forms of BES1.

AB  - Plants encounter a variety of stresses and must fine-tune their growth and
      stress-response programs to best suit their environment. BES1 functions as a
      master regulator in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway that promotes plant growth. 
      Here, we show that BES1 interacts with the ubiquitin receptor protein DSK2 and is
      targeted to the autophagy pathway during stress via the interaction of DSK2 with 
      ATG8, a ubiquitin-like protein directing autophagosome formation and cargo
      recruitment. Additionally, DSK2 is phosphorylated by the GSK3-like kinase BIN2, a
      negative regulator in the BR pathway. BIN2 phosphorylation of DSK2 flanking its
      ATG8 interacting motifs (AIMs) promotes DSK2-ATG8 interaction, thereby targeting 
      BES1 for degradation. Accordingly, loss-of-function dsk2 mutants accumulate BES1,
      have altered global gene expression profiles, and have compromised stress
      responses. Our results thus reveal that plants coordinate growth and stress
      responses by integrating BR and autophagy pathways and identify the molecular
      basis of this crosstalk.

AB  - The study of genome architecture has recently been advanced by new techniques
      combining nuclear proximity ligation and high-throughput sequencing, but
      independent methods to validate them have been lacking. Reporting in Nature,
      Beagrie et al. (2017) describe such an orthogonal technique, called genome
      architecture mapping, to map genomes in 3D space.

AB  - The induction of autophagy by nutrient deprivation leads to a rapid increase in
      the formation of autophagosomes, unique organelles that replenish the cellular
      pool of nutrients by sequestering cytoplasmic material for degradation. The
      urgent need for membranes to form autophagosomes during starvation to maintain
      homeostasis leads to a dramatic rearrangement of intracellular membranes. Here we
      discuss recent findings that have begun to uncover how different parts of the
      secretory pathway directly and indirectly contribute to autophagosome formation
      during starvation.

TI  - Spectraplakin Induces Positive Feedback between Fusogens and the Actin
      Cytoskeleton to Promote Cell-Cell Fusion.

AB  - Cell-cell fusion generally requires cellular fusogenic proteins and
      actin-propelled membrane protrusions. However, the molecular connections between 
      fusogens and the actin cytoskeleton remain unclear. Here, we show that the
      Caenorhabditis elegans fusogen EFF-1 and F-actin are enriched at the cortex of
      the post-embryonic fusing cells, and conditional mutations of WASP and Arp2/3
      delay cell-cell fusion by impairing EFF-1 localization. Our affinity purification
      and mass spectrometry analyses determined that an actin-binding protein,
      spectraplakin/VAB-10A, binds to EFF-1. VAB-10A promotes cell-cell fusion by
      linking EFF-1 to the actin cytoskeleton. Conversely, EFF-1 enhanced the F-actin
      bundling activity of VAB-10A in vitro, and actin dynamics in the cortex were
      reduced in eff-1 or vab-10a mutants. Thus, cell-cell fusion is promoted by a
      positive feedback loop in which actin filaments that are crosslinked by
      spectraplakin to recruit fusogens to fusion sites are reinforced via fusogens,
      thereby increasing the probability of further fusogen accumulation to form fusion
      synapses.

AB  - The selective clearance of organelles by autophagy is critical for the regulation
      of cellular homeostasis in organisms from yeast to humans. Removal of damaged
      organelles clears the cell of potentially toxic byproducts and enables reuse of
      organelle components for bioenergetics. Thus, defects in organelle clearance may 
      be detrimental to the health of the cells, contributing to cancer,
      neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases. Organelle-specific autophagy can
      clear mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, ER, chloroplasts, and the nucleus.
      Here, we review our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the clearance
      of organelles by autophagy and highlight gaps in our knowledge of these
      processes.

AB  - Global transcriptome reprogramming during spermatogenesis ensures timely
      expression of factors in each phase of male germ cell differentiation.
      Spermatocytes and spermatids require particularly extensive reprogramming of gene
      expression to switch from mitosis to meiosis and to support gamete morphogenesis.
      Here, we uncovered an extensive alternative splicing program during this
      transmeiotic differentiation. Notably, intron retention was largely the most
      enriched pattern, with spermatocytes showing generally higher levels of retention
      compared with spermatids. Retained introns are characterized by weak splice sites
      and are enriched in genes with strong relevance for gamete function. Meiotic
      intron-retaining transcripts (IRTs) were exclusively localized in the nucleus.
      However, differently from other developmentally regulated IRTs, they are stable
      RNAs, showing longer half-life than properly spliced transcripts. Strikingly,
      fate-mapping experiments revealed that IRTs are recruited onto polyribosomes days
      after synthesis. These studies reveal an unexpected function for regulated intron
      retention in modulation of the timely expression of select transcripts during
      spermatogenesis.

AB  - Columnar restriction of neurites is critical for forming nonoverlapping receptive
      fields and preserving spatial sensory information from the periphery in both
      vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems, but the underlying molecular
      mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila homolog
      of alpha-neurexin (DNrx) plays an essential role in columnar restriction during
      L4 axon branching. Depletion of DNrx from L4 neurons resulted in misprojection of
      L4 axonal branches into neighboring columns due to impaired ephrin clustering.
      The proper ephrin clustering requires its interaction with the intracellular
      region of DNrx. Furthermore, we find that Drosophila neuroligin 4 (DNlg4) in Tm2 
      neurons binds to DNrx and initiates DNrx clustering in L4 neurons, which
      subsequently induces ephrin clustering. Our study demonstrates that DNrx promotes
      ephrin clustering and reveals that ephrin/Eph signaling from adjacent L4 neurons 
      restricts axonal branches of L4 neurons in columns.

AB  - Limb amputation in the newt induces myofibers to dedifferentiate and re-enter the
      cell cycle to generate proliferative myogenic precursors in the regeneration
      blastema. Here we show that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and mature BMPs
      that have been further cleaved by serum proteases induce cell cycle entry by
      dedifferentiating newt muscle cells. Protease-activated BMP4/7 heterodimers that 
      are present in serum strongly induced myotube cell cycle re-entry with protease
      cleavage yielding a 30-fold potency increase of BMP4/7 compared with canonical
      BMP4/7. Inhibition of BMP signaling via muscle-specific dominant-negative
      receptor expression reduced cell cycle entry in vitro and in vivo. In vivo
      inhibition of serine protease activity depressed cell cycle re-entry, which in
      turn was rescued by cleaved-mimic BMP. This work identifies a mechanism of BMP
      activation that generates blastema cells from differentiated muscle.

TI  - The Putative Drp1 Inhibitor mdivi-1 Is a Reversible Mitochondrial Complex I
      Inhibitor that Modulates Reactive Oxygen Species.

AB  - Mitochondrial fission mediated by the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is 
      an attractive drug target in numerous maladies that range from heart disease to
      neurodegenerative disorders. The compound mdivi-1 is widely reported to inhibit
      Drp1-dependent fission, elongate mitochondria, and mitigate brain injury. Here,
      we show that mdivi-1 reversibly inhibits mitochondrial complex I-dependent O2
      consumption and reverse electron transfer-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      production at concentrations (e.g., 50 muM) used to target mitochondrial fission.
      Respiratory inhibition is rescued by bypassing complex I using yeast NADH
      dehydrogenase Ndi1. Unexpectedly, respiratory impairment by mdivi-1 occurs
      without mitochondrial elongation, is not mimicked by Drp1 deletion, and is
      observed in Drp1-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, mdivi-1 poorly inhibits
      recombinant Drp1 GTPase activity (Ki > 1.2 mM). Overall, these results suggest
      that mdivi-1 is not a specific Drp1 inhibitor. The ability of mdivi-1 to
      reversibly inhibit complex I and modify mitochondrial ROS production may
      contribute to effects observed in disease models.

AB  - A lack of sufficient oligodendrocyte myelination contributes to remyelination
      failure in demyelinating disorders. miRNAs have been implicated in
      oligodendrogenesis; however, their functions in myelin regeneration remained
      elusive. Through developmentally regulated targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate
      that miR-219 alleles are critical for CNS myelination and remyelination after
      injury. Further deletion of miR-338 exacerbates the miR-219 mutant
      hypomyelination phenotype. Conversely, miR-219 overexpression promotes precocious
      oligodendrocyte maturation and regeneration processes in transgenic mice.
      Integrated transcriptome profiling and biotin-affinity miRNA pull-down approaches
      reveal stage-specific miR-219 targets in oligodendrocytes and further uncover a
      novel network for miR-219 targeting of differentiation inhibitors including
      Lingo1 and Etv5. Inhibition of Lingo1 and Etv5 partially rescues differentiation 
      defects of miR-219-deficient oligodendrocyte precursors. Furthermore, miR-219
      mimics enhance myelin restoration following lysolecithin-induced demyelination as
      well as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, principal animal models of
      multiple sclerosis. Together, our findings identify context-specific
      miRNA-regulated checkpoints that control myelinogenesis and a therapeutic role
      for miR-219 in CNS myelin repair.

AB  - Proper functioning of an organism requires cells and tissues to behave in
      uniform, well-organized ways. How this optimum of phenotypes is achieved during
      the development of vertebrates is unclear. Here, we carried out a multi-faceted
      and single-cell resolution screen of zebrafish embryonic blood vessels upon
      mutagenesis of single and multi-gene microRNA (miRNA) families. We found that
      embryos lacking particular miRNA-dependent signaling pathways develop a vascular 
      trait similar to wild-type, but with a profound increase in phenotypic
      heterogeneity. Aberrant trait variance in miRNA mutant embryos uniquely
      sensitizes their vascular system to environmental perturbations. We discovered a 
      previously unrecognized role for specific vertebrate miRNAs to protect tissue
      development against phenotypic variability. This discovery marks an important
      advance in our comprehension of how miRNAs function in the development of higher 
      organisms.

AB  - Asymmetric stem cell division establishes an initial difference between a stem
      cell and its differentiating sibling, critical for maintaining homeostasis and
      preventing carcinogenesis. Yet the mechanisms that consolidate and lock in such
      initial fate bias remain obscure. Here, we use Drosophila neuroblasts to
      demonstrate that the super elongation complex (SEC) acts as an intrinsic
      amplifier to drive cell fate commitment. SEC is highly expressed in neuroblasts, 
      where it promotes self-renewal by physically associating with Notch transcription
      activation complex and enhancing HES (hairy and E(spl)) transcription. HES in
      turn upregulates SEC activity, forming an unexpected self-reinforcing feedback
      loop with SEC. SEC inactivation leads to neuroblast loss, whereas its forced
      activation results in neural progenitor dedifferentiation and tumorigenesis. Our 
      studies unveil an SEC-mediated intracellular amplifier mechanism in ensuring
      robustness and precision in stem cell fate commitment and provide mechanistic
      explanation for the highly frequent association of SEC overactivation with human 
      cancers.

AB  - Endothelial cells (ECs) line the inside of blood vessels and respond to
      mechanical cues generated by blood flow. Mechanical stimuli regulate the
      localization of YAP by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton. Here we demonstrate
      blood-flow-mediated regulation of endothelial YAP in vivo. We indirectly
      monitored transcriptional activity of Yap1 (zebrafish YAP) and its spatiotemporal
      localization in living zebrafish and found that Yap1 entered the nucleus and
      promoted transcription in response to blood flow. In cultured human ECs, laminar 
      shear stress induced nuclear import of YAP and its transcriptional activity in a 
      manner independent of Hippo signaling. We uncovered a molecular mechanism by
      which flow induced the nuclear translocation of YAP through the regulation of
      filamentous actin and angiomotin. Yap1 mutant zebrafish showed a defect in
      vascular stability, indicating an essential role for Yap1 in blood vessels. Our
      data imply that endothelial Yap1 functions in response to flow to maintain blood 
      vessels.

AB  - Autophagy, a central pathway for cellular homeostasis, plays diverse roles in
      development, cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. In a new report in Nature, Ho 
      et al. (2017) show that autophagy is essential for maintaining the replicative
      quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells throughout life by limiting the number of 
      active mitochondria.

AB  - The interplay between transcription factors and chromatin dictates gene
      regulatory network activity. Germ layer specification is tightly coupled with
      zygotic gene activation and, in most metazoans, is dependent upon maternal
      factors. We explore the dynamic genome-wide interactions of Foxh1, a maternal
      transcription factor that mediates Nodal/TGF-beta signaling, with cis-regulatory 
      modules (CRMs) during mesendodermal specification. Foxh1 marks CRMs during
      cleavage stages and recruits the co-repressor Tle/Groucho in the early blastula. 
      We highlight a population of CRMs that are continuously occupied by Foxh1 and
      show that they are marked by H3K4me1, Ep300, and Fox/Sox/Smad motifs, suggesting 
      interplay between these factors in gene regulation. We also propose a molecular
      "hand-off" between maternal Foxh1 and zygotic Foxa at these CRMs to maintain
      enhancer activation. Our findings suggest that Foxh1 functions at the top of a
      hierarchy of interactions by marking developmental genes for activation,
      beginning with the onset of zygotic gene expression.

AB  - During development, cells undergo dramatic changes in their morphology. By
      affecting contact geometry, these morphological changes could influence cellular 
      communication. However, it has remained unclear whether and how signaling depends
      on contact geometry. This question is particularly relevant for Notch signaling, 
      which coordinates neighboring cell fates through direct cell-cell signaling.
      Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that
      signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This
      relationship extends across contact diameters ranging from micrometers to tens of
      micrometers. Mathematical modeling predicts that dependence of signaling on
      contact area can bias cellular differentiation in Notch-mediated lateral
      inhibition processes, such that smaller cells are more likely to differentiate
      into signal-producing cells. Consistent with this prediction, analysis of
      developing chick inner ear revealed that ligand-producing hair cell precursors
      have smaller apical footprints than non-hair cells. Together, these results
      highlight the influence of cell morphology on fate determination processes.

AB  - Successful regeneration requires that progenitors of different lineages form the 
      appropriate missing cell types. However, simply generating lineages is not
      enough. Cells produced by a particular lineage often have distinct functions
      depending on their position within the organism. How this occurs in regeneration 
      is largely unexplored. In planarian regeneration, new cells arise from a
      proliferative cell population (neoblasts). We used the planarian epidermal
      lineage to study how the location of adult progenitor cells results in their
      acquisition of distinct functional identities. Single-cell RNA sequencing of
      epidermal progenitors revealed the emergence of distinct spatial identities as
      early in the lineage as the epidermal neoblasts, with further pre-patterning
      occurring in their post-mitotic migratory progeny. Establishment of
      dorsal-ventral epidermal identities and functions, in response to BMP signaling, 
      required neoblasts. Our work identified positional signals that activate
      regionalized transcriptional programs in the stem cell population and
      subsequently promote cell-type diversity in the epidermis.

TI  - Kibra and Merlin Activate the Hippo Pathway Spatially Distinct from and
      Independent of Expanded.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is emerging as a key evolutionarily conserved signaling
      mechanism that controls organ size. Three membrane-associated proteins, Kibra,
      Merlin, and Expanded, regulate pathway activity, but the precise molecular
      mechanism by which they function is still poorly understood. Here we provide
      evidence that Merlin and Kibra activate Hippo signaling in parallel to Expanded
      at a spatially distinct cellular domain, the medial apical cortex. Merlin and
      Kibra together recruit the adapter protein Salvador, which in turn recruits the
      core kinase Hippo. In addition, we show that Crumbs has a dual effect on Hippo
      signaling. Crumbs promotes the ability of Expanded to activate the pathway but
      also sequesters Kibra to downregulate Hippo signaling. Together, our findings
      elucidate the mechanism of Hippo pathway activation by Merlin and Kibra, identify
      a subcellular domain for Hippo pathway regulation, and demonstrate differential
      activity of upstream regulators in different subcellular domains.

AB  - Collective migration of epithelial cells underlies diverse tissue-remodeling
      events, but the mechanisms that coordinate individual cell migratory behaviors
      for collective movement are largely unknown. Studying the Drosophila follicular
      epithelium, we show that the cadherin Fat2 and the receptor tyrosine phosphatase 
      Lar function in a planar signaling system that coordinates leading and trailing
      edge dynamics between neighboring cells. Fat2 signals from each cell's trailing
      edge to induce leading edge protrusions in the cell behind, in part by
      stabilizing Lar's localization in these cells. Conversely, Lar signals from each 
      cell's leading edge to stimulate trailing edge retraction in the cell ahead.
      Fat2/Lar signaling is similar to planar cell polarity signaling in terms of
      sub-cellular protein localization; however, Fat2/Lar signaling mediates
      short-range communication between neighboring cells instead of transmitting
      long-range information across a tissue. This work defines a key mechanism
      promoting epithelial migration and establishes a different paradigm for planar
      cell-cell signaling.

AB  - PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs essential for animal
      germ cell development. Despite intense investigation of post-transcriptional
      processing, chromatin regulators for piRNA biogenesis in mammals remain largely
      unexplored. Here we document that BTBD18 is a pachytene nuclear protein in mouse 
      testes that occupies a subset of pachytene piRNA-producing loci. Ablation of
      Btbd18 in mice disrupts piRNA biogenesis, prevents spermiogenesis, and results in
      male sterility. Transcriptome profiling, chromatin accessibility, and RNA
      polymerase II occupancy demonstrate that BTBD18 facilitates expression of
      pachytene piRNA precursors by promoting transcription elongation. Thus, our study
      identifies BTBD18 as a specific controller for transcription activation through
      RNA polymerase II elongation at a subset of genomic piRNA loci.

TI  - A Wnt5 Activity Asymmetry and Intercellular Signaling via PCP Proteins Polarize
      Node Cells for Left-Right Symmetry Breaking.

AB  - Polarization of node cells along the anterior-posterior axis of mouse embryos is 
      responsible for left-right symmetry breaking. How node cells become polarized has
      remained unknown, however. Wnt5a and Wnt5b are expressed posteriorly relative to 
      the node, whereas genes for Sfrp inhibitors of Wnt signaling are expressed
      anteriorly. Here we show that polarization of node cells is impaired in
      Wnt5a(-/-)Wnt5b(-/-) and Sfrp mutant embryos, and also in the presence of a
      uniform distribution of Wnt5a or Sfrp1, suggesting that Wnt5 and Sfrp proteins
      act as instructive signals in this process. The absence of planar cell polarity
      (PCP) core proteins Prickle1 and Prickle2 in individual cells or local forced
      expression of Wnt5a perturbed polarization of neighboring wild-type cells. Our
      results suggest that opposing gradients of Wnt5a and Wnt5b and of their Sfrp
      inhibitors, together with intercellular signaling via PCP proteins, polarize node
      cells along the anterior-posterior axis for breaking of left-right symmetry.

AB  - Morphogen gradients determine tissue pattern by triggering differential cell
      responses to distinct morphogen concentrations. The strict quantitative
      dependence of the emerging patterns on morphogen distribution raises the
      challenge of buffering variability in morphogen profile to ensure a reproducible 
      outcome. We describe the underlying principles of two modules for buffering
      morphogen distribution: buffering morphogen amplitude by storing excess morphogen
      in a limited spatial region, and buffering morphogen spread by pinning morphogen 
      levels at a distal position through global feedback that adjusts morphogen
      diffusion or degradation across the tissue. We also present concrete examples of 
      patterning systems that implement these modules.

AB  - During the maternal-to-zygotic transition, maternal mRNAs are cleared by multiple
      distinct but interrelated pathways. A recent study in Nature by Zhao et al.
      (2017) finds that YTHDF2, a reader of N(6)- methylation, facilitates maternal
      mRNA decay, introducing an additional facet of control over transcript fate and
      developmental reprogramming.

AB  - Chromatin regulation is a principal mechanism governing animal development, yet
      it is unclear to what extent structural changes in chromatin underlie tissue
      regeneration. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish activate cardiomyocyte 
      (CM) division after tissue damage to regenerate lost heart muscle. Here, we
      generated transgenic zebrafish expressing a biotinylatable H3.3 histone variant
      in CMs and derived cell-type-specific profiles of histone replacement. We
      identified an emerging program of putative enhancers that revise H3.3 occupancy
      during regeneration, overlaid upon a genome-wide reduction of H3.3 from
      promoters. In transgenic reporter lines, H3.3-enriched elements directed gene
      expression in subpopulations of CMs. Other elements increased H3.3 enrichment and
      displayed enhancer activity in settings of injury- and/or Neuregulin1-elicited CM
      proliferation. Dozens of consensus sequence motifs containing predicted
      transcription factor binding sites were enriched in genomic regions with
      regeneration-responsive H3.3 occupancy. Thus, cell-type-specific regulatory
      programs of tissue regeneration can be revealed by genome-wide H3.3 profiling.

AB  - Dividing cells called neoblasts contain pluripotent stem cells and drive
      planarian flatworm regeneration from diverse injuries. A long-standing question
      is whether neoblasts directly sense and respond to the identity of missing
      tissues during regeneration. We used the eye to investigate this question.
      Surprisingly, eye removal was neither sufficient nor necessary for neoblasts to
      increase eye progenitor production. Neoblasts normally increase eye progenitor
      production following decapitation, facilitating regeneration. Eye removal alone, 
      however, did not induce this response. Eye regeneration following eye-specific
      resection resulted from homeostatic rates of eye progenitor production and less
      cell death in the regenerating eye. Conversely, large head injuries that left
      eyes intact increased eye progenitor production. Large injuries also
      non-specifically increased progenitor production for multiple uninjured tissues. 
      We propose a model for eye regeneration in which eye tissue production by
      planarian stem cells is not directly regulated by the absence of the eye itself.

AB  - How the developmental potential of differentiating stem cell progeny becomes
      rapidly and stably restricted following asymmetric stem cell division is unclear.
      In the fly larval brain, earmuff (erm) uniquely functions to restrict the
      developmental potential of intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) generated by
      asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells (neuroblasts). Here we demonstrate that
      the histone deacetylase Hdac1/Rpd3 functions together with self-renewal
      transcriptional repressors to maintain the erm immature INP enhancer in an
      inactive but poised state in neuroblasts. Within 2 hr of immature INP birth,
      downregulation of repressor activities alleviates Rpd3-mediated repression on the
      erm enhancer, enabling acetylation of multiple histone proteins and activating
      Erm expression. Erm restricts the developmental potential in immature INPs by
      repressing genes encoding neuroblast transcriptional activators. We propose that 
      poising the fast-activating enhancers of master regulators of differentiation
      through continual histone deacetylation in stem cells enables self-renewal and
      rapid restriction of developmental potential following asymmetric division.

AB  - Mammalian embryos transiently exhibit aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), a
      metabolic adaptation also observed in cancer cells. The role of this particular
      type of metabolism during vertebrate organogenesis is currently unknown. Here, we
      provide evidence for spatiotemporal regulation of glycolysis in the posterior
      region of mouse and chicken embryos. We show that a posterior glycolytic gradient
      is established in response to graded transcription of glycolytic enzymes
      downstream of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. We demonstrate that
      glycolysis controls posterior elongation of the embryonic axis by regulating cell
      motility in the presomitic mesoderm and by controlling specification of the
      paraxial mesoderm fate in the tail bud. Our results suggest that glycolysis in
      the tail bud coordinates Wnt and FGF signaling to promote elongation of the
      embryonic axis.

AB  - How metabolism is rewired during embryonic development is still largely unknown, 
      as it remains a major technical challenge to resolve metabolic activities or
      metabolite levels with spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we investigated metabolic
      changes during development of organogenesis-stage mouse embryos, focusing on the 
      presomitic mesoderm (PSM). We measured glycolytic labeling kinetics from
      (13)C-glucose tracing experiments and detected elevated glycolysis in the
      posterior, more undifferentiated PSM. We found evidence that the spatial
      metabolic differences are functionally relevant during PSM development. To enable
      real-time quantification of a glycolytic metabolite with spatiotemporal
      resolution, we generated a pyruvate FRET-sensor reporter mouse line. We revealed 
      dynamic changes in cytosolic pyruvate levels as cells transit toward a more
      anterior PSM state. Combined, our approach identifies a gradient of glycolytic
      activity across the PSM, and we provide evidence that these spatiotemporal
      metabolic changes are intrinsically linked to PSM development and
      differentiation.

AB  - Defining the genes that are essential for cellular proliferation is critical for 
      understanding organismal development and identifying high-value targets for
      disease therapies. However, the requirements for cell-cycle progression in human 
      cells remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the consequences of acute and 
      chronic elimination of cell-cycle proteins, we generated and characterized
      inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout human cell lines targeting 209 genes involved in
      diverse cell-cycle processes. We performed single-cell microscopic analyses to
      systematically establish the effects of the knockouts on subcellular
      architecture. To define variations in cell-cycle requirements between cultured
      cell lines, we generated knockouts across cell lines of diverse origins. We
      demonstrate that p53 modulates the phenotype of specific cell-cycle defects
      through distinct mechanisms, depending on the defect. This work provides a
      resource to broadly facilitate robust and long-term depletion of cell-cycle
      proteins and reveals insights into the requirements for cell-cycle progression.

      However, remarkably little is known about how tissues coordinate their movements 
      to shape the embryo. In zebrafish embryogenesis, coordinated tissue movements
      first become apparent during "doming," when the blastoderm begins to spread over 
      the yolk sac, a process involving coordinated epithelial surface cell layer
      expansion and mesenchymal deep cell intercalations. Here, we find that active
      surface cell expansion represents the key process coordinating tissue movements
      during doming. By using a combination of theory and experiments, we show that
      epithelial surface cells not only trigger blastoderm expansion by reducing tissue
      surface tension, but also drive blastoderm thinning by inducing tissue
      contraction through radial deep cell intercalations. Thus, coordinated tissue
      expansion and thinning during doming relies on surface cells simultaneously
      controlling tissue surface tension and radial tissue contraction.

AB  - Signaling receptors are internalized and regulated by clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis (CME). Two clathrin light chain isoforms, CLCa and CLCb, are integral
      components of the endocytic machinery whose differential functions remain
      unknown. We report that CLCb is specifically upregulated in non-small-cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) cells and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Engineered
      single CLCb-expressing NSCLC cells, as well as "switched" cells that
      predominantly express CLCb, exhibit increased rates of CME and altered
      clathrin-coated pit dynamics. This "adaptive CME" resulted from upregulation of
      dynamin-1 (Dyn1) and its activation through a positive feedback loop involving
      enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt/GSK3beta phosphorylation.
      CLCb/Dyn1-dependent adaptive CME selectively altered EGF receptor trafficking,
      enhanced cell migration in vitro, and increased the metastatic efficiency of
      NSCLC cells in vivo. We define molecular mechanisms for adaptive CME in cancer
      cells and a role for the reciprocal crosstalk between signaling and CME in cancer
      progression.

AB  - The establishment of pluripotent stem cells is a key event during plant and
      animal embryogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. We show
      that in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, expression of the shoot
      meristem stem cell marker CLV3 becomes detectable in transition stage embryos.
      Surprisingly, the key regulator of stem cell homeostasis WUSCHEL (WUS) is
      expressed but dispensable for stem cell initiation. Rather, the WUS paralog WOX2,
      a regulator of embryo patterning initiated in the zygote, functions in this
      process by shielding stem cell progenitors from differentiation. WOX2 upregulates
      HD-ZIP III transcription factors required for shoot identity and balances
      cytokinin versus auxin hormone pathways, revealing that classical plantlet
      regeneration procedures recapitulate the natural induction mechanism. Our
      findings link transcriptional regulation of early embryo patterning to hormonal
      control of stem cell initiation and suggest that similar strategies have evolved 
      in plant and animal stem cell formation.

AB  - Planarian flatworms maintain their body plan in the face of constant internal
      turnover and can regenerate from arbitrary tissue fragments. Both phenomena
      require self-maintaining and self-organizing patterning mechanisms, the molecular
      mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. We show that a morphogenic gradient
      of canonical Wnt signaling patterns gene expression along the planarian
      anteroposterior (A/P) axis. Our results demonstrate that gradient formation
      likely occurs autonomously in the tail and that an autoregulatory module of
      Wnt-mediated Wnt expression both shapes the gradient at steady state and governs 
      its re-establishment during regeneration. Functional antagonism between the tail 
      Wnt gradient and an unknown head patterning system further determines the spatial
      proportions of the planarian A/P axis and mediates mutually exclusive molecular
      fate choices during regeneration. Overall, our results suggest that the planarian
      A/P axis is patterned by self-organizing patterning systems deployed from either 
      end that are functionally coupled by mutual antagonism.

AB  - Mammalian development begins with segregation of the extra-embryonic
      trophectoderm from the embryonic lineage in the blastocyst. While cell polarity
      and adhesion play key roles, the decisive cue driving this lineage segregation
      remains elusive. Here, to study symmetry breaking, we use a reduced system in
      which isolated blastomeres recapitulate the first lineage segregation. We find
      that in the 8-cell stage embryo, the apical domain recruits a spindle pole to
      ensure its differential distribution upon division. Daughter cells that inherit
      the apical domain adopt trophectoderm fate. However, the fate of apolar daughter 
      cells depends on whether their position within the embryo facilitates apical
      domain formation by Cdh1-independent cell contact. Finally, we develop methods
      for transplanting apical domains and show that acquisition of this domain is not 
      only required but also sufficient for the first lineage segregation. Thus, we
      provide mechanistic understanding that reconciles previous models for symmetry
      breaking in mouse development.

AB  - Macrophages are multifunctional innate immune cells that seed all tissues within 
      the body and play disparate roles throughout development and in adult tissues,
      both in health and disease. Their complex developmental origins and many of their
      functions are being deciphered in mammalian tissues, but opportunities for live
      imaging and the genetic tractability of Drosophila are offering complementary
      insights into how these fascinating cells integrate a multitude of guidance cues 
      to fulfill their many tasks and migrate to distant sites to either direct
      developmental patterning or raise an inflammatory response.

AB  - Autophagy supports cell growth and survival autonomously by recycling
      intracellular proteins and/or organelles. Reporting in Nature, Katheder and
      colleagues (2017) find that tumors trigger non-autonomous autophagy in
      neighboring cells and distant organs, thus fueling tumor growth and metastasis.
      This opens new avenues for understanding and manipulating cancers through
      cell-cell communication.

      and Human Germline.

AB  - Somatic X dosage compensation requires two mechanisms: X inactivation balances X 
      gene output between males (XY) and females (XX), while X upregulation,
      hypothesized by Ohno and documented in vivo, balances X gene with autosomal gene 
      output. Whether X dosage compensation occurs in germ cells is unclear. We show
      that mouse and human germ cells exhibit non-canonical X dosage states that differ
      from the soma and between the sexes. Prior to genome-wide reprogramming, X
      upregulation is present, consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. Subsequently,
      however, it is erased. In females, erasure follows loss of X inactivation,
      causing X dosage excess. Conversely, in males, erasure leads to permanent X
      dosage decompensation. Sex chromosomally abnormal models exhibit a "sex-reversed"
      X dosage state: XX males, like XX females, develop X dosage excess, while XO
      females, like XY males, develop X dosage decompensation. Thus, germline X dosage 
      compensation states are determined by X chromosome number, not phenotypic sex.
      These unexpected differences in X dosage compensation states between germline and
      soma offer unique perspectives on sex chromosome infertility.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene regulation through structural and
      regulatory interactions with associated proteins. The Polycomb complex often
      binds to lncRNAs in eukaryotes, and an lncRNA, COLDAIR, associates with Polycomb 
      to mediate silencing of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during the
      process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. Here, we identified an additional
      Polycomb-binding lncRNA, COLDWRAP. COLDWRAP is derived from the repressed
      promoter of FLC and is necessary for the establishment of the stable repressed
      state of FLC by vernalization. Both COLDAIR and COLDWRAP are required to form a
      repressive intragenic chromatin loop at the FLC locus by vernalization. Our
      results indicate that vernalization-mediated Polycomb silencing is coordinated by
      lncRNAs in a cooperative manner to form a stable repressive chromatin structure.

AB  - Centrosome amplification is a common feature of human tumors, but whether this is
      a cause or a consequence of cancer remains unclear. Here, we test the consequence
      of centrosome amplification by creating mice in which centrosome number can be
      chronically increased in the absence of additional genetic defects. We show that 
      increasing centrosome number elevated tumor initiation in a mouse model of
      intestinal neoplasia. Most importantly, we demonstrate that supernumerary
      centrosomes are sufficient to drive aneuploidy and the development of spontaneous
      tumors in multiple tissues. Tumors arising from centrosome amplification exhibit 
      frequent mitotic errors and possess complex karyotypes, recapitulating a common
      feature of human cancer. Together, our data support a direct causal relationship 
      among centrosome amplification, genomic instability, and tumor development.

AB  - Animal development is characterized by signaling events that occur at precise
      locations and times within the embryo, but determining when and where such
      precision is needed for proper embryogenesis has been a long-standing challenge. 
      Here we address this question for extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk)
      signaling, a key developmental patterning cue. We describe an optogenetic system 
      for activating Erk with high spatiotemporal precision in vivo. Implementing this 
      system in Drosophila, we find that embryogenesis is remarkably robust to ectopic 
      Erk signaling, except from 1 to 4 hr post-fertilization, when perturbing the
      spatial extent of Erk pathway activation leads to dramatic disruptions of
      patterning and morphogenesis. Later in development, the effects of ectopic
      signaling are buffered, at least in part, by combinatorial mechanisms. Our
      approach can be used to systematically probe the differential contributions of
      the Ras/Erk pathway and concurrent signals, leading to a more quantitative
      understanding of developmental signaling.

AB  - Angiogenesis is responsible for tissue vascularization during development, as
      well as in pathological contexts, including cancer and ischemia. Vascular
      endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate angiogenesis by acting through VEGF
      receptors to induce endothelial cell signaling. VEGF is processed in the
      extracellular matrix (ECM), but the complexity of ECM control of VEGF signaling
      and angiogenesis remains far from understood. In a forward genetic screen, we
      identified angiogenesis defects in tmem2 zebrafish mutants that lack both
      arterial and venous Vegf/Vegfr/Erk signaling. Strikingly, tmem2 mutants display
      increased hyaluronic acid (HA) surrounding developing vessels. Angiogenesis in
      tmem2 mutants was rescued, or restored after failed sprouting, by degrading this 
      increased HA. Furthermore, oligomerized HA or overexpression of Vegfc rescued
      angiogenesis in tmem2 mutants. Based on these data, and the known structure of
      Tmem2, we find that Tmem2 regulates HA turnover to promote normal Vegf signaling 
      during developmental angiogenesis.

AB  - Mutant RAS-driven cancers are infamously resistant to chemotherapeutics.
      Reporting in Cell, Grabocka and Bar-Sagi (2016) demonstrate that when subjected
      to stress, mutant KRAS-dependent lipid production leads to upregulated stress
      granule formation. This confers not only cell-autonomous cytoprotection but also 
      paracrine establishment of a stress-resistant tumor niche.

AB  - Plants control nutrient availability in intercellular spaces (the apoplast) via
      transporters, channels, and vesicular transport. Recent papers in Science and
      Nature from two groups have highlighted how plants control sugar to restrict
      bacterial growth (Yamada et al., 2016) and how increased water availability
      enhances pathogenesis (Xin et al., 2016).

AB  - Activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is used by many
      signaling pathways to control tissue patterning in a broad range of multicellular
      organisms. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Johnson et al. (2017) provide an 
      optogenetic approach to manipulate this pathway with high precision and explore
      its signaling code.

AB  - Fringe proteins are beta3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases that modulate Notch
      activity by modifying O-fucose residues on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF)
      repeats of Notch. Mammals have three Fringes: Lunatic, Manic, and Radical. While 
      Lunatic and Manic Fringe inhibit Notch1 activation from Jagged1 and enhance
      activation from Delta-like 1, Radical Fringe enhances signaling from both. We
      used a mass spectrometry approach to determine whether the variable effects of
      Fringes on Notch1 result from generation of unique glycosylation patterns on
      Notch1. We found that Lunatic and Manic Fringe modified similar sites on Notch1, 
      while Radical Fringe modified a subset. Fringe modifications at EGF8 and EGF12
      enhanced Notch1 binding to and activation from Delta-like 1, while modifications 
      at EGF6 and EGF36 (added by Manic and Lunatic but not Radical) inhibited Notch1
      activation from Jagged1. Combined, these results suggest that Fringe
      modifications "mark" different regions in the Notch1 extracellular domain for
      activation or inhibition.

AB  - During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells lining the tissue
      periphery break up their cohesion to migrate within the tissue. This dramatic
      reorganization involves a poorly characterized reorientation of the apicobasal
      polarity of static epithelial cells into the front-rear polarity of migrating
      mesenchymal cells. To investigate the spatial coordination of intracellular
      reorganization with morphological changes, we monitored centrosome positioning
      during EMT in vivo, in developing mouse embryos and mammary gland, and in vitro, 
      in cultured 3D cell aggregates and micropatterned cell doublets. In all
      conditions, centrosomes moved from their off-centered position next to
      intercellular junctions toward extracellular matrix adhesions on the opposite
      side of the nucleus, resulting in an effective internal polarity reversal. This
      move appeared to be supported by controlled microtubule network disassembly.
      Sequential release of cell confinement using dynamic micropatterns, and
      modulation of microtubule dynamics, confirmed that centrosome repositioning was
      responsible for further cell disengagement and scattering.

AB  - Long-term studies of Caenorhabditis elegans larval development traditionally
      require tedious manual observations because larvae must move to develop, and
      existing immobilization techniques either perturb development or are unsuited for
      young larvae. Here, we present a simple microfluidic device to simultaneously
      follow development of ten C. elegans larvae at high spatiotemporal resolution
      from hatching to adulthood ( approximately 3 days). Animals grown in
      microchambers are periodically immobilized by compression to allow high-quality
      imaging of even weak fluorescence signals. Using the device, we obtain cell-cycle
      statistics for C. elegans vulval development, a paradigm for organogenesis. We
      combine Nomarski and multichannel fluorescence microscopy to study processes such
      as cell-fate specification, cell death, and transdifferentiation throughout
      post-embryonic development. Finally, we generate time-lapse movies of complex
      neural arborization through automated image registration. Our technique opens the
      door to quantitative analysis of time-dependent phenomena governing cellular
      behavior during C. elegans larval development.

AB  - Lysosomes rely on their resident transporter proteins to return products of
      catabolism to the cell for reuse and for cellular signaling, metal storage, and
      maintaining the lumenal environment. Despite their importance, little is known
      about the lifetime of these transporters or how they are regulated. Using
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we discovered a new pathway intrinsic to
      homotypic lysosome membrane fusion that is responsible for their degradation.
      Transporter proteins are selectively sorted by the docking machinery into an area
      between apposing lysosome membranes, which is internalized and degraded by
      lumenal hydrolases upon organelle fusion. These proteins have diverse lifetimes
      that are regulated in response to protein misfolding, changing substrate levels, 
      or TOR activation. Analogous to endocytosis for controlling surface protein
      levels, the "intralumenal fragment pathway" is critical for lysosome membrane
      remodeling required for organelle function in the context of cellular protein
      quality control, ion homeostasis, and metabolism.

AB  - In lower vertebrates, stem/progenitor cells located in a peripheral domain of the
      retina, called the ciliary margin zone (CMZ), cooperate with retinal domain
      progenitors to build the mature neural retina. In mammals, it is believed that
      the CMZ lacks neurogenic potential and that the retina develops from one pool of 
      multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Here we identify a population of
      Msx1-expressing progenitors in the mouse CMZ that is both molecularly and
      functionally distinct from RPCs. Using genetic lineage tracing, we report that
      Msx1 progenitors have unique developmental properties compared with RPCs. Msx1
      lineages contain both neural retina and non-neural ciliary epithelial progenies
      and overall generate fewer photoreceptors than classical RPC lineages.
      Furthermore, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb regulates the
      balance between neural and non-neural fates in Msx1 progenitors. These results
      uncover a population of CMZ progenitors, distinct from classical RPCs, that also 
      contributes to mammalian retinogenesis.

AB  - Genome haploidization involves two meiotic divisions following a single round of 
      DNA replication. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Arguello-Miranda et al.
      (2017) show that production and packaging of the single-copy genome into gametes 
      during the second meiotic division is coordinated by a conserved casein kinase 1.

AB  - CENP-A is a histone H3 variant key to epigenetic specification of mammalian
      centromeres. Using transient overexpression of CENP-A mutants, two recent reports
      in Developmental Cell proposed essential centromere functions for
      post-translational modifications of human CENP-A. Phosphorylation at Ser68 was
      proposed to have an essential role in CENP-A deposition at centromeres. Blockage 
      of ubiquitination at Lys124 was proposed to abrogate localization of CENP-A to
      the centromere. Following gene inactivation and replacement in human cells, we
      demonstrate that CENP-A mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser68 or
      ubiquitinated at Lys124 assemble efficiently at centromeres during G1, mediate
      early events in centromere establishment at an ectopic chromosomal locus, and
      maintain centromere function indefinitely. Thus, neither Ser68 nor Lys124
      post-translational modification is essential for long-term centromere identity,
      propagation, cell-cycle-dependent deposition, maintenance, function, or mediation
      of early steps in centromere establishment.

AB  - Significant amounts of microRNAs (miRs) are detected in exosomes, but their
      function during fetal development is poorly understood. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Hayashi et al. (2017) show that exosomal miRs secreted by
      mesenchymal cells can regulate epithelial KIT(+) progenitor cell expansion during
      murine salivary gland organogenesis.

AB  - The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, well 
      known for its role in cell-cycle progression. However, it has been linked to
      additional functions, mainly in neuronal contexts, when using the co-activator
      Cdh1/Fzr. Here, our data indicate a post-mitotic requirement for the
      APC/C(Fzr/Cdh1) in epithelial cell patterning and planar cell polarity (PCP) in
      Drosophila. PCP signaling is critical for development by establishing cellular
      asymmetries and orientation within the plane of an epithelium, via differential
      localization of distinct complexes of core PCP factors. Loss of APC/C function
      leads to reduced levels of Dishevelled (Dsh), a core PCP factor. The effect of
      APC/C on Dsh is mediated by Nek2 kinase, which can phosphorylate Dsh and is a
      direct APC/C(Fzr/Cdh1) substrate. We have thus uncovered a pathway of regulation 
      whereby APC/C(Fzr/Cdh1) negatively regulates Nek2, which negatively regulates
      Dsh, to ensure its proper stoichiometric requirement and localization during PCP 
      establishment.

AB  - The cell cycle is coordinated with differentiation during animal development.
      Here we report a cell-cycle-independent developmental role for a master
      cell-cycle regulator, the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), in the
      regulation of cell fate through modulation of Wingless (Wg) signaling. The APC/C 
      controls both cell-cycle progression and postmitotic processes through
      ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Through an RNAi screen in the developing
      Drosophila eye, we found that partial APC/C inactivation severely inhibits
      retinal differentiation independently of cell-cycle defects. The differentiation 
      inhibition coincides with hyperactivation of Wg signaling caused by the
      accumulation of a Wg modulator, Drosophila Nek2 (dNek2). The APC/C degrades dNek2
      upon synchronous G1 arrest prior to differentiation, which allows retinal
      differentiation through local suppression of Wg signaling. We also provide
      evidence that decapentaplegic signaling may posttranslationally regulate this
      APC/C function. Thus, the APC/C coordinates cell-fate determination with the cell
      cycle through the modulation of developmental signaling pathways.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions involve fundamental communication between
      tissues during organogenesis and are primarily regulated by growth factors and
      extracellular matrix. It is unclear whether RNA-containing exosomes are mobile
      genetic signals regulating epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Here we identify 
      that exosomes loaded with mesenchyme-specific mature microRNA contribute mobile
      genetic signals from mesenchyme to epithelium. The mature mesenchymal
      miR-133b-3p, loaded into exosomes, was transported from mesenchyme to the
      salivary epithelium, which did not express primary miR-133b-3p. Knockdown of
      miR-133b-3p in culture decreased endbud morphogenesis, reduced proliferation of
      epithelial KIT(+) progenitors, and increased expression of a target gene,
      Disco-interacting protein 2 homolog B (Dip2b). DIP2B, which is involved in DNA
      methylation, was localized with 5-methylcytosine in the prophase nucleus of a
      subset of KIT(+) progenitors during mitosis. In summary, exosomal transport of
      miR-133b-3p from mesenchyme to epithelium decreases DIP2B, which may function as 
      an epigenetic regulator of genes responsible for KIT(+) progenitor expansion
      during organogenesis.

AB  - Meiosis consists of DNA replication followed by two consecutive nuclear divisions
      and gametogenesis or spore formation. While meiosis I has been studied
      extensively, less is known about the regulation of meiosis II. Here we show that 
      Hrr25, the conserved casein kinase 1delta of budding yeast, links three mutually 
      independent key processes of meiosis II. First, Hrr25 induces nuclear division by
      priming centromeric cohesin for cleavage by separase. Hrr25 simultaneously
      phosphorylates Rec8, the cleavable subunit of cohesin, and removes from
      centromeres the cohesin protector composed of shugoshin and the phosphatase PP2A.
      Second, Hrr25 initiates the sporulation program by inducing the synthesis of
      membranes that engulf the emerging nuclei at anaphase II. Third, Hrr25 mediates
      exit from meiosis II by activating pathways that trigger the destruction of
      M-phase-promoting kinases. Thus, Hrr25 synchronizes formation of the single-copy 
      genome with gamete differentiation and termination of meiosis.

AB  - Proper regulation of osmotic balance and response to tissue damage is crucial in 
      maintaining intestinal stem cell (ISC) homeostasis. We found that Drosophila
      miR-263a downregulates the expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)
      subunits in enterocytes (ECs) to maintain osmotic and ISC homeostasis. In the
      absence of miR-263a, the intraluminal surface of the intestine displays
      dehydration-like phenotypes, Na(+) levels are increased in ECs, stress pathways
      are activated in ECs, and ISCs overproliferate. Furthermore, miR-263a mutants
      have increased bacterial load and expression of antimicrobial peptides.
      Strikingly, these phenotypes are reminiscent of the pathophysiology of cystic
      fibrosis (CF) in which loss-of-function mutations in the chloride channel CF
      transmembrane conductance regulator can elevate the activity of ENaC, suggesting 
      that Drosophila could be used as a model for CF. Finally, we provide evidence
      that overexpression of miR-183, the human ortholog of miR-263a, can also directly
      target the expressions of all three subunits of human ENaC.

AB  - Mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation require timely separation of
      the two duplicated centrosomes, and this process is initiated in late G2 by
      centrosome disjunction. Here we report that GAS2L1, a microtubule- and
      actin-binding protein, associates with the proximal end of mature centrioles and 
      participates in centriole dynamics and centrosome disjunction. GAS2L1 attaches
      microtubules and actin to centrosomes, and the loss of GAS2L1 inhibits centrosome
      disjunction in G2 and centrosome splitting induced by depletion of the centrosome
      linker rootletin. Conversely, GAS2L1 overexpression induces premature centrosome 
      separation, and this activity requires GAS2L1 association with actin,
      microtubules, and the microtubule end-binding proteins. The centrosome-splitting 
      effect of GAS2L1 is counterbalanced by rootletin, reflecting the opposing actions
      of GAS2L1 and the centrosome linker. Our work reveals a GAS2L1-mediated
      centriole-tethering mechanism of microtubules and actin, which provide the forces
      required for centrosome dynamics and separation.

AB  - Cells can globally upregulate their transcriptome during specific transitions, a 
      phenomenon called hypertranscription. Evidence for hypertranscription dates back 
      over 70 years but has gone largely ignored in the genomics era until recently. We
      discuss data supporting the notion that hypertranscription is a unifying theme in
      embryonic development, stem cell biology, regeneration, and cell competition. We 
      review the history, methods for analysis, underlying mechanisms, and biological
      significance of hypertranscription.

AB  - While DNA replication and mitosis occur in a sequential manner, precisely how
      cells maintain their temporal separation and order remains elusive. Here, we
      unveil a double-negative feedback loop between replication intermediates and an
      M-phase-specific structure-selective endonuclease, MUS81-SLX4, which renders DNA 
      replication and mitosis mutually exclusive. MUS81 nuclease is constitutively
      active throughout the cell cycle but requires association with SLX4 for efficient
      substrate targeting. To preclude toxic processing of replicating chromosomes,
      WEE1 kinase restrains CDK1 and PLK1-mediated MUS81-SLX4 assembly during S phase. 
      Accordingly, WEE1 inhibition triggers widespread nucleolytic breakage of
      replication intermediates, halting DNA replication and leading to chromosome
      pulverization. Unexpectedly, premature entry into mitosis-licensed by
      unrestrained CDK1 activity during S phase-requires MUS81-SLX4, which inhibits DNA
      replication. This suggests that ongoing replication assists WEE1 in delaying
      entry into M phase and, indirectly, in preventing MUS81-SLX4 assembly.
      Conversely, MUS81-SLX4 activation during mitosis promotes targeted resolution of 
      persistent replication intermediates, which safeguards chromosome segregation.

AB  - While gene regulatory networks involved in cardiogenesis have been characterized,
      the role of bioenergetics remains less studied. Here we show that until
      midgestation, myocardial metabolism is compartmentalized, with a glycolytic
      signature restricted to compact myocardium contrasting with increased
      mitochondrial oxidative activity in the trabeculae. HIF1alpha regulation mirrors 
      this pattern, with expression predominating in compact myocardium and scarce in
      trabeculae. By midgestation, the compact myocardium downregulates HIF1alpha and
      switches toward oxidative metabolism. Deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Vhl
      results in HIF1alpha hyperactivation, blocking the midgestational metabolic shift
      and impairing cardiac maturation and function. Moreover, the altered glycolytic
      signature induced by HIF1 trabecular activation precludes regulation of genes
      essential for establishment of the cardiac conduction system. Our findings reveal
      VHL-HIF-mediated metabolic compartmentalization in the developing heart and the
      connection between metabolism and myocardial differentiation. These results
      highlight the importance of bioenergetics in ventricular myocardium
      specialization and its potential relevance to congenital heart disease.

      trajectories to reach their final destination. However, the molecular cues
      controlling their directional migration are largely unknown. To address this, we 
      established glial migration onto the developing Drosophila leg imaginal disc as a
      model. Here, CNS-derived glial cells move along nerves containing motoaxons and
      sensory axons. Along their path, glial cells encounter at least three choice
      points where directional decisions are needed. Subsequent genetic analyses
      allowed uncovering mechanisms that escaped previous studies. Most strikingly, we 
      found that glial cells require the expression of the repulsive guidance receptors
      PlexinA/B and Robo2 to prevent breaking away from the nerve. Interestingly, the
      repulsive ligands are presented by the underlying leg imaginal disc epithelium,
      which appears to push glial cells toward the axon fascicle. In conclusion, nerve 
      formation not only requires neuron-glia interaction but also depends on
      glial-epithelial communication.

AB  - Cells dynamically interact throughout animal development to coordinate growth and
      deter disease. For example, cell-cell competition weeds out aberrant cells to
      enforce homeostasis. In Drosophila, tumorigenic cells mutant for the cell
      polarity gene scribble (scrib) are actively eliminated from epithelia when
      surrounded by wild-type cells. While scrib cell elimination depends critically on
      JNK signaling, JNK-dependent cell death cannot sufficiently explain scrib cell
      extirpation. Thus, how JNK executed cell elimination remained elusive. Here, we
      show that repulsive Slit-Robo2-Ena signaling exerts an extrusive force downstream
      of JNK to eliminate scrib cells from epithelia by disrupting E-cadherin. While
      loss of Slit-Robo2-Ena in scrib cells potentiates scrib tumor formation within
      the epithelium, Robo2-Ena hyperactivation surprisingly triggers luminal scrib
      tumor growth following excess extrusion. This extrusive signaling is amplified by
      a positive feedback loop between Slit-Robo2-Ena and JNK. Our observations provide
      a potential causal mechanism for Slit-Robo dysregulation in numerous human
      cancers.

AB  - Life for all animals starts with a precise 3D choreography of reductive divisions
      of the fertilized egg, known as cleavage patterns. These patterns exhibit
      conserved geometrical features and striking interspecies invariance within
      certain animal classes. To identify the generic rules that may govern these
      morphogenetic events, we developed a 3D-modeling framework that iteratively
      infers blastomere division positions and orientations, and consequent
      multicellular arrangements. From a minimal set of parameters, our model predicts 
      detailed features of cleavage patterns in the embryos of fishes, amphibians,
      echinoderms, and ascidians, as well as the genetic and physical perturbations
      that alter these patterns. This framework demonstrates that a geometrical system 
      based on length-dependent microtubule forces that probe blastomere shape and yolk
      gradients, biased by cortical polarity domains, may dictate division patterns and
      overall embryo morphogenesis. These studies thus unravel the default
      self-organization rules governing early embryogenesis and how they are altered by
      deterministic regulatory layers.

AB  - Errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis have been recognized as a
      hallmark of tumor cells since the late 1800s, resulting in the long-standing
      hypothesis that mitotic abnormalities drive tumorigenesis. Recent work has shown 
      that mitotic defects can promote tumors, suppress them, or do neither, depending 
      on the rate of chromosome missegregation. Here we discuss the causes of
      chromosome missegregation, their effects on tumor initiation and progression, and
      the evidence that increasing the rate of chromosome missegregation may be an
      effective chemotherapeutic strategy.

AB  - The Hippo pathway limits organ size and suppresses tumors. Reporting in Cell,
      Moroishi et al. (2016), show that, paradoxically, Hippo pathway inactivation can 
      repress tumor growth by modulating tumor immunogenicity. This could explain the
      rarity of pathway mutations in cancers and suggests Hippo pathway repression as a
      cancer immunotherapy modality.

AB  - Hox genes are key developmental regulators. In this issue of Developmental Cell, 
      Rux et al. (2016) uncover an adult role for Hox11 genes in regionalized bone
      repair. This function relies on Hox activity in bone marrow multipotent
      mesenchymal stem progenitor cells, which promotes skeletal cell differentiation.

TI  - Mesenchymal Cell Invasion Requires Cooperative Regulation of Persistent
      Microtubule Growth by SLAIN2 and CLASP1.
PG  - 708-723
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2016.11.009 [doi]
AB  - Microtubules regulate signaling, trafficking, and cell mechanics, but the
      respective contribution of these functions to cell morphogenesis and migration in
      3D matrices is unclear. Here, we report that the microtubule plus-end tracking
      protein (+TIP) SLAIN2, which suppresses catastrophes, is not required for 2D cell
      migration but is essential for mesenchymal cell invasion in 3D culture and in a
      mouse cancer model. We show that SLAIN2 inactivation does not affect Rho GTPase
      activity, trafficking, and focal adhesion formation. However, SLAIN2-dependent
      catastrophe inhibition determines microtubule resistance to compression and
      pseudopod elongation. Another +TIP, CLASP1, is also needed to form invasive
      pseudopods because it prevents catastrophes specifically at their tips. When
      microtubule growth persistence is reduced, inhibition of depolymerization is
      sufficient for pseudopod maintenance but not remodeling. We propose that
      catastrophe inhibition by SLAIN2 and CLASP1 supports mesenchymal cell shape in
      soft 3D matrices by enabling microtubules to perform a load-bearing function.

AB  - Posterior Hox genes (Hox9-13) are critical for patterning the limb skeleton along
      the proximodistal axis during embryonic development. Here we show that Hox11
      paralogous genes, which developmentally pattern the zeugopod (radius/ulna and
      tibia/fibula), remain regionally expressed in the adult skeleton. Using
      Hoxa11EGFP reporter mice, we demonstrate expression exclusively in multipotent
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the bone marrow of the adult zeugopod.
      Hox-positive cells express PDGFRalpha and CD51, are marked by LepR-Cre, and
      exhibit colony-forming unit fibroblast activity and tri-lineage differentiation
      in vitro. Loss of Hox11 function leads to fracture repair defects, including
      reduced cartilage formation and delayed ossification. Hox mutant cells are
      defective in osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation in tri-lineage
      differentiation experiments, and these defects are zeugopod specific. In the
      stylopod (humerus and femur) and sternum, bone marrow MSCs express other
      regionally restricted Hox genes, and femur fractures heal normally in Hox11
      mutants. Together, our data support regional Hox expression and function in
      skeletal MSCs.

AB  - Tissue-specific gene expression is often thought to arise from spatially
      restricted transcriptional cascades. However, it is unclear how expression is
      established at the top of these cascades in the absence of pre-existing
      specificity. We generated a transcriptional network to explore how transcription 
      factor expression is established in the Arabidopsis thaliana root ground tissue. 
      Regulators of the SHORTROOT-SCARECROW transcriptional cascade were validated in
      planta. At the top of this cascade, we identified both activators and repressors 
      of SHORTROOT. The aggregate spatial expression of these regulators is not
      sufficient to predict transcriptional specificity. Instead, modeling,
      transcriptional reporters, and synthetic promoters support a mechanism whereby
      expression at the top of the SHORTROOT-SCARECROW cascade is established through
      opposing activities of activators and repressors.

AB  - Tissue morphogenesis requires force-generating mechanisms to organize cells into 
      complex structures. Although many such mechanisms have been characterized, we
      know little about how forces are integrated across developing tissues. We provide
      evidence that integrin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion
      modulates the transmission of apically generated tension during dorsal closure
      (DC) in Drosophila. Integrin-containing adhesive structures resembling focal
      adhesions were identified on the basal surface of the amnioserosa (AS), an
      extraembryonic epithelium essential for DC. Genetic modulation of
      integrin-mediated adhesion results in defective DC. Quantitative image analysis
      and laser ablation experiments reveal that basal cell-ECM adhesions provide
      resistance to apical cell displacements and force transmission between
      neighboring cells in the AS. Finally, we provide evidence for integrin-dependent 
      force transmission to the AS substrate. Overall, we find that integrins regulate 
      force transmission within and between cells, thereby playing an essential role in
      transmitting tension in developing tissues.

AB  - Inherited mtDNA mutations cause severe human disease. In most species,
      mitochondria are inherited maternally through mechanisms that are poorly
      understood. Genes that specifically control the inheritance of mitochondria in
      the germline are unknown. Here, we show that the long isoform of the protein
      Oskar regulates the maternal inheritance of mitochondria in Drosophila
      melanogaster. We show that, during oogenesis, mitochondria accumulate at the
      oocyte posterior, concurrent with the bulk streaming and churning of the oocyte
      cytoplasm. Long Oskar traps and maintains mitochondria at the posterior at the
      site of primordial germ cell (PGC) formation through an actin-dependent
      mechanism. Mutating long oskar strongly reduces the number of mtDNA molecules
      inherited by PGCs. Therefore, Long Oskar ensures germline transmission of
      mitochondria to the next generation. These results provide molecular insight into
      how mitochondria are passed from mother to offspring, as well as how they are
      positioned and asymmetrically partitioned within polarized cells.

TI  - The Red Light Receptor Phytochrome B Directly Enhances Substrate-E3 Ligase
      Interactions to Attenuate Ethylene Responses.
PG  - 597-610
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2016.10.020 [doi]
AB  - Plants germinating under subterranean darkness assume skotomorphogenesis, a
      developmental program strengthened by ethylene in response to mechanical pressure
      of soil. Upon reaching the surface, light triggers a dramatic developmental
      transition termed de-etiolation that requires immediate termination of ethylene
      responses. Here, we report that light activation of photoreceptor phyB results in
      rapid degradation of EIN3, the master transcription factor in the ethylene
      signaling pathway. As a result, light rapidly and efficiently represses ethylene 
      actions. Specifically, phyB directly interacts with EIN3 in a light-dependent
      manner and also physically associates with F box protein EBFs. The
      light-activated association of phyB, EIN3, and EBF1/EBF2 proteins stimulates
      robust EIN3 degradation by SCF(EBF1/EBF2) E3 ligases. We reveal that phyB
      manipulates substrate-E3 ligase interactions in a light-dependent manner, thus
      directly controlling the stability of EIN3. Our findings illustrate a mechanistic
      model of how plants transduce light information to immediately turn off ethylene 
      signaling for de-etiolation initiation.

AB  - Faithful genome propagation requires coordination between nuclear envelope (NE)
      breakdown, spindle formation, and chromosomal events. The conserved linker of
      nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex connects fission yeast centromeres
      and the centrosome, across the NE, during interphase. During meiosis, LINC
      connects the centrosome with telomeres rather than centromeres. We previously
      showed that loss of telomere-LINC contacts compromises meiotic spindle formation.
      Here, we define the precise events regulated by telomere-LINC contacts and
      address the analogous possibility that centromeres regulate mitotic spindle
      formation. We develop conditionally inactivated LINC complexes in which the
      conserved SUN-domain protein Sad1 remains stable but severs interphase
      centromere-LINC contacts. Strikingly, the loss of such contacts abolishes spindle
      formation. We pinpoint the defect to a failure in the partial NE breakdown
      required for centrosome insertion into the NE, a step analogous to mammalian NE
      breakdown. Thus, interphase chromosome-LINC contacts constitute a cell-cycle
      control device linking nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic events.

TI  - The Shh Topological Domain Facilitates the Action of Remote Enhancers by Reducing
      the Effects of Genomic Distances.

AB  - Gene expression often requires interaction between promoters and distant
      enhancers, which occur within the context of highly organized topologically
      associating domains (TADs). Using a series of engineered chromosomal
      rearrangements at the Shh locus, we carried out an extensive fine-scale
      characterization of the factors that govern the long-range regulatory
      interactions controlling Shh expression. We show that Shh enhancers act
      pervasively, yet not uniformly, throughout the TAD. Importantly, changing
      intra-TAD distances had no impact on Shh expression. In contrast, inversions
      disrupting the TAD altered global folding of the region and prevented regulatory 
      contacts in a distance-dependent manner. Our data indicate that the Shh TAD
      promotes distance-independent contacts between distant regions that would
      otherwise interact only sporadically, enabling functional communication between
      them. In large genomes where genomic distances per se can limit regulatory
      interactions, this function of TADs could be as essential for gene expression as 
      the formation of insulated neighborhoods.

AB  - Biological systems display extraordinary robustness. Robustness of
      transcriptional enhancers results mainly from clusters of binding sites for the
      same transcription factor, and it is not clear how robust enhancers can evolve
      loss of expression through point mutations. Here, we report the high-resolution
      functional dissection of a robust enhancer of the shavenbaby gene that has
      contributed to morphological evolution. We found that robustness is encoded by
      many binding sites for the transcriptional activator Arrowhead and that, during
      evolution, some of these activator sites were lost, weakening enhancer activity. 
      Complete silencing of enhancer function, however, required evolution of a binding
      site for the spatially restricted potent repressor Abrupt. These findings
      illustrate that recruitment of repressor binding sites can overcome enhancer
      robustness and may minimize pleiotropic consequences of enhancer evolution.
      Recruitment of repression may be a general mode of evolution to break robust
      regulatory linkages.

AB  - Membrane contact sites enable interorganelle communication by positioning
      organelles in close proximity using molecular "tethers." With a growing
      understanding of the importance of contact sites, the hunt for new contact sites 
      and their tethers is in full swing. Determining just what is a tether has proven 
      challenging. Here, we aim to delineate guidelines that define the prerequisites
      for categorizing a protein as a tether. Setting this gold standard now, while
      groups from different disciplines are beginning to explore membrane contact
      sites, will enable efficient cooperation in the growing field and help to realize
      a great collaborative opportunity to boost its development.

AB  - Adult cardiomyocytes are largely thought to lack proliferative and therefore
      regenerative potential. Reporting in Nature, Nakada et al. (2016) find that a
      hypoxic regime reduces mitochondrial metabolism and promotes proliferation in
      adult mouse cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased regeneration following
      myocardial infarction. These findings suggest the potential to transform post-MI 
      care.

AB  - Centrioles acquire subdistal appendages (sDAPs) during primary cilium formation. 
      In this issue of Developmental Cell, Mazo et al. (2016) demonstrate that sDAPs
      keep cilia submerged within deep membrane invaginations. When sDAPs and
      centrosome cohesion are disrupted, cilia surface to the plasma membrane, which
      may alter mechanical and chemical signal transduction.

AB  - Embryonic gene expression intricately reflects anatomical context, developmental 
      stage, and cell type. To address whether the precise spatial origins of cardiac
      cells can be deduced solely from their transcriptional profiles, we established a
      genome-wide expression database from 118, 949, and 1,166 single murine heart
      cells at embryonic day 8.5 (e8.5), e9.5, and e10.5, respectively. We segregated
      these cells by type using unsupervised bioinformatics analysis and identified
      chamber-specific genes. Using a random forest algorithm, we reconstructed the
      spatial origin of single e9.5 and e10.5 cardiomyocytes with 92.0% +/- 3.2% and
      91.2% +/- 2.8% accuracy, respectively (99.4% +/- 1.0% and 99.1% +/- 1.1% if a
      +/-1 zone margin is permitted) and predicted the second heart field distribution 
      of Isl-1-lineage descendants. When applied to Nkx2-5(-/-) cardiomyocytes from
      murine e9.5 hearts, we showed their transcriptional alteration and lack of
      ventricular phenotype. Our database and zone classification algorithm will enable
      the discovery of novel mechanisms in early cardiac development and disease.

AB  - The extent to which alternative splicing and long intergenic noncoding RNAs
      (lincRNAs) contribute to the specialized functions of cells within an organ is
      poorly understood. We generated a comprehensive dataset of gene expression from
      individual cell types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types
      revealed that alternative splicing tends to remove parts of coding regions from a
      longer, major isoform, providing evidence for a progressive mechanism of
      splicing. Cell-type-specific intron retention suggested a possible origin for
      this common form of alternative splicing. Coordinated alternative splicing across
      developmental stages pointed to a role in regulating differentiation. Consistent 
      with this hypothesis, distinct isoforms of a transcription factor were shown to
      control developmental transitions. lincRNAs were generally lowly expressed at the
      level of individual cell types, but co-expression clusters provided clues as to
      their function. Our results highlight insights gained from analysis of expression
      at the level of individual cell types.

AB  - Activation of complex molecular programs in specific cell lineages governs
      mammalian heart development, from a primordial linear tube to a four-chamber
      organ. To characterize lineage-specific, spatiotemporal developmental programs,
      we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of >1,200 murine cells isolated at seven 
      time points spanning embryonic day 9.5 (primordial heart tube) to postnatal day
      21 (mature heart). Using unbiased transcriptional data, we classified
      cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblast-enriched cells, thus
      identifying markers for temporal and chamber-specific developmental programs. By 
      harnessing these datasets, we defined developmental ages of human and mouse
      pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes and characterized lineage-specific
      maturation defects in hearts of mice with heterozygous mutations in Nkx2.5 that
      cause human heart malformations. This spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis of
      heart development reveals lineage-specific gene programs underlying normal
      cardiac development and congenital heart disease.

AB  - Connective tissues-skeleton, dermis, pericytes, fascia-are a key cell source for 
      regenerating the patterned skeleton during axolotl appendage regeneration. This
      complexity has made it difficult to identify the cells that regenerate skeletal
      tissue. Inability to identify these cells has impeded a mechanistic understanding
      of blastema formation. By tracing cells during digit tip regeneration using
      brainbow transgenic axolotls, we show that cells from each connective tissue
      compartment have distinct spatial and temporal profiles of proliferation,
      migration, and differentiation. Chondrocytes proliferate but do not migrate into 
      the regenerate. In contrast, pericytes proliferate, then migrate into the
      blastema and give rise solely to pericytes. Periskeletal cells and fibroblasts
      contribute the bulk of digit blastema cells and acquire diverse fates according
      to successive waves of migration that choreograph their proximal-distal and
      tissue contributions. We further show that platelet-derived growth factor
      signaling is a potent inducer of fibroblast migration, which is required to form 
      the blastema.

TI  - Rac1-Mediated DNA Damage and Inflammation Promote Nf2 Tumorigenesis but Also
      Limit Cell-Cycle Progression.

AB  - Merlin encoded by the Nf2 gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor that has been
      implicated in regulation of both the Hippo-Yap and Rac1-Pak1 pathways. Using
      genetically engineered murine liver models, we show that co-deletion of Rac1 with
      Nf2 blocks tumor initiation but paradoxically exacerbates hepatomegaly induced by
      Nf2 loss, which can be suppressed either by treatment with pro-oxidants or by
      co-deletion of Yap. Our results suggest that while Yap acts as the central driver
      of proliferation during Nf2 tumorigenesis, Rac1 primarily functions as an
      inflammation switch by inducing reactive oxygen species that, on one hand, induce
      nuclear factor kappaB signaling and expression of inflammatory cytokines, and on 
      the other activate p53 checkpoint and senescence programs dampening the cyclin
      D1-pRb-E2F1 pathway. Interestingly, senescence markers are associated with benign
      NF2 tumors but not with malignant NF2 mutant mesotheliomas, suggesting that
      senescence may underlie the benign nature of most NF2 tumors.

AB  - Vertebrate cells can initiate ciliogenesis from centrioles at the cell center,
      near the Golgi, forming primary cilia confined or submerged in a deep narrow pit 
      created by membrane invagination. How or why cells maintain submerged cilia is
      unclear. Here, by characterizing centriole subdistal appendages (sDAP) in cells
      exclusively growing submerged cilia, we found that a group of sDAP components
      localize to the centriole proximal end through the cohesion factor C-Nap1 and
      that sDAP function redundantly with C-Nap1 for submerged cilia maintenance. Loss 
      of sDAP and C-Nap1 has no effect on cilia assembly, but it disrupts stable
      Golgi-cilia association and allows normally submerged cilia to fully surface,
      losing the deep membrane invagination. Intriguingly, unlike submerged cilia
      (stationary), surfaced cilia actively respond to mechanical stimuli with motions 
      and can ectopically recruit Hedgehog signaling components in the absence of
      agonist. We propose that spatial control of ciliogenesis uncouples or specifies
      sensory properties of cilia.

AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a central role in development and diseases. Hh
      activates its signal transducer and GPCR-family protein Smoothened (Smo) by
      inducing Smo phosphorylation, but whether Smo is activated through other
      post-translational modifications remains unexplored. Here we show that
      sumoylation acts in parallel with phosphorylation to promote Smo cell-surface
      expression and Hh signaling. We find that Hh stimulates Smo sumoylation by
      dissociating it from a desumoylation enzyme Ulp1. Sumoylation of Smo in turn
      recruits a deubiquitinase UBPY/USP8 to antagonize Smo ubiquitination and
      degradation, leading to its cell-surface accumulation and elevated Hh pathway
      activity. We also provide evidence that Shh stimulates sumoylation of mammalian
      Smo (mSmo) and that sumoylation promotes ciliary localization of mSmo and Shh
      pathway activity. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism whereby the SUMO
      pathway promotes Hh signaling by regulating Smo subcellular localization and shed
      light on how sumoylation regulates membrane protein trafficking.

AB  - Binding of the transcriptional co-activator YAP with the transcription factor
      TEAD stimulates growth of the heart and other organs. YAP overexpression potently
      stimulates fetal cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation, but YAP's mitogenic potency
      declines postnatally. While investigating factors that limit YAP's postnatal
      mitogenic activity, we found that the CM-enriched TEAD1 binding protein VGLL4
      inhibits CM proliferation by inhibiting TEAD1-YAP interaction and by targeting
      TEAD1 for degradation. Importantly, VGLL4 acetylation at lysine 225 negatively
      regulated its binding to TEAD1. This developmentally regulated acetylation event 
      critically governs postnatal heart growth, since overexpression of an
      acetylation-refractory VGLL4 mutant enhanced TEAD1 degradation, limited neonatal 
      CM proliferation, and caused CM necrosis. Our study defines an
      acetylation-mediated, VGLL4-dependent switch that regulates TEAD stability and
      YAP-TEAD activity. These insights may improve targeted modulation of TEAD-YAP
      activity in applications from cardiac regeneration to cancer.

AB  - Acinar cells make up the majority of all cells in the pancreas, yet the source of
      new acinar cells during homeostasis remains unknown. Using multicolor
      lineage-tracing and organoid-formation assays, we identified the presence of a
      progenitor-like acinar cell subpopulation. These cells have long-term
      self-renewal capacity, albeit in a unipotent fashion. We further demonstrate that
      binuclear acinar cells are terminally differentiated acinar cells. Transcriptome 
      analysis of single acinar cells revealed the existence of a minor population of
      cells expressing progenitor markers. Interestingly, a gain of the identified
      markers accompanied by a transient gain of proliferation was observed following
      chemically induced pancreatitis. Altogether, our study identifies a functionally 
      and molecularly distinct acinar subpopulation and thus transforms our
      understanding of the acinar cell compartment as a pool of equipotent secretory
      cells.

AB  - Insulin secretion by pancreatic islet beta cells is critical for glucose
      homeostasis, and a blunted beta cell secretory response is an early deficit in
      type 2 diabetes. Here, we uncover a regulatory mechanism by which glucose
      recruits vascular-derived neurotrophins to control insulin secretion. Nerve
      growth factor (NGF), a classical trophic factor for nerve cells, is expressed in 
      pancreatic vasculature while its TrkA receptor is localized to islet beta cells. 
      High glucose rapidly enhances NGF secretion and increases TrkA phosphorylation in
      mouse and human islets. Tissue-specific deletion of NGF or TrkA, or acute
      disruption of TrkA signaling, impairs glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in 
      mice. We show that internalized TrkA receptors promote insulin granule exocytosis
      via F-actin reorganization. Furthermore, NGF treatment augments glucose-induced
      insulin secretion in human islets. These findings reveal a non-neuronal role for 
      neurotrophins and identify a new regulatory pathway in insulin secretion that can
      be targeted to ameliorate beta cell dysfunction.

AB  - Positioning organs in the body often requires the movement of multiple tissues,
      yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms coordinating such movements are largely
      unknown. Here, we show that bidirectional signaling between EphrinB1 and EphB3b
      coordinates the movements of the hepatic endoderm and adjacent lateral plate
      mesoderm (LPM), resulting in asymmetric positioning of the zebrafish liver.
      EphrinB1 in hepatoblasts regulates directional migration and mediates
      interactions with the LPM, where EphB3b controls polarity and movement of the
      LPM. EphB3b in the LPM concomitantly repels hepatoblasts to move leftward into
      the liver bud. Cellular protrusions controlled by Eph/Ephrin signaling mediate
      hepatoblast motility and long-distance cell-cell contacts with the LPM beyond
      immediate tissue interfaces. Mechanistically, intracellular EphrinB1 domains
      mediate EphB3b-independent hepatoblast extension formation, while EpB3b
      interactions cause their destabilization. We propose that bidirectional short-
      and long-distance cell interactions between epithelial and mesenchyme-like
      tissues coordinate liver bud formation and laterality via cell repulsion.

AB  - The role of metabolic rewiring during cellular differentiation is under intense
      investigation. Reporting recently in Science, Peng et al. (2016) found that
      activation of glycolysis supports T helper cell differentiation by controlling
      acetyl-coA and histone acetylation levels, identifying a link between metabolic
      state and epigenetic control of gene activity.

AB  - Protein degradation is as important as synthesis in regulating protein
      expression, but protein degradation kinetics are relatively less understood. In a
      recent paper in Cell, McShane et al. (2016) use a novel methodology to
      demonstrate that many proteins decay non-exponentially, with biological
      implications for proteins in heteromeric complexes and in aneuploidy.

AB  - During development, the placement of internal organs asymmetrically along the
      left-right axis is critical for their proper adult function. Reporting in
      Developmental Cell, Cayuso et al. (2016) demonstrate an active role of the
      endoderm in this process, challenging the prior view that the endoderm is
      passively pushed by the mesoderm.

AB  - Actomyosin networks generate contractile force that changes cell and tissue
      shape. In muscle cells, actin filaments and myosin II appear in a polarized
      structure called a sarcomere, in which myosin II is localized in the center.
      Nonmuscle cortical actomyosin networks are thought to contract when nonmuscle
      myosin II (myosin) is activated throughout a mixed-polarity actin network. Here, 
      we identified a mutant version of the myosin-activating kinase, ROCK, that
      localizes diffusely, rather than centrally, in epithelial cell apices.
      Surprisingly, this mutant inhibits constriction, suggesting that centrally
      localized apical ROCK/myosin activity promotes contraction. We determined actin
      cytoskeletal polarity by developing a barbed end incorporation assay for
      Drosophila embryos, which revealed barbed end enrichment at junctions. Our
      results demonstrate that epithelial cells contract with a spatially organized
      apical actomyosin cortex, involving a polarized actin cytoskeleton and centrally 
      positioned myosin, with cell-scale order that resembles a muscle sarcomere.

AB  - Obesity is a global health issue, arousing interest in molecular mechanisms
      controlling fat. Transcriptional regulation of fat has received much attention,
      and key transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism, such as SBP-1/SREBP, 
      LPD-2/C/EBP, and MDT-15, are conserved from nematodes to mammals. However, there 
      is a growing awareness that lipid metabolism can also be controlled by
      post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans
      RNase, REGE-1, related to MCPIP1/Zc3h12a/Regnase-1, a key regulator of mammalian 
      innate immunity, promotes accumulation of body fat. Using exon-intron split
      analysis, we find that REGE-1 promotes fat by degrading the mRNA encoding ETS-4, 
      a fat-loss-promoting transcription factor. Because ETS-4, in turn, induces rege-1
      transcription, REGE-1 and ETS-4 appear to form an auto-regulatory module. We
      propose that this type of fat regulation may be of key importance when, if faced 
      with an environmental change, an animal must rapidly but precisely remodel its
      metabolism.

AB  - The earliest aspects of human embryogenesis remain mysterious. To model
      patterning events in the human embryo, we used colonies of human embryonic stem
      cells (hESCs) grown on micropatterned substrate and differentiated with BMP4.
      These gastruloids recapitulate the embryonic arrangement of the mammalian germ
      layers and provide an assay to assess the structural and signaling mechanisms
      patterning the human gastrula. Structurally, high-density hESCs localize their
      receptors to transforming growth factor beta at their lateral side in the center 
      of the colony while maintaining apical localization of receptors at the edge.
      This relocalization insulates cells at the center from apically applied ligands
      while maintaining response to basally presented ones. In addition, BMP4 directly 
      induces the expression of its own inhibitor, NOGGIN, generating a
      reaction-diffusion mechanism that underlies patterning. We develop a quantitative
      model that integrates edge sensing and inhibitors to predict human fate
      positioning in gastruloids and, potentially, the human embryo.

AB  - Eukaryotic cells attempt to maintain an optimal size, resulting in size
      homeostasis. While cellular content scales isometrically with cell size,
      allometric laws indicate that metabolism per mass unit should decline with
      increasing size. Here we use elutriation and single-cell flow cytometry to
      analyze mitochondrial scaling with cell size. While mitochondrial content
      increases linearly, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative
      phosphorylation are highest at intermediate cell sizes. Thus, mitochondrial
      content and functional scaling are uncoupled. The nonlinearity of mitochondrial
      functionality is cell size, not cell cycle, dependent, and it results in an
      optimal cell size whereby cellular fitness and proliferative capacity are
      maximized. While optimal cell size is controlled by growth factor signaling, its 
      establishment and maintenance requires mitochondrial dynamics, which can be
      controlled by the mevalonate pathway. Thus, optimization of cellular fitness and 
      functionality through mitochondria can explain the requirement for size control, 
      as well as provide means for its maintenance.

AB  - The axonal wiring molecule Slit and its Round-About (Robo) receptors are
      conserved regulators of nerve cord patterning. Robo receptors also contribute to 
      wiring brain circuits. Whether molecular mechanisms regulating these signals are 
      modified to fit more complex brain wiring processes is unclear. We investigated
      the role of Slit and Robo receptors in wiring Drosophila higher-order brain
      circuits and identified differences in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
      Robo/Slit function. First, we find that signaling by Robo receptors in the brain 
      is regulated by the Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase RPTP69d. RPTP69d
      increases membrane availability of Robo3 without affecting its phosphorylation
      state. Second, we detect no midline localization of Slit during brain
      development. Instead, Slit is enriched in the mushroom body, a neuronal structure
      covering large areas of the brain. Thus, a divergent molecular mechanism
      regulates neuronal circuit wiring in the Drosophila brain, partly in response to 
      signals from the mushroom body.

AB  - Directional cell migration is critical for metazoan development. We define two
      molecular pathways that activate the Arp2/3 complex during neuroblast migration
      in Caenorhabditis elegans. The transmembrane protein MIG-13/Lrp12 is linked to
      the Arp2/3 nucleation-promoting factors WAVE or WASP through direct interactions 
      with ABL-1 or SEM-5/Grb2, respectively. WAVE mutations partially impaired F-actin
      organization and decelerated cell migration, and WASP mutations did not inhibit
      cell migration but enhanced migration defects in WAVE-deficient cells. Purified
      SEM-5 and MIG-2 synergistically stimulated the F-actin branching activity of
      WASP-Arp2/3 in vitro. In GFP knockin animals, WAVE and WASP were largely
      organized into separate clusters at the leading edge, and the amount of WASP was 
      less than WAVE but could be elevated by WAVE mutations. Our results indicate that
      the MIG-13-WAVE pathway provides the major force for directional cell motility,
      whereas MIG-13-WASP partially compensates for its loss, underscoring their
      coordinated activities in facilitating robust cell migration.

AB  - An evolutionarily conserved feature of cellular organelles is the distinct
      phospholipid composition of their bounding membranes, which is essential to their
      identity and function. Within eukaryotic cells, two major lipid territories can
      be discerned, one centered on the endoplasmic reticulum and characterized by
      membranes with lipid packing defects, the other comprising
      plasma-membrane-derived organelles and characterized by membrane charge. We
      discuss how this cellular lipid organization is maintained, how lipid flux is
      regulated, and how perturbations in cellular lipid homeostasis can lead to
      disease.

AB  - Excitatory synaptic strengthening and the corresponding enlargement of dendritic 
      spines are thought to be essential for learning and memory. In two recent Nature 
      papers, Harward et al. (2016) and Hedrick et al. (2016) provide insight into the

AB  - The protocadherins Dachsous and Fat initiate a signaling pathway that controls
      growth and planar cell polarity by regulating the membrane localization of the
      atypical myosin Dachs. How Dachs is regulated by Fat signaling has remained
      unclear. Here we identify the vamana gene as playing a crucial role in regulating
      membrane localization of Dachs and in linking Fat and Dachsous to Dachs
      regulation. Vamana, an SH3-domain-containing protein, physically associates with 
      and co-localizes with Dachs and promotes its membrane localization. Vamana also
      associates with the Dachsous intracellular domain and with a region of the Fat
      intracellular domain that is essential for controlling Hippo signaling and levels
      of Dachs. Epistasis experiments, structure-function analysis, and physical
      interaction experiments argue that Fat negatively regulates Dachs in a
      Vamana-dependent process. Our findings establish Vamana as a crucial component of
      the Dachsous-Fat pathway that transmits Fat signaling by regulating Dachs.

AB  - Cell-specific regulation of protein levels and activity is essential for the
      distribution of functions among multiple cell types in animals. The finding that 
      many genes involved in these regulatory processes have a premetazoan origin
      raises the intriguing possibility that the mechanisms required for spatially
      regulated cell differentiation evolved prior to the appearance of animals. Here, 
      we use high-throughput proteomics in Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular
      relative of animals, to characterize the dynamic proteome and phosphoproteome
      profiles of three temporally distinct cell types in this premetazoan species. We 
      show that life-cycle transitions are linked to extensive proteome and
      phosphoproteome remodeling and that they affect key genes involved in animal
      multicellularity, such as transcription factors and tyrosine kinases. The
      observation of shared features between Capsaspora and metazoans indicates that
      elaborate and conserved phosphosignaling and proteome regulation supported
      temporal cell-type differentiation in the unicellular ancestor of animals.

AB  - The amyloid state of protein organization is typically associated with
      debilitating human neuropathies and is seldom observed in physiology. Here, we
      uncover a systemic program that leverages the amyloidogenic propensity of
      proteins to regulate cell adaptation to stressors. On stimulus, cells assemble
      the amyloid bodies (A-bodies), nuclear foci containing heterogeneous proteins
      with amyloid-like biophysical properties. A discrete peptidic sequence, termed
      the amyloid-converting motif (ACM), is capable of targeting proteins to the
      A-bodies by interacting with ribosomal intergenic noncoding RNA (rIGSRNA). The
      pathological beta-amyloid peptide, involved in Alzheimer's disease, displays
      ACM-like activity and undergoes stimuli-mediated amyloidogenesis in vivo. Upon
      signal termination, elements of the heat-shock chaperone pathway disaggregate the
      A-bodies. Physiological amyloidogenesis enables cells to store large quantities
      of proteins and enter a dormant state in response to stressors. We suggest that
      cells have evolved a post-translational pathway that rapidly and reversibly
      converts native-fold proteins to an amyloid-like solid phase.

AB  - Numerous signals drive the proliferative expansion of the distal endoderm and the
      underlying mesenchyme during lung branching morphogenesis, but little is known
      about how these signals are integrated. Here, we show by analysis of conditional 
      double mutants that the two T-box transcription factor genes Tbx2 and Tbx3 act
      together in the lung mesenchyme to maintain branching morphogenesis. Expression
      of both genes depends on epithelially derived Shh signaling, with additional
      modulation by Bmp, Wnt, and Tgfbeta signaling. Genetic rescue experiments reveal 
      that Tbx2 and Tbx3 function downstream of Shh to maintain pro-proliferative
      mesenchymal Wnt signaling, in part by direct repression of the Wnt antagonists
      Frzb and Shisa3. In combination with our previous finding that Tbx2 and Tbx3
      repress the cell-cycle inhibitors Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b, we conclude that Tbx2 and
      Tbx3 maintain proliferation of the lung mesenchyme by way of at least two
      molecular mechanisms: regulating cell-cycle regulation and integrating the
      activity of multiple signaling pathways.

AB  - Sensory perception, including thermosensation, shapes longevity in diverse
      organisms, but longevity-modulating signals from the sensory neurons are largely 
      obscure. Here we show that CRH-1/CREB activation by CMK-1/CaMKI in the AFD
      thermosensory neuron is a key mechanism that maintains lifespan at warm
      temperatures in C. elegans. In response to temperature rise and crh-1 activation,
      the AFD neurons produce and secrete the FMRFamide neuropeptide FLP-6. Both CRH-1 
      and FLP-6 are necessary and sufficient for longevity at warm temperatures. Our
      data suggest that FLP-6 targets the AIY interneurons and engages DAF-9 sterol
      hormone signaling. Moreover, we show that FLP-6 signaling downregulates
      ins-7/insulin-like peptide and several insulin pathway genes, whose activity
      compromises lifespan. Our work illustrates how temperature experience is
      integrated by the thermosensory circuit to generate neuropeptide signals that
      remodel insulin and sterol hormone signaling and reveals a neuronal-endocrine
      circuit driven by thermosensation to promote temperature-specific longevity.

AB  - The germ cell lineage ensures reproduction and heredity. The mechanism for germ
      cell specification in primates, including humans, has remained unknown. In
      primates, upon implantation the pluripotent epiblast segregates the amnion, an
      extra-embryonic membrane eventually ensheathing an embryo, and thereafter
      initiates gastrulation to generate three germ layers. Here, we show that in
      cynomolgus monkeys, the SOX17/TFAP2C/BLIMP1-positive primordial germ cells
      (cyPGCs) originate from the dorsal amnion at embryonic day 11 (E11) prior to
      gastrulation. cyPGCs appear to migrate down the amnion and, through proliferation
      and recruitment from the posterior amnion, expand in number around the posterior 
      yolk sac by E17. Remarkably, the amnion itself expresses BMP4 and WNT3A,
      cytokines potentially critical for cyPGC specification, and responds primarily to
      them. Moreover, human PGC-like cells in vitro exhibit a transcriptome similar to 
      cyPGCs just after specification. Our study identifies the origin of PGCs and a
      unique function of the nascent amnion in primates.

AB  - The origin of the stem is a major but poorly understood aspect of plant
      development, partly because the stem initiates in a relatively inaccessible
      region of the shoot apical meristem called the rib zone (RZ). We developed
      quantitative 3D image analysis and clonal analysis tools, which revealed that the
      Arabidopsis homeodomain protein REPLUMLESS (RPL) establishes distinct patterns of
      oriented cell division and growth in the central and peripheral regions of the
      RZ. A genome-wide screen for target genes connected RPL directly to many of the
      key shoot development pathways, including the development of organ boundaries;
      accordingly, mutation of the organ boundary gene LIGHT-SENSITIVE HYPOCOTYL 4
      restored RZ function and stem growth in the rpl mutant. Our work opens the way to
      study a developmental process of importance to crop improvement and highlights
      how apparently simple changes in 3D organ growth can reflect more complex
      internal changes in oriented cell activities.

AB  - When bacteria infect a cell, the bacterial membrane partially shields microbial
      structures from the immune system, preventing detection and clearance. In a
      recent issue of Cell, Man et al. (2016) show that the interferon-inducible
      protein IRGB10 liberates bacterial ligands for sensing by both the AIM2 and the
      non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasomes.

AB  - Bacteria use type 6 secretion systems in antagonistic behavior to compete for
      resources with other bacteria. In a recent issue of Cell, Vettiger and Basler
      (2016) show that bacteria can also use these systems to arm neighboring cells and
      force them to pass on a signal in the bacterial population.

      to experimental manipulations. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Cerikan et
      al. (2016) reveal how acute effects of DOCK6 RhoGEF depletion on RAC1 and CDC42
      activation are reversed over time by compensatory mechanisms that re-establish
      cellular homeostasis.

AB  - Primordial germ cell (PGC) development is characterized by global epigenetic
      remodeling, which resets genomic potential and establishes an epigenetic ground
      state. Here we recapitulate PGC specification in vitro from naive embryonic stem 
      cells and characterize the early events of epigenetic reprogramming during the
      formation of the human and mouse germline. Following rapid de novo DNA
      methylation during priming to epiblast-like cells, methylation is globally erased
      in PGC-like cells. Repressive chromatin marks (H3K9me2/3) and transposable
      elements are enriched at demethylation-resistant regions, while active chromatin 
      marks (H3K4me3 or H3K27ac) are more prominent at regions that demethylate faster.
      The dynamics of specification and epigenetic reprogramming show species-specific 
      differences, in particular markedly slower reprogramming kinetics in the human
      germline. Differences in developmental kinetics may be explained by differential 
      regulation of epigenetic modifiers. Our work establishes a robust and faithful
      experimental system of the early events of epigenetic reprogramming and
      regulation in the germline.

AB  - Selective autophagy, an essential process for maintaining intracellular
      homeostasis, depends on precise target recognition and local activation.
      Reporting in Developmental Cell, Chauhan et al. (2016) elegantly demonstrate that
      interaction between TRIM16 and Galectin3 orchestrates the recruitment of core
      autophagic factors and activates selective autophagy at the site of damaged
      endomembranes.

AB  - For adaptation to complex cellular functions, dynamic cytoskeletal networks are
      required. There are two major components of the cytoskeleton, microtubules and
      actin filaments, which form an intricate network maintaining an exquisite
      cooperation to build the physical basis for their cellular function. However,
      little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying their synergism. Here,
      we show that in Caco2 epithelial cells, noncentrosomal microtubules crosstalk
      with F-actin through their minus ends and contribute to the regulation of focal
      adhesion size and cell migration. We demonstrate that ACF7, a member of the
      spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal crosslinking proteins, interacts with Nezha 
      (also called CAMSAP3) at the minus ends of noncentrosomal microtubules and
      anchors them to actin filaments. Those noncentrosomal microtubules cooperate with
      actin filaments through retrograde flow to keep their length and orientation
      perpendicular to the cell edge as well as regulate focal adhesion size and cell
      migration.

AB  - Autophagy is a cytoplasmic degradation system that is important for starvation
      adaptation and cellular quality control. Previously, we reported that Atg5-null
      mice are neonatal lethal; however, the exact cause of their death remains
      unknown. Here, we show that restoration of ATG5 in the brain is sufficient to
      rescue Atg5-null mice from neonatal lethality. This suggests that neuronal
      dysfunction, including suckling failure, is the primary cause of the death of
      Atg5-null neonates, which would further be accelerated by nutrient insufficiency 
      due to a systemic failure in autophagy. The rescued Atg5-null mouse model, as a
      resource, allows us to investigate the physiological roles of autophagy in the
      whole body after the neonatal period. These rescued mice demonstrate previously
      unappreciated abnormalities such as hypogonadism and iron-deficiency anemia.
      These observations provide new insights into the physiological roles of the
      autophagy factor ATG5.

AB  - Genome-editing technologies allow systematic inactivation of human genes. Whether
      knockout phenotypes always reflect gene functions as determined by acute RNAi is 
      an important question. Here we show how the acute knockdown of the Adams-Oliver
      syndrome (AOS) gene DOCK6, coding for a RAC1/CDC42 guanine nucleotide exchange
      factor, results in strikingly different phenotypes to those generated by genomic 
      DOCK6 disruption. Cell-intrinsic adaptation compensates for loss of DOCK6
      function. Prolonged DOCK6 loss impacts upon the MRTF-A/SRF transcription factor, 
      reducing levels of the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15. Reduced ISGylation of the
      IQGAP1 protein increases levels of active CDC42 and RAC1 to compensate for DOCK6 
      disruption. Similar downregulation of ISG15 in cells from DOCK6 AOS patients
      indicates that such adaptation can compensate for genetic defects during
      development. Thus, phenotypes of gene inactivation are critically dependent on
      the timescale, as acute knockdown reflects a transient state of adjustment to a
      new equilibrium that is attained following compensation.

AB  - Selective autophagy performs an array of tasks to maintain intracellular
      homeostasis, sterility, and organellar and cellular functionality. The fidelity
      of these processes depends on precise target recognition and limited activation
      of the autophagy apparatus in a localized fashion. Here we describe cooperation
      in such processes between the TRIM family and Galectin family of proteins. TRIMs,
      which are E3 ubiquitin ligases, displayed propensity to associate with Galectins.
      One specific TRIM, TRIM16, interacted with Galectin-3 in a ULK1-dependent manner.
      TRIM16, through integration of Galectin- and ubiquitin-based processes,
      coordinated recognition of membrane damage with mobilization of the core
      autophagy regulators ATG16L1, ULK1, and Beclin 1 in response to damaged
      endomembranes. TRIM16 affected mTOR, interacted with TFEB, and influenced TFEB's 
      nuclear translocation. The cooperation between TRIM16 and Galectin-3 in targeting
      and activation of selective autophagy protects cells from lysosomal damage and
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion.

AB  - The Golgi apparatus controls the formation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays 
      important for Golgi organization, polarized transport, cell motility, and cell
      differentiation. Here, we show that CAMSAP2 stabilizes and attaches microtubule
      minus ends to the Golgi through a complex of AKAP450 and myomegalin. CLASPs
      stabilize CAMSAP2-decorated microtubules but are not required for their Golgi
      tethering. AKAP450 is also essential for Golgi microtubule nucleation, and
      myomegalin and CDK5RAP2 but not CAMSAP2 contribute to this function. In the
      absence of centrosomes, AKAP450- and CAMSAP2-dependent pathways of microtubule
      minus-end organization become dominant, and the presence of at least one of them 
      is needed to maintain microtubule density. Strikingly, a compact Golgi can be
      assembled in the absence of both centrosomal and Golgi microtubules. However,
      CAMSAP2- and AKAP450-dependent Golgi microtubules facilitate Golgi reorientation 
      and cell invasion in a 3D matrix. We propose that Golgi-anchored microtubules are
      important for polarized cell movement but not for coalescence of Golgi membranes.

AB  - Specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) activates epigenetic reprogramming 
      for totipotency, the elucidation of which remains a fundamental challenge. Here, 
      we uncover regulatory principles for DNA methylation reprogramming during in
      vitro PGC specification, in which mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are induced
      into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then PGC-like cells (PGCLCs). While ESCs
      reorganize their methylome to form EpiLCs, PGCLCs essentially dilute the EpiLC
      methylome at constant, yet different, rates between unique sequence regions and
      repeats. ESCs form hypomethylated domains around pluripotency regulators for
      their activation, whereas PGCLCs create demethylation-sensitive domains around
      developmental regulators by accumulating abundant H3K27me3 for their repression. 
      Loss of PRDM14 globally upregulates methylation and diminishes the hypomethylated
      domains, but it preserves demethylation-sensitive domains. Notably, female ESCs
      form hypomethylated lamina-associated domains, while female PGCLCs effectively
      reverse such states into a more normal configuration. Our findings illuminate the
      unique orchestration of DNA methylation and histone modification reprogramming
      during PGC specification.

AB  - Remodeling DNA methylation in mammalian genomes can be global, as seen in
      preimplantation embryos and primordial germ cells (PGCs), or locus specific,
      which can regulate neighboring gene expression. In PGCs, global and
      locus-specific DNA demethylation occur in sequential stages, with an initial
      global decrease in methylated cytosines (stage I) followed by a Tet
      methylcytosine dioxygenase (Tet)-dependent decrease in methylated cytosines that 
      act at imprinting control regions (ICRs) and meiotic genes (stage II). The
      purpose of the two-stage mechanism is unclear. Here we show that Dnmt1 preserves 
      DNA methylation through stage I at ICRs and meiotic gene promoters and is
      required for the pericentromeric enrichment of 5hmC. We discovered that the
      functional consequence of abrogating two-stage DNA demethylation in PGCs was
      precocious germline differentiation leading to hypogonadism and infertility.
      Therefore, bypassing stage-specific DNA demethylation has significant
      consequences for progenitor germ cell differentiation and the ability to transmit
      DNA from parent to offspring.

AB  - There were multiple prerequisites to the evolution of multicellular animal life, 
      including the generation of multiple cell fates ("cellular diversity") and their 
      patterned spatial arrangement ("spatial form"). Wnt proteins operate as
      primordial symmetry-breaking signals. By virtue of their short-range nature and
      their capacity to activate both lineage-specifying and cell-polarizing
      intracellular signaling cascades, Wnts can polarize cells at their site of
      contact, orienting the axis of cell division while simultaneously programming
      daughter cells to adopt diverging fates in a spatially stereotyped way. By
      coupling cell fate to position, symmetry-breaking Wnt signals were pivotal in
      constructing the metazoan body by generating cellular diversity and spatial form.

AB  - The root meristem has a centrally located group of mitotically quiescent cells,
      to which current models assign a stem cell organizer function. However, evidence 
      is emerging for decentralized control of stem cell activity, whereby
      self-renewing behavior emerges from the lack of cell displacement at the border
      of opposing differentiation gradients. We term this a "stagnation" model due to
      its reliance on passive mechanics. The position of stem cells is established by
      two opposing axes that reciprocally control each other's differentiation. Such
      broad tissue organization programs would allow plants, like some animal systems, 
      to rapidly reconstitute stem cells from non-stem-cell tissues.

AB  - Cell competition is a cell fitness-sensing mechanism conserved from insects to
      mammals that eliminates those cells that, although viable, are less fit than
      their neighbors. An important implication of cell competition is that cellular
      fitness is not only a cell-intrinsic property but is also determined relative to 
      the fitness of neighboring cells: a cell that is of suboptimal fitness in one
      context may be "super-fit" in the context of a different cell population. Here we
      discuss the mechanisms by which cell competition measures and communicates cell
      fitness levels and the implications of this mechanism for development,
      regeneration, and tumor progression.

AB  - Chromatin structure is intimately connected with gene expression and cell
      identity. Here we review recent advances in the field and discuss how
      establishment of cell identity during development is accompanied by large-scale
      remodeling of the epigenetic landscape and how this remodeling drives and
      supports lineage specification and maintenance. We discuss maternal control of
      the early embryonic epigenetic landscape, selective usage of enhancer clusters
      via 3D chromatin contacts leading to activation of transcription factor networks,
      and conserved regulation of developmental pathways by specific DNA demethylation 
      of key regulatory regions. Together, these processes establish an epigenetic
      framework regulating different phases of embryonic development.

AB  - Mammalian epidermis is maintained through proliferation of stem cells and
      differentiation of their progeny. The balance between self-renewal and
      differentiation is controlled by a variety of interacting intrinsic and extrinsic
      factors. Although the nature of these interactions is complex, they can be
      modeled in a reductionist fashion by capturing single epidermal stem cells on
      micropatterned substrates and exposing them to individual stimuli, alone or in
      combination, over defined time points. These studies have shown that different
      extrinsic stimuli trigger a common outcome-initiation of terminal
      differentiation-by activating different signaling pathways and eliciting
      different transcriptional responses.

AB  - Organoids are three-dimensional in-vitro-grown cell clusters with near-native
      microanatomy that arise from self-organizing mammalian pluripotent or adult stem 
      cells. Although monolayer stem cell cultures were established more than 40 years 
      ago, organoid technology has recently emerged as an essential tool for both
      fundamental and biomedical research. For developmental biologists, organoids
      provide powerful means for ex vivo modeling of tissue morphogenesis and
      organogenesis. Here we discuss how organoid cultures of the intestine and other
      tissues have been established and how they are utilized as an in vitro model
      system for stem cell research and developmental biology.

AB  - Theoretical modeling is central to elucidating underlying principles of emergent 
      properties of complex systems. In cell and developmental biology, the last 15
      years have witnessed a convergence of empirical and modeling approaches for fresh
      perspectives. The role of cell division in coordinating size, shape, and fate in 
      particular illustrates the ever-growing impact of modeling.

TI  - PIKfyve Regulates Vacuole Maturation and Nutrient Recovery following Engulfment.

AB  - The scavenging of extracellular macromolecules by engulfment can sustain cell
      growth in a nutrient-depleted environment. Engulfed macromolecules are contained 
      within vacuoles that are targeted for lysosome fusion to initiate degradation and
      nutrient export. We have shown that vacuoles containing engulfed material undergo
      mTORC1-dependent fission that redistributes degraded cargo back into the
      endosomal network. Here we identify the lipid kinase PIKfyve as a regulator of an
      alternative pathway that distributes engulfed contents in support of
      intracellular macromolecular synthesis during macropinocytosis, entosis, and
      phagocytosis. We find that PIKfyve regulates vacuole size in part through its
      downstream effector, the cationic transporter TRPML1. Furthermore, PIKfyve
      promotes recovery of nutrients from vacuoles, suggesting a potential link between
      PIKfyve activity and lysosomal nutrient export. During nutrient depletion,
      PIKfyve activity protects Ras-mutant cells from starvation-induced cell death and
      supports their proliferation. These data identify PIKfyve as a critical regulator
      of vacuole maturation and nutrient recovery during engulfment.

TI  - Rac1 Controls Both the Secretory Function of the Mammary Gland and Its Remodeling
      for Successive Gestations.

AB  - An important feature of the mammary gland is its ability to undergo repeated
      morphological changes during each reproductive cycle with profound tissue
      expansion in pregnancy and regression in involution. However, the mechanisms that
      determine the tissue's cyclic regenerative capacity remain elusive. We have now
      discovered that Cre-Lox ablation of Rac1 in mammary epithelia causes gross
      enlargement of the epithelial tree and defective alveolar regeneration in a
      second pregnancy. Architectural defects arise because loss of Rac1 disrupts
      clearance in involution following the first lactation. We show that Rac1 is
      crucial for mammary alveolar epithelia to switch from secretion to a phagocytic
      mode and rapidly remove dying neighbors. Moreover, Rac1 restricts the extrusion
      of dying cells into the lumen, thus promoting their eradication by live
      phagocytic neighbors while within the epithelium. Without Rac1, residual milk and
      cell corpses flood the ductal network, causing gross dilation, chronic
      inflammation, and defective future regeneration.

TI  - A Conserved Role for Girdin in Basal Body Positioning and Ciliogenesis.

AB  - Primary cilia are ubiquitous sensory organelles that mediate diverse signaling
      pathways. Cilia position on the cell surface is determined by the location of the
      basal body (BB) that templates the cilium. The mechanisms that regulate BB
      positioning in the context of ciliogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that
      the conserved signaling and scaffolding protein Girdin localizes to the proximal 
      regions of centrioles and regulates BB positioning and ciliogenesis in
      Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons and human RPE-1 cells. Girdin depletion
      alters localization of the intercentriolar linker and ciliary rootlet component
      rootletin, and rootletin knockdown in RPE-1 cells mimics Girdin-dependent
      phenotypes. C. elegans Girdin also regulates localization of the apical junction 
      component AJM-1, suggesting that in nematodes Girdin may position BBs via
      rootletin- and AJM-1-dependent anchoring to the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane,
      respectively. Together, our results describe a conserved role for Girdin in BB
      positioning and ciliogenesis.

      Segregation and Nuclear Assembly.

AB  - During M-phase entry in metazoans with open mitosis, the concerted action of
      mitotic kinases disassembles nuclei and promotes assembly of kinetochores-the
      primary microtubule attachment sites on chromosomes. At M-phase exit, these major
      changes in cellular architecture must be reversed. Here, we show that the
      conserved kinetochore-localized nucleoporin MEL-28/ELYS docks the catalytic
      subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) to direct kinetochore
      disassembly-dependent chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis I and nuclear 
      assembly during the transition from M phase to interphase. During oocyte meiosis 
      I, MEL-28-PP1c disassembles kinetochores in a timely manner to promote elongation
      of the acentrosomal spindles that segregate homologous chromosomes. During
      nuclear assembly, MEL-28 recruits PP1c to the periphery of decondensed chromatin,
      where it directs formation of a functional nuclear compartment. Thus, a pool of
      phosphatase activity associated with a kinetochore-localized nucleoporin
      contributes to two key events that occur during M-phase exit in metazoans:
      kinetochore disassembly and nuclear reassembly.

AB  - Mammary epithelial phagocytosis is critical for removal of apoptotic cells during
      involution, but the mechanisms governing this process are largely unknown. In
      this issue of Developmental Cell, Akhtar et al. (2016) provide insight into
      mechanisms regulating involution, demonstrating that Rac1 drives the switch from 
      differentiation to phagocytosis in mammary epithelium.

AB  - When neutrophils infiltrate a site of inflammation, they have to stop at the
      right place to exert their effector function. In this issue of Developmental
      Cell, Wang et al. (2016) show that neutrophils sense reactive oxygen species via 
      the TRPM2 channel to arrest migration at their target site.

AB  - Nuclear pore proteins at the base of cilia were thought to regulate transport
      into cilia. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Del Viso et al. (2016) challenge
      this view, showing instead that pore proteins localize to ciliary basal bodies
      and that their perturbation leads to congenital heart disease.

AB  - Human genomics is identifying candidate genes for congenital heart disease (CHD),
      but discovering the underlying mechanisms remains challenging. In a patient with 
      CHD and heterotaxy (Htx), a disorder of left-right patterning, we previously
      identified a duplication in Nup188. However, a mechanism to explain how a
      component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) could cause Htx/CHD was undefined.
      Here, we show that knockdown of Nup188 or its binding partner Nup93 leads to a
      loss of cilia during embryonic development while leaving NPC function largely
      intact. Many data, including the localization of endogenous Nup188/93 at cilia
      bases, support their direct role at cilia. Super-resolution imaging of Nup188
      shows two barrel-like structures with dimensions and organization incompatible
      with an NPC-like ring, arguing against a proposed "ciliary pore complex." We
      suggest that the nanoscale organization and function of nucleoporins are context 
      dependent in a way that is required for the structure of the heart.

AB  - Blood neutrophils perform an essential host-defense function by directly
      migrating to bacterial invasion sites to kill bacteria. The mechanisms mediating 
      the transition from the migratory to bactericidal phenotype remain elusive. Here,
      we demonstrate that TRPM2, a trp superfamily member, senses neutrophil-generated 
      reactive oxygen species and restrains neutrophil migration. The inhibitory
      function of oxidant sensing by TRPM2 requires the oxidation of Cys549, which then
      induces TRMP2 binding to formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and subsequent FPR1
      internalization and signaling inhibition. The oxidant sensing-induced termination
      of neutrophil migration at the site of infection permits a smooth transition to
      the subsequent microbial killing phase.

AB  - While the extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to regulate neural stem cell
      quiescence in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ), the function of ECM in the
      developing SVZ remains unknown. Here, we report that the ECM receptor
      dystroglycan regulates a unique developmental restructuring of ECM in the early
      postnatal SVZ. Dystroglycan is furthermore required for ependymal cell
      differentiation and assembly of niche pinwheel structures, at least in part by
      suppressing Notch activation in radial glial cells, which leads to the increased 
      expression of MCI, Myb, and FoxJ1, transcriptional regulators necessary for
      acquisition of the multiciliated phenotype. Dystroglycan also regulates perinatal
      radial glial cell proliferation and transition into intermediate gliogenic
      progenitors, such that either acute or constitutive loss of function in
      dystroglycan results in increased oligodendrogenesis. These findings reveal a
      role for dystroglycan in orchestrating both the assembly and function of the SVZ 
      neural stem cell niche.

AB  - Spermatogenesis occurs inside a somatic cell enclosure. Sperm release, the most
      important final step and a target for contraceptives, has been extensively
      studied in fixed tissue preparations. Here, we provide a time-lapse description
      of the release process in Drosophila testis ex vivo. We show that the spermatid
      tails exit the somatic enclosure and enter the testicular duct first, followed by
      the spermatid heads. Prior to this, individual spermatid heads attempt to invade 
      the head cyst cell, and on each occasion they are repelled by a rapid and local
      F-actin polymerization response from the head cyst cell. The F-actin assembly
      involves N-WASp, D-WIP, and Arp2/3 complex and dissipates once the spermatid head
      retreats back into the fold. These findings revise the existing spermiation model
      in Drosophila and suggest that somatic cells can actively oppose mechanical cell 
      invasion attempts using calibrated F-actin dynamics in situ.

AB  - During embryonic development, cells must establish fates, morphologies, and
      behaviors in coordination with one another to form a functional body. A prevalent
      hypothesis for how this coordination is achieved is that each cell's fate and
      behavior is determined by a defined mixture of RNAs. Only recently has it become 
      possible to measure the full suite of transcripts in a single cell. Here we
      quantify genome-wide mRNA abundance in each cell of the Caenorhabditis elegans
      embryo up to the 16-cell stage. We describe spatially dynamic expression,
      quantify cell-specific differential activation of the zygotic genome, and
      identify genes that were previously unappreciated as being critical for
      development. We present an interactive data visualization tool that allows broad 
      access to our dataset. This genome-wide single-cell map of mRNA abundance,
      alongside the well-studied life history and fate of each cell, describes at a
      cellular resolution the mRNA landscape that guides development.

AB  - Embryos of most metazoans undergo rapid and synchronous cell cycles following
      fertilization. While diffusion is too slow for synchronization of mitosis across 
      large spatial scales, waves of Cdk1 activity represent a possible process of
      synchronization. However, the mechanisms regulating Cdk1 waves during embryonic
      development remain poorly understood. Using biosensors of Cdk1 and Chk1
      activities, we dissect the regulation of Cdk1 waves in the Drosophila syncytial
      blastoderm. We show that Cdk1 waves are not controlled by the mitotic switch but 
      by a double-negative feedback between Cdk1 and Chk1. Using mathematical modeling 
      and surgical ligations, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between S phase 
      Cdk1 waves, which propagate as active trigger waves in an excitable medium, and
      mitotic Cdk1 waves, which propagate as passive phase waves. Our findings show
      that in Drosophila embryos, Cdk1 positive feedback serves primarily to ensure the
      rapid onset of mitosis, while wave propagation is regulated by S phase events.

TI  - aPKC Inhibition by Par3 CR3 Flanking Regions Controls Substrate Access and
      Underpins Apical-Junctional Polarization.

AB  - Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a key apical-basal polarity determinant and
      Par complex component. It is recruited by Par3/Baz (Bazooka in Drosophila) into
      epithelial apical domains through high-affinity interaction. Paradoxically, aPKC 
      also phosphorylates Par3/Baz, provoking its relocalization to adherens junctions 
      (AJs). We show that Par3 conserved region 3 (CR3) forms a tight inhibitory
      complex with a primed aPKC kinase domain, blocking substrate access. A CR3 motif 
      flanking its PKC consensus site disrupts the aPKC kinase N lobe, separating
      P-loop/alphaB/alphaC contacts. A second CR3 motif provides a high-affinity
      anchor. Mutation of either motif switches CR3 to an efficient in vitro substrate 
      by exposing its phospho-acceptor site. In vivo, mutation of either CR3 motif
      alters Par3/Baz localization from apical to AJs. Our results reveal how Par3/Baz 
      CR3 can antagonize aPKC in stable apical Par complexes and suggests that
      modulation of CR3 inhibitory arms or opposing aPKC pockets would perturb the
      interaction, promoting Par3/Baz phosphorylation.

AB  - Fascin is an F-actin-bundling protein shown to stabilize filopodia and regulate
      adhesion dynamics in migrating cells, and its expression is correlated with poor 
      prognosis and increased metastatic potential in a number of cancers. Here, we
      identified the nuclear envelope protein nesprin-2 as a binding partner for fascin
      in a range of cell types in vitro and in vivo. Nesprin-2 interacts with fascin
      through a direct, F-actin-independent interaction, and this binding is distinct
      and separable from a role for fascin within filopodia at the cell periphery.
      Moreover, disrupting the interaction between fascin and nesprin-2 C-terminal
      domain leads to specific defects in F-actin coupling to the nuclear envelope,
      nuclear movement, and the ability of cells to deform their nucleus to invade
      through confined spaces. Together, our results uncover a role for fascin that
      operates independently of filopodia assembly to promote efficient cell migration 
      and invasion.

AB  - Signal transduction from a cell's surface to its interior requires dedicated
      signaling elements and a cellular environment conducive to signal propagation.
      Plant development, defense, and homeostasis rely on plasma membrane receptor-like
      kinases to perceive endogenous and environmental signals, but little is known
      about their immediate downstream targets and signaling modifiers. Using genetics,
      biochemistry, and live-cell imaging, we show that the VAP-RELATED SUPPRESSOR OF
      TMM (VST) family is required for ERECTA-mediated signaling in growth and
      cell-fate determination and reveal a role for ERECTA-LIKE2 in modulating
      signaling by its sister kinases. We show that VSTs are peripheral plasma membrane
      proteins that can form complexes with integral ER-membrane proteins, thereby
      potentially influencing the organization of the membrane milieu to promote
      efficient and differential signaling from the ERECTA-family members to their
      downstream intracellular targets.

AB  - The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway governs complex developmental processes,
      including proliferation and patterning within diverse tissues. These activities
      rely on a tightly regulated transduction system that converts graded Hh input
      signals into specific levels of pathway activity. Uncontrolled activation of Hh
      signaling drives tumor initiation and maintenance. However, recent entry of
      pathway-specific inhibitors into the clinic reveals mixed patient responses and
      thus prompts further exploration of pathway activation and inhibition. In this
      review, we share emerging insights into regulated and oncogenic Hh signaling,
      supplemented with updates on the development and use of Hh pathway-targeted
      therapies.

AB  - A large population of proliferative stem cells (neoblasts) is required for
      physiological tissue homeostasis and post-injury regeneration in planarians.
      Recent studies indicate that survival of a few neoblasts after sublethal
      irradiation results in the clonal expansion of the surviving stem cells and the
      eventual restoration of tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity. However,
      the precise mechanisms regulating the population dynamics of neoblasts remain
      largely unknown. Here, we uncovered a central role for epidermal growth factor
      (EGF) signaling during in vivo neoblast expansion mediated by Smed-egfr-3
      (egfr-3) and its putative ligand Smed-neuregulin-7 (nrg-7). Furthermore, the EGF 
      receptor-3 protein localizes asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic membrane of
      neoblasts, and the ratio of asymmetric to symmetric cell divisions decreases
      significantly in egfr-3(RNAi) worms. Our results not only provide the first
      molecular evidence of asymmetric stem cell divisions in planarians, but also
      demonstrate that EGF signaling likely functions as an essential regulator of
      neoblast clonal expansion.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are self-renewing multipotent stem cells that
      generate mature blood lineages throughout life. They, together with hematopoietic
      progenitor cells (collectively known as HSPCs), emerge from hemogenic endothelium
      in the floor of the embryonic dorsal aorta by an endothelial-to-hematopoietic
      transition (EHT). Here we demonstrate that transforming growth factor beta
      (TGFbeta) is required for HSPC specification and that it regulates the expression
      of the Notch ligand Jagged1a in endothelial cells prior to EHT, in a striking
      parallel with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The requirement for
      TGFbeta is two fold and sequential: autocrine via Tgfbeta1a and Tgfbeta1b
      produced in the endothelial cells themselves, followed by a paracrine input of
      Tgfbeta3 from the notochord, suggesting that the former programs the hemogenic
      endothelium and the latter drives EHT. Our findings have important implications
      for the generation of HSPCs from pluripotent cells in vitro.

AB  - Indirect flight muscles (IFMs) in Drosophila are generated during pupariation by 
      fusion of hundreds of myoblasts with larval muscle templates (myotubes). Live
      observation of these muscles during the fusion process revealed multiple long
      actin-based protrusions that emanate from the myotube surface and require Enabled
      and IRSp53 for their generation and maintenance. Fusion is blocked when formation
      of these filopodia is compromised. While filopodia are not required for the
      signaling process underlying critical myoblast cell-fate changes prior to fusion,
      myotube-myoblast adhesion appears to be filopodia dependent. Without filopodia,
      close apposition between the cell membranes is not achieved, the cell-adhesion
      molecule Duf is not recruited to the myotube surface, and adhesion-dependent
      actin foci do not form. We therefore propose that the filopodia are necessary to 
      prime the heterotypic adhesion process between the two cell types, possibly by
      recruiting the cell-adhesion molecule Sns to discrete patches on the myoblast
      cell surface.

AB  - Genes are thought to be transmitted to offspring by random fertilization of a
      small number of oocytes with numerous spermatozoa. Here we analyzed the dynamics 
      of male germline transmission by genetic marking and transplantation of
      spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We found that offspring deriving from a small
      number of specific SSCs appear within a limited time. Interestingly, the same SSC
      clones reappear later with an average functional lifespan of approximately 124.4 
      days. Cyclic offspring production from SSCs was not caused by changes in SSC
      self-renewal activity because lineage-tracing analyses suggested that all SSCs
      actively proliferated. Selection appears to occur during the differentiating
      spermatogonia stage, when extensive apoptosis was observed. The pattern of
      germline transmission could be predicted using a mathematical model in which SSCs
      repeat cycles of transient spermatogenic burst and refractory periods. Thus,
      spermatogenesis is a regulated process whereby specific SSC clones are repeatedly
      recruited for fertilization with long-term cycles.

      movements, often caused by dysfunction of the TorsinA gene. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Grillet et al. (2016) use Drosophila to discover that TorsinA
      regulates lipid metabolism, opening up future directions of research into the

AB  - Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and is the major contributor
      to plant morphogenesis. Cellulose is synthesized by plasma membrane-localized
      cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Nascent cellulose microfibrils become
      entangled in the cell wall, and further catalysis therefore drives the CSC
      forward through the membrane: a process guided by cortical microtubules via the
      protein CSI1/POM2. Still, it is unclear how the microtubules can withstand the
      forces generated by the motile CSCs to effectively direct CSC movement. Here, we 
      identified a family of microtubule-associated proteins, the cellulose
      synthase-microtubule uncouplings (CMUs), that located as static puncta along
      cortical microtubules. Functional disruption of the CMUs caused lateral
      microtubule displacement and compromised microtubule-based guidance of CSC
      movement. CSCs that traversed the microtubules interacted with the microtubules
      via CSI1/POM2, which prompted the lateral microtubule displacement. Hence, we
      have revealed how microtubules can withstand the propulsion of the CSCs during
      cellulose biosynthesis and thus sustain anisotropic plant cell growth.

AB  - Torsins are developmentally essential AAA+ proteins, and mutation of human
      torsinA causes the neurological disease DYT1 dystonia. They localize in the ER
      membranes, but their cellular function remains unclear. We now show that dTorsin 
      is required in Drosophila adipose tissue, where it suppresses triglyceride
      levels, promotes cell growth, and elevates membrane lipid content. We also see
      that human torsinA at the inner nuclear membrane is associated with membrane
      expansion and elevated cellular lipid content. Furthermore, the key lipid
      metabolizing enzyme, lipin, is mislocalized in dTorsin-KO cells, and dTorsin
      increases levels of the lipin substrate, phosphatidate, and reduces the product, 
      diacylglycerol. Finally, genetic suppression of dLipin rescues dTorsin-KO
      defects, including adipose cell size, animal growth, and survival. These findings
      identify that torsins are essential regulators of cellular lipid metabolism and
      implicate disturbed lipid biology in childhood-onset DYT1 dystonia.

TI  - PRG-1 Regulates Synaptic Plasticity via Intracellular PP2A/beta1-Integrin
      Signaling.

AB  - Alterations in dendritic spine numbers are linked to deficits in learning and
      memory. While we previously revealed that postsynaptic plasticity-related gene 1 
      (PRG-1) controls lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling at glutamatergic synapses 
      via presynaptic LPA receptors, we now show that PRG-1 also affects spine density 
      and synaptic plasticity in a cell-autonomous fashion via protein phosphatase 2A
      (PP2A)/beta1-integrin activation. PRG-1 deficiency reduces spine numbers and
      beta1-integrin activation, alters long-term potentiation (LTP), and impairs
      spatial memory. The intracellular PRG-1 C terminus interacts in an LPA-dependent 
      fashion with PP2A, thus modulating its phosphatase activity at the postsynaptic
      density. This results in recruitment of adhesome components src, paxillin, and
      talin to lipid rafts and ultimately in activation of beta1-integrins. Consistent 
      with these findings, activation of PP2A with FTY720 rescues defects in spine
      density and LTP of PRG-1-deficient animals. These results disclose a mechanism by
      which bioactive lipid signaling via PRG-1 could affect synaptic plasticity and
      memory formation.

AB  - Vertebrates exhibit a remarkably broad variation in trunk and tail lengths.
      However, the evolutionary and developmental origins of this diversity remain
      largely unknown. Posterior Hox genes were proposed to be major players in trunk
      length diversification in vertebrates, but functional studies have so far failed 
      to support this view. Here we identify the pluripotency factor Oct4 as a key
      regulator of trunk length in vertebrate embryos. Maintaining high Oct4 levels in 
      axial progenitors throughout development was sufficient to extend trunk length in
      mouse embryos. Oct4 also shifted posterior Hox gene-expression boundaries in the 
      extended trunks, thus providing a link between activation of these genes and the 
      transition to tail development. Furthermore, we show that the exceptionally long 
      trunks of snakes are likely to result from heterochronic changes in Oct4 activity
      during body axis extension, which may have derived from differential genomic
      rearrangements at the Oct4 locus during vertebrate evolution.

AB  - The neural crest is a transient, multipotent embryonic cell population in
      vertebrates giving rise to diverse cell types in adults via intermediate
      progenitors. The in vivo cell-fate potential and lineage segregation of these
      postembryonic progenitors is poorly understood, and it is unknown if and when the
      progenitors become fate restricted. We investigate the fate restriction in the
      neural crest-derived stem cells and intermediate progenitors in zebrafish, which 
      give rise to three distinct adult pigment cell types: melanophores, iridophores, 
      and xanthophores. By inducing clones in sox10-expressing cells, we trace and
      quantitatively compare the pigment cell progenitors at four stages, from
      embryogenesis to metamorphosis. At all stages, a large fraction of the
      progenitors are multipotent. These multipotent progenitors have a high
      proliferation ability, which diminishes with fate restriction. We suggest that
      multipotency of the nerve-associated progenitors lasting into metamorphosis may
      have facilitated the evolution of adult-specific traits in vertebrates.

AB  - Cell motility is required for diverse biological processes including development,
      homing of immune cells, wound healing, and cancer cell invasion. Motile
      neutrophils exhibit a polarized morphology characterized by the formation of
      leading-edge pseudopods and a highly contractile cell rear known as the uropod.
      Although it is known that perturbing uropod formation impairs neutrophil
      migration, the role of the uropod in cell polarization and motility remains
      incompletely understood. Here we discuss cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate 
      neutrophil polarization and motility, with a focus on the uropod, and examine how
      relationships among regulatory mechanisms change when cells change their
      direction of migration.

AB  - The phagocytic clearance of dying cells in a tissue is a highly orchestrated
      series of intercellular events coordinated by a complex signaling network. Recent
      data from genetic, biochemical, and live-imaging approaches have greatly enhanced
      our understanding of the dynamics of cell clearance and how the process is
      orchestrated at the cellular and tissue levels. We discuss how networks
      regulating apoptotic cell clearance are integrated to enable a rapid, efficient, 
      and high-capacity clearance system within tissues.

AB  - Phagocytes recognize and eliminate pathogens, alert other tissues of impending
      threats, and provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity. They also
      maintain tissue homeostasis, consuming dead cells without causing alarm. The
      receptor engagement, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal rearrangements
      underlying phagocytosis are paradigmatic of other immune responses and bear
      similarities to macropinocytosis and cell migration. We discuss how the
      glycocalyx restricts access to phagocytic receptors, the processes that enable
      receptor engagement and clustering, and the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton 
      that controls the mobility of membrane proteins and lipids and provides the
      mechanical force propelling the phagocyte membrane toward and around the
      phagocytic prey.

AB  - Many phagocyte behaviors, including vascular rolling and adhesion, migration, and
      oxidative bursting, are better measured in seconds or minutes than hours or days.
      Zebrafish is ideally suited for imaging such rapid biology within the intact
      animal. We discuss how this model has revealed unique insights into various
      aspects of phagocyte physiology.

      eliminate excess functional connections between neurons to sculpt neuronal
      circuits during development and throughout adulthood. Understanding how microglia
      recognize and prune synapses during development is providing insight into synapse
      loss and dysfunction in disease.

AB  - Microglia, immune cells of the brain, originate from erythromyeloid precursors,
      far from the central nervous system. Xu et al. (2016) in this issue of
      Developmental Cell and Casano et al. (2016) recently in Cell Reports show that
      apoptotic neurons act as bait to "trap" microglia into colonizing the developing 
      brain.

      Acid and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.

AB  - Crosstalk among phytohormones is crucial for balancing plant growth and
      adjustment to various environments. Abscisic acid (ABA) and brassinosteroids
      (BRs) exhibit antagonistic interactions during many plant development processes, 
      but little is known about the molecular mechanism mediating those interactions.
      Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) remorin gene, OsREM4.1, whose
      expression is upregulated by ABA through the transcriptional activator OsbZIP23. 
      OsREM4.1, in return, negatively regulates BR signaling output. We discovered that
      OsREM4.1 interacts with OsSERK1 to inhibit its interaction with rice BR receptor 
      OsBRI1. Moreover, OsBRI1 could phosphorylate OsREM4.1 to reduce the binding
      affinity of OsREM4.1 to OsSERK1. These results demonstrate that OsREM4.1 is
      transcriptionally regulated by ABA and functions as an OsBRI1 substrate and
      OsSERK1-interacting protein to inhibit the formation and subsequent activation of
      the OsBRI1-OsSERK1 receptor complex. Our findings provide insight into the
      mechanism by which the antagonistic interactions between ABA and BRs are
      coordinated in rice.

AB  - Microglia are CNS-resident macrophages and play important roles in neural
      development and function. However, how microglial precursors born in peripheral
      tissues colonize the CNS remains undefined. Using in vivo imaging and genetic
      manipulation of zebrafish, we showed that microglial precursors enter the optic
      tectum of the midbrain, where the majority of microglia reside during early
      development, via the lateral periphery between the eyes and brain and the ventral
      periphery of the brain in a circulation-independent manner. The colonization of
      the optic tectum by microglial precursors is dynamic and driven by apoptotic
      neuronal death, which occurs naturally in the midbrain during neurogenesis. We
      further show that lysophosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid known to be released
      from apoptotic cells, can promote microglial precursor entry into the brain via
      its cognate receptors grp132b. Our study reveals that microglia colonization of
      developing zebrafish midbrain is triggered by apoptotic neuronal death, possibly 
      via releasing lysophosphatidylcholine.

AB  - N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) represents the most prevalent internal modification 
      on mRNA and requires a multicomponent m(6)A methyltransferase complex in mammals.
      How their plant counterparts determine the global m(6)A modification landscape
      and its molecular link to plant development remain unknown. Here we show that
      FKBP12 INTERACTING PROTEIN 37 KD (FIP37) is a core component of the m(6)A
      methyltransferase complex, which underlies control of shoot stem cell fate in
      Arabidopsis. The mutants lacking FIP37 exhibit massive overproliferation of shoot
      meristems and a transcriptome-wide loss of m(6)A RNA modifications. We further
      demonstrate that FIP37 mediates m(6)A RNA modification on key shoot meristem
      genes inversely correlated with their mRNA stability, thus confining their
      transcript levels to prevent shoot meristem overproliferation. Our results
      suggest an indispensable role of FIP37 in mediating m(6)A mRNA modification,
      which is required for maintaining the shoot meristem as a renewable source for
      continuously producing all aerial organs in plants.

AB  - Autophagy is a cellular degradation process important for neuronal development
      and survival. Neurons are highly polarized cells in which autophagosome
      biogenesis is spatially compartmentalized. The mechanisms and physiological
      importance of this spatial compartmentalization of autophagy in the neuronal
      development of living animals are not well understood. Here we determine that, in
      Caenorhabditis elegans neurons, autophagosomes form near synapses and are
      required for neurodevelopment. We first determine, through unbiased genetic
      screens and systematic genetic analyses, that autophagy is required cell
      autonomously for presynaptic assembly and for axon outgrowth dynamics in specific
      neurons. We observe autophagosome biogenesis in the axon near synapses, and this 
      localization depends on the synaptic vesicle kinesin, KIF1A/UNC-104.
      KIF1A/UNC-104 coordinates localized autophagosome formation by regulating the
      transport of the integral membrane autophagy protein, ATG-9. Our findings
      indicate that autophagy is spatially regulated in neurons through the transport
      of ATG-9 by KIF1A/UNC-104 to regulate neurodevelopment.

AB  - Human preimplantation embryo development involves complex cellular and molecular 
      events that lead to the establishment of three cell lineages in the blastocyst:
      trophectoderm, primitive endoderm, and epiblast. Owing to limited resources of
      biological specimens, our understanding of how the earliest lineage commitments
      are regulated remains narrow. Here, we examined gene expression in 241 individual
      cells from early and late human blastocysts to delineate dynamic gene-expression 
      changes. We distinguished all three lineages and further developed a 3D model of 
      the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in which individual cells were mapped into 
      distinct expression domains. We identified in silico precursors of the epiblast
      and primitive endoderm lineages and revealed a role for MCRS1, TET1, and THAP11
      in epiblast formation and their ability to induce naive pluripotency in vitro.
      Our results highlight the potential of single-cell gene-expression analysis in
      human preimplantation development to instruct human stem cell biology.

TI  - The Intrinsically Disordered Protein Atg13 Mediates Supramolecular Assembly of
      Autophagy Initiation Complexes.

AB  - Autophagosome formation in yeast entails starvation-induced assembly of the
      pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), in which multiple Atg1 complexes (composed of
      Atg1, Atg13, and the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 subcomplex) are initially engaged.
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the multimeric assembly of these
      complexes remain unclear. Using structural and biological techniques, we herein
      demonstrate that Atg13 has a large intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and
      interacts with two distinct Atg17 molecules using two binding regions in the IDR.
      We further reveal that these two binding regions are essential not only for Atg1 
      complex assembly in vitro, but also for PAS organization in vivo. These findings 
      underscore the structural and functional significance of the IDR of Atg13 in
      autophagy initiation: Atg13 provides intercomplex linkages between
      Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes, thereby leading to supramolecular self-assembly of
      Atg1 complexes, in turn accelerating the initial events of autophagy, including
      autophosphorylation of Atg1, recruitment of Atg9 vesicles, and phosphorylation of
      Atg9 by Atg1.

AB  - The Golgi apparatus undergoes a ubiquitin-dependent disassembly and reassembly
      process during each cycle of cell division. Here we report the identification of 
      the Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5 (Syn5) as the ubiquitinated substrate. Syn5 is
      monoubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase HACE1 in early mitosis and
      deubiquitinated by the deubiquitinase VCIP135 in late mitosis. Syn5
      ubiquitination on lysine 270 (K270) in the SNARE domain impairs the interaction
      between Syn5 and the cognate v-SNARE Bet1 but increases its binding to p47, the
      adaptor protein of p97. Expression of the Syn5 K270R mutant in cells impairs
      post-mitotic Golgi reassembly. Therefore, monoubiquitination of Syn5 in early
      mitosis disrupts SNARE complex formation. Subsequently, ubiquitinated Syn5
      recruits p97/p47 to the mitotic Golgi fragments and promotes post-mitotic Golgi
      reassembly upon ubiquitin removal by VCIP135. Overall, this study reveals both
      the substrate and the mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated regulation of Golgi
      membrane dynamics during the cell cycle.

AB  - Noncentrosomal microtubules play an important role in polarizing differentiated
      cells, but little is known about how these microtubules are organized. Here we
      identify the spectraplakin, Short stop (Shot), as the cortical anchor for
      noncentrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) in the Drosophila oocyte.
      Shot interacts with the cortex through its actin-binding domain and recruits the 
      microtubule minus-end-binding protein, Patronin, to form cortical ncMTOCs.
      Shot/Patronin foci do not co-localize with gamma-tubulin, suggesting that they do
      not nucleate new microtubules. Instead, they capture and stabilize existing
      microtubule minus ends, which then template new microtubule growth. Shot/Patronin
      foci are excluded from the oocyte posterior by the Par-1 polarity kinase to
      generate the polarized microtubule network that localizes axis determinants. Both
      proteins also accumulate apically in epithelial cells, where they are required
      for the formation of apical-basal microtubule arrays. Thus, Shot/Patronin ncMTOCs
      may provide a general mechanism for organizing noncentrosomal microtubules in
      differentiated cells.

TI  - Rab10-Mediated Secretion Synergizes with Tissue Movement to Build a Polarized
      Basement Membrane Architecture for Organ Morphogenesis.

AB  - Basement membranes (BMs) are planar protein networks that support epithelial
      function. Regulated changes to BM architecture can also contribute to tissue
      morphogenesis, but how epithelia dynamically remodel their BMs is unknown. In
      Drosophila, elongation of the initially spherical egg chamber correlates with the
      generation of a polarized network of fibrils in its surrounding BM. Here, we use 
      live imaging and genetic manipulations to determine how these fibrils form. BM
      fibrils are assembled from newly synthesized proteins in the pericellular spaces 
      between the egg chamber's epithelial cells and undergo oriented insertion into
      the BM by directed epithelial migration. We find that a Rab10-based secretion
      pathway promotes pericellular BM protein accumulation and fibril formation.
      Finally, by manipulating this pathway, we show that BM fibrillar structure
      influences egg chamber morphogenesis. This work highlights how regulated protein 
      secretion can synergize with tissue movement to build a polarized BM architecture
      that controls tissue shape.

AB  - Here we describe an in vitro primary culture system for Caenorhabditis elegans
      germline stem cells. This culture system was used to identify a bacterial folate 
      as a positive regulator of germ cell proliferation. Folates are a family of
      B-complex vitamins that function in one-carbon metabolism to allow the de novo
      synthesis of amino acids and nucleosides. We show that germ cell proliferation is
      stimulated by the folate 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate-Glun both in vitro and in
      animals. Other folates that can act as vitamins to rescue folate deficiency lack 
      this germ cell stimulatory activity. The bacterial folate precursor
      dihydropteroate also promotes germ cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo,
      despite its inability to promote one-carbon metabolism. The folate receptor
      homolog FOLR-1 is required for the stimulation of germ cells by
      10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate-Glun and dihydropteroate. This work defines a folate
      and folate-related compound as exogenous signals to modulate germ cell
      proliferation.

AB  - Organ sizes and shapes are strikingly reproducible, despite the variable growth
      and division of individual cells within them. To reveal which mechanisms enable
      this precision, we designed a screen for disrupted sepal size and shape
      uniformity in Arabidopsis and identified mutations in the mitochondrial i-AAA
      protease FtsH4. Counterintuitively, through live imaging we observed that
      variability of neighboring cell growth was reduced in ftsh4 sepals. We found that
      regular organ shape results from spatiotemporal averaging of the cellular
      variability in wild-type sepals, which is disrupted in the less-variable cells of
      ftsh4 mutants. We also found that abnormal, increased accumulation of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) in ftsh4 mutants disrupts organ size consistency. In
      wild-type sepals, ROS accumulate in maturing cells and limit organ growth,
      suggesting that ROS are endogenous signals promoting termination of growth. Our
      results demonstrate that spatiotemporal averaging of cellular variability is
      required for precision in organ size.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Chaudhari and colleagues (2016) use a novel 
      method to create an in vitro proliferative cell line from tumorous C. elegans
      germ cells, and in the process discover that bacterial folates act as signals for
      proliferation, independent of their roles as vitamins.

AB  - How do plants make species-specific leaves and flowers with stereotypical size
      and shape? A new study in Developmental Cell finds that local spatiotemporal
      variability in cell growth rate is essential for robustness in organ geometry
      control, and reactive oxygen species act to suppress this local heterogeneity
      during organ maturation.

AB  - The tripartite network of Prdm14, Blimp1, and AP2gamma is essential for the
      important process of germ cell specification, but their precise molecular
      mechanisms of action remain lacking. Tu and colleagues (2016) report in Nature
      that the transcriptional co-repressor CBFA2T2 is an essential interactor protein 
      regulating PRDM14 function, shedding light into the mechanisms directing germline
      formation and pluripotency.

AB  - The vertebrate body plan contains both dorsal and ventral midline structures.
      While dorsal midline structures have been extensively studied, formation of
      ventral midline structures, and how they become aligned with the dorsal midline, 
      is a fundamental aspect of vertebrate development that is poorly understood. This
      study uses the chick dorsal mesentery (DM) as a model for investigating the
      formation of ventral midline structures. We document formation of the DM by
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and medial ingression of the lateral
      plate coelomic lining and show that DM positioning is a fundamentally dynamic
      process regulated by relative levels of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
      signaling in the two sides of the ingressing lateral plate. Disruption of this
      process causes misalignment of the DM and disturbances during initial stages of
      lung morphogenesis. Since the dorsal midline is a source of BMP antagonists,
      these results suggest a mechanism for aligning the dorsal and ventral embryonic
      midlines.

AB  - Steroid hormones control important developmental processes and are linked to many
      diseases. To systematically identify genes and pathways required for steroid
      production, we performed a Drosophila genome-wide in vivo RNAi screen and
      identified 1,906 genes with potential roles in steroidogenesis and developmental 
      timing. Here, we use our screen as a resource to identify mechanisms regulating
      intracellular levels of cholesterol, a substrate for steroidogenesis. We identify
      a conserved fatty acid elongase that underlies a mechanism that adjusts
      cholesterol trafficking and steroidogenesis with nutrition and developmental
      programs. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of an autophagosomal
      cholesterol mobilization mechanism and show that activation of this system
      rescues Niemann-Pick type C1 deficiency that causes a disorder characterized by
      cholesterol accumulation. These cholesterol-trafficking mechanisms are regulated 
      by TOR and feedback signaling that couples steroidogenesis with growth and
      ensures proper maturation timing. These results reveal genes regulating
      steroidogenesis during development that likely modulate disease mechanisms.

      Convert Them to Centrosomes.

AB  - Centrosomes and cilia are organized by a centriole pair comprising an older
      mother and a younger daughter. Centriole numbers are tightly regulated, and
      daughter centrioles (which assemble in S phase) cannot themselves duplicate or
      organize centrosomes until they have passed through mitosis. It is unclear how
      this mitotic "centriole conversion" is regulated, but it requires Plk1/Polo
      kinase. Here we show that in flies, Cdk1 phosphorylates the conserved centriole
      protein Sas-4 during mitosis. This creates a Polo-docking site that helps recruit
      Polo to daughter centrioles and is required for the subsequent recruitment of
      Asterless (Asl), a protein essential for centriole duplication and mitotic
      centrosome assembly. Point mutations in Sas-4 that prevent Cdk1 phosphorylation
      or Polo docking do not block centriole disengagement during mitosis, but block
      efficient centriole conversion and lead to embryonic lethality. These
      observations can explain why daughter centrioles have to pass through mitosis
      before they can duplicate and organize a centrosome.

AB  - It is unclear how regulatory genes establish neural circuits that compose
      sex-specific behaviors. The Drosophila melanogaster male courtship song provides 
      a powerful model to study this problem. Courting males vibrate a wing to sing
      bouts of pulses and hums, called pulse and sine song, respectively. We report the
      discovery of male-specific thoracic interneurons-the TN1A neurons-that are
      required specifically for sine song. The TN1A neurons can drive the activity of a
      sex-non-specific wing motoneuron, hg1, which is also required for sine song. The 
      male-specific connection between the TN1A neurons and the hg1 motoneuron is
      regulated by the sexual differentiation gene doublesex. We find that doublesex is
      required in the TN1A neurons during development to increase the density of the
      TN1A arbors that interact with dendrites of the hg1 motoneuron. Our findings
      demonstrate how a sexual differentiation gene can build a sex-specific circuit
      motif by modulating neuronal arborization.

AB  - Vertebrate ancestors had only cone-like photoreceptors. The duplex retina evolved
      in jawless vertebrates with the advent of highly photosensitive rod-like
      photoreceptors. Despite cones being the arbiters of high-resolution color vision,
      rods emerged as the dominant photoreceptor in mammals during a nocturnal phase
      early in their evolution. We investigated the evolutionary and developmental
      origins of rods in two divergent vertebrate retinas. In mice, we discovered
      genetic and epigenetic vestiges of short-wavelength cones in developing rods, and
      cell-lineage tracing validated the genesis of rods from S cones. Curiously, rods 
      did not derive from S cones in zebrafish. Our study illuminates several questions
      regarding the evolution of duplex retina and supports the hypothesis that, in
      mammals, the S-cone lineage was recruited via the Maf-family transcription factor
      NRL to augment rod photoreceptors. We propose that this developmental mechanism
      allowed the adaptive exploitation of scotopic niches during the nocturnal
      bottleneck early in mammalian evolution.

AB  - Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins function to ensure correct deployment of
      developmental programs by epigenetically repressing target gene expression.
      Despite the importance, few studies have been focused on the regulation of PcG
      activity itself. Here, we report a Drosophila gene, stuxnet (stx), that controls 
      Pc protein stability. We find that heightened stx activity leads to homeotic
      transformation, reduced Pc activity, and de-repression of PcG targets.
      Conversely, stx mutants, which can be rescued by decreased Pc expression, display
      developmental defects resembling hyperactivation of Pc. Our biochemical analyses 
      provide a mechanistic basis for the interaction between stx and Pc; Stx
      facilitates Pc degradation in the proteasome, independent of ubiquitin
      modification. Furthermore, this mode of regulation is conserved in vertebrates.
      Mouse stx promotes degradation of Cbx4, an orthologous Pc protein, in vertebrate 
      cells and induces homeotic transformation in Drosophila. Our results highlight an
      evolutionarily conserved mechanism of regulated protein degradation on PcG
      homeostasis and epigenetic activity.

      actin filaments and myosin motors (actomyosin) that, upon activation, trigger
      ring constriction. Actomyosin ring constriction, in turn, has been implicated in 
      key cellular processes ranging from cytokinesis to wound closure.
      Non-constricting actin ring-like structures also form at cell-cell contacts,
      where they exert a stabilizing function. Here, we review recent studies on the
      formation and function of actin ring-like structures in various morphogenetic
      processes, shedding light on how those different rings have been adapted to
      fulfill their specific roles.

AB  - Mitochondrial genes reside in the nucleus and mitochondria. In a recent paper in 
      Nature, Couvillion et al. (2016) describe their development of a "mitoribosome
      profiling" approach and demonstrate that changes in expression of nuclear- and
      mitochondrial-encoded genes are coordinated at the level of translation during
      metabolic adaptation to fuel source changes.

      Transport.

AB  - Membrane contact sites between the ER and multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVBs) 
      play important roles in endosome positioning and fission and in neurite
      outgrowth. ER-MVB contacts additionally function in epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase downregulation by providing sites where the
      ER-localized phosphatase, PTP1B, interacts with endocytosed EGFR before the
      receptor is sorted onto intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Here we show that these
      contacts are tethered by annexin A1 and its Ca(2+)-dependent ligand, S100A11, and
      form a subpopulation of differentially regulated contact sites between the ER and
      endocytic organelles. Annexin A1-regulated contacts function in the transfer of
      ER-derived cholesterol to the MVB when low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in
      endosomes is low. This sterol traffic depends on interaction between ER-localized
      VAP and endosomal oxysterol-binding protein ORP1L, and is required for the
      formation of ILVs within the MVB and thus for the spatial regulation of EGFR
      signaling.

AB  - Conserved DNA-damage responses (DDRs) sense genome damage and prevent mitosis of 
      broken chromosomes. How cells lacking DDRs cope with broken chromosomes during
      mitosis is poorly understood. DDRs are frequently inactivated in cells with extra
      genomes (polyploidy), suggesting that study of polyploidy can reveal how cells
      with impaired DDRs/genome damage continue dividing. Here, we show that continued 
      division and normal organ development occurs in polyploid, DDR-impaired
      Drosophila papillar cells. As papillar cells become polyploid, they naturally
      accumulate broken acentric chromosomes but do not apoptose/arrest the cell cycle.
      To survive mitosis with acentric chromosomes, papillar cells require Fanconi
      anemia proteins FANCD2 and FANCI, as well as Blm helicase, but not canonical DDR 
      signaling. FANCD2 acts independently of previous S phases to promote alignment
      and segregation of acentric DNA produced by double-strand breaks, thus avoiding
      micronuclei and organ malformation. Because polyploidy and impaired DDRs can
      promote cancer, our findings provide insight into disease-relevant DNA-damage
      tolerance mechanisms.

      Suv39h1-Mediated Centromere Inactivation.

AB  - Centromere chromatin containing histone H3 variant CENP-A is required for
      accurate chromosome segregation as a foundation for kinetochore assembly. Human
      centromere chromatin assembles on a part of the long alpha-satellite (alphoid)
      DNA array, where it is flanked by pericentric heterochromatin. Heterochromatin
      spreads into adjacent chromatin and represses gene expression, and it can
      antagonize centromere function or CENP-A assembly. Here, we demonstrate an
      interaction between CENP-A assembly factor M18BP1 and acetyltransferase
      KAT7/HBO1/MYST2. Knocking out KAT7 in HeLa cells reduced centromeric CENP-A
      assembly. Mitotic chromosome misalignment and micronuclei formation increased in 
      the knockout cells and were enhanced when the histone H3-K9 trimethylase Suv39h1 
      was overproduced. Tethering KAT7 to an ectopic alphoid DNA integration site
      removed heterochromatic H3K9me3 modification and was sufficient to stimulate new 
      CENP-A or histone H3.3 assembly. Thus, KAT7-containing acetyltransferases
      associating with the Mis18 complex provides competence for histone
      turnover/exchange activity on alphoid DNA and prevents Suv39h1-mediated
      heterochromatin invasion into centromeres.

AB  - Cilium formation depends on intraflagellar transport trains that move
      bidirectionally along ciliary microtubules. Reporting in Science, Stepanek and
      Pigino (2016) employ correlative light and electron microscopy in algae to
      determine the ultrastructure of anterograde and retrograde trains and discover
      that these trains avoid collision by running on B- and A-tubules, respectively.

TI  - A Galpha-Stimulated RapGEF Is a Receptor-Proximal Regulator of Dictyostelium
      Chemotaxis.

AB  - Chemotaxis, or directional movement toward extracellular chemical gradients, is
      an important property of cells that is mediated through G-protein-coupled
      receptors (GPCRs). Although many chemotaxis pathways downstream of Gbetagamma
      have been identified, few Galpha effectors are known. Galpha effectors are of
      particular importance because they allow the cell to distinguish signals
      downstream of distinct chemoattractant GPCRs. Here we identify GflB, a Galpha2
      binding partner that directly couples the Dictyostelium cyclic AMP GPCR to Rap1. 
      GflB localizes to the leading edge and functions as a Galpha-stimulated,
      Rap1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor required to balance Ras and Rap 
      signaling. The kinetics of GflB translocation are fine-tuned by GSK-3
      phosphorylation. Cells lacking GflB display impaired Rap1/Ras signaling and actin
      and myosin dynamics, resulting in defective chemotaxis. Our observations
      demonstrate that GflB is an essential upstream regulator of
      chemoattractant-mediated cell polarity and cytoskeletal reorganization
      functioning to directly link Galpha activation to monomeric G-protein signaling.

AB  - Clathrin-coated vesicles form by rapid assembly of discrete coat constituents
      into a cargo-sorting lattice. How the sequential phases of coat construction are 
      choreographed is unclear, but transient protein-protein interactions mediated by 
      short interaction motifs are pivotal. We show that arrayed Asp-Pro-Phe (DPF)
      motifs within the early-arriving endocytic pioneers Eps15/R are differentially
      decoded by other endocytic pioneers Fcho1/2 and AP-2. The structure of an
      Eps15/RFcho1 mu-homology domain complex reveals a spacing-dependent DPF triad,
      bound in a mechanistically distinct way from the mode of single DPF binding to
      AP-2. Using cells lacking FCHO1/2 and with Eps15 sequestered from the plasma
      membrane, we establish that without these two endocytic pioneers, AP-2 assemblies
      are fleeting and endocytosis stalls. Thus, distinct DPF-based codes within the
      unstructured Eps15/R C terminus direct the assembly of temporary
      Fcho1/2Eps15/RAP-2 ternary complexes to facilitate conformational activation of
      AP-2 by the Fcho1/2 interdomain linker to promote AP-2 cargo engagement.

AB  - SnoN regulates multiple signaling pathways, including TGF-beta/Smad and p53, and 
      displays both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities in human cancer. We
      have observed previously that both its intracellular localization and expression 
      levels are sensitive to cell density, suggesting that it may crosstalk with Hippo
      signaling. Here we report that, indeed, SnoN interacts with multiple components
      of the Hippo pathway to inhibit the binding of Lats2 to TAZ and the subsequent
      phosphorylation of TAZ, leading to TAZ stabilization. Consistently, SnoN enhances
      the transcriptional and oncogenic activities of TAZ, and reducing SnoN decreases 
      TAZ expression as well as malignant progression of breast cancer cells.
      Interestingly, SnoN itself is downregulated by Lats2 that is activated by the
      Scribble basolateral polarity protein. Thus, SnoN is a critical component of the 
      Hippo regulatory network that receives signals from the tissue architecture and
      polarity to coordinate the activity of intracellular signaling pathways.

AB  - Cytokine production is a necessary event in the immune response during
      inflammation and is associated with mortality during sepsis, autoimmune
      disorders, cancer, and diabetes. Stress-activated MAP kinase signaling cascades
      that mediate cytokine synthesis are well established. However, the downstream
      fate of cytokines before they are secreted remains elusive. We report that
      pro-inflammatory stimuli lead to recruitment of pericentriolar material,
      specifically pericentrin and gamma-tubulin, to the centrosome. This is
      accompanied by enhanced microtubule nucleation and enrichment of the recycling
      endosome component FIP3, all of which are hallmarks of centrosome maturation
      during mitosis. Intriguingly, centrosome maturation occurs during interphase in
      an MLK-dependent manner, independent of the classic mitotic kinase, Plk1.
      Centrosome disruption by chemical prevention of centriole assembly or genetic
      ablation of pericentrin attenuated interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and MCP1
      secretion, suggesting that the centrosome is critical for cytokine production.
      Our results reveal a function of the centrosome in innate immunity.

AB  - Centrioles are fundamental and evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based
      organelles whose assembly is characterized by microtubule growth rates that are
      orders of magnitude slower than those of cytoplasmic microtubules. Several
      centriolar proteins can interact with tubulin or microtubules, but how they
      ensure the exceptionally slow growth of centriolar microtubules has remained
      mysterious. Here, we bring together crystallographic, biophysical, and
      reconstitution assays to demonstrate that the human centriolar protein CPAP
      (SAS-4 in worms and flies) binds and "caps" microtubule plus ends by associating 
      with a site of beta-tubulin engaged in longitudinal tubulin-tubulin interactions.
      Strikingly, we uncover that CPAP activity dampens microtubule growth and
      stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting catastrophes and promoting rescues. We
      further establish that the capping function of CPAP is important to limit growth 
      of centriolar microtubules in cells. Our results suggest that CPAP acts as a
      molecular lid that ensures slow assembly of centriolar microtubules and, thereby,
      contributes to organelle length control.

AB  - Microtubules play an essential role in breaking cellular symmetry. We have
      previously shown that separase associates with microtubules and regulates
      microtubule-dependent establishment of cell polarity in Arabidopsis. However,
      separase lacks microtubule-binding activity, raising questions about mechanisms
      underlying this phenomenon. Here we report that the N-terminal non-catalytic
      domain of separase binds to the C-terminal tail domain of three homologs of the
      centromeric protein CENP-E Kinesin 7 (Kin7). Conformational changes of Kin7
      induced upon binding to separase facilitate recruitment of Kin7/separase complex 
      (KISC) onto microtubules. KISC operates independently of proteolytic activity of 
      separase in promoting microtubule rescue and pauses, as well as in suppressing
      catastrophes. Genetic complementation experiments in conditional separase mutant 
      rsw4 background demonstrate the importance of KISC for the establishment of cell 
      polarity and for plant development. Our study establishes a mechanism governing
      microtubule dynamics via the separase-dependent activation of CENP-E-related
      kinesins.

AB  - Although autophagy controls cell death and survival, underlying mechanisms are
      poorly understood, and it is unknown whether autophagy affects only whether or
      not cells die or also controls other aspects of programmed cell death. MAP3K7 is 
      a tumor suppressor gene associated with poor disease-free survival in prostate
      cancer. Here, we report that Map3k7 deletion in mouse prostate cells sensitizes
      to cell death by TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Surprisingly,
      this death occurs primarily through necroptosis, not apoptosis, due to assembly
      of the necrosome in association with the autophagy machinery, mediated by
      p62/SQSTM1 recruitment of RIPK1. The mechanism of cell death switches to
      apoptosis if p62-dependent recruitment of the necrosome to the autophagy
      machinery is blocked. These data show that the autophagy machinery can control
      the mechanism of programmed cell death by serving as a scaffold rather than by
      degrading cargo.

AB  - Autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) plays an important role in maintaining
      lysosome homeostasis. During ALR, lysosomes are reformed by recycling lysosomal
      components from autolysosomes. The most noticeable step of ALR is autolysosome
      tubulation, but it is currently unknown how the process is regulated. Here, using
      an approach combining in vivo studies and in vitro reconstitution, we found that 
      the kinesin motor protein KIF5B is required for autolysosome tubulation and that 
      KIF5B drives autolysosome tubulation by pulling on the autolysosomal membrane.
      Furthermore, we show that KIF5B directly interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Kinesin
      motors are recruited and clustered on autolysosomes via interaction with
      PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a clathrin-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that
      clathrin promotes formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2-enriched microdomains, which are
      required for clustering of KIF5B. Our study reveals a mechanism by which
      autolysosome tubulation was generated.

AB  - The generation and shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes
      and microvesicles (MVs), by cells has emerged as a form of intercellular
      communication with important roles in several physiological processes and
      diseases such as cancer. These membrane-enclosed packets can transfer specific
      proteins, RNA transcripts, microRNAs, and even DNA to target cells, thereby
      altering their function. Despite the exponential growth of the EV field, a great 
      deal remains unclear about the mechanisms that regulate exosome and MV
      biogenesis, as well as about how to isolate different classes of EVs and how to
      best take advantage of them for clinical applications.

AB  - The Arabidopsis separase homolog, AtESP, associates with microtubules and affects
      cell polarity but does not bind microtubules directly. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Moschou et al. (2016) show that AtESP teams up with the
      CENP-E kinesin Kin7 to promote microtubule stabilization, an activity independent
      of separase proteolytic activity.

AB  - An outstanding challenge in biology is to elucidate the mechanisms that establish
      and limit organelle structure and size. In this issue of Developmental Cell,
      Sharma et al. (2016) report how a conserved centriole protein dynamically caps
      centriole microtubule plus ends to limit the organelle's length.

AB  - Macroautophagy facilitates degradation of cellular constituents and can
      positively or negatively affect cell death depending on the context. In this
      issue of Developmental Cell, Goodall and colleagues (2016) add to this complexity
      by showing that autophagy regulators can determine not only cell viability, but
      also the mechanism by which cells die.

      mTORC2.

AB  - Components of the evolutionarily conserved developmental planar cell polarity
      (PCP) pathway were recently described to play a prominent role in cancer cell
      dissemination. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PCP molecules drive the
      spread of cancer cells remain largely unknown. PRICKLE1 encodes a PCP protein
      bound to the promigratory serine/threonine kinase MINK1. We identify RICTOR, a
      member of the mTORC2 complex, as a PRICKLE1-binding partner and show that the
      integrity of the PRICKLE1-MINK1-RICTOR complex is required for activation of AKT,
      regulation of focal adhesions, and cancer cell migration. Disruption of the
      PRICKLE1-RICTOR interaction results in a strong impairment of breast cancer cell 
      dissemination in xenograft assays. Finally, we show that upregulation of PRICKLE1
      in basal breast cancers, a subtype characterized by high metastatic potential, is
      associated with poor metastasis-free survival.

AB  - Cells store membrane in surface reservoirs of pits and protrusions. These
      membrane reservoirs facilitate cell shape change and buffer mechanical stress,
      but we do not know how reservoir dynamics are regulated. During cellularization, 
      the first cytokinesis in Drosophila embryos, a reservoir of microvilli unfolds to
      fuel cleavage furrow ingression. We find that regulated exocytosis adds membrane 
      to the reservoir before and during unfolding. Dynamic F-actin deforms exocytosed 
      membrane into microvilli. Single microvilli extend and retract in approximately
      20 s, while the overall reservoir is depleted in sync with furrow ingression over
      60-70 min. Using pharmacological and genetic perturbations, we show that
      exocytosis promotes microvillar F-actin assembly, while furrow ingression
      controls microvillar F-actin disassembly. Thus, reservoir F-actin and,
      consequently, reservoir dynamics are regulated by membrane supply from exocytosis
      and membrane demand from furrow ingression.

TI  - Inheritance of a Nuclear PIWI from Pluripotent Stem Cells by Somatic Descendants 
      Ensures Differentiation by Silencing Transposons in Planarian.
PG  - 226-37

AB  - Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) requires transposon silencing
      throughout the process. PIWIs, best known as key factors in germline transposon
      silencing, are also known to act in somatic differentiation of planarian PSCs
      (neoblasts). However, how PIWIs control the latter process remains elusive. Here,
      using Dugesia japonica, we show that a nuclear PIWI, DjPiwiB, was bound to
      PIWI-interacting RNAs (generally key mediators of PIWI-dependent transposon
      silencing), and was detected in not only neoblasts but also their descendant
      somatic cells, which do not express piwi. In contrast, cytoplasmic DjPiwiA and
      DjPiwiC were detected only in neoblasts, in accord with their transcription
      there. DjPiwiB was indispensable for regeneration, but dispensable for transposon
      silencing in neoblasts. However, transposons were derepressed at the onset of
      differentiation in DjPiwiB-knockdown planarians. Thus, DjPiwiB appears to be
      inherited by descendant somatic cells of neoblasts to ensure transposon silencing
      in those cells, which are unable to produce PIWI proteins.

AB  - Radial intercalation is a fundamental process responsible for the thinning of
      multilayered tissues during large-scale morphogenesis; however, its molecular
      mechanism has remained elusive. Using amphibian epiboly, the thinning and
      spreading of the animal hemisphere during gastrulation, here we provide evidence 
      that radial intercalation is driven by chemotaxis of cells toward the external
      layer of the tissue. This role of chemotaxis in tissue spreading and thinning is 
      unlike its typical role associated with large-distance directional movement of
      cells. We identify the chemoattractant as the complement component C3a, a factor 
      normally linked with the immune system. The mechanism is explored by
      computational modeling and tested in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro. This mechanism 
      is robust against fluctuations of chemoattractant levels and expression patterns 
      and explains expansion during epiboly. This study provides insight into the
      fundamental process of radial intercalation and could be applied to a wide range 
      of morphogenetic events.

AB  - Different plant species flower in different seasons, but there is also annual
      variability depending on environmental conditions. In this issue of Developmental
      Cell, Hyun et al. (2016) show that Arabidopsis plants can flower without proper
      seasonal cues if they have developed past the juvenile phase and have high levels
      of gibberellin.

      lymphocyte subtypes. In a recent report in Nature, Verbist et al. (2016) describe
      how a regulatory loop acting between metabolic and transcriptional programs,
      centered around the asymmetric cell division machinery and the proto-oncogene
      c-Myc, establishes distinct T cell fates.

TI  - Multi-layered Regulation of SPL15 and Cooperation with SOC1 Integrate Endogenous 
      Flowering Pathways at the Arabidopsis Shoot Meristem.

AB  - Flowering is initiated in response to environmental and internal cues that are
      integrated at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). We show that SPL15 coordinates the
      basal floral promotion pathways required for flowering of Arabidopsis in
      non-inductive environments. SPL15 directly activates transcription of the floral 
      regulators FUL and miR172b in the SAM during floral induction, whereas its
      paralog SPL9 is expressed later on the flanks of the SAM. The capacity of SPL15
      to promote flowering is regulated by age through miR156, which targets SPL15
      mRNA, and gibberellin (GA), which releases SPL15 from DELLAs. Furthermore, SPL15 
      and the MADS-box protein SOC1 cooperate to promote transcription of their target 
      genes. SPL15 recruits RNAPII and MED18, a Mediator complex component, in a
      GA-dependent manner, while SOC1 facilitates active chromatin formation with the
      histone demethylase REF6. Thus, we present a molecular basis for assimilation of 
      flowering signals and transcriptional control at the SAM during flowering.

AB  - In extant species, bone formation is restricted to vertebrate species.
      Sp7/Osterix is a key transcriptional determinant of bone-secreting osteoblasts.
      We performed Sp7 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis identifying a 
      large set of predicted osteoblast enhancers and validated a subset of these in
      cell culture and transgenic mouse assays. Sp family members bind GC-rich target
      sequences through their zinc finger domain. Several lines of evidence suggest
      that Sp7 acts differently, engaging osteoblast targets in Dlx-containing
      regulatory complexes bound to AT-rich motifs. Amino acid differences in the Sp7
      zinc finger domain reduce Sp7's affinity for the Sp family consensus GC-box
      target; Dlx5 binding maps to this domain of Sp7. The data support a model in
      which Dlx recruitment of Sp7 to osteoblast enhancers underlies Sp7-directed
      osteoblast specification. Because an Sp7-like zinc finger variant is restricted
      to vertebrates, the emergence of an Sp7 member within the Sp family was likely
      closely coupled to the evolution of bone-forming vertebrates.

AB  - Segregation of functional organelles during the cell cycle is crucial to generate
      healthy daughter cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ER stress causes an ER
      inheritance block to ensure cells inherit a functional ER. Here, we report that
      formation of tubular ER in the mother cell, the first step in ER inheritance,
      depends on functional symmetry between the cortical ER (cER) and perinuclear ER
      (pnER). ER stress induces functional asymmetry, blocking tubular ER formation and
      ER inheritance. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we show that
      the ER chaperone Kar2/BiP fused to GFP and an ER membrane reporter, Hmg1-GFP,
      behave differently in the cER and pnER. The functional asymmetry and tubular ER
      formation depend on Reticulons/Yop1, which maintain ER structure. LUNAPARK1
      deletion in rtn1Deltartn2Deltayop1Delta cells restores the pnER/cER functional
      asymmetry, tubular ER generation, and ER inheritance blocks. Thus,
      Reticulon/Yop1-dependent changes in ER structure are linked to ER inheritance
      during the yeast cell cycle.

      Iron-Deficiency Responses.

AB  - Iron is an essential element for most living organisms. Plants acquire iron from 
      the rhizosphere and have evolved different biochemical and developmental
      responses to adapt to a low-iron environment. In Arabidopsis, FIT encodes a basic
      helix-loop-helix transcription factor that activates the expression of
      iron-uptake genes in root epidermis upon iron deficiency. Here, we report that
      the gibberellin (GA)-signaling DELLA repressors contribute substantially in the
      adaptive responses to iron-deficient conditions. When iron availability
      decreases, DELLAs accumulate in the root meristem, thereby restraining root
      growth, while being progressively excluded from epidermal cells in the root
      differentiation zone. Such DELLA exclusion from the site of iron acquisition
      relieves FIT from DELLA-dependent inhibition and therefore promotes iron uptake. 
      Consistent with this mechanism, expression of a non-GA-degradable DELLA mutant
      protein in root epidermis interferes with iron acquisition. Hence, spatial
      distribution of DELLAs in roots is essential to fine-tune the adaptive responses 
      to iron availability.

PG  - 174-189
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2016.03.023 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria play central roles in buffering intracellular Ca(2)(+) transients.
      While basal mitochondrial Ca(2)(+) (Ca(2)(+) mito) is needed to maintain
      organellar physiology, Ca(2)(+) mito overload can lead to cell death. How
      Ca(2)(+) mito homeostasis is regulated is not well understood. Here we show that 
      Miro, a known component of the mitochondrial transport machinery, regulates
      Drosophila neural stem cell (NSC) development through Ca(2)(+) mito homeostasis
      control, independent of its role in mitochondrial transport. Miro interacts with 
      Ca(2)(+) transporters at the ER-mitochondria contact site (ERMCS). Its
      inactivation causes Ca(2)(+) mito depletion and metabolic impairment, whereas its
      overexpression results in Ca(2)(+) mito overload, mitochondrial morphology
      change, and apoptotic response. Both conditions impaired NSC lineage progression.
      Ca(2)(+) mito homeostasis is influenced by Polo-mediated phosphorylation of a
      conserved residue in Miro, which positively regulates Miro localization to, and
      the integrity of, ERMCS. Our results elucidate a regulatory mechanism underlying 
      Ca(2)(+) mito homeostasis and how its dysregulation may affect NSC
      metabolism/development and contribute to disease.

AB  - Membrane remodeling by BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, RVS) domain-containing proteins,
      such as endophilins and amphiphysins, is integral to the process of endocytosis. 
      However, little is known about the regulation of endocytic BAR domain activity.
      We have identified an interaction between the yeast Rvs167 N-BAR domain and
      calmodulin. Calmodulin-binding mutants of Rvs167 exhibited defects in endocytic
      vesicle release. In vitro, calmodulin enhanced membrane tubulation and
      constriction by wild-type Rvs167 but not calmodulin-binding-defective mutants. A 
      subset of mammalian N-BAR domains bound calmodulin, and co-expression of
      calmodulin with endophilin A2 potentiated tubulation in vivo. These studies
      reveal a conserved role for calmodulin in regulating the intrinsic
      membrane-sculpting activity of endocytic N-BAR domains.

AB  - During neurulation of chordate ascidians, the 11th mitotic division within the
      epidermal layer shows a posterior-to-anterior wave that is precisely coordinated 
      with the unidirectional progression of the morphogenetic movement. Here we show
      that the first sign of this patterned mitosis is an asynchronous
      anterior-to-posterior S-phase length and that mitotic synchrony is reestablished 
      by a compensatory asynchronous G2-phase length. Live imaging combined with
      genetic experiments demonstrated that compensatory G2-phase regulation requires
      transcriptional activation of the G2/M regulator cdc25 by the patterning genes
      GATA and AP-2. The downregulation of GATA and AP-2 at the onset of neurulation
      leads to loss of compensatory G2-phase regulation and promotes the transition to 
      patterned mitosis. We propose that such developmentally regulated cell-cycle
      compensation provides an abrupt switch to spatially patterned mitosis in order to
      achieve the coordination between mitotic timing and morphogenesis.

      Drosophila Species.

AB  - Centromeres mediate the conserved process of chromosome segregation, yet
      centromeric DNA and the centromeric histone, CENP-A, are rapidly evolving. The
      rapid evolution of Drosophila CENP-A loop 1 (L1) is thought to modulate the
      DNA-binding preferences of CENP-A to counteract centromere drive, the
      preferential transmission of chromosomes with expanded centromeric satellites.
      Consistent with this model, CENP-A from Drosophila bipectinata (bip) cannot
      localize to Drosophila melanogaster (mel) centromeres. We show that this result
      is due to the inability of the mel CENP-A chaperone, CAL1, to deposit bip CENP-A 
      into chromatin. Co-expression of bip CENP-A and bip CAL1 in mel cells restores
      centromeric localization, and similar findings apply to other Drosophila species.
      We identify two co-evolving regions, CENP-A L1 and the CAL1 N terminus, as
      critical for lineage-specific CENP-A incorporation. Collectively, our data show
      that the rapid evolution of L1 modulates CAL1-mediated CENP-A assembly,
      suggesting an alternative mechanism for the suppression of centromere drive.

AB  - Anatomical proportions are robustly maintained in individuals that vary
      enormously in size, both within a species and between members of related taxa.
      However, the mechanisms underlying scaling are still poorly understood. We have
      examined this phenomenon in the context of the patterning of the ventral neural
      tube in response to a gradient of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (SHH) in the chick
      and zebra finch, two species that differ in size during the time of neural tube
      patterning. We find that scaling is achieved, at least in part, by altering the
      sensitivity of the target cells to SHH and appears to be achieved by modulating
      the ratio of the repressive and activating transcriptional regulators, GLI2 and
      GLI3. This mechanism contrasts with previous experimental and theoretical
      analyses of morphogenic scaling that have focused on compensatory changes in the 
      morphogen gradient itself.

AB  - Formation of new blood vessels in tumors, a process termed tumor angiogenesis, is
      a crucial step during oncogenic progression. Blocking tumor angiogenesis is
      therefore expected to have a profound impact on tumor growth. It took several
      decades of collective efforts to translate this intriguing idea into tangible
      clinical benefit. Today, anti-angiogenesis agents represent standard-of-care
      therapies for multiple types of cancers, and the clinical experience has taught
      us many lessons about the concept and application of anti-angiogenesis. This
      Perspective is an attempt to summarize these lessons and how they can be
      leveraged to improve anti-angiogenesis therapy.

AB  - An outstanding question in embryogenesis is how different-sized animals maintain 
      similarly proportioned body plans. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Uygur et 
      al. (2016) tackle this issue in the context of neural tube patterning,
      discovering that differential sensitivity to the Hedgehog pathway may provide one
      answer to this fundamental issue.

AB  - A directional wave of mitosis, progressing posterior to anterior across the
      epidermis, is important for neural tube closure in the invertebrate chordate
      Ciona intestinalis. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Ogura and Sasakura
      (2016) show that the patterning of this wave unexpectedly has complex origins in 
      the previous cell cycle.

AB  - How cells avoid excessive caspase activity and unwanted cell death during
      apoptotic caspase-mediated removal of large cellular structures is poorly
      understood. We investigate caspase-mediated extrusion of spermatid cytoplasmic
      contents in Drosophila during spermatid individualization. We show that a Krebs
      cycle component, the ATP-specific form of the succinyl-CoA synthetase beta
      subunit (A-Sbeta), binds to and activates the Cullin-3-based ubiquitin ligase
      (CRL3) complex required for caspase activation in spermatids. In vitro and in
      vivo evidence suggests that this interaction occurs on the mitochondrial surface,
      thereby limiting the source of CRL3 complex activation to the vicinity of this
      organelle and reducing the potential rate of caspase activation by at least 60%. 
      Domain swapping between A-Sbeta and the GTP-specific SCSbeta (G-Sbeta), which
      functions redundantly in the Krebs cycle, show that the metabolic and structural 
      roles of A-Sbeta in spermatids can be uncoupled, highlighting a moonlighting
      function of this Krebs cycle component in CRL activation.

AB  - Samans et al. (2014) reported the enrichment of nucleosomes in human and bovine
      spermatozoa at centromere repeats and retrotransposon sequences such as LINE-1
      and SINE. We demonstrate here that nucleosomal enrichments at repetitive
      sequences as reported result from bioinformatic analyses that make redundant use 
      of sequencing reads that map to multiple locations in the genome. To illustrate
      that this computational approach is flawed, we observed comparable artificial
      enrichments at repetitive sequences when aligning control genomic DNA or
      simulated reads of uniform genome coverage. These results imply that the main
      conclusions of the article by Samans et al. (2014) are confounded by an
      inappropriate computational methodology used to analyze the primary data.

AB  - The steady-state airway epithelium has a low rate of stem cell turnover but can
      nevertheless mount a rapid proliferative response following injury. This suggests
      a mechanism to restrain proliferation at steady state. One such mechanism has
      been identified in skeletal muscle in which pro-proliferative FGFR1 signaling is 
      antagonized by SPRY1 to maintain satellite cell quiescence. Surprisingly, we
      found that deletion of Fgfr1 or Spry2 in basal cells of the adult mouse trachea
      caused an increase in steady-state proliferation. We show that in airway basal
      cells, SPRY2 is post-translationally modified in response to FGFR1 signaling.
      This allows SPRY2 to inhibit intracellular signaling downstream of other receptor
      tyrosine kinases and restrain basal cell proliferation. An FGFR1-SPRY2 signaling 
      axis has previously been characterized in cell lines in vitro. We now demonstrate
      an in vivo biological function of this interaction and thus identify an active
      signaling mechanism that maintains quiescence in the airway epithelium.

AB  - The assembly of microtubule-based cellular structures depends on regulated
      tubulin polymerization and directional transport. Here, we purify and
      characterize tubulin heterodimers that have human beta-tubulin isotype III
      (TUBB3), as well as heterodimers with one of two beta-tubulin mutations (D417H or
      R262H). Both point mutations are proximal to the kinesin-binding site and have
      been linked to an ocular motility disorder in humans. Compared to wild-type,
      microtubules with these mutations have decreased catastrophe frequencies and
      increased average lifetimes of plus- and minus-end-stabilizing caps. Importantly,
      the D417H mutation does not alter microtubule lattice structure or Mal3 binding
      to growing filaments. Instead, this mutation reduces the affinity of tubulin for 
      TOG domains and colchicine, suggesting that the distribution of tubulin
      heterodimer conformations is changed. Together, our findings reveal how residues 
      on the surface of microtubules, distal from the GTP-hydrolysis site and
      inter-subunit contacts, can alter polymerization dynamics at the plus- and
      minus-ends of microtubules.

      Steady-State and Apoptotic Adherens Junctions.

AB  - In this study we sought to identify how contractility at adherens junctions
      influences apoptotic cell extrusion. We first found that the generation of
      effective contractility at steady-state junctions entails a process of
      architectural reorganization whereby filaments that are initially generated as
      poorly organized networks of short bundles are then converted into co-aligned
      perijunctional bundles. Reorganization requires coronin 1B, which is recruited to
      junctions by E-cadherin adhesion and is necessary to establish contractile
      tension at the zonula adherens. When cells undergo apoptosis within an epithelial
      monolayer, coronin 1B is also recruited to the junctional cortex at the
      apoptotic/neighbor cell interface in an E-cadherin-dependent fashion to support
      actin architectural reorganization, contractility, and extrusion. We propose that
      contractile stress transmitted from the apoptotic cell through E-cadherin
      adhesions elicits a mechanosensitive response in neighbor cells that is necessary
      for the morphogenetic event of apoptotic extrusion to occur.

TI  - SETD7 Controls Intestinal Regeneration and Tumorigenesis by Regulating
      Wnt/beta-Catenin and Hippo/YAP Signaling.

AB  - Intestinal tumorigenesis is a result of mutations in signaling pathways that
      control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in the
      Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are associated with the majority of intestinal cancers, 
      while dysregulation of the Hippo/Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) pathway is an
      emerging regulator of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, these closely
      related pathways play a central role during intestinal regeneration. We have
      previously shown that methylation of the Hippo transducer YAP by the lysine
      methyltransferase SETD7 controls its subcellular localization and function. We
      now show that SETD7 is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis and
      regeneration. Mechanistically, SETD7 is part of a complex containing YAP, AXIN1, 
      and beta-catenin, and SETD7-dependent methylation of YAP facilitates Wnt-induced 
      nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Collectively, these results define a
      methyltransferase-dependent regulatory mechanism that links the Wnt/beta-catenin 
      and Hippo/YAP pathways during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis.

AB  - Since the discovery of double fertilization, it has been recognized that
      flowering plants produce two highly dimorphic female gametes, the egg cell and
      central cell. These give rise, respectively, to the embryo and the endosperm, a
      nourishing tissue unique to flowering plants. Here we show that in Arabidopsis,
      endosperm formation requires the CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT 1 (CKI1) histidine kinase,
      an activator of the cytokinin signaling pathway, which specifies central cells
      and restricts egg cell fate. Dimorphism of the two adjacent gametes is
      mechanistically established in the syncytial embryo sac by spatially restricted
      CKI1 expression, followed by translocation of ER-localized CKI1 protein via
      nuclear migration. Cell specification by CKI1 likely involves activation of the
      cytokinin signaling pathway mediated by histidine phosphotransferases. Ectopic
      CKI1 expression generates non-propagating seeds with dual fertilized endosperms
      and no embryos. We conclude that CKI1-directed specification of the endosperm
      precursor central cell results in seeds containing an embryo and an endosperm.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative
      disease induced by mutations in the voltage-dependent Kv3.3 potassium channel.
      Recently in Cell, Zhang et al. (2016) provide new insights into how
      Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization modulates both Kv3.3 activity and its
      ability to stimulate actin polymerization via Hax-1.

AB  - Drosophila germ cell specification depends on localization of mRNAs required for 
      patterning to the posterior of the oocyte during oogenesis. In a recent issue of 
      Nature, Vourekas et al. (2016) suggest that Aubergine in complex with piRNAs may 
      provide a low-specificity anchoring mechanism for posterior mRNAs.

AB  - Epithelial cells transmit contractile force with adherens junctions to mediate
      morphological changes like the extrusion of apoptotic cells. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Michael and colleagues (2016) show that the actin binding
      protein Coronin plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and
      association with junctions to promote contractility.

AB  - Gastrulation of the mouse embryo entails progressive restriction of lineage
      potency and the organization of the lineage progenitors into a body plan. Here we
      performed a high-resolution RNA sequencing analysis on single mid-gastrulation
      mouse embryos to collate a spatial transcriptome that correlated with the
      regionalization of cell fates in the embryo. 3D rendition of the quantitative
      data enabled the visualization of the spatial pattern of all expressing genes in 
      the epiblast in a digital whole-mount in situ format. The dataset also identified
      genes that (1) are co-expressed in a specific cell population, (2) display
      similar global pattern of expression, (3) have lineage markers, (4) mark domains 
      of transcriptional and signaling activity associated with cell fates, and (5) can
      be used as zip codes for mapping the position of single cells isolated from the
      mid-gastrula stage embryo and the embryo-derived stem cells to the equivalent
      epiblast cells for delineating their prospective cell fates.

AB  - Current fate mapping and imaging platforms are limited in their ability to
      capture dynamic behaviors of epithelial cells. To deconstruct regenerating adult 
      epithelial tissue at single-cell resolution, we created a multicolor system,
      skinbow, that barcodes the superficial epithelial cell (SEC) population of
      zebrafish skin with dozens of distinguishable tags. With image analysis to
      directly segment and simultaneously track hundreds of SECs in vivo over entire
      surface lifetimes, we readily quantified the orchestration of cell emergence,
      growth, repositioning, and loss under homeostatic conditions and after
      exfoliation or appendage amputation. We employed skinbow-based imaging in
      conjunction with a live reporter of epithelial stem cell cycle activity and as an
      instrument to evaluate the effects of reactive oxygen species on SEC behavior
      during epithelial regeneration. Our findings introduce a platform for
      large-scale, quantitative in vivo imaging of regenerating skin and reveal
      unanticipated collective dynamism in epithelial cell size, mobility, and
      interactions.

AB  - We present simple and efficient methods for creating heritable modifications of
      the zebrafish genome. Precisely modified alleles are generated by homologous
      recombination between the host genome and dsDNA donor molecules, stimulated by
      the induction of chromosomally targeted double-strand breaks. Several
      kilobase-long tracts of genome sequence can be replaced. Tagging donor sequences 
      with reporter genes that can be subsequently excised improves recovery of edited 
      alleles by an order of magnitude and facilitates recovery of recessive and
      phenotypically silent conditional mutations. We generate and demonstrate
      functionality of (1) alleles with a single codon change, (2) an allele encoding
      an epitope-tagged version of an endogenous protein, (3) alleles expressing
      reporter proteins, and (4) a conditional allele in which an exon is flanked by
      recombinogenic loxP sites. Our methods make recovery of a broad range of genome
      editing events very practicable, significantly advancing applicability of the
      zebrafish for studying normal biological processes and modeling diseases.

AB  - The neocortex contains glutamatergic excitatory neurons and gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory interneurons. Extensive studies have revealed
      substantial insights into excitatory neuron production. However, our knowledge of
      the generation of GABAergic interneurons remains limited. Here we show that
      periventricular blood vessels selectively influence neocortical interneuron
      progenitor behavior and neurogenesis. Distinct from those in the dorsal
      telencephalon, radial glial progenitors (RGPs) in the ventral telencephalon
      responsible for producing neocortical interneurons progressively grow radial
      glial fibers anchored to periventricular vessels. This progenitor-vessel
      association is robust and actively maintained as RGPs undergo interkinetic
      nuclear migration and divide at the ventricular zone surface. Disruption of this 
      association by selective removal of INTEGRIN beta1 in RGPs leads to a decrease in
      progenitor division, a loss of PARVALBUMIN and SOMATOSTATIN-expressing
      interneurons, and defective synaptic inhibition in the neocortex. These results
      highlight a prominent interaction between RGPs and periventricular vessels
      important for proper production and function of neocortical interneurons.

AB  - KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) are early embryonic controllers 
      of transposable elements (TEs), which they repress with their cofactor KAP1
      through histone and DNA methylation, a process thought to result in irreversible 
      silencing. Using a target-centered functional screen, we matched murine TEs with 
      their cognate KRAB-ZFP. We found the paralogs ZFP932 and Gm15446 to bind
      overlapping but distinguishable subsets of ERVK (endogenous retrovirus K),
      repress these elements in embryonic stem cells, and regulate secondarily the
      expression of neighboring genes. Most importantly, we uncovered that these
      KRAB-ZFPs and KAP1 control TEs in adult tissues, in cell culture and in vivo,
      where they partner up to modulate cellular genes. Therefore, TEs and KRAB-ZFPs
      establish transcriptional networks that likely regulate not only development but 
      also many physiological events. Given the high degree of species specificity of
      TEs and KRAB-ZFPs, these results have important implications for understanding
      the biology of higher vertebrates, including humans.

AB  - Animal development is a complex and dynamic process orchestrated by exquisitely
      timed cell lineage commitment, divisions, migration, and morphological changes at
      the single-cell level. In the past decade, extensive genetic, stem cell, and
      genomic studies provided crucial insights into molecular underpinnings and the
      functional importance of genetic pathways governing various cellular
      differentiation processes. However, it is still largely unknown how the precise
      coordination of these pathways is achieved at the whole-organism level and how
      the highly regulated spatiotemporal choreography of development is established in
      turn. Here, we discuss the latest technological advances in imaging and
      single-cell genomics that hold great promise for advancing our understanding of
      this intricate process. We propose an integrated approach that combines such
      methods to quantitatively decipher in vivo cellular dynamic behaviors and their
      underlying molecular mechanisms at the systems level with single-cell,
      single-molecule resolution.

AB  - Cells respond to the mechanical properties of their environment, but how
      biomechanics contributes to intercellular signaling remains unclear. Reporting in
      Cell, Basu et al. (2016) showed that forces exerted by cytotoxic T lymphocytes
      enhance the function of the pore-forming protein perforin, thereby leading to
      more effective target cell killing.

AB  - Transposable element (TE) silencing is initiated early in mammalian development
      and maintained during somatic differentiation. Reporting in this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Ecco et al. (2016) show that in somatic tissues, TE
      regulation, and its subsequent effect on host gene transcription, is dynamic
      rather than locked in a silent state.

AB  - A century ago, Oscar Hertwig discovered that cells orient their cleavage plane
      orthogonal to their long axis. Reporting recently in Nature, Bosveld et al.
      (2016) shed light on how, showing that NuMA/Mud localization at tricellular
      junctions provides mitotic cells with the memory of interphase shape used to
      orient cleavage plane.

AB  - In the vertebrate neural tube, a morphogen-induced transcriptional network
      produces multiple molecularly distinct progenitor domains, each generating
      different neuronal subtypes. Using an in vitro differentiation system, we defined
      gene expression signatures of distinct progenitor populations and identified
      direct gene-regulatory inputs corresponding to locations of specific
      transcription factor binding. Combined with targeted perturbations of the
      network, this revealed a mechanism in which a progenitor identity is installed by
      active repression of the entire transcriptional programs of other neural
      progenitor fates. In the ventral neural tube, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling,
      together with broadly expressed transcriptional activators, concurrently
      activates the gene expression programs of several domains. The specific outcome
      is selected by repressive input provided by Shh-induced transcription factors
      that act as the key nodes in the network, enabling progenitors to adopt a single 
      definitive identity from several initially permitted options. Together, the data 
      suggest design principles relevant to many developing tissues.

AB  - RNA-binding Fox (Rbfox) proteins have well-established roles in regulating
      alternative splicing, but specific Rbfox isoforms lack nuclear localization
      signals and accumulate in the cytoplasm. The potential splicing-independent
      functions of these proteins remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that cytoplasmic 
      Drosophila Rbfox1 regulates germ cell development and represses the translation
      of mRNAs containing (U)GCAUG elements within their 3'UTRs. During germline cyst
      differentiation, Rbfox1 targets pumilio mRNA for destabilization and
      translational silencing, thereby promoting germ cell development. Mis-expression 
      of pumilio results in the formation of germline tumors, which contain cysts that 
      break down and dedifferentiate back to single, mitotically active cells.
      Together, these results reveal that cytoplasmic Rbfox family members regulate the
      translation of specific target mRNAs. In the Drosophila ovary, this activity
      provides a genetic barrier that prevents germ cells from reverting back to an
      earlier developmental state. The finding that Rbfox proteins regulate mRNA
      translation has implications for Rbfox-related diseases.

AB  - For muscles to function, myofibers have to stretch and anchor at the myotendinous
      junction (MTJ), a region rich in extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin signaling
      is required for MTJ formation, and mutations affecting the cascade lead to
      muscular dystrophies in mice and humans. Underlying mechanisms for integrin
      activation at the MTJ and ECM modifications regulating its signaling are unclear.
      We show that lysyl oxidase-like 3 (LoxL3) is a key regulator of integrin
      signaling that ensures localized control of the cascade. In LoxL3 mutants,
      myofibers anchor prematurely or overshoot to adjacent somites, and are loose and 
      lack tension. We find that LoxL3 complexes with and directly oxidizes Fibronectin
      (FN), an ECM scaffold protein and integrin ligand enriched at the MTJ. We
      identify a mechanism whereby localized LoxL3 secretion from myofiber termini
      oxidizes FN, enabling enhanced integrin activation at the tips of myofibers and
      ensuring correct positioning and anchoring of myofibers along the MTJ.

AB  - Cells must duplicate their mass in order to proliferate. Glucose and glutamine
      are the major nutrients consumed by proliferating mammalian cells, but the extent
      to which these and other nutrients contribute to cell mass is unknown. We
      quantified the fraction of cell mass derived from different nutrients and found
      that the majority of carbon mass in cells is derived from other amino acids,
      which are consumed at much lower rates than glucose and glutamine. While glucose 
      carbon has diverse fates, glutamine contributes most to protein, suggesting that 
      glutamine's ability to replenish tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates
      (anaplerosis) is primarily used for amino acid biosynthesis. These findings
      demonstrate that rates of nutrient consumption are indirectly associated with
      mass accumulation and suggest that high rates of glucose and glutamine
      consumption support rapid cell proliferation beyond providing carbon for
      biosynthesis.

AB  - Definitive hematopoiesis emerges via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition
      in the embryo and placenta; however, the precursor cells to hemogenic endothelium
      are not defined phenotypically. We previously demonstrated that the induction of 
      hematopoietic progenitors from fibroblasts progresses through hemogenic
      precursors that are Prom1(+)Sca1(+)CD34(+)CD45(-) (PS34CD45(-)). Guided by these 
      studies, we analyzed mouse placentas and identified a population with this
      phenotype. These cells express endothelial markers, are heterogeneous for early
      hematopoietic markers, and localize to the vascular labyrinth. Remarkably, global
      gene expression profiles of PS34CD45(-) cells correlate with reprogrammed
      precursors and establish a hemogenic precursor cell molecular signature.
      PS34CD45(-) cells are also present in intra-embryonic hemogenic sites. After
      stromal co-culture, PS34CD45(-) cells give rise to all blood lineages and engraft
      primary and secondary immunodeficient mice. In summary, we show that
      reprogramming reveals a phenotype for in vivo precursors to hemogenic
      endothelium, establishing that direct in vitro conversion informs developmental
      processes in vivo.

AB  - Regulation of organ size is essential in animal development, and Hippo (Hpo)
      signaling is a major conserved mechanism for controlling organ growth. In
      Drosophila, Hpo and Warts kinases are core components of this pathway and
      function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting Yorkie (Yki). Expanded (Ex) is a
      regulator of the Hpo activity, but how they are linked is unknown. Here, we show 
      that Schip1, a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Schwannomin interacting
      protein 1 (SCHIP1), provides a link between Ex and Hpo. Ex is required for apical
      localization of Schip1 in imaginal discs. Schip1 is necessary for promoting
      membrane localization and phosphorylation of Hpo by recruiting the Hpo kinase
      Tao-1. Taking these findings together, we conclude that Schip1 directly links Ex 
      to Hpo signaling by recruiting Tao-1. This study provides insights into the
      mechanism of Tao-1 regulation and a potential growth control function for SCHIP1 
      in mammals.

AB  - Mammalian erythropoiesis involves chromatin condensation that is initiated in the
      early stage of terminal differentiation. The mechanisms of chromatin condensation
      during erythropoiesis are unclear. Here, we show that the mouse erythroblast
      forms large, transient, and recurrent nuclear openings that coincide with the
      condensation process. The opening lacks nuclear lamina, nuclear pore complexes,
      and nuclear membrane, but it is distinct from nuclear envelope changes that occur
      during apoptosis and mitosis. A fraction of the major histones are released from 
      the nuclear opening and degraded in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that caspase-3 
      is required for the nuclear opening formation throughout terminal erythropoiesis.
      Loss of caspase-3 or ectopic expression of a caspase-3 non-cleavable lamin B
      mutant blocks nuclear opening formation, histone release, chromatin condensation,
      and terminal erythroid differentiation. We conclude that caspase-3-mediated
      nuclear opening formation accompanied by histone release from the opening is a
      critical step toward chromatin condensation during erythropoiesis in mice.

AB  - Incorrect attachment of kinetochore microtubules is the leading cause of
      chromosome missegregation in cancers. The highly conserved chromosomal passenger 
      complex (CPC), containing mitotic kinase Aurora B as a catalytic subunit, ensures
      faithful chromosome segregation through destabilizing incorrect microtubule
      attachments and promoting biorientation of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle. It
      is unknown whether CPC dysfunction affects chromosome segregation fidelity in
      cancers and, if so, how. Here, we show that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is an
      essential CPC component required for full Aurora B activity. HP1 binding to the
      CPC becomes particularly important when Aurora B phosphorylates kinetochore
      targets to eliminate erroneous microtubule attachments. Remarkably, a reduced
      proportion of HP1 bound to CPC is widespread in cancers, which causes an
      impairment in Aurora B activity. These results indicate that HP1 is an essential 
      modulator for CPC function and identify a molecular basis for chromosome
      segregation errors in cancer cells.

AB  - Wnt ligands are secreted lipid-modified proteins that are essential for
      development and homeostasis. Published recently in Nature, Farin et al. (2016)
      report that Wnt3 acts at a short distance during growth of mouse intestinal
      organoids, suggesting that Wnt proteins remain membrane-bound to activate
      signaling at a short range from their source.

AB  - The role of Heterochromatin Protein-1 (HP1) during mitosis has been
      controversial. Two recent studies in Science and Developmental Cell, from Tanno
      et al. (2015) and Abe et al. (2016), suggest that the means of HP1 localization
      and its function at inner centromeres are altered in cancer cells with
      chromosomal instability.

AB  - Metazoan development involves the successive activation and silencing of specific
      gene expression programs and is driven by tissue-specific transcription factors
      programming the chromatin landscape. To understand how this process executes an
      entire developmental pathway, we generated global gene expression, chromatin
      accessibility, histone modification, and transcription factor binding data from
      purified embryonic stem cell-derived cells representing six sequential stages of 
      hematopoietic specification and differentiation. Our data reveal the nature of
      regulatory elements driving differential gene expression and inform how
      transcription factor binding impacts on promoter activity. We present a dynamic
      core regulatory network model for hematopoietic specification and demonstrate its
      utility for the design of reprogramming experiments. Functional studies motivated
      by our genome-wide data uncovered a stage-specific role for TEAD/YAP factors in
      mammalian hematopoietic specification. Our study presents a powerful resource for
      studying hematopoiesis and demonstrates how such data advance our understanding
      of mammalian development.

AB  - The microenvironment determines cell behavior, but the underlying molecular
      mechanisms are poorly understood because quantitative studies of cell signaling
      and behavior have been challenging due to insufficient spatial and/or temporal
      resolution and limitations on microenvironmental control. Here we introduce
      microenvironmental selective plane illumination microscopy (meSPIM) for imaging
      and quantification of intracellular signaling and submicrometer cellular
      structures as well as large-scale cell morphological and environmental features. 
      We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the mechanical
      properties of the microenvironment regulate the transition of melanoma cells from
      actin-driven protrusion to blebbing, and we present tools to quantify how cells
      manipulate individual collagen fibers. We leverage the nearly isotropic
      resolution of meSPIM to quantify the local concentration of actin and
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling on the surfaces of cells deep within 3D
      collagen matrices and track the many small membrane protrusions that appear in
      these more physiologically relevant environments.

AB  - Bacteria display an array of contact-dependent interaction systems that have
      evolved to facilitate direct cell-to-cell communication. We have previously
      identified a mode of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes bridging
      neighboring cells. Here, we elucidate nanotube architecture, dynamics, and
      molecular components. Utilizing Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we found
      that at low cell density, nanotubes exhibit remarkable complexity, existing as
      both intercellular tubes and extending tubes, with the latter frequently
      surrounding the cells in a "root-like" fashion. Observing nanotube formation in
      real time showed that these structures are formed in the course of minutes,
      displaying rapid movements. Utilizing a combination of super-resolution, light,
      and electron microscopy, we revealed that nanotubes are composed of chains of
      membranous segments harboring a continuous lumen. Furthermore, we discovered that
      a conserved calcineurin-like protein, YmdB, presents in nanotubes and is required
      for both nanotube production and intercellular molecular trade.

AB  - Current models entail that transport through the Golgi-the main sorting
      compartment of the cell-occurs via cisternal progression/maturation and that
      Ypt/Rab GTPases regulate this process. However, there is very limited evidence
      that cisternal progression is regulated, and no evidence for involvement of
      Ypt/Rab GTPases in such a regulation. Moreover, controversy about the placement
      of two of the founding members of the Ypt/Rab family, Ypt1 and Ypt31, to specific
      Golgi cisternae interferes with addressing this question in yeast, where
      cisternal progression has been extensively studied. Here, we establish the
      localization of Ypt1 and Ypt31 to opposite faces of the Golgi: early and late,
      respectively. Moreover, we show that they partially overlap on a transitional
      compartment. Finally, we determine that changes in Ypt1 and Ypt31 activity affect
      Golgi cisternal progression, early-to-transitional and transitional-to-late,
      respectively. These results show that Ypt/Rab GTPases regulate two separate steps
      of Golgi cisternal progression.

AB  - Eukaryotic phagocytes search and destroy invading microorganisms via chemotaxis
      and phagocytosis. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a professional
      phagocyte that chases bacteria through chemotaxis and engulfs them as food via
      phagocytosis. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known for detecting
      chemoattractants and directing cell migration, but their roles in phagocytosis
      are not clear. Here, we developed a quantitative phosphoproteomic technique to
      discover signaling components. Using this approach, we discovered the long sought
      after folic acid receptor, fAR1, in D. discoideum. We showed that the
      seven-transmembrane receptor fAR1 is required for folic acid-mediated signaling
      events. Significantly, we discovered that fAR1 is essential for both chemotaxis
      and phagocytosis of bacteria, thereby representing a chemoattractant GPCR that
      mediates not only chasing but also ingesting bacteria. We revealed that a
      phagocyte is able to internalize particles via a chemoattractant-mediated
      engulfment process. We propose that mammalian phagocytes may also use this
      mechanism to engulf and ingest bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Correct function of the mitotic spindle requires balanced interplay of
      kinetochore and astral microtubules that mediate chromosome segregation and
      spindle positioning, respectively. Errors therein can cause severe defects
      ranging from aneuploidy to developmental disorders. Here, we describe a protein
      degradation pathway that functionally links astral microtubules to kinetochores
      via regulation of a microtubule-associated factor. We show that the yeast spindle
      positioning protein Kar9 localizes not only to astral but also to kinetochore
      microtubules, where it becomes targeted for proteasomal degradation by the
      SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) Slx5-Slx8. Intriguingly, this process
      does not depend on preceding sumoylation of Kar9 but rather requires
      SUMO-dependent recruitment of STUbLs to kinetochores. Failure to degrade Kar9
      leads to defects in both chromosome segregation and spindle positioning. We
      propose that kinetochores serve as platforms to recruit STUbLs in a
      SUMO-dependent manner in order to ensure correct spindle function by regulating
      levels of microtubule-associated proteins.

AB  - Patterning by morphogen gradients relies on the capacity to generate reproducible
      distribution profiles. Morphogen spread depends on kinetic parameters, including 
      diffusion and degradation rates, which vary between embryos, raising the question
      of how variability is controlled. We examined this in the context of
      Toll-dependent dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila embryo. We find
      that low embryo-to-embryo variability in DV patterning relies on wntD, a
      Toll-target gene expressed initially at the posterior pole. WntD protein is
      secreted and disperses in the extracellular milieu, associates with its receptor 
      Frizzled4, and inhibits the Toll pathway by blocking the Toll extracellular
      domain. Mathematical modeling predicts that WntD accumulates until the Toll
      gradient narrows to its desired spread, and we support this feedback
      experimentally. This circuit exemplifies a broadly applicable
      induction-contraction mechanism, which reduces patterning variability through a
      restricted morphogen-dependent expression of a secreted diffusible inhibitor.

AB  - Plant organogenesis requires control over division planes and anisotropic cell
      wall growth, which each require spatial patterning of cells. Polyhedral plant
      cells can display complex patterning in which individual faces are established as
      biochemically distinct domains by endomembrane trafficking. We now show that,
      during organogenesis, the Arabidopsis endomembrane system specifies an important 
      additional cellular spatial domain: the geometric edges. Previously unidentified 
      membrane vesicles lying immediately beneath the plasma membrane at cell edges
      were revealed through localization of RAB-A5c, a plant GTPase of the Rab family
      of membrane-trafficking regulators. Specific inhibition of RAB-A5c activity
      grossly perturbed cell geometry in developing lateral organs by interfering
      independently with growth anisotropy and cytokinesis without disrupting default
      membrane trafficking. The initial loss of normal cell geometry can be explained
      by a failure to maintain wall stiffness specifically at geometric edges. RAB-A5c 
      thus meets a requirement to specify this cellular spatial domain during
      organogenesis.

AB  - Most transcription factor families contain highly related paralogs generated by
      gene duplication, and functional divergence is generally accomplished by
      activation of distinct sets of genes by each member. Here we compare the
      molecular functions of Myf5 and MyoD, two highly related bHLH transcription
      factors that regulate skeletal muscle specification and differentiation. We find 
      that MyoD and Myf5 bind the same sites genome-wide but have distinct functions:
      Myf5 induces histone acetylation without Pol II recruitment or robust gene
      activation, whereas MyoD induces histone acetylation, recruits Pol II, and
      robustly activates gene transcription. Therefore, the initial specification of
      the muscle lineage by Myf5 occurs without significant induction of gene
      transcription. Transcription of the skeletal muscle program is then achieved by
      the subsequent expression of MyoD, which binds to the same sites as Myf5,
      indicating that each factor regulates distinct steps in gene initiation and
      transcription at a shared set of binding sites.

AB  - Adult humans fail to regenerate their hearts following injury, and this failure
      to regenerate myocardium is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide.
      Although all adult mammals appear to lack significant cardiac regeneration
      potential, some vertebrates can regenerate myocardium throughout life. In
      addition, new studies indicate that mammals have cardiac regeneration potential
      during development and very soon after birth. The mechanisms of heart
      regeneration among model organisms, including neonatal mice, appear remarkably
      similar. Orchestrated waves of inflammation, matrix deposition and remodeling,
      and cardiomyocyte proliferation are commonly seen in heart regeneration models.
      Understanding why adult mammals develop extensive scarring instead of
      regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology.

AB  - Kar9 positions mitotic spindles during budding yeast cell division. Reporting in 
      this issue of Developmental Cell, Schweiggert et al. (2016) show that modulation 
      of Kar9 stability mediates crosstalk between cytoplasmic and nuclear
      microtubules, using an elaborate mechanism that involves regulated nuclear
      transport as well as SUMOylation and ubiquitination.

AB  - A study by Tsiairis and Aulehla (2016), published in Cell, reveals that
      randomized mixtures of dissociated presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells reestablish
      wave-like propagating patterns of oscillatory gene expression by tuning the
      oscillation dynamics in response to surrounding cells. Thus, PSM cells
      self-organize the phase-coupled oscillators.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Pan et al. (2016) identified in cells of the
      social amoeba Dictyostelium a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that recognizes a
      chemoattractant secreted by bacteria. This work uncovers a mechanism by which a
      single GPCR mediates pseudopod extension during cell migration and bacterial
      engulfment.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays mitotic progression when chromosomes
      are not properly attached to microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Cells vary
      widely in the extent to which they delay mitotic progression upon SAC activation.
      To explore the mechanisms that determine checkpoint strength in different cells, 
      we systematically measured the mitotic delay induced by microtubule disruption at
      different stages of embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Strikingly, we
      observed a gradual increase in SAC strength after each round of division.
      Analysis of mutants that alter cell size or ploidy revealed that SAC strength is 
      determined primarily by cell size and the number of kinetochores. These findings 
      provide clear evidence in vivo that the kinetochore-to-cytoplasm ratio determines
      the strength of the SAC, providing new insights into why cells exhibit such large
      variations in their SAC responses.

TI  - Phosphorylation-Dependent Activation of the ESCRT Function of ALIX in Cytokinetic
      Abscission and Retroviral Budding.

AB  - The modular adaptor protein ALIX is a key player in multiple ESCRT-III-mediated
      membrane remodeling processes. ALIX is normally present in a closed conformation 
      due to an intramolecular interaction that renders ALIX unable to perform its
      ESCRT functions. Here we demonstrate that M phase-specific phosphorylation of the
      intramolecular interaction site within the proline-rich domain (PRD) of ALIX
      transforms cytosolic ALIX from closed to open conformation. Defining the role of 
      this mechanism of ALIX regulation in three classical ESCRT-mediated processes
      revealed that phosphorylation of the intramolecular interaction site in the PRD
      is required for ALIX to function in cytokinetic abscission and retroviral
      budding, but not in multivesicular body sorting of activated epidermal growth
      factor receptor. Thus, phosphorylation of the intramolecular interaction site in 
      the PRD is one of the major mechanisms that activates the ESCRT function of ALIX.

TI  - Hdac3 Interaction with p300 Histone Acetyltransferase Regulates the
      Oligodendrocyte and Astrocyte Lineage Fate Switch.

AB  - Establishment and maintenance of CNS glial cell identity ensures proper brain
      development and function, yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying glial fate
      control remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the histone deacetylase
      Hdac3 controls oligodendrocyte-specification gene Olig2 expression and functions 
      as a molecular switch for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte lineage determination.
      Hdac3 ablation leads to a significant increase of astrocytes with a concomitant
      loss of oligodendrocytes. Lineage tracing indicates that the ectopic astrocytes
      originate from oligodendrocyte progenitors. Genome-wide occupancy analysis
      reveals that Hdac3 interacts with p300 to activate oligodendroglial
      lineage-specific genes, while suppressing astroglial differentiation genes
      including NFIA. Furthermore, we find that Hdac3 modulates the acetylation state
      of Stat3 and competes with Stat3 for p300 binding to antagonize astrogliogenesis.
      Thus, our data suggest that Hdac3 cooperates with p300 to prime and maintain
      oligodendrocyte identity while inhibiting NFIA and Stat3-mediated
      astrogliogenesis, and thereby regulates phenotypic commitment at the point of
      oligodendrocyte-astrocytic fate decision.

AB  - Chromosomal instability (CIN) is thought to be a source of mutability in cancer. 
      However, CIN often results in aneuploidy, which compromises cell fitness. Here,
      we used the dosage compensation mechanism (DCM) of Drosophila to demonstrate that
      chromosome-wide gene dosage imbalance contributes to the deleterious effects of
      CIN-induced aneuploidy and its pro-tumorigenic action. We present evidence that
      resetting of the DCM counterbalances the damaging effects caused by CIN-induced
      changes in X chromosome number. Importantly, interfering with the DCM suffices to
      mimic the cellular effects of aneuploidy in terms of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) production, JNK-dependent cell death, and tumorigenesis upon apoptosis
      inhibition. We unveil a role of ROS in JNK activation and a variety of cellular
      and tissue-wide mechanisms that buffer the deleterious effects of CIN, including 
      DNA-damage repair, activation of the p38 pathway, and cytokine induction to
      promote compensatory proliferation. Our data reveal the existence of robust
      compensatory mechanisms that counteract CIN-induced cell death and tumorigenesis.

AB  - Novel developmental programs often evolve via cooption of existing genetic
      networks. To understand this process, we explored cooption of the TAS3 tasiRNA
      pathway in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We find an ancestral function for this
      repeatedly redeployed pathway in the spatial regulation of a conserved set of
      Auxin Response Factors. In moss, this results in stochastic patterning of the
      filamentous protonemal tissue. Through modeling and experimentation, we
      demonstrate that tasiRNA regulation confers sensitivity and robustness onto the
      auxin response. Increased auxin sensitivity parallels increased developmental
      sensitivity to nitrogen, a key environmental signal. We propose that the
      properties lent to the auxin response network, along with the ability to
      stochastically modulate development in response to environmental cues, have
      contributed to repeated cooption of the tasiRNA-ARF module during evolution. The 
      signaling properties of a genetic network, and not just its developmental output,
      are thus critical to understanding evolution of multicellular forms.

AB  - Human mutations in the cardiac transcription factor gene TBX5 cause congenital
      heart disease (CHD), although the underlying mechanism is unknown. We report
      characterization of the endogenous TBX5 cardiac interactome and demonstrate that 
      TBX5, long considered a transcriptional activator, interacts biochemically and
      genetically with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) repressor
      complex. Incompatible gene programs are repressed by TBX5 in the developing
      heart. CHD mis-sense mutations that disrupt the TBX5-NuRD interaction cause
      depression of a subset of repressed genes. Furthermore, the TBX5-NuRD interaction
      is required for heart development. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
      TBX5-NuRD interaction domain evolved during early diversification of vertebrates,
      simultaneous with the evolution of cardiac septation. Collectively, this work
      defines a TBX5-NuRD interaction essential to cardiac development and the
      evolution of the mammalian heart, and when altered may contribute to human CHD.

AB  - During early embryonic development, cells are organized as cohesive epithelial
      sheets that are continuously growing and remodeled without losing their
      integrity, giving rise to a wide array of tissue shapes. Here, using live imaging
      in chick embryo, we investigate how epithelial cells rearrange during
      gastrulation. We find that cell division is a major rearrangement driver that
      powers dramatic epithelial cell intercalation events. We show that these cell
      division-mediated intercalations, which represent the majority of epithelial
      rearrangements within the early embryo, are absolutely necessary for the spatial 
      patterning of gastrulation movements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these
      intercalation events result from overall low cortical actomyosin accumulation
      within the epithelial cells of the embryo, which enables dividing cells to
      remodel junctions in their vicinity. These findings uncover a role for cell
      division as coordinator of epithelial growth and remodeling that might underlie
      various developmental, homeostatic, or pathological processes in amniotes.

AB  - Toll and Hippo are two seemingly disparate pathways that regulate innate immunity
      and tissue growth, respectively. Reporting recently in Cell, Liu et al. (2016)
      tie them together by demonstrating that microbial infection activates Toll, which
      then signals to both pathways to modulate the antimicrobial response.

AB  - Variation in the activity of the spindle assembly checkpoint has been observed in
      different cell types, yet the reason for this variability remains poorly
      understood. Reporting in Developmental Cell, Galli and Morgan (2016) show that
      checkpoint activity increases during development as cell size, and the
      cytoplasm-to-kinetochore ratio, decreases.

AB  - The terminal stages of pulmonary development, called sacculation and
      alveologenesis, involve both differentiation of distal lung endoderm progenitors 
      and extensive cellular remodeling of the resultant epithelial lineages. These
      processes are coupled with dramatic expansion of distal airspace and surface
      area. Despite the importance of these late developmental processes and their
      relation to neonatal respiratory diseases, little is understood about the
      molecular and cellular pathways critical for their successful completion. We show
      that a histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3)-mediated epigenetic pathway is critical for 
      the proper remodeling and expansion of the distal lung saccules into primitive
      alveoli. Loss of Hdac3 in the developing lung epithelium leads to a reduction of 
      alveolar type 1 cell spreading and a disruption of lung sacculation. Hdac3
      represses miR-17-92 expression, a microRNA cluster that regulates transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling. De-repression of miR-17-92 in
      Hdac3-deficient lung epithelium results in decreased TGF-beta signaling activity.
      Importantly, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling and overexpression of miR-17-92 can
      phenocopy the defects observed in Hdac3 null lungs. Conversely, loss of miR-17-92
      expression rescues many of the defects caused by loss of Hdac3 in the lung. These
      studies reveal an intricate epigenetic pathway where Hdac3 is required to repress
      miR-17-92 expression to allow for proper TGF-beta signaling during lung
      sacculation.

AB  - We present the Real-time Accurate Cell-shape Extractor (RACE), a high-throughput 
      image analysis framework for automated three-dimensional cell segmentation in
      large-scale images. RACE is 55-330 times faster and 2-5 times more accurate than 
      state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the generality of RACE by extracting
      cell-shape information from entire Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos
      imaged with confocal and light-sheet microscopes. Using RACE, we automatically
      reconstructed cellular-resolution tissue anisotropy maps across developing
      Drosophila embryos and quantified differences in cell-shape dynamics in wild-type
      and mutant embryos. We furthermore integrated RACE with our framework for
      automated cell lineaging and performed joint segmentation and cell tracking in
      entire Drosophila embryos. RACE processed these terabyte-sized datasets on a
      single computer within 1.4 days. RACE is easy to use, as it requires adjustment
      of only three parameters, takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multi-core
      processors and graphics cards, and is available as open-source software for
      Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

AB  - Cell motility and actin homeostasis depend on the control of polarized growth of 
      actin filaments. Profilin, an abundant regulator of actin dynamics, supports
      filament assembly at barbed ends by binding G-actin. Here, we demonstrate how, by
      binding and destabilizing filament barbed ends at physiological concentrations,
      profilin also controls motility, cell migration, and actin homeostasis. Profilin 
      enhances filament length fluctuations. Profilin competes with Capping Protein at 
      barbed ends, which generates a lower amount of profilin-actin than expected if
      barbed ends were tightly capped. Profilin competes with barbed end polymerases,
      such as formins and VopF, and inhibits filament branching by WASP-Arp2/3 complex 
      by competition for filament barbed ends, accounting for its as-yet-unknown
      effects on motility and metastatic cell migration observed in this concentration 
      range. In conclusion, profilin is a major coordinator of polarized growth of
      actin filaments, controlled by competition between barbed end cappers, trackers, 
      destabilizers, and filament branching machineries.

AB  - Transporting and sensory epithelial cells shape apical specializations using
      protocadherin-based adhesion. In the enterocyte brush border, protocadherin
      function requires a complex of cytoplasmic binding partners, although the
      composition of this complex and logic governing its assembly remain poorly
      understood. We found that ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain
      containing 4B (ANKS4B) localizes to the tips of adherent brush border microvilli 
      and is essential for intermicrovillar adhesion. ANKS4B interacts with USH1C and
      MYO7B, which link protocadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. ANKS4B and USH1C also
      bind to the MYO7B cargo-binding tail at distinct sites. However, a tripartite
      complex only forms if ANKS4B and MYO7B are first activated by USH1C. This study
      uncovers an essential role for ANKS4B in brush border assembly, reveals a
      hierarchy in the molecular interactions that drive intermicrovillar adhesion, and
      informs our understanding of diseases caused by mutations in USH1C and ankyrin
      repeat proteins, such as Usher syndrome.

AB  - Brush border microvilli are actin-based protrusions lining the apical surface of 
      epithelial cells in intestines and proximal tubules of kidneys. While brush
      border microvilli resemble the relatively well-characterized stereocilia of hair 
      cells, the mechanistic basis of tip-link complex organization in microvilli is
      poorly understood. Here, we have biochemically and structurally characterized the
      following pairs of interactions: protocadherin 24 and Harmonin (also known as
      USH1C or AIE-75), Harmonin and myosin VIIb (MYO7B), Harmonin and ANKS4B, and
      ANKS4B and MYO7B. We show that Harmonin, ANKS4B, and MYO7B form a stable ternary 
      complex for anchoring microvilli tip-link cadherins. Despite having only Harmonin
      in common, the microvilli and the stereocilia tip-link complexes are formed via
      strikingly similar interaction modes. These results not only provide insight into
      the mechanistic bases of brush border microvilli formation and maintenance but
      may also be valuable for understanding some gut and/or kidney diseases caused by 
      perturbations of brush border microvilli structures.

TI  - The 1p36 Tumor Suppressor KIF 1Bbeta Is Required for Calcineurin Activation,
      Controlling Mitochondrial Fission and Apoptosis.

AB  - KIF1Bbeta is a candidate 1p36 tumor suppressor that regulates apoptosis in the
      developing sympathetic nervous system. We found that KIF1Bbeta activates the
      Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CN) by stabilizing the CN-calmodulin
      complex, relieving enzymatic autoinhibition and enabling CN substrate
      recognition. CN is the key mediator of cellular responses to Ca(2+) signals and
      its deregulation is implicated in cancer, cardiac, neurodegenerative, and immune 
      disease. We show that KIF1Bbeta affects mitochondrial dynamics through
      CN-dependent dephosphorylation of Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), causing
      mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Furthermore, KIF1Bbeta actuates recognition 
      of all known CN substrates, implying a general mechanism for KIF1Bbeta in Ca(2+) 
      signaling and how Ca(2+)-dependent signaling is executed by CN. Pathogenic
      KIF1Bbeta mutations previously identified in neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas
      all fail to activate CN or stimulate DRP1 dephosphorylation. Importantly,
      KIF1Bbeta and DRP1 are silenced in 1p36 hemizygous-deleted neuroblastomas,
      indicating that deregulation of calcineurin and mitochondrial dynamics
      contributes to high-risk and poor-prognosis neuroblastoma.

AB  - Critical roles for DNA methylation in embryonic development are well established,
      but less is known about its roles during trophoblast development, the
      extraembryonic lineage that gives rise to the placenta. We dissected the role of 
      DNA methylation in trophoblast development by performing mRNA and DNA methylation
      profiling of Dnmt3a/3b mutants. We find that oocyte-derived methylation plays a
      major role in regulating trophoblast development but that imprinting of the key
      placental regulator Ascl2 is only partially responsible for these effects. We
      have identified several methylation-regulated genes associated with trophoblast
      differentiation that are involved in cell adhesion and migration, potentially
      affecting trophoblast invasion. Specifically, trophoblast-specific DNA
      methylation is linked to the silencing of Scml2, a Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 
      protein that drives loss of cell adhesion in methylation-deficient trophoblast.
      Our results reveal that maternal DNA methylation controls multiple
      differentiation-related and physiological processes in trophoblast via both
      imprinting-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

TI  - WAC Regulates mTOR Activity by Acting as an Adaptor for the TTT and Pontin/Reptin
      Complexes.

AB  - The ability to sense energy status is crucial in the regulation of metabolism via
      the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). The assembly of the
      TTT-Pontin/Reptin complex is responsive to changes in energy status. Under
      energy-sufficient conditions, the TTT-Pontin/Reptin complex promotes mTORC1
      dimerization and mTORC1-Rag interaction, which are critical for mTORC1
      activation. We show that WAC is a regulator of energy-mediated mTORC1 activity.
      In a Drosophila screen designed to isolate mutations that cause neuronal
      dysfunction, we identified wacky, the homolog of WAC. Loss of Wacky leads to
      neurodegeneration, defective mTOR activity, and increased autophagy. Wacky and
      WAC have conserved physical interactions with mTOR and its regulators, including 
      Pontin and Reptin, which bind to the TTT complex to regulate energy-dependent
      activation of mTORC1. WAC promotes the interaction between TTT and Pontin/Reptin 
      in an energy-dependent manner, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity by facilitating 
      mTORC1 dimerization and mTORC1-Rag interaction.

AB  - Conrad Waddington's eponymous 1957 diagram provided a metaphorical framework for 
      considering how sequential developmental fate decisions allow an egg to develop
      into an embryo. In recent years, the Waddington diagram has been repurposed to
      illustrate how cellular identity changes in the context of reprogramming. In this
      Perspective, we revisit the Waddington diagram in light of the emerging
      recognition that plasticity is part and parcel of adult regeneration.
      Specifically, we speculate that the "epigenetic landscapes" that define identity 
      in adult tissues are dynamic, facilitating cellular de-differentiation and
      trans-differentiation in the setting of injury.

AB  - Phagocytosis is key for many organismal functions. In a recent issue of Cell,
      Freeman et al. (2016) demonstrate a feed-forward signaling mechanism wherein
      F-actin and integrin receptors drive contact formation between phagocytes and
      antibody-coated solid particles, signaling their engulfment. This mechanism
      translates nanoscale proximity effects into wider self-propagating signals.

AB  - The activity of the mTORC1 protein complex depends on multiple metabolic inputs
      that regulate dimerization, recruitment to the lysosome, and activation. In this 
      issue of Developmental Cell, David-Morrison et al. (2016) show that the
      Drosophila protein Wacky and its mammalian counterpart WAC act as adaptors in the
      process of mTORC1 dimerization.

AB  - Neuroblastomas are associated with KIF1Bbeta mutations within tumor suppressor
      region 1p36. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Li et al. (2016) show that
      KIF1Bbeta binding releases calcineurin autoinhibition, leading to
      dephosphorylation of the DRP1 GTPase and subsequent mitochondrial fragmentation. 
      KIF1Bbeta impairment causes mitochondrial hyperfusion, impairing developmental
      apoptosis and promoting tumorigenesis.

TI  - An NF-kappaB--EphrinA5-Dependent Communication between NG2(+) Interstitial Cells 
      and Myoblasts Promotes Muscle Growth in Neonates.

AB  - Skeletal muscle growth immediately following birth is critical for proper body
      posture and locomotion. However, compared with embryogenesis and adulthood, the
      processes regulating the maturation of neonatal muscles is considerably less
      clear. Studies in the 1960s predicted that neonatal muscle growth results from
      nuclear accretion of myoblasts preferentially at the tips of myofibers.
      Remarkably, little information has been added since then to resolve how myoblasts
      migrate to the ends of fibers. Here, we provide insight into this process by
      revealing a unique NF-kappaB-dependent communication between NG2(+) interstitial 
      cells and myoblasts. NF-kappaB in NG2(+) cells promotes myoblast migration to the
      tips of myofibers through cell-cell contact. This occurs through expression of
      ephrinA5 from NG2(+) cells, which we further deduce is an NF-kappaB target gene. 
      Together, these results suggest that NF-kappaB plays an important role in the
      development of newborn muscles to ensure proper myoblast migration for fiber
      growth.

AB  - We demonstrate the utility of the phytochrome system to rapidly and reversibly
      recruit proteins to specific subcellular regions within specific cells in a
      living vertebrate embryo. Light-induced heterodimerization using the phytochrome 
      system has previously been used as a powerful tool to dissect signaling pathways 
      for single cells in culture but has not previously been used to reversibly
      manipulate the precise subcellular location of proteins in multicellular
      organisms. Here we report the experimental conditions necessary to use this
      system to manipulate proteins in vivo. As proof of principle, we demonstrate that
      we can manipulate the localization of the apical polarity protein Pard3 with high
      temporal and spatial precision in both the neural tube and the embryo's
      enveloping layer epithelium. Our optimizations of optogenetic component
      expression and chromophore purification and delivery should significantly lower
      the barrier for establishing this powerful optogenetic system in other
      multicellular organisms.

AB  - Epithelia grow and undergo extensive rearrangements to achieve their final size
      and shape. Imaging the dynamics of tissue growth and morphogenesis is now
      possible with advances in time-lapse microscopy, but a true understanding of
      their complexities is limited by automated image analysis tools to extract
      quantitative data. To overcome such limitations, we have designed a new
      open-source image analysis toolkit called EpiTools. It provides user-friendly
      graphical user interfaces for accurately segmenting and tracking the contours of 
      cell membrane signals obtained from 4D confocal imaging. It is designed for a
      broad audience, especially biologists with no computer-science background.
      Quantitative data extraction is integrated into a larger bioimaging platform,
      Icy, to increase the visibility and usability of our tools. We demonstrate the
      usefulness of EpiTools by analyzing Drosophila wing imaginal disc growth,
      revealing previously overlooked properties of this dynamic tissue, such as the
      patterns of cellular rearrangements.

AB  - Vertebrate immature oocytes are arrested at prophase of meiosis I (MI). Hormonal 
      stimulation breaks this prophase-I arrest and induces re-entry into MI. The
      mechanism underlying meiotic resumption remains largely elusive. Here, we
      demonstrate that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in complex with
      Cdh1 has an unexpected function in meiosis in that it is essential for meiotic
      resumption. We identify the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6c) as 
      the critical substrate whose APC/C(Cdh1)-mediated destruction is a prerequisite
      for the re-entry of immature Xenopus laevis oocytes into MI. Preventing PP6c
      destruction impairs activating autophosphorylation of Aurora A, a cell-cycle
      kinase critical for meiotic translation. Restoring meiotic translation rescues
      the meiotic resumption defect of Cdh1-depleted oocytes. Thus, our studies
      discover that the essential function of the APC/C in triggering cell-cycle
      transitions is not limited to M-phase exit but also applies to entry into meiotic
      M-phase, and identify a crucial APC/C-PP6c-Aurora A axis in the resumption of
      female meiosis.

AB  - The WNT signaling enhancer R-spondin3 (RSPO3) is prominently expressed in the
      vasculature. Correspondingly, embryonic lethality of Rspo3-deficient mice is
      caused by vessel remodeling defects. Yet the mechanisms underlying vascular RSPO3
      function remain elusive. Inducible endothelial Rspo3 deletion (Rspo3-iECKO)
      resulted in perturbed developmental and tumor vascular remodeling. Endothelial
      cell apoptosis and vascular pruning led to reduced microvessel density in
      Rspo3-iECKO mice. Rspo3-iECKO mice strikingly phenocopied the non-canonical WNT
      signaling-induced vascular defects of mice deleted for the WNT secretion factor
      Evi/Wls. An endothelial screen for RSPO3 and EVI/WLS co-regulated genes
      identified Rnf213, Usp18, and Trim30alpha. RNF213 targets filamin A and NFAT1 for
      proteasomal degradation attenuating non-canonical WNT/Ca(2+) signaling. Likewise,
      USP18 and TRIM5alpha inhibited NFAT1 activation. Consequently, NFAT protein
      levels were decreased in endothelial cells of Rspo3-iECKO mice and
      pharmacological NFAT inhibition phenocopied Rspo3-iECKO mice. The data identify
      endothelial RSPO3-driven non-canonical WNT/Ca(2+)/NFAT signaling as a critical
      maintenance pathway of the remodeling vasculature.

AB  - Mitosis ensures equal segregation of the genome and is controlled by a variety of
      ubiquitylation signals on substrate proteins. However, it remains unexplored how 
      the versatile ubiquitin code is read out during mitotic progression. Here, we
      identify the ubiquitin receptor protein UBASH3B as an important regulator of
      mitosis. UBASH3B interacts with ubiquitylated Aurora B, one of the main kinases
      regulating chromosome segregation, and controls its subcellular localization but 
      not protein levels. UBASH3B is a limiting factor in this pathway and is
      sufficient to localize Aurora B to microtubules prior to anaphase. Importantly,
      targeting Aurora B to microtubules by UBASH3B is necessary for the timing and
      fidelity of chromosome segregation in human cells. Our findings uncover an
      important mechanism defining how ubiquitin attachment to a substrate protein is
      decoded during mitosis.

AB  - Control of cell-division orientation is integral to epithelial morphogenesis and 
      asymmetric cell division. Proper spatiotemporal localization of the
      evolutionarily conserved Galphai-LGN-NuMA protein complex is critical for mitotic
      spindle orientation, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we identify
      Suppressor APC domain containing 2 (SAPCD2) as a previously unreported
      LGN-interacting protein. We show that SAPCD2 is essential to instruct planar
      mitotic spindle orientation in both epithelial cell cultures and mouse retinal
      progenitor cells in vivo. Loss of SAPCD2 randomizes spindle orientation, which in
      turn disrupts cyst morphogenesis in three-dimensional cultures, and triples the
      number of terminal asymmetric cell divisions in the developing retina.
      Mechanistically, we show that SAPCD2 negatively regulates the localization of LGN
      at the cell cortex, likely by competing with NuMA for its binding. These results 
      uncover SAPCD2 as a key regulator of the ternary complex controlling spindle
      orientation during morphogenesis and asymmetric cell divisions.

AB  - Epithelial sheets are crucial components of all metazoan animals, enclosing
      organs and protecting the animal from its environment. Epithelial homeostasis
      poses unique challenges, as addition of new cells and loss of old cells must be
      achieved without disrupting the fluid-tight barrier and apicobasal polarity of
      the epithelium. Several studies have identified cell biological mechanisms
      underlying extrusion of cells from epithelia, but far less is known of the
      converse mechanism by which new cells are added. Here, we combine molecular,
      pharmacological, and laser-dissection experiments with theoretical modeling to
      characterize forces driving emergence of an apical surface as single nascent
      cells are added to a vertebrate epithelium in vivo. We find that this process
      involves the interplay between cell-autonomous actin-generated pushing forces in 
      the emerging cell and mechanical properties of neighboring cells. Our findings
      define the forces driving this cell behavior, contributing to a more
      comprehensive understanding of epithelial homeostasis.

      Transcription during Hematopoiesis.

AB  - Enhancers are the primary determinants of cell identity, but the regulatory
      components controlling enhancer turnover during lineage commitment remain largely
      unknown. Here we compare the enhancer landscape, transcriptional factor
      occupancy, and transcriptomic changes in human fetal and adult hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cells and committed erythroid progenitors. We find that enhancers
      are modulated pervasively and direct lineage- and stage-specific transcription.
      GATA2-to-GATA1 switch is prevalent at dynamic enhancers and drives erythroid
      enhancer commissioning. Examination of lineage-specific enhancers identifies
      transcription factors and their combinatorial patterns in enhancer turnover.
      Importantly, by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing, we uncover functional
      hierarchy of constituent enhancers within the SLC25A37 super-enhancer. Despite
      indistinguishable chromatin features, we reveal through genomic editing the
      functional diversity of several GATA switch enhancers in which enhancers with
      opposing functions cooperate to coordinate transcription. Thus, genome-wide
      enhancer profiling coupled with in situ enhancer editing provide critical
      insights into the functional complexity of enhancers during development.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cells synthesize and secrete insulin to increase anabolic
      metabolism in an organism, and insulin synthesis has long been suspected to
      inhibit beta cell replication. Recently in Cell Metabolism, Szabat et al. (2015) 
      present evidence that deletion of Insulin genes alleviates ER stress and promotes
      mature beta cell replication.

AB  - The evolutionarily conserved Galphai-LGN-NuMA protein complex is a key regulator 
      of spindle orientation, but how its spatiotemporal localization is achieved
      remains elusive. Chiu et al. (2016) show that SAPCD2 negatively regulates LGN
      cortical localization by competing with NuMA for LGN binding in both epithelial
      cells and mouse retinal progenitor cells.

AB  - In contrast to mammals, zebrafish regenerate heart injuries via proliferation of 
      cardiomyocytes located near the wound border. To identify regulators of
      cardiomyocyte proliferation, we used spatially resolved RNA sequencing (tomo-seq)
      and generated a high-resolution genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the
      regenerating zebrafish heart. Interestingly, we identified two wound border zones
      with distinct expression profiles, including the re-expression of embryonic
      cardiac genes and targets of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling.
      Endogenous BMP signaling has been reported to be detrimental to mammalian cardiac
      repair. In contrast, we find that genetic or chemical inhibition of BMP signaling
      in zebrafish reduces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation,
      ultimately compromising myocardial regeneration, while bmp2b overexpression is
      sufficient to enhance it. Our results provide a resource for further studies on
      the molecular regulation of cardiac regeneration and reveal intriguing
      differential cellular responses of cardiomyocytes to a conserved signaling
      pathway in regenerative versus non-regenerative hearts.

AB  - After neural tube closure, amniotic fluid (AF) captured inside the neural tube
      forms the nascent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Neuroepithelial stem cells contact
      CSF-filled ventricles, proliferate, and differentiate to form the mammalian
      brain, while neurogenic placodes, which generate cranial sensory neurons, remain 
      in contact with the AF. Using in vivo ultrasound imaging, we quantified the
      expansion of the embryonic ventricular-CSF space from its inception. We developed
      tools to obtain pure AF and nascent CSF, before and after neural tube closure,
      and to define how the AF and CSF proteomes diverge during mouse development.
      Using embryonic neural explants, we demonstrate that age-matched fluids promote
      Sox2-positive neurogenic identity in developing forebrain and olfactory
      epithelia. Nascent CSF also stimulates SOX2-positive self-renewal of forebrain
      progenitor cells, some of which is attributable to LIFR signaling. Our Resource
      should facilitate the investigation of fluid-tissue interactions during this
      highly vulnerable stage of early brain development.

TI  - A Negative Regulatory Mechanism Involving 14-3-3zeta Limits Signaling Downstream 
      of ROCK to Regulate Tissue Stiffness in Epidermal Homeostasis.
PG  - 759-74
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2015.11.026 [doi]
LID - S1534-5807(15)00761-3 [pii]
AB  - ROCK signaling causes epidermal hyper-proliferation by increasing ECM production,
      elevating dermal stiffness, and enhancing Fak-mediated mechano-transduction
      signaling. Elevated dermal stiffness in turn causes ROCK activation, establishing
      mechano-reciprocity, a positive feedback loop that can promote tumors. We have
      identified a negative feedback mechanism that limits excessive ROCK signaling
      during wound healing and is lost in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Signal flux 
      through ROCK was selectively tuned down by increased levels of 14-3-3zeta, which 
      interacted with Mypt1, a ROCK signaling antagonist. In 14-3-3zeta(-/-) mice,
      unrestrained ROCK signaling at wound margins elevated ECM production and reduced 
      ECM remodeling, increasing dermal stiffness and causing rapid wound healing.
      Conversely, 14-3-3zeta deficiency enhanced cutaneous SCC size. Significantly,
      inhibiting 14-3-3zeta with a novel pharmacological agent accelerated wound
      healing 2-fold. Patient samples of chronic non-healing wounds overexpressed
      14-3-3zeta, while cutaneous SCCs had reduced 14-3-3zeta. These results reveal a
      novel 14-3-3zeta-dependent mechanism that negatively regulates
      mechano-reciprocity, suggesting new therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - Paternal diet can impact metabolic phenotypes in offspring, but mechanisms
      underlying such intergenerational information transfer remain obscure. Here, we
      interrogate cytosine methylation patterns in sperm obtained from mice consuming
      one of three diets, generating whole genome methylation maps for four pools of
      sperm samples and for 12 individual sperm samples, as well as 61 genome-scale
      methylation maps. We find that "epivariation," either stochastic or due to
      unknown demographic or environmental factors, was a far stronger contributor to
      the sperm methylome than was the diet consumed. Variation in cytosine methylation
      was particularly dramatic over tandem repeat families, including ribosomal DNA
      (rDNA) repeats, but rDNA methylation was strongly correlated with genetic
      variation in rDNA copy number and was not influenced by paternal diet. These
      results identify loci of genetic and epigenetic lability in the mammalian genome 
      but argue against a direct role for sperm cytosine methylation in dietary
      reprogramming of offspring metabolism.

AB  - Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) kinases play a central role in limiting growth in most
      animals. Signals that promote growth do so in part by suppressing the activation 
      of NDR kinases by STE20/Hippo kinases. Here, we identify another mechanism for
      downregulating NDR kinase activity. Specifically, we show that activity of the
      Drosophila NDR kinase Warts in the developing wing depends on its transition from
      an inactive, "closed" conformation to a potentially active, "open" conformation
      mediated by Mats, a conserved Mps1-binder (Mob) protein. Further, we show that
      signaling interactions between the protocadherins Fat and Dachsous, organized by 
      the morphogens Wingless and Decapentaplegic, suppress Warts by acting via the
      atypical myosin Dachs to inhibit or reverse this transition. The regulation of
      Warts conformation by Mats, Fat/Dachsous signaling, and Dachs appears independent
      of Warts phosphorylation by Hippo kinase, establishing a precedent for the
      control of NDR kinases, and hence growth, by distinct allosteric and
      phosphorylation mechanisms.

      Proteins in Cell Motility and Cytokinesis.

AB  - F-BAR proteins function in diverse cellular processes by linking membranes to the
      actin cytoskeleton. Through oligomerization, multiple F-BAR domains can bend
      membranes into tubules, though the physiological importance of F-BAR-to-F-BAR
      assemblies is not yet known. Here, we investigate the F-BAR domain of the
      essential cytokinetic scaffold, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc15, during
      cytokinesis. Challenging a widely held view that membrane deformation is a
      fundamental property of F-BARs, we report that the Cdc15 F-BAR binds, but does
      not deform, membranes in vivo or in vitro, and six human F-BAR domains-including 
      those from Fer and RhoGAP4-share this property. Nevertheless, tip-to-tip
      interactions between F-BAR dimers are critical for Cdc15 oligomerization and
      high-avidity membrane binding, stabilization of contractile ring components at
      the medial cortex, and the fidelity of cytokinesis. F-BAR oligomerization is also
      critical for Fer and RhoGAP4 physiological function, demonstrating its broad
      importance to F-BAR proteins that function without membrane bending.

AB  - The proper positioning of organs during development is essential, yet little is
      known about the regulation of this process in mammals. Using murine tooth
      development as a model, we have found that cell migration plays a central role in
      positioning of the organ primordium. By combining lineage tracing, genetic cell
      ablation, and confocal live imaging, we identified a migratory population of
      Fgf8-expressing epithelial cells in the embryonic mandible. These Fgf8-expressing
      progenitors furnish the epithelial cells required for tooth development, and the 
      progenitor population migrates toward a Shh-expressing region in the mandible,
      where the tooth placode will initiate. Inhibition of Fgf and Shh signaling
      disrupted the oriented migration of cells, leading to a failure of tooth
      development. These results demonstrate the importance of intraepithelial cell
      migration in proper positioning of an initiating organ.

TI  - The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase TRIM9 Is a Filopodia Off Switch Required for
      Netrin-Dependent Axon Guidance.
PG  - 698-712
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2015.11.022 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal growth cone filopodia contain guidance receptors and contribute to axon 
      guidance; however, the mechanism by which the guidance cue netrin increases
      filopodia density is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TRIM9, an E3 ubiquitin
      ligase that localizes to filopodia tips and binds the netrin receptor DCC,
      interacts with and ubiquitinates the barbed-end polymerase VASP to modulate
      filopodial stability during netrin-dependent axon guidance. Studies with murine
      Trim9(+/+) and Trim9(-/-) cortical neurons, along with a non-ubiquitinatable VASP
      mutant, demonstrate that TRIM9-mediated ubiquitination of VASP reduces VASP
      filopodial tip localization, VASP dynamics at tips, and filopodial stability.
      Upon netrin treatment, VASP is deubiquitinated, which promotes VASP tip
      localization and filopodial stability. Trim9 deletion induces axon guidance
      defects in vitro and in vivo, whereas a gradient of deubiquitinase inhibition
      promotes axon turning in vitro. We conclude that a gradient of TRIM9-mediated
      ubiquitination of VASP creates a filopodial stability gradient during axon
      turning.

AB  - Neoplastic transformation requires changes in cellular identity. Emerging
      evidence increasingly points to cellular reprogramming, a process during which
      fully differentiated and functional cells lose aspects of their identity while
      gaining progenitor characteristics, as a critical early step during cancer
      initiation. This cell identity crisis persists even at the malignant stage in
      certain cancers, suggesting that reactivation of progenitor functions supports
      tumorigenicity. Here, we review recent findings that establish the essential role
      of cellular reprogramming during neoplastic transformation and the major players 
      involved in it with a special emphasis on pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Chromatin domains associated with the nuclear lamina are generally
      heterochromatic and transcriptionally repressed. How they are recruited to and
      maintained at the nuclear periphery remains unclear. A recent study by
      Gonzalez-Sandoval et al. (2015) in Cell identifies a chromatin-binding protein
      that links repressive chromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

AB  - Reporting in Developmental Cell, Shea et al. (2015) show, using an inbred mouse
      strain, that "epivariation"-stochastic individual differences in DNA
      methylation-is a much greater contributor to the sperm methylome than is diet.
      They conclude that DNA methylation is not the mechanism underlying the dietary
      reprogramming of offspring phenotype.

      in diverse eukaryotes. However, the formation and biological roles of
      heterochromatin bodies are poorly understood. In the ciliated protozoan
      Tetrahymena, de novo heterochromatin body formation is accompanied by programmed 
      DNA elimination. Here, we show that the heterochromatin body component Jub1p
      promotes heterochromatin body formation and dephosphorylation of the
      Heterochromatin Protein 1-like protein Pdd1p. Through the mutagenesis of the
      phosphorylated residues of Pdd1p, we demonstrate that Pdd1p dephosphorylation
      promotes the electrostatic interaction between Pdd1p and RNA in vitro and
      heterochromatin body formation in vivo. We therefore propose that heterochromatin
      body is assembled by the Pdd1p-RNA interaction. Pdd1p dephosphorylation and Jub1p
      are required for heterochromatin body formation and DNA elimination but not for
      local heterochromatin assembly, indicating that heterochromatin body plays an
      essential role in DNA elimination.

AB  - The propagation of force in epithelial tissues requires that the contractile
      cytoskeletal machinery be stably connected between cells through
      E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions. In many epithelial tissues, the cells' 
      contractile network is positioned at a distance from the junction. However, the
      mechanism or mechanisms that connect the contractile networks to the adherens
      junctions, and thus mechanically connect neighboring cells, are poorly
      understood. Here, we identified the role for F-actin turnover in regulating the
      contractile cytoskeletal network's attachment to adherens junctions. Perturbing
      F-actin turnover via gene depletion or acute drug treatments that slow F-actin
      turnover destabilized the attachment between the contractile actomyosin network
      and adherens junctions. Our work identifies a critical role for F-actin turnover 
      in connecting actomyosin to intercellular junctions, defining a dynamic process
      required for the stability of force balance across intercellular contacts in
      tissues.

TI  - An Optogenetic Method to Modulate Cell Contractility during Tissue Morphogenesis.
PG  - 646-60
AB  - Morphogenesis of multicellular organisms is driven by localized cell shape
      changes. How, and to what extent, changes in behavior in single cells or groups
      of cells influence neighboring cells and large-scale tissue remodeling remains an
      open question. Indeed, our understanding of multicellular dynamics is limited by 
      the lack of methods allowing the modulation of cell behavior with high
      spatiotemporal precision. Here, we developed an optogenetic approach to achieve
      local modulation of cell contractility and used it to control morphogenetic
      movements during Drosophila embryogenesis. We show that local inhibition of
      apical constriction is sufficient to cause a global arrest of mesoderm
      invagination. By varying the spatial pattern of inhibition during invagination,
      we further demonstrate that coordinated contractile behavior responds to local
      tissue geometrical constraints. Together, these results show the efficacy of this
      optogenetic approach to dissect the interplay between cell-cell interaction,
      force transmission, and tissue geometry during complex morphogenetic processes.

AB  - Regeneration starts with injury. Yet how injuries affect gene expression in
      different cell types and how distinct injuries differ in gene expression remain
      unclear. We defined the transcriptomes of major cell types of
      planarians--flatworms that regenerate from nearly any injury--and identified
      1,214 tissue-specific markers across 13 cell types. RNA sequencing on 619 single 
      cells revealed that wound-induced genes were expressed either in nearly all cell 
      types or specifically in one of three cell types (stem cells, muscle, or
      epidermis). Time course experiments following different injuries indicated that a
      generic wound response is activated with any injury regardless of the
      regenerative outcome. Only one gene, notum, was differentially expressed early
      between anterior- and posterior-facing wounds. Injury-specific transcriptional
      responses emerged 30 hr after injury, involving context-dependent patterning and 
      stem-cell-specialization genes. The regenerative requirement of every injury is
      different; however, our work demonstrates that all injuries start with a common
      transcriptional response.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures the accurate segregation of sister 
      chromatids during mitosis. Activation of the SAC occurs through a series of
      ordered molecular events that result in recruitment of Mad1:Mad2 complexes to
      improperly attached kinetochores. The current model involves sequential
      phospho-dependent recruitment of Bub3:Bub1 to KNL1 followed by binding of
      Mad1:Mad2 to Bub1. Here, we show in non-transformed diploid human cells that the 
      KNL1-Bub3-Bub1 (KBB) pathway is required during normal mitotic progression when
      kinetochores are misaligned but is nonessential for SAC activation and Mad2
      loading when kinetochores are unattached from microtubules. We provide evidence
      that the Rod-ZW10-Zwilch (RZZ) complex is necessary to recruit Mad1:Mad2 to, and 
      delay anaphase onset in response to, unattached kinetochores independently of the
      KBB pathway. These data suggest that the KBB and RZZ complexes provide two
      distinct kinetochore receptors for Mad1:Mad2 and reveal mechanistic differences
      between SAC activation by unattached and improperly attached kinetochores.

AB  - The immediate responses to inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis in
      yeast are altered phospholipid levels, slow growth, and defects in the morphology
      and localization of ER and mitochondria. With chronic lipid imbalance, yeast
      adapt. Lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and conversion of phospholipids to
      triacylglycerol are required for restoring some phospholipids to near-wild-type
      levels. We confirmed that the unfolded protein response is activated by this
      lipid stress and find that Hsp104p is recruited to ER aggregates. We also find
      that LDs form at ER aggregates, contain polyubiquitinated proteins and an ER
      chaperone, and are degraded in the vacuole by a process resembling
      microautophagy. This process, microlipophagy, is required for restoration of
      organelle morphology and cell growth during adaptation to lipid stress.
      Microlipophagy does not require ATG7 but does requires ESCRT components and a
      newly identified class E VPS protein that localizes to ER and is upregulated by
      lipid imbalance.

AB  - The cerebral cortex contains layers of neurons sequentially generated by distinct
      lineage-related progenitors. At the onset of corticogenesis, the first-born
      progenitors are apical progenitors (APs), whose asymmetric division gives birth
      directly to neurons. Later, they switch to indirect neurogenesis by generating
      intermediate progenitors (IPs), which give rise to projection neurons of all
      cortical layers. While a direct lineage relationship between APs and IPs has been
      established, the molecular mechanism that controls their transition remains
      elusive. Here we show that interfering with codon translation speed triggers ER
      stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), further impairing the generation 
      of IPs and leading to microcephaly. Moreover, we demonstrate that a progressive
      downregulation of UPR in cortical progenitors acts as a physiological signal to
      amplify IPs and promotes indirect neurogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal a
      contribution of UPR to cell fate acquisition during mammalian brain development.

AB  - Many guidance receptors are proteolytically cleaved by membrane-associated
      metalloproteases of the ADAM family, leading to the shedding of their
      ectodomains. Ectodomain shedding is crucial for receptor signaling and function, 
      but how this process is controlled in neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we
      show that the transmembrane protein Lrig2 negatively regulates ADAM-mediated
      guidance receptor proteolysis in neurons. Lrig2 binds Neogenin, a receptor for
      repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs), and prevents premature Neogenin shedding by 
      ADAM17 (TACE). RGMa reduces Lrig2-Neogenin interactions, providing ADAM17 access 
      to Neogenin and allowing this protease to induce ectodomain shedding. Regulation 
      of ADAM17-mediated Neogenin cleavage by Lrig2 is required for neurite growth
      inhibition by RGMa in vitro and for cortical neuron migration in vivo.
      Furthermore, knockdown of Lrig2 significantly improves CNS axon regeneration.
      Together, our data identify a unique ligand-gated mechanism to control receptor
      shedding by ADAMs and reveal functions for Lrigs in neuron migration and
      regenerative failure.

AB  - The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures that mitotic cells only segregate their
      sister chromatids once all chromosomes are attached via kinetochores by
      microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Reporting in Developmental Cell, Silio et
      al. (2015) show that in human cells the signaling cascade controlling the
      checkpoint operates through two separate branches.

AB  - Using light to control cell and animal behavior has opened up many avenues of
      research in neuroscience and cell biology, but applications in developmental
      biology have been limited thus far. Guglielmi et al. (2015) now apply optogenetic
      tools to control cortical contractility and tissue morphogenesis in Drosophila
      embryos.

AB  - Recent advances suggest that phase transitions of proteins into liquid or
      hydrogel states could underlie pathological protein aggregation associated with
      neurodegenerative disease. In a recent issue of Neuron, Murakami et al. (2015)
      demonstrate that ALS-associated FUS mutations abrogate the reversibility of
      condensed liquids and/or hydrogels, leading to neurotoxicity in C. elegans.

AB  - Progression from brown preadipocytes to adipocytes engages two transcriptional
      programs: the expression of adipogenic genes common to both brown fat (BAT) and
      white fat (WAT), and the expression of BAT-selective genes. However, the dynamics
      of chromatin states and epigenetic enzymes involved remain poorly understood.
      Here we show that BAT development is selectively marked and guided by repressive 
      H3K27me3 and is executed by its demethylase Jmjd3. We find that a significant
      subset of BAT-selective genes, but not common fat genes or WAT-selective genes,
      are demarcated by H3K27me3 in both brown and white preadipocytes. Jmjd3-catalyzed
      removal of H3K27me3, in part through Rreb1-mediated recruitment, is required for 
      expression of BAT-selective genes and for development of beige adipocytes both in
      vitro and in vivo. Moreover, gain- and loss-of-function Jmjd3 transgenic mice
      show age-dependent body weight reduction and cold intolerance, respectively.
      Together, we identify an epigenetic mechanism governing BAT fate determination
      and WAT plasticity.

AB  - Drosophila Orb, the homolog of vertebrate CPEB, is a key translational regulator 
      involved in oocyte polarity and maturation through poly(A) tail elongation of
      specific mRNAs. orb also has an essential function during early oogenesis that
      has not been addressed at the molecular level. Here, we show that orb prevents
      cell death during early oogenesis, thus allowing oogenesis to progress. It does
      so through the repression of autophagy by directly repressing, together with the 
      CCR4 deadenylase, the translation of Autophagy-specific gene 12 (Atg12) mRNA.
      Autophagy and cell death observed in orb mutant ovaries are reduced by decreasing
      Atg12 or other Atg mRNA levels. These results reveal a role of Orb in
      translational repression and identify autophagy as an essential pathway regulated
      by Orb during early oogenesis. Importantly, they also establish translational
      regulation as a major mode of control of autophagy, a key process in cell
      homeostasis in response to environmental cues.

AB  - Integrin adhesions assemble and mature in response to ligand binding and
      mechanical factors, but the molecular-level organization is not known. We report 
      that approximately 100-nm clusters of approximately 50 beta3-activated integrins 
      form very early adhesions under a wide variety of conditions on RGD surfaces.
      These adhesions form similarly on fluid and rigid substrates, but most adhesions 
      are transient on rigid substrates. Without talin or actin polymerization, few
      early adhesions form, but expression of either the talin head or rod domain in
      talin-depleted cells restores early adhesion formation. Mutation of the integrin 
      binding site in the talin rod decreases cluster size. We suggest that the
      integrin clusters constitute universal early adhesions and that they are the
      modular units of cell matrix adhesions. They require the association of activated
      integrins with cytoplasmic proteins, in particular talin and actin, and
      cytoskeletal contraction on them causes adhesion maturation for cell motility and
      growth.

AB  - Yeast cells track gradients of pheromones to locate mating partners. Intuition
      suggests that uniform distribution of pheromone receptors over the cell surface
      would yield optimal gradient sensing. However, yeast cells display polarized
      receptors. The benefit of such polarization was unknown. During gradient
      tracking, cell growth is directed by a patch of polarity regulators that wanders 
      around the cortex. Patch movement is sensitive to pheromone dose, with wandering 
      reduced on the up-gradient side of the cell, resulting in net growth in that
      direction. Mathematical modeling suggests that active receptors and associated G 
      proteins lag behind the polarity patch and act as an effective drag on patch
      movement. In vivo, the polarity patch is trailed by a G protein-rich domain, and 
      this polarized distribution of G proteins is required to constrain patch
      wandering. Our findings explain why G protein polarization is beneficial and
      illuminate a novel mechanism for gradient tracking.

AB  - Current gene expression network approaches commonly focus on transcription
      factors (TFs), biasing network-based discovery efforts away from potentially
      important non-TF proteins. We developed proximity analysis, a network
      reconstruction method that uses topological constraints of scale-free,
      small-world biological networks to reconstruct relationships in eukaryotic
      systems, independent of subcellular localization. Proximity analysis identified
      MPZL3 as a highly connected hub that is strongly induced during epidermal
      differentiation. MPZL3 was essential for normal differentiation, acting
      downstream of p63, ZNF750, KLF4, and RCOR1, each of which bound near the MPZL3
      gene and controlled its expression. MPZL3 protein localized to mitochondria,
      where it interacted with FDXR, which was itself also found to be essential for
      differentiation. Together, MPZL3 and FDXR increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      to drive epidermal differentiation. ROS-induced differentiation is dependent upon
      promotion of FDXR enzymatic activity by MPZL3. ROS induction by the MPZL3 and
      FDXR mitochondrial proteins is therefore essential for epidermal differentiation.

AB  - Control of tissue dimensions in multicellular organisms requires the precise
      quantitative regulation of mitotic activity. In plants, where cells are immobile,
      tissue size is achieved through control of both cell division orientation and
      mitotic rate. The bHLH transcription factor heterodimer formed by target of
      monopteros5 (TMO5) and lonesome highway (LHW) is a central regulator of vascular 
      width-increasing divisions. An important unanswered question is how its activity 
      is limited to specify vascular tissue dimensions. Here we identify a regulatory
      network that restricts TMO5/LHW activity. We show that thermospermine synthase
      ACAULIS5 antagonizes TMO5/LHW activity by promoting the accumulation of
      SAC51-LIKE (SACL) bHLH transcription factors. SACL proteins heterodimerize with
      LHW-therefore likely competing with TMO5/LHW interactions-prevent activation of
      TMO5/LHW target genes, and suppress the over-proliferation caused by excess
      TMO5/LHW activity. These findings connect two thus-far disparate pathways and
      provide a mechanistic understanding of the quantitative control of vascular
      tissue growth.

AB  - Axon extension at the growing tip requires elevated local protein supply, with a 
      capability sustainable over long axons in varying environments. The exact
      mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Here we report that axon-promoting factors
      elicited a retrograde transport-dependent removal of proteasomes from nascent
      axon terminals, thereby increasing protein stability at axon tips. Such an effect
      occurred through phosphorylation of a dynein-interacting proteasome adaptor
      protein Ecm29. During the transition from immature neurites to nascent axons in
      cultured hippocampal neurons, live-cell imaging revealed a significant increase
      of the retrograde axonal transport of fluorescently labeled 20S proteasomes. This
      retrograde proteasome transport depended on neuron stage and increased with axon 
      lengths. Blockade of retrograde transport caused accumulation of proteasomes,
      reduction of axon growth, and attenuation of growth-associated Par6 at the axon
      tip of newly polarized neurons. Our results delineate a regulatory mechanism that
      controls proteasome abundance via preferential transport required for axon
      development in newborn neurons.

AB  - Positional information derived from local morphogen concentration plays an
      important role in patterning. A key question is how morphogen diffusion and gene 
      expression regulation shape positional information into an appropriate profile
      with suitably low noise. We address this question using a model system--the C.
      elegans germline--whose regulatory network has been well characterized
      genetically but whose spatiotemporal dynamics are poorly understood. We show that
      diffusion within the germline syncytium is a critical control of stem cell
      differentiation and that semi-permeable diffusion barriers present at key
      locations make it possible--in combination with a feedback loop in the germline
      regulatory network--for mitotic zone size to be robust against spatial noise in
      Notch signaling. Spatial averaging within compartments defined by diffusion
      barriers is an advantageous patterning strategy, which attenuates noise while
      still allowing for sharp transitions between compartments. This strategy could
      apply to other organs.

AB  - Inhibition of GSK3 by Wnt signaling stabilizes many cellular proteins, but proof 
      that this effect is independent of beta-catenin-mediated transcription is
      lacking. Koch, Acebron, and colleagues (2015) now demonstrate that
      transcriptionally silent mammalian sperm require Wnt signaling via exosomes to
      prevent protein degradation during their lengthy travels through the epididymis.

AB  - Connexins and connexin channels play important roles in cell
      growth/differentiation and tumorigenesis. Here, we identified a relationship
      between a connexin molecule and a critical cell-cycle regulator. Our data show
      that connexin (Cx) 50 regulated lens cell-cycle progression and differentiation
      by modulating expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/p57 and E3
      ubiquitin ligase Skp2. Cx50 directly interacted with and retained Skp2 in the
      cytosol by masking the nuclear targeting domain of Skp2, and this effect was
      supported by an increased nuclear localization of Skp2, disruption of Skp2
      interaction with importin-7, and decreased levels of p27/p57 in mouse lenses
      lacking Cx50. As a result, Cx50 increased auto-ubiquitination and subsequent
      degradation of Skp2. A mutation (V362E) on the C terminus of Cx50 disrupted the
      interaction between Cx50 and Skp2 and completely abolished such effects.
      Therefore, this study identifies a role for connexins in regulating cell-cycle
      modulators and, consequently, cell growth and differentiation.

AB  - Directional cell growth requires that cells read and interpret shallow chemical
      gradients, but how the gradient directional information is identified remains
      elusive. We use single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to define the
      cellular gradient decoding network in yeast. Our results demonstrate that the
      spatial information of the gradient signal is read locally within the polarity
      site complex using double-positive feedback between the GTPase Cdc42 and
      trafficking of the receptor Ste2. Spatial decoding critically depends on low
      Cdc42 activity, which is maintained by the MAPK Fus3 through sequestration of the
      Cdc42 activator Cdc24. Deregulated Cdc42 or Ste2 trafficking prevents gradient
      decoding and leads to mis-oriented growth. Our work discovers how a conserved set
      of components assembles a network integrating signal intensity and directionality
      to decode the spatial information contained in chemical gradients.

AB  - While cilia are recognized as important signaling organelles, the extent of
      ciliary functions remains unknown because of difficulties in cataloguing proteins
      from mammalian primary cilia. We present a method that readily captures rapid
      snapshots of the ciliary proteome by selectively biotinylating ciliary proteins
      using a cilia-targeted proximity labeling enzyme (cilia-APEX). Besides
      identifying known ciliary proteins, cilia-APEX uncovered several ciliary
      signaling molecules. The kinases PKA, AMPK, and LKB1 were validated as bona fide 
      ciliary proteins and PKA was found to regulate Hedgehog signaling in primary
      cilia. Furthermore, proteomics profiling of Ift27/Bbs19 mutant cilia correctly
      detected BBSome accumulation inside Ift27(-/-) cilia and revealed that
      beta-arrestin 2 and the viral receptor CAR are candidate cargoes of the BBSome.
      This work demonstrates that proximity labeling can be applied to proteomics of
      non-membrane-enclosed organelles and suggests that proteomics profiling of cilia 
      will enable a rapid and powerful characterization of ciliopathies.

AB  - Reliable and quantifiable high-resolution protein localization is critical for
      understanding protein function. However, the time required to clone and
      characterize any protein of interest is a significant bottleneck, especially for 
      electron microscopy (EM). We present a modular system for enzyme-based protein
      tagging that allows for improved speed and sampling for analysis of subcellular
      protein distributions using existing clone libraries to EM-resolution. We
      demonstrate that we can target a modified soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) to 
      any GFP-tagged protein of interest by engineering a GFP-binding peptide (GBP)
      directly to the APEX-tag. We demonstrate that APEX-GBP (1) significantly reduces 
      the time required to characterize subcellular protein distributions of whole
      libraries to less than 3 days, (2) provides remarkable high-resolution
      localization of proteins to organelle subdomains, and (3) allows EM localization 
      of GFP-tagged proteins, including proteins expressed at endogenous levels, in
      vivo by crossing existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines with APEX-GBP
      transgenic lines.

AB  - A biochemical explanation of development from the fertilized egg to the adult
      requires an understanding of the proteins and RNAs expressed over time during
      embryogenesis. We present a comprehensive characterization of protein and mRNA
      dynamics across early development in Xenopus. Surprisingly, we find that most
      protein levels change little and duplicated genes are expressed similarly. While 
      the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is poor, a mass action kinetics
      model parameterized using protein synthesis and degradation rates regresses
      protein dynamics to RNA dynamics, corrected for initial protein concentration.
      This study provides detailed data for absolute levels of approximately 10,000
      proteins and approximately 28,000 transcripts via a convenient web portal, a rich
      resource for developmental biologists. It underscores the lasting impact of
      maternal dowry, finds surprisingly few cases where degradation alone drives a
      change in protein level, and highlights the importance of transcription in
      shaping the dynamics of the embryonic proteome.

AB  - Naive pluripotency is manifest in the preimplantation mammalian embryo. Here we
      determine transcriptome dynamics of mouse development from the eight-cell stage
      to postimplantation using lineage-specific RNA sequencing. This method combines
      high sensitivity and reporter-based fate assignment to acquire the full spectrum 
      of gene expression from discrete embryonic cell types. We define expression
      modules indicative of developmental state and temporal regulatory patterns
      marking the establishment and dissolution of naive pluripotency in vivo. Analysis
      of embryonic stem cells and diapaused embryos reveals near-complete conservation 
      of the core transcriptional circuitry operative in the preimplantation epiblast. 
      Comparison to inner cell masses of marmoset primate blastocysts identifies a
      similar complement of pluripotency factors but use of alternative signaling
      pathways. Embryo culture experiments further indicate that marmoset embryos
      utilize WNT signaling during early lineage segregation, unlike rodents. These
      findings support a conserved transcription factor foundation for naive
      pluripotency while revealing species-specific regulatory features of lineage
      segregation.

AB  - An early event in skeletal joint development is the specification of articular
      chondrocytes at the joint surface. Articular chondrocytes are distinct in
      producing lower levels of cartilage matrix and not being replaced by bone, yet
      how they acquire these properties remains poorly understood. Here, we show that
      two members of the Iroquois transcriptional repressor family, Irx7 and Irx5a,
      function to block chondrocyte maturation at the developing hyoid joint of
      zebrafish. These Irx factors suppress the production of cartilage matrix at the
      joint in part by preventing the activation of a col2a1a enhancer by Sox9a.
      Further, both zebrafish Irx7 and mouse IRX1 are able to repress cartilage matrix 
      production in a murine chondrogenic cell line. Iroquois proteins may therefore
      have a conserved role in keeping chondrocytes in an immature state, with the
      lower levels of cartilage matrix produced by these immature cells contributing to
      joint flexibility.

      Is a Key Regulator of Cell Protrusions.

AB  - Polarization of cells into a protrusive front and a retracting cell body is the
      hallmark of mesenchymal-like cell migration. Many mRNAs are localized to
      protrusions, but it is unclear to what degree mRNA localization contributes
      toward protrusion formation. We performed global quantitative analysis of the
      distributions of mRNAs, proteins, and translation rates between protrusions and
      the cell body by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative proteomics. Our
      results reveal local translation as a key determinant of protein localization to 
      protrusions. Accordingly, inhibition of local translation destabilizes
      protrusions and inhibits mesenchymal-like morphology. Interestingly, many mRNAs
      localized to protrusions are translationally repressed. Specific cis-regulatory
      elements within mRNA UTRs define whether mRNAs are locally translated or
      repressed. Finally, RNAi screening of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) enriched in
      protrusions revealed trans-regulators of localized translation that are
      functionally important for protrusions. We propose that by deciphering the
      localized mRNA UTR code, these proteins regulate protrusion stability and
      mesenchymal-like morphology.

AB  - Asymmetric localization of RNA is a widely observed mechanism of cell
      polarization. Using embryos of the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, we previously
      showed that mesoderm and endoderm fates are separated by localization of mRNA
      encoding a transcription factor, Not, to the future mesoderm-side cytoplasm of
      the mesendoderm cell through asymmetric positioning of the nucleus. Here, we
      investigated the mechanism that defines the direction of the nuclear migration.
      We show that localization of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to the future mesoderm region
      determines the direction of nuclear migration. Localization of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
      was dependent on the localization of PI3Kalpha to the future mesoderm region.
      PI3Kalpha was first localized at the 1-cell stage by the ooplasmic movement.
      Activity of localized PI3Kalpha at the 4-cell stage was required for the
      localization of PI3Kalpha up to the nuclear migration. Our results provide the
      scaffold for understanding the chain of causality leading to the separation of
      germ layer fates.

AB  - The mammalian lung forms its elaborate tree-like structure following a largely
      stereotypical branching sequence. While a number of genes have been identified to
      play essential roles in lung branching, what coordinates the choice between
      branch growth and new branch formation has not been elucidated. Here we show that
      loss of FGF-activated transcription factor genes, Etv4 and Etv5 (collectively
      Etv), led to prolonged branch tip growth and delayed new branch formation.
      Unexpectedly, this phenotype is more similar to mutants with increased rather
      than decreased FGF activity. Indeed, an increased Fgf10 expression is observed,
      and reducing Fgf10 dosage can attenuate the Etv mutant phenotype. Further
      evidence indicates that ETV inhibits Fgf10 via directly promoting Shh expression.
      SHH in turn inhibits local Fgf10 expression and redirects growth, thereby
      initiating new branches. Together, our findings establish ETV as a key node in
      the FGF-ETV-SHH inhibitory feedback loop that dictates branching periodicity.

AB  - Light regulates major plant developmental transitions by orchestrating a series
      of nuclear events. This study uncovers the molecular function of the natural
      variant, TZP (Tandem Zinc-finger-Plus3), as a signal integrator of light and
      photoperiodic pathways in transcriptional nuclear foci. We report that TZP acts
      as a positive regulator of photoperiodic flowering via physical interactions with
      the red-light receptor phytochrome B (phyB). We demonstrate that TZP localizes in
      dynamic nuclear domains regulated by light quality and photoperiod. This study
      shows that phyB is indispensable not only for localizing TZP to transcriptionally
      active nuclear photobodies, but also for recruiting TZP on the promoter of the
      floral inducer FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Our findings signify a unique
      transcriptional regulatory role to the highly enigmatic plant nuclear
      photobodies, where TZP directly activates FT gene expression and promotes
      flowering.

AB  - The insulin-like peptide (ILP) family plays key biological roles in the control
      of body growth. Although the functions of ILPs are well understood, the
      mechanisms by which organisms sense their nutrient status and thereby control ILP
      production remain largely unknown. Here, we show that signaling relay and
      feedback mechanisms control the nutrient-dependent expression of Drosophila ILP5 
      (Dilp5). The expression of dilp5 in brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs) is
      negatively regulated by the transcription factor FoxO. Glia-derived Dilp6
      remotely regulates the FoxO activity in IPCs, primarily through Jeb secreted by
      cholinergic neurons. Dilp6 production by surface glia is amplified by cellular
      response to circulating Dilps derived from IPCs, in concert with amino acid
      signals. The induction of dilp5 is critical for sustaining body growth under
      restricted food conditions. These results provide a molecular framework that
      explains how the production of an endocrine hormone in a specific tissue is
      coordinated with environmental conditions.

AB  - Actin polymerization powers membrane deformation during many processes, including
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). During CME in yeast, actin polymerization is
      triggered and coordinated by a six-protein WASP/Myosin complex that includes
      WASP, class I myosins (Myo3 and Myo5), WIP (Vrp1), and two other proteins. We
      show that a single engineered protein can replace this entire complex while still
      supporting CME. This engineered protein reveals that the WASP/Myosin complex has 
      four essential activities: recruitment to endocytic sites, anchorage to the
      plasma membrane, Arp2/3 activation, and transient actin filament binding by the
      motor domain. The requirement for both membrane and F-actin binding reveals that 
      myosin-mediated coupling between actin filaments and the base of endocytic sites 
      is essential for allowing actin polymerization to drive membrane invagination.

AB  - The basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) proteins represent a well-known class of
      transcriptional regulators. Many bHLH proteins act as heterodimers with members
      of a class of ubiquitous partners, the E proteins. A widely expressed class of
      inhibitory heterodimer partners-the Inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) proteins-also
      exists. Genetic and molecular analyses in humans and in knockout mice implicate E
      proteins and ID proteins in a wide variety of diseases, belying the notion that
      they are non-specific partner proteins. Here, we explore relationships of E
      proteins and ID proteins to a variety of disease processes and highlight gaps in 
      knowledge of disease mechanisms.

AB  - CHK-2 kinase is a master regulator of meiosis in C. elegans. Its activity is
      required for homolog pairing and synapsis and for double-strand break formation, 
      but how it drives and coordinates these pathways to ensure crossover formation
      remains unknown. Here we show that CHK-2 promotes pairing and synapsis by
      phosphorylating a family of zinc finger proteins that bind to specialized regions
      on each chromosome known as pairing centers, priming their recruitment of the
      Polo-like kinase PLK-2. This knowledge enabled the development of a
      phospho-specific antibody as a tool to monitor CHK-2 activity. When either
      synapsis or crossover formation is impaired, CHK-2 activity is prolonged, and
      meiotic progression is delayed. We show that this common feedback circuit is
      mediated by interactions among a network of HORMA domain proteins within the
      chromosome axis and generates a graded signal. These findings reveal conserved
      regulatory mechanisms that ensure faithful meiotic chromosome segregation in
      diverse species.

AB  - Determination of left-right asymmetry in mouse embryos is established by a
      leftward fluid flow that is generated by clockwise rotation of node cilia. How
      node cilia achieve stable unidirectional rotation has remained unknown, however. 
      Here we show that brief exposure to the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel
      (Taxol) induces randomly directed rotation and changes the ultrastructure of node
      cilia. In vivo observations and a computer simulation revealed that a regular 9+0
      arrangement of doublet microtubules is essential for stable unidirectional
      rotation of node cilia. The 9+2 motile cilia of the airway, which manifest planar
      beating, are resistant to Taxol treatment. However, the airway cilia of mice
      lacking the radial spoke head protein Rsph4a undergo rotational movement instead 
      of planar beating, are prone to microtubule rearrangement, and are sensitive to
      Taxol. Our results suggest that the absence of radial spokes allows node cilia to
      rotate unidirectionally but, as a trade-off, renders them ultrastructurally
      fragile.

AB  - The small GTPase Rab11 dynamically changes its location to regulate various
      cellular processes such as endocytic recycling, secretion, and cytokinesis.
      However, our knowledge of its upstream regulators is still limited. Here, we
      identify the RAB-11-interacting protein-1 (REI-1) as a unique family of guanine
      nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RAB-11 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Although
      REI-1 and its human homolog SH3-binding protein 5 do not contain any known
      Rab-GEF domains, they exhibited strong GEF activity toward Rab11 in vitro. In C. 
      elegans, REI-1 is expressed in the germline and co-localizes with RAB-11 on the
      late-Golgi membranes. The loss of REI-1 specifically impaired the targeting of
      RAB-11 to the late-Golgi compartment and the recycling endosomes in embryos and
      further reduced the RAB-11 distribution to the cleavage furrow, which resulted in
      cytokinesis delay. These results suggest that REI-1 is a GEF specifically
      regulating the RAB-11 localization and functions in early embryos.

TI  - Amphiphysin 2 Orchestrates Nucleus Positioning and Shape by Linking the Nuclear
      Envelope to the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeleton.

AB  - Nucleus positioning is key for intracellular organization, cell differentiation, 
      and organ development and is affected in many diseases, including myopathies due 
      to alteration in amphiphysin-2 (BIN1). The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons
      are essential for nucleus positioning, but their crosstalk in this process is
      sparsely characterized. Here, we report that impairment of amphiphysin/BIN1 in
      Caenorhabditis elegans, mammalian cells, or muscles from patients with
      centronuclear myopathy alters nuclear position and shape. We show that
      AMPH-1/BIN1 binds to nesprin and actin, as well as to the microtubule-binding
      protein CLIP170 in both species. Expression of the microtubule-anchoring CAP-GLY 
      domain of CLIP170 fused to the nuclear-envelope-anchoring KASH domain of nesprin 
      rescues nuclear positioning defects of amph-1 mutants. Amphiphysins thus play a
      central role in linking the nuclear envelope with the actin and microtubule
      cytoskeletons. We propose that BIN1 has a direct and evolutionarily conserved
      role in nuclear positioning, altered in myopathies.

AB  - Morphogen signaling is critical for the growth and patterning of tissues in
      embryos and adults, but how morphogen signaling gradients are generated in
      tissues remains controversial. The morphogen Nodal was proposed to form a
      long-range signaling gradient via a reaction-diffusion system, on the basis of
      differential diffusion rates of Nodal and its antagonist Lefty. Here we use a
      specific zebrafish Nodal biosensor combined with immunofluorescence for
      phosphorylated Smad2 to demonstrate that endogenous Nodal is unlikely to diffuse 
      over a long range. Instead, short-range Nodal signaling activation in a temporal 
      window is sufficient to determine the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain.
      The size of this temporal window is set by the differentially timed production of
      Nodal and Lefty, which arises mainly from repression of Lefty translation by the 
      microRNA miR-430. Thus, temporal information is transformed into spatial
      information to define the dimensions of the Nodal signaling domain and,
      consequently, to specify mesendoderm.

AB  - Despite critical roles in development and cancer, the mechanisms that specify
      invasive cellular behavior are poorly understood. Through a screen of
      transcription factors in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified G1 cell-cycle
      arrest as a precisely regulated requirement of the anchor cell (AC) invasion
      program. We show that the nuclear receptor nhr-67/tlx directs the AC into G1
      arrest in part through regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor cki-1.
      Loss of nhr-67 resulted in non-invasive, mitotic ACs that failed to express
      matrix metalloproteinases or actin regulators and lack invadopodia, F-actin-rich 
      membrane protrusions that facilitate invasion. We further show that G1 arrest is 
      necessary for the histone deacetylase HDA-1, a key regulator of differentiation, 
      to promote pro-invasive gene expression and invadopodia formation. Together,
      these results suggest that invasive cell fate requires G1 arrest and that
      strategies targeting both G1-arrested and actively cycling cells may be needed to
      halt metastatic cancer.

AB  - Cells display dynamic and diverse morphologies during development, but the
      strategies by which differentiated tissues achieve precise shapes and patterns
      are not well understood. Here we identify a developmental program that generates 
      a highly ordered square cell grid in the Drosophila embryo through sequential and
      spatially regulated cell alignment, oriented cell division, and apicobasal cell
      elongation. The basic leucine zipper transcriptional regulator Cnc is necessary
      and sufficient to produce a square cell grid in the presence of a midline signal 
      provided by the EGF receptor ligand Spitz. Spitz orients cell divisions through a
      Pins/LGN-dependent spindle-positioning mechanism and controls cell shape and
      alignment through a transcriptional pathway that requires the Pointed ETS domain 
      protein. These results identify a strategy for producing ordered square cell
      packing configurations in epithelia and reveal a molecular mechanism by which
      organized tissue structure is generated through spatiotemporally regulated
      responses to EGF receptor activation.

AB  - For over 15 years, antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) have allowed
      developmental biologists to make key discoveries regarding developmental
      mechanisms in numerous model organisms. Recently, serious concerns have been
      raised as to the specificity of MO effects, and it has been recommended to
      discontinue their usage, despite the long experience of the scientific community 
      with the MO tool in thousands of studies. Reviewing the many advantages afforded 
      by MOs, we conclude that adequately controlled MOs should continue to be accepted
      as generic loss-of-function approach, as otherwise progress in developmental
      biology will greatly suffer.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Matus et al. (2015) reveal that to invade
      past basement membrane, the C. elegans anchor cell must cease dividing before
      differentiating and expressing pro-invasion genes. This demonstration of invasion
      and proliferation as mutually incompatible cell states has implications for our
      understanding of cancer metastasis.

AB  - Centrioles are essential for cilia and centrosome assembly. In
      centriole-containing cells, centrioles always form juxtaposed to pre-existing
      ones, motivating a century-old debate on centriole biogenesis control. Here, we
      show that trans-autoactivation of Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), the trigger of
      centriole biogenesis, is a critical event in the spatial control of that process.
      We demonstrate that centrioles promote PLK4 activation through its recruitment
      and local accumulation. Though centriole removal reduces the proportion of active
      PLK4, this is rescued by concentrating PLK4 to the peroxisome lumen. Moreover,
      while mild overexpression of PLK4 only triggers centriole amplification at the
      existing centriole, higher PLK4 levels trigger both centriolar and cytoplasmatic 
      (de novo) biogenesis. Hence, centrioles promote their assembly locally and
      disfavor de novo synthesis. Similar mechanisms enforcing the local concentration 
      and/or activity of other centriole components are likely to contribute to the
      spatial control of centriole biogenesis under physiological conditions.

AB  - The Par polarity complex creates mutually exclusive cortical domains in diverse
      animal cells. Activity of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a key output of
      the Par complex as phosphorylation removes substrates from the Par domain. Here, 
      we investigate how diverse, apparently unrelated Par substrates couple
      phosphorylation to cortical displacement. Each protein contains a basic and
      hydrophobic (BH) motif that interacts directly with phospholipids and also
      overlaps with aPKC phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation alters the
      electrostatic character of the sequence, inhibiting interaction with
      phospholipids and the cell cortex. We searched for overlapping BH and aPKC
      phosphorylation site motifs (i.e., putative phosphoregulated BH motifs) in
      several animal proteomes. Candidate proteins with strong PRBH signals associated 
      with the cell cortex but were displaced into the cytoplasm by aPKC. These
      findings demonstrate a potentially general mechanism for exclusion of proteins
      from the Par cortical domain in polarized cells.

AB  - Dynamic maintenance of cell polarity is essential for development and physiology.
      Here we combine experiments and modeling to elucidate mechanisms that maintain
      cortical polarity in the C. elegans zygote. We show that polarity is dynamically 
      stabilized by two coupled cross-inhibitory feedback loops: one involves the
      oligomeric scaffold PAR-3 and the kinase PAR-1, and the other involves CDC-42 and
      its putative GAP CHIN-1. PAR-3 and CDC-42 are both required locally to recruit
      PAR-6/PKC-3, which inhibits PAR-1 (shown previously) and inhibits local
      growth/accumulation of CHIN-1 clusters. Conversely, PAR-1 inhibits local
      accumulation of PAR-3 oligomers, while CHIN-1 inhibits CDC-42 (shown previously),
      such that either PAR-1 or CHIN-1 can prevent recruitment of PAR-6/PKC-3, but loss
      of both causes complete loss of polarity. Ultrasensitive dependence of CHIN-1
      cluster growth on PAR-6/PKC-3 endows this core circuit with bistable dynamics,
      while transport of CHIN-1 clusters by cortical flow can stabilize the AP boundary
      against diffusive spread of PAR-6/PKC-3.

AB  - Precise positioning of dendritic branches is a critical step in the establishment
      of neuronal circuitry. However, there is limited knowledge on how environmental
      cues translate into dendrite initiation or branching at a specific position.
      Here, through a combination of mutation, RNAi, and imaging experiments, we found 
      that a Dscam-Dock-Pak1 hierarchical interaction defines the stereotypical
      dendrite growth site in the Drosophila aCC motoneuron. This interaction localizes
      the Cdc42 effector Pak1 to the plasma membrane at the dendrite initiation site
      before the activation of Cdc42. Ectopic expression of membrane-anchored Pak1
      overrides this spatial specification of dendritogenesis, confirming its function 
      in guiding Cdc42 signaling. We further discovered that Dscam1 localization in aCC
      occurs through an inter-neuronal contact that involves Dscam1 in the partner MP1 
      neuron. These findings elucidate a mechanism by which Dscam1 controls neuronal
      morphogenesis through spatial regulation of Cdc42 signaling and, subsequently,
      cytoskeletal remodeling.

AB  - During fetal development, nephrons of the metanephric kidney form from a
      mesenchymal progenitor population that differentiates en masse before or shortly 
      after birth. We explored intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms controlling
      progenitor lifespan in a transplantation assay that allowed us to compare
      engraftment of old and young progenitors into the same young niche. The
      progenitors displayed an age-dependent decrease in proliferation and concomitant 
      increase in niche exit rates. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed
      progressive age-dependent changes, with heterogeneity increasing in older
      populations. Age-dependent elevation in mTor and reduction in Fgf20 could
      contribute to increased exit rates. Importantly, 30% of old progenitors remained 
      in the niche for up to 1 week post engraftment, a net gain of 50% to their
      lifespan, but only if surrounded by young neighbors. We provide evidence in
      support of a model in which intrinsic age-dependent changes affect
      inter-progenitor interactions that drive cessation of nephrogenesis.

AB  - Developmental Hedgehog signaling controls proliferation of cerebellar granule
      cell precursors (GCPs), and its aberrant activation is a leading cause of
      medulloblastoma. We show here that Hedgehog promotes polyamine biosynthesis in
      GCPs by engaging a non-canonical axis leading to the translation of ornithine
      decarboxylase (ODC). This process is governed by AMPK, which phosphorylates
      threonine 173 of the zinc finger protein CNBP in response to Hedgehog activation.
      Phosphorylated CNBP increases its association with Sufu, followed by CNBP
      stabilization, ODC translation, and polyamine biosynthesis. Notably, CNBP, ODC,
      and polyamines are elevated in Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma, and genetic or
      pharmacological inhibition of this axis efficiently blocks Hedgehog-dependent
      proliferation of medulloblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data
      illustrate an auxiliary mechanism of metabolic control by a morphogenic pathway
      with relevant implications in development and cancer.

AB  - This Perspective considers how classical cadherin cell-cell adhesion receptors
      are organized at the nanoscale to generate lateral clusters. Recent advances in
      optical microscopy reveal that clustering constitutes a general feature of
      cadherin organization, but one that takes diverse forms. Here we consider the
      molecular mechanisms responsible for cadherin clustering and their functional
      implications. We frame our discussion in light of what is known about how
      nanoscale organization is conferred upon the plasma membrane, through
      protein-protein interactions, regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, and 
      the lipid environment of the membrane.

AB  - In excitable cells, regulated exocytosis is coupled to endocytic membrane
      retrieval. Yuan et al. (2015) in this issue of Developmental Cell report a
      possible mechanism for such exo-endocytic coupling that is based on
      stimulation-induced hopping of clathrin-containing endocytic structures to
      nascent sites of insulin granule fusion.

AB  - Adherens junctions (AJs) play a crucial role in epithelial tissue development and
      tumorigenesis, and the mechanisms controlling their assembly and disassembly have
      therefore attracted considerable attention. A paper from Tsur et al. (2015) in
      this issue of Developmental Cell now shows how sumoylation and desumoylation of
      E-cadherin promotes its recruitment to AJs.

AB  - Although we know that mesenchymal progenitors give rise to nephrons in the
      kidney, how they balance self-renewal versus differentiation is still unclear. In
      this issue of Developmental Cell, Chen et al. (2015) show that nephron
      progenitors age, but not necessarily irreversibly: old progenitors can be
      "rejuvenated" by a young crowd.

      sequences in mice, lizards, and limbless snakes to reveal widespread sharing of
      enhancer activity in developing limbs and genitalia. Genetic deletion of a
      limb-genital enhancer demonstrates that common regulatory elements affect

AB  - Migrating fibroblasts undergo contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a process
      that was discovered five decades ago and still is not fully understood at the
      molecular level. We identify the Slit2-Robo4-srGAP2 signaling network as a key
      regulator of CIL in fibroblasts. CIL involves highly dynamic contact protrusions 
      with a specialized actin cytoskeleton that stochastically explore cell-cell
      overlaps between colliding fibroblasts. A membrane curvature-sensing F-BAR domain
      pre-localizes srGAP2 to protruding edges and terminates their extension phase in 
      response to cell collision. A FRET-based biosensor reveals that Rac1 activity is 
      focused in a band at the tip of contact protrusions, in contrast to the broad
      activation gradient in contact-free protrusions. SrGAP2 specifically controls the
      duration of Rac1 activity in contact protrusions, but not in contact-free
      protrusions. We propose that srGAP2 integrates cell edge curvature and
      Slit-Robo-mediated repulsive cues to fine-tune Rac1 activation dynamics in
      contact protrusions to spatiotemporally coordinate CIL.

AB  - The amniote phallus and limbs differ dramatically in their morphologies but share
      patterns of signaling and gene expression in early development. Thus far, the
      extent to which genital and limb transcriptional networks also share
      cis-regulatory elements has remained unexplored. We show that many limb enhancers
      are retained in snake genomes, suggesting that these elements may function in
      non-limb tissues. Consistent with this, our analysis of cis-regulatory activity
      in mice and Anolis lizards reveals that patterns of enhancer activity in
      embryonic limbs and genitalia overlap heavily. In mice, deletion of HLEB, an
      enhancer of Tbx4, produces defects in hindlimbs and genitalia, establishing the
      importance of this limb-genital enhancer for development of these different
      appendages. Further analyses demonstrate that the HLEB of snakes has lost
      hindlimb enhancer function while retaining genital activity. Our findings
      identify roles for Tbx4 in genital development and highlight deep similarities in
      cis-regulatory activity between limbs and genitalia.

AB  - During forebrain development, LRP2 promotes morphogen signaling as an auxiliary
      SHH receptor. However, in the developing retina, LRP2 assumes the opposing
      function, mediating endocytic clearance of SHH and antagonizing morphogen action.
      LRP2-mediated clearance prevents spread of SHH activity from the central retina
      into the retinal margin to protect quiescent progenitor cells in this niche from 
      mitogenic stimuli. Loss of LRP2 in mice increases the sensitivity of the retinal 
      margin for SHH, causing expansion of the retinal progenitor cell pool and
      hyperproliferation of this tissue. Our findings document the ability of LRP2 to
      act, in a context-dependent manner, as activator or inhibitor of the SHH pathway.
      Our current findings uncovered LRP2 activity as the molecular mechanism imposing 
      quiescence of the retinal margin in the mammalian eye and suggest SHH-induced
      proliferation of the retinal margin as cause of the large eye phenotype observed 
      in mouse models and patients with LRP2 defects.

TI  - Diacylglycerol Guides the Hopping of Clathrin-Coated Pits along Microtubules for 
      Exo-Endocytosis Coupling.

AB  - Many receptor-mediated endocytic processes are mediated by constitutive budding
      of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at spatially randomized sites before slowly
      pinching off from the plasma membrane (60-100 s). In contrast, clathrin-mediated 
      endocytosis (CME) coupled with regulated exocytosis in excitable cells occurs at 
      peri-exocytic sites shortly after vesicle fusion ( approximately 10 s). The
      molecular mechanism underlying this spatiotemporal coupling remains elusive. We
      show that coupled endocytosis makes use of pre-formed CCPs, which hop to nascent 
      fusion sites nearby following vesicle exocytosis. A dynamic cortical microtubular
      network, anchored at the cell surface by the cytoplasmic linker-associated
      protein on microtubules and the LL5beta/ELKS complex on the plasma membrane,
      provides the track for CCP hopping. Local diacylglycerol gradients generated upon

AB  - Adherens junctions (AJs) are membrane-anchored structures composed of E-cadherin 
      and associated proteins, including catenins and actin. The unique plasticity of
      AJs mediates both the rigidity and flexibility of cell-cell contacts essential
      for embryonic morphogenesis and adult tissue remodeling. We identified the SUMO
      protease ULP-2 as a regulator of AJ assembly and show that dysregulated ULP-2
      activity impairs epidermal morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. The
      conserved cytoplasmic tail of HMR-1/E-cadherin is sumoylated and is a target of
      ULP-2 desumoylation activity. Coupled sumoylation and desumoylation of HMR-1 are 
      required for its recruitment to the subapical membrane during AJ assembly and the
      formation of the linkages between AJs and the apical actin cytoskeleton.
      Sumoylation weakens HMR-1 binding to HMP-2/beta-catenin. Our study provides a
      mechanistic link between the dynamic nature of the SUMO machinery and AJ
      plasticity and highlight sumoylation as a molecular switch that modulates the
      binding of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton.

AB  - The proper organization of the microtubule-based mitotic spindle is proposed to
      depend on nanometer-sized motor proteins generating forces that scale with a
      micron-sized geometric feature, such as microtubule overlap length. However, it
      is unclear whether such regulation can be achieved by any mitotic motor protein. 
      Here, we employ an optical-trap- and total internal reflection fluorescence
      (TIRF)-based assay to show that ensembles of kinesin-5, a conserved mitotic motor
      protein, can push apart overlapping antiparallel microtubules to generate a force
      whose magnitude scales with filament overlap length. We also find that kinesin-5 
      can produce overlap-length-dependent "brake-like" resistance against relative
      microtubule sliding in both parallel and antiparallel geometries, an activity
      that has been suggested by cell biological studies but had not been directly
      measured. Together, these findings, along with numerical simulations, reveal how 
      a motor protein can function as an analog converter, "reading" simple geometric
      and dynamic features in cytoskeletal networks to produce regulated force outputs.

AB  - For glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin granules have to be
      localized close to the plasma membrane. The role of microtubule-dependent
      transport in granule positioning and GSIS has been debated. Here, we report that 
      microtubules, counterintuitively, restrict granule availability for secretion. In
      beta cells, microtubules originate at the Golgi and form a dense non-radial
      meshwork. Non-directional transport along these microtubules limits granule
      dwelling at the cell periphery, restricting granule availability for secretion.
      High glucose destabilizes microtubules, decreasing their density; such local
      microtubule depolymerization is necessary for GSIS, likely because granule
      withdrawal from the cell periphery becomes inefficient. Consistently, microtubule
      depolymerization by nocodazole blocks granule withdrawal, increases their
      concentration at exocytic sites, and dramatically enhances GSIS in vitro and in
      mice. Furthermore, glucose-driven MT destabilization is balanced by new
      microtubule formation, which likely prevents over-secretion. Importantly,
      microtubule density is greater in dysfunctional beta cells of diabetic mice.

AB  - Microglia are CNS resident macrophages, and they play important roles in neural
      development and function. Recent studies have suggested that murine microglia
      arise from a single source, the yolk sac (YS), yet these studies lack spatial
      resolution to define the bona fide source(s) for microglia. Here, using
      light-induced high temporal-spatial resolution fate mapping, we challenge this
      single-source view by showing that microglia in zebrafish arise from multiple
      sources. The embryonic/larval microglia originate from the rostral blood island
      (RBI) region, the equivalent of mouse YS for myelopoiesis, whereas the adult
      microglia arise from the ventral wall of dorsal aorta (VDA) region, a tissue also
      producing definitive hematopoiesis in mouse. We further show that the
      VDA-region-derived microglia are Runx1 dependent, but cMyb independent, and

AB  - It is becoming clear that a radical change of cell identity of differentiated
      cells in vivo, triggered by injury or other adversity, provides an essential
      route to recovery for many different mammalian tissues. This process, which we
      term adaptive cellular reprogramming, promotes regeneration in one of two ways:
      by providing a transient class of repair cells or by directly replacing cells
      lost during tissue damage. Controlling adaptive changes in cell fate in vivo in
      order to promote the body's own cell therapy, particularly by pharmacology rather
      than genetics, is likely to become an increasingly active area of future work.

AB  - How the cell builds a spindle remains an open question. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Shimamoto, Forth, and Kapoor (2015) show that kinesin-5 motor
      ensembles can exert sliding forces that scale with microtubule overlap length.
      This behavior could allow microtubule architecture-dependent modulation of force 
      and contribute to spindle self-organization.

AB  - Recent discoveries of regulated cell death in bacteria have led to speculation
      about possible benefits that apoptosis-like pathways may confer to single-celled 
      organisms. However, establishing how these pathways provide increased ecological 
      fitness has remained difficult to determine. Here, we report a pathway in
      Bacillus subtilis in which regulated cell death maintains the fidelity of
      sporulation through selective removal of cells that misassemble the spore
      envelope. The spore envelope, which protects the dormant spore's genome from
      environmental insults, uses the protein SpoIVA as a scaffold for assembly. We
      found that disrupting envelope assembly activates a cell death pathway wherein
      the small protein CmpA acts as an adaptor to the AAA+ ClpXP protease to degrade
      SpoIVA, thereby halting sporulation and resulting in lysis of defective
      sporulating cells. We propose that removal of unfit cells from a population of
      terminally differentiating cells protects against evolutionary deterioration and 
      ultimately loss of the sporulation program.

AB  - The airway epithelium develops into a tree-like structure via branching
      morphogenesis. Here, we show a critical role for localized differentiation of
      airway smooth muscle during epithelial bifurcation in the embryonic mouse lung.
      We found that during terminal bifurcation, changes in the geometry of nascent
      buds coincided with patterned smooth muscle differentiation. Evaluating
      spatiotemporal dynamics of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) in reporter mice 
      revealed that alphaSMA-expressing cells appear at the basal surface of the future
      epithelial cleft prior to bifurcation and then increase in density as they wrap
      around the bifurcating bud. Disrupting this stereotyped pattern of smooth muscle 
      differentiation prevents terminal bifurcation. Our results reveal stereotyped
      differentiation of airway smooth muscle adjacent to nascent epithelial buds and
      suggest that localized smooth muscle wrapping at the cleft site is required for
      terminal bifurcation during airway branching morphogenesis.

AB  - The esophagus links the oral cavity to the stomach and facilitates the transfer
      of bolus. Using genetic tracing and mouse mutants, we demonstrate that esophagus 
      striated muscles (ESMs) are not derived from somites but are of cranial origin.
      Tbx1 and Isl1 act as key regulators of ESMs, which we now identify as a third
      derivative of cardiopharyngeal mesoderm that contributes to second heart field
      derivatives and head muscles. Isl1-derived ESM progenitors colonize the mouse
      esophagus in an anterior-posterior direction but are absent in the developing
      chick esophagus, thus providing evolutionary insight into the lack of ESMs in
      avians. Strikingly, different from other myogenic regions, in which embryonic
      myogenesis establishes a scaffold for fetal fiber formation, ESMs are established
      directly by fetal myofibers. We propose that ESM progenitors use smooth muscle as
      a scaffold, thereby bypassing the embryonic program. These findings have
      important implications in understanding esophageal dysfunctions, including
      dysphagia, and congenital disorders, such as DiGeorge syndrome.

AB  - In Drosophila and mammals, the canonical Hippo kinase cascade is mediated by
      Hpo/Mst acting through the intermediary kinase Wts/Lats to phosphorylate the
      transcriptional coactivator Yki/YAP/TAZ. Despite recent reports linking
      Yki/YAP/TAZ activity to the actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms are
      poorly understood and/or controversial. Using Drosophila imaginal discs as an in 
      vivo model, we show that Wts, but not Hpo, is genetically indispensable for
      cytoskeleton-mediated subcellular localization of Yki. Through a systematic
      screen, we identify the Ste-20 kinase Happyhour (Hppy) and its mammalian
      counterpart MAP4K1/2/3/5 as an alternative kinase that phosphorylates the
      hydrophobic motif of Wts/Lats in a similar manner as Hpo/Mst. Consistent with
      their redundant function as activating kinases of Wts/Lats, combined loss of
      Hpo/Mst and Hppy/MAP4K abolishes cytoskeleton-mediated regulation of Yki/YAP
      subcellular localization, as well as YAP cytoplasmic translocation induced by
      contact inhibition. These Hpo/Mst-like kinases provide an expanded view of the
      Hippo kinase cascade in development and physiology.

AB  - The development of multicellular organisms requires the precisely coordinated
      regulation of an evolutionarily conserved group of signaling pathways. Temporal
      and spatial control of these signaling cascades is achieved through networks of
      regulatory proteins, segregation of pathway components in specific subcellular
      compartments, or both. In vertebrates, dysregulation of primary cilia function
      has been strongly linked to developmental signaling defects, yet it remains
      unclear whether cilia sequester pathway components to regulate their activation
      or cilia-associated proteins directly modulate developmental signaling events. To
      elucidate this question, we conducted an RNAi-based screen in Drosophila
      non-ciliated cells to test for cilium-independent loss-of-function phenotypes of 
      ciliary proteins in developmental signaling pathways. Our results show no effect 
      on Hedgehog signaling. In contrast, our screen identified several
      cilia-associated proteins as functioning in canonical Wnt signaling. Further
      characterization of specific components of Intraflagellar Transport complex A
      uncovered a cilia-independent function in potentiating Wnt signals by promoting
      beta-catenin/Armadillo activity.

AB  - T lymphoid-primed progenitors are hematopoietic progenitors destined to enter the
      thymus. The in vivo characterization of these embryonic progenitors is
      challenging, however, due to the intrauterine development of mouse embryos. Thus,
      how the fate of these cells is determined has not been fully defined in mammals. 
      Here we use zebrafish embryos to show that the homing of T lymphoid-primed
      progenitors to the thymus is impaired, concomitant with a decrease in ccr9a
      expression, in the absence of irf4a. Strikingly, fate mapping assays at the
      single-cell level showed a fate change of irf4a-deficient T lymphoid-primed
      progenitors to myeloid cells, accompanied by an increase in Pu.1 expression.
      These data indicate that in addition to regulating ccr9a expression, Irf4a is
      essential in T lymphoid-primed progenitors for repressing Pu.1 expression to
      prevent an alternate fate. Our findings provide insight into the fate
      determination mechanism of T lymphoid-primed progenitors.

      specifies the heart lineage in Ciona intestinalis. In this issue of Developmental
      Cell, Cota and Davidson (2015) show that differential induction is mediated by

TI  - The Legionella Anti-autophagy Effector RavZ Targets the Autophagosome via PI3P-
      and Curvature-Sensing Motifs.
PG  - 569-76

AB  - Autophagy is a conserved membrane transport pathway used to destroy pathogenic
      microbes that access the cytosol of cells. The intracellular pathogen Legionella 
      pneumophila interferes with autophagy by delivering an effector protein, RavZ,
      into the host cytosol. RavZ acts by cleaving membrane-conjugated Atg8/LC3
      proteins from pre-autophagosomal structures. Its remarkable efficiency allows
      minute quantities of RavZ to block autophagy throughout the cell. To understand
      how RavZ targets pre-autophagosomes and specifically acts only on
      membrane-associated Atg8 proteins, we elucidated its structure. Revealed is a
      catalytic domain related in fold to Ulp family deubiquitinase-like enzymes and a 
      C-terminal PI3P-binding module. RavZ targets the autophagosome via the
      PI3P-binding module and a catalytic domain helix, and it preferentially binds
      high-curvature membranes, intimating localization to highly curved domains in
      autophagosome intermediate membranes. RavZ-membrane interactions enhance
      substrate affinity, providing a mechanism for interfacial activation that also
      may be used by host autophagy proteins engaging only lipidated Atg8 proteins.

AB  - Early retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) in vertebrates produce lineages that vary
      greatly both in terms of cell number and fate composition, yet how this
      variability is achieved remains unknown. One possibility is that these RPCs are
      individually distinct and that each gives rise to a unique lineage. Another is
      that stochastic mechanisms play upon the determinative machinery of equipotent
      early RPCs to drive clonal variability. Here we show that a simple model, based
      on the independent firing of key fate-influencing transcription factors, can
      quantitatively account for the intrinsic clonal variance in the zebrafish retina 
      and predict the distributions of neuronal cell types in clones where one or more 
      of these fates are made unavailable.

AB  - Synthesis and release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh) are key to
      synaptic function. However, little is known about the spatial regulation of their
      synthesizing machinery. Here, we demonstrate that ataxia-related protein
      BNIP-H/Caytaxin links kinesin-1 (KLC1) to ATP citrate lyase (ACL), a key enzyme
      for ACh synthesis, and transports it toward neurite terminals. There, BNIP-H/ACL 
      complex synergistically recruits another enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT),
      leading to enhanced secretion of ACh. ACh then activates MAPK/ERK via muscarinic 
      receptors to promote neurite outgrowth. In mice deficient in BNIP-H, ACL fails to
      interact with KLC1, and formation of the ACL/ChAT complex is prevented, whereas
      the disease-associated BNIP-H mutation fails to target ACL for neurite outgrowth.
      Significantly, Bnip-h knockdown in zebrafish causes developmental defect in motor
      neurons through impaired cholinergic pathway, leading to motor disorder.
      Therefore, precise targeting of the cholinergic machinery through BNIP-H is
      essential for the local production of ACh for morphogenesis and
      neurotransmission.

AB  - The evolutionary origins of complex morphological structures such as the
      vertebrate eye or insect wing remain one of the greatest mysteries of biology.
      Recent comparative studies of gene expression imply that new structures are not
      built from scratch, but rather form by co-opting preexisting gene networks. A key
      prediction of this model is that upstream factors within the network will
      activate their preexisting targets (i.e., enhancers) to form novel anatomies.
      Here, we show how a recently derived morphological novelty present in the
      genitalia of D. melanogaster employs an ancestral Hox-regulated network deployed 
      in the embryo to generate the larval posterior spiracle. We demonstrate how
      transcriptional enhancers and constituent transcription factor binding sites are 
      used in both ancestral and novel contexts. These results illustrate network
      co-option at the level of individual connections between regulatory genes and
      highlight how morphological novelty may originate through the co-option of
      networks controlling seemingly unrelated structures.

AB  - Elucidating the mechanism of cell lineage differentiation is critical for our
      understanding of development and fate manipulation. Here we combined systematic
      perturbation and direct lineaging to map the regulatory landscape of lineage
      differentiation in early C. elegans embryogenesis. High-dimensional phenotypic
      analysis of 204 essential genes in 1,368 embryos revealed that cell lineage
      differentiation follows a canalized landscape with barriers shaped by lineage
      distance and genetic robustness. We assigned function to 201 genes in regulating 
      lineage differentiation, including 175 switches of binary fate choices. We
      generated a multiscale model that connects gene networks and cells to the
      experimentally mapped landscape. Simulations showed that the landscape topology
      determines the propensity of differentiation and regulatory complexity.
      Furthermore, the model allowed us to identify the chromatin assembly complex
      CAF-1 as a context-specific repressor of Notch signaling. Our study presents a
      systematic survey of the regulatory landscape of lineage differentiation of a
      metazoan embryo.

AB  - Postnatal organogenesis occurs in an immune competent environment and is tightly 
      controlled by interplay between positive and negative regulators. Innate immune
      cells have beneficial roles in postnatal tissue remodeling, but roles for the
      adaptive immune system are currently unexplored. Here we show that adaptive
      immune responses participate in the normal postnatal development of a
      non-lymphoid epithelial tissue. Since the mammary gland (MG) is the only organ
      developing predominantly after birth, we utilized it as a powerful system to
      study adaptive immune regulation of organogenesis. We found that antigen-mediated
      interactions between mammary antigen-presenting cells and interferon-gamma
      (IFNgamma)-producing CD4+ T helper 1 cells participate in MG postnatal
      organogenesis as negative regulators, locally orchestrating epithelial
      rearrangement. IFNgamma then affects luminal lineage differentiation. This
      function of adaptive immune responses, regulating normal development, changes the
      paradigm for studying players of postnatal organogenesis and provides insights
      into immune surveillance and cancer transformation.

AB  - In response to microenvironmental cues, embryonic cells form adhesive signaling
      compartments that influence survival and patterning. Dividing cells detach from
      the surrounding matrix and initiate extensive membrane remodeling, but the in
      vivo impact of mitosis on adhesion-dependent signaling remains poorly
      characterized. We investigate in vivo signaling dynamics using the invertebrate
      chordate, Ciona intestinalis. In Ciona, matrix adhesion polarizes fibroblast
      growth factor (FGF)-dependent heart progenitor induction. Here, we show that
      adhesion inhibits mitotic FGF receptor internalization, leading to receptor
      enrichment along adherent membranes. Targeted disruption of matrix adhesion
      promotes uniform FGF receptor internalization and degradation while enhanced
      adhesion suppresses degradation. Chimeric analysis indicates that integrin beta
      chain-specific impacts on induction are dictated by distinct internalization
      motifs. We also found that matrix adhesion impacts receptor enrichment through
      Caveolin-rich membrane domains. These results redefine the relationship between
      cell division and adhesive signaling, revealing how mitotic membrane turnover
      orchestrates adhesion-dependent signal polarization.

AB  - Neural crest cells are induced at the neural plate border by the combined action 
      of transcription factors and signaling molecules. Here, we show that Axud1, a
      downstream effector of Wnt signaling, represents a critical missing link that
      integrates signaling and transcriptional cues to mediate neural crest formation. 
      Axud1 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest progenitors in a
      Wnt1/beta-catenin-dependent manner. Axud1 loss leads to downregulation of
      multiple genes involved in neural crest specification, similar to the effects of 
      Wnt1 knockdown. Importantly, Axud1 is sufficient to rescue neural crest formation
      after disruption of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, it physically interacts with
      neural plate border genes Pax7 and Msx1 in vivo to directly activate
      transcription of stem cell factor FoxD3, initiating the neural crest program.
      Thus, Axud1 integrates Wnt signaling with transcriptional inputs to endow the
      neural crest with its unique molecular signature.

AB  - Defining the unique molecular features of progenitors and their niche requires a 
      genome-wide, whole-tissue approach with cellular resolution. Here, we co-isolate 
      embryonic hair follicle (HF) placode and dermal condensate cells, precursors of
      adult HF stem cells and the dermal papilla/sheath niche, along with
      lineage-related keratinocytes and fibroblasts, Schwann cells, melanocytes, and a 
      population inclusive of all remaining skin cells. With next-generation RNA
      sequencing, we define gene expression patterns in the context of the entire
      embryonic skin, and through transcriptome cross-comparisons, we uncover hundreds 
      of enriched genes in cell-type-specific signatures. Axon guidance signaling and
      many other pathway genes are enriched in multiple signatures, implicating these
      factors in driving the large-scale cellular rearrangements necessary for HF
      formation. Finally, we share all data in an interactive, searchable companion
      website. Our study provides an overarching view of signaling within the entire
      embryonic skin and captures a molecular snapshot of HF progenitors and their
      niche.

AB  - Cytoplasmic streaming occurs in diverse cell types, where it generally serves a
      transport function. Here, we examine streaming in multicellular fungal hyphae and
      identify an additional function wherein regimented streaming forms distinct
      cytoplasmic subcompartments. In the hypha, cytoplasm flows directionally from
      cell to cell through septal pores. Using live-cell imaging and computer
      simulations, we identify a flow pattern that produces vortices (eddies) on the
      upstream side of the septum. Nuclei can be immobilized in these microfluidic
      eddies, where they form multinucleate aggregates and accumulate foci of the HDA-2
      histone deacetylase-associated factor, SPA-19. Pores experiencing flow degenerate
      in the absence of SPA-19, suggesting that eddy-trapped nuclei function to
      reinforce the septum. Together, our data show that eddies comprise a subcellular 
      niche favoring nuclear differentiation and that subcompartments can be
      self-organized as a consequence of regimented cytoplasmic streaming.

TI  - Phosphoinositides Regulate Ciliary Protein Trafficking to Modulate Hedgehog
      Signaling.
PG  - 400-409
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2015.08.001 [doi]
AB  - Primary cilia interpret vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Why cilia are essential
      for signaling is unclear. One possibility is that some forms of signaling require
      a distinct membrane lipid composition, found at cilia. We found that the ciliary 
      membrane contains a particular phosphoinositide, PI(4)P, whereas a different
      phosphoinositide, PI(4,5)P2, is restricted to the membrane of the ciliary base.
      This distribution is created by Inpp5e, a ciliary phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase.
      Without Inpp5e, ciliary PI(4,5)P2 levels are elevated and Hh signaling is
      disrupted. Inpp5e limits the ciliary levels of inhibitors of Hh signaling,
      including Gpr161 and the PI(4,5)P2-binding protein Tulp3. Increasing ciliary
      PI(4,5)P2 levels or conferring the ability to bind PI(4)P on Tulp3 increases the 
      ciliary localization of Tulp3. Lowering Tulp3 in cells lacking Inpp5e reduces
      ciliary Gpr161 levels and restores Hh signaling. Therefore, Inpp5e regulates
      ciliary membrane phosphoinositide composition, and Tulp3 reads out ciliary
      phosphoinositides to control ciliary protein localization, enabling Hh signaling.

AB  - Cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) commonly switch
      from expressing E-cadherin to N-cadherin. But why this occurs is not well
      understood. In the current issue of Developmental Cell, Scarpa et al. (2015)
      identify a reason: cadherin switching controls Rac signaling to determine how
      cell locomotion is regulated by contact.

AB  - Cytoplasmic streaming occurs in a variety of organisms, but its biological
      function is often unclear. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Pieuchot et al.
      (2015) report that streaming creates subcellular compartments in the filamentous 
      fungus Neurospora crassa. Nuclei immobilized within these compartments
      differentiate and may drive a compartment-specific genetic program.

AB  - How phosphoinositide metabolism is coupled to primary cilia physiology is poorly 
      understood. Reporting recently in Developmental Cell, Chavez et al. (2015) and
      Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2015) show that INPP5E-mediated phosphoinositide
      metabolism, which creates a specific phosphoinositide distribution, ensures
      proper protein trafficking and Hh signaling in primary cilia.

AB  - piRNAs silence foreign genes, such as transposons, to preserve genome integrity, 
      but they also target endogenous mRNAs by mechanisms that are poorly understood.
      Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon
      mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the
      dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA
      silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. In the 
      absence of piRNAs and a cellular memory of piRNA activity, essential and
      conserved genes are misrouted into the RNAi pathway to produce siRNAs that bind
      the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, resulting in dramatic defects in germ cell
      proliferation and function such that the animals are sterile. Inactivation of
      RNAi suppresses sterility, indicating that aberrant siRNAs produced in the
      absence of piRNAs target essential genes for silencing. Thus, by reanimating
      RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA
      silencing.

AB  - Every cell in our body originates from the pluripotent inner mass of the embryo, 
      yet it is unknown how biomechanical forces allocate inner cells in vivo. Here we 
      discover subcellular heterogeneities in tensile forces, generated by actomyosin
      cortical networks, which drive apical constriction to position the first inner
      cells of living mouse embryos. Myosin II accumulates specifically around
      constricting cells, and its disruption dysregulates constriction and cell fate.
      Laser ablations of actomyosin networks reveal that constricting cells have higher
      cortical tension, generate tension anisotropies and morphological changes in
      adjacent regions of neighboring cells, and require their neighbors to coordinate 
      their own changes in shape. Thus, tensile forces determine the first spatial
      segregation of cells during mammalian development. We propose that, unlike more
      cohesive tissues, the early embryo dissipates tensile forces required by
      constricting cells via their neighbors, thereby allowing confined cell
      repositioning without jeopardizing global architecture.

AB  - The Piwi-piRNA pathway represents a germline-specific transposon-defense system. 
      C. elegans Piwi, prg-1, is a non-essential gene and triggers a secondary RNAi
      response that depends on mutator genes, endo-siRNAs (22G-RNAs), and the
      22G-RNA-binding Argonaute protein HRDE-1. Interestingly, silencing of PRG-1
      targets can become PRG-1 independent. This state, known as RNAe, is heritable and
      depends on mutator genes and HRDE-1. We studied how the transgenerational memory 
      of RNAe and the piRNA pathway interact. We find that maternally provided PRG-1 is
      required for de novo establishment of 22G-RNA populations, especially those
      targeting transposons. Strikingly, attempts to re-establish 22G-RNAs in absence
      of both PRG-1 and RNAe memory result in severe germline proliferation defects.
      This is accompanied by a disturbed balance between gene-activating and
      -repressing 22G-RNA pathways. We propose a model in which CSR-1 prevents the
      loading of HRDE-1 and in which both PRG-1 and HRDE-1 help to keep mutator
      activity focused on the proper targets.

AB  - Sister-chromatid disjunction in anaphase requires the resolution of DNA catenanes
      by topoisomerase II together with Plk1-interacting checkpoint helicase (PICH) and
      Bloom's helicase (BLM). We here identify Rif1 as a factor involved in the
      resolution of DNA catenanes that are visible as ultrafine DNA bridges (UFBs) in
      anaphase to which PICH and BLM localize. Rif1, which during interphase functions 
      downstream of 53BP1 in DNA repair, is recruited to UFBs in a PICH-dependent
      fashion, but independently of 53BP1 or BLM. Similar to PICH and BLM, Rif1
      promotes the resolution of UFBs: its depletion increases the frequency of
      nucleoplasmic bridges and RPA70-positive UFBs in late anaphase. Moreover, in the 
      absence of Rif1, PICH, or BLM, more nuclear bodies with damaged DNA arise in
      ensuing G1 cells, when chromosome decatenation is impaired. Our data reveal a
      thus far unrecognized function for Rif1 in the resolution of UFBs during anaphase
      to protect genomic integrity.

AB  - Regulated turnover of integrin receptors is essential for cell adhesion and
      migration. Pathways selectively regulating beta1-integrin recycling are
      implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis, yet proteins required for the
      internalization of this pro-invasive integrin remain to be identified. Here, we
      uncover formin-like 2 (FMNL2) as a critical regulator of beta1-integrin
      internalization downstream of protein kinase C (PKC). PKCalpha associates with
      and phosphorylates FMNL2 at S1072 within its Diaphanous autoregulatory region,
      leading to the release of formin autoinhibition. Phosphorylation of FMNL2
      triggers its rapid relocation and promotes its interaction with the cytoplasmic
      tails of the alpha-integrin subunits for beta1-integrin endocytosis. FMNL2 drives
      beta1-integrin internalization and invasive motility in a
      phosphorylation-dependent manner, while a FMNL2 mutant defective in actin
      assembly interferes with beta1-integrin endocytosis and cancer cell invasion. Our
      data establish a role for FMNL2 in the regulation of beta1-integrin and provide a
      mechanistic understanding of the function of FMNL2 in cancer invasiveness.

AB  - Some organisms, such as adult zebrafish and newborn mice, have the capacity to
      regenerate heart tissue following injury. Unraveling the mechanisms of heart
      regeneration is fundamental to understanding why regeneration fails in adult
      humans. Numerous studies have revealed that nerves are crucial for organ
      regeneration, thus we aimed to determine whether nerves guide heart regeneration.
      Here, we show using transgenic zebrafish that inhibition of cardiac innervation
      leads to reduction of myocyte proliferation following injury. Specifically,
      pharmacological inhibition of cholinergic nerve function reduces cardiomyocyte
      proliferation in the injured hearts of both zebrafish and neonatal mice. Direct
      mechanical denervation impairs heart regeneration in neonatal mice, which was
      rescued by the administration of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and nerve growth factor
      (NGF) recombinant proteins. Transcriptional analysis of mechanically denervated
      hearts revealed a blunted inflammatory and immune response following injury.
      These findings demonstrate that nerve function is required for both zebrafish and
      mouse heart regeneration.

AB  - Contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) is the process through which cells move
      away from each other after cell-cell contact, and it contributes to malignant
      invasion and developmental migration. Various cell types exhibit CIL, whereas
      others remain in contact after collision and may form stable junctions. To
      investigate what determines this differential behavior, we study neural crest
      cells, a migratory stem cell population whose invasiveness has been likened to
      cancer metastasis. By comparing pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells,
      we show that the switch from E- to N-cadherin during EMT is essential for
      acquisition of CIL behavior. Loss of E-cadherin leads to repolarization of
      protrusions, via p120 and Rac1, resulting in a redistribution of forces from
      intercellular tension to cell-matrix adhesions, which break down the cadherin
      junction. These data provide insight into the balance of physical forces that
      contributes to CIL in cells in vivo.

AB  - Of fundamental interest to biologists is how organs achieve a reproducible size
      during development. Studies of the developing Drosophila wing have provided many 
      key insights that will help give a conceptual understanding of the process beyond
      the fly. In the wing, there is evidence for both "top-down" mechanisms, in which 
      signals emanating from small subsets of cells direct global proliferation, and
      "bottom-up" mechanisms, in which the final size is an emergent property of local 
      cell-cell interactions. Mechanical forces also appear to have an important role
      along with the Hippo pathway, which may integrate multiple types of inputs to
      regulate the extent of growth.

TI  - Direct Microtubule-Binding by Myosin-10 Orients Centrosomes toward Retraction
      Fibers and Subcortical Actin Clouds.

AB  - Positioning of centrosomes is vital for cell division and development. In
      metazoan cells, spindle positioning is controlled by a dynamic pool of
      subcortical actin that organizes in response to the position of retraction
      fibers. These actin "clouds" are proposed to generate pulling forces on
      centrosomes and mediate spindle orientation. However, the motors that pull astral
      microtubules toward these actin structures are not known. Here, we report that
      the unconventional myosin, Myo10, couples actin-dependent forces from retraction 
      fibers and subcortical actin clouds to centrosomes. Myo10-mediated centrosome
      positioning requires its direct microtubule binding. Computational image analysis
      of large microtubule populations reveals a direct effect of Myo10 on microtubule 
      dynamics and microtubule-cortex interactions. Myo10's role in centrosome
      positioning is distinct from, but overlaps with, that of dynein. Thus, Myo10
      plays a key role in integrating the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons to
      position centrosomes and mitotic spindles.

TI  - Crumbs3-Mediated Polarity Directs Airway Epithelial Cell Fate through the Hippo
      Pathway Effector Yap.

AB  - Epithelial cells undergo dynamic polarity changes as organs pattern, but the
      relationship between epithelial polarity and cell fate is poorly understood.
      Using the developing lung as a model, we found that distinct alterations in
      apical-basal polarity dictate airway epithelial differentiation. We demonstrate
      that Crb3, a Crumbs isoform that determines epithelial apical domain identity, is
      required for airway differentiation by controlling the localization of the
      transcriptional regulator Yap. We show that Crb3 promotes the interaction between
      Yap and the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 at apical cell junctions to induce Yap 
      phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention, which drive cell differentiation. Loss
      of Crb3 in developing mouse airways or isolated adult airway progenitors results 
      in unrestricted nuclear Yap activity and consequent cell differentiation defects.
      Our findings demonstrate that polarity-dependent cues control airway cell
      differentiation, offering important molecular insights into organ patterning.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) are lipid storage organelles that grow or shrink, depending 
      on the availability of metabolic energy. Proteins recruited to LDs mediate many
      metabolic functions, including phosphatidylcholine and triglyceride synthesis.
      How the LD protein composition is tuned to the supply and demand for lipids
      remains unclear. We show that LDs, in contrast to other organelles, have limited 
      capacity for protein binding. Consequently, macromolecular crowding plays a major
      role in determining LD protein composition. During lipolysis, when LDs and their 
      surfaces shrink, some, but not all, proteins become displaced. In vitro studies
      show that macromolecular crowding, rather than changes in monolayer lipid
      composition, causes proteins to fall off the LD surface. As predicted by a
      crowding model, proteins compete for binding to the surfaces of LDs. Moreover,
      the LD binding affinity determines protein localization during lipolysis. Our
      findings identify protein crowding as an important principle in determining LD
      protein composition.

AB  - Throughout their lifetime, cells may suffer insults that reduce their fitness and
      disrupt their function, and it is unclear how these potentially harmful cells are
      managed in adult tissues. We address this question using the adult Drosophila
      posterior midgut as a model of homeostatic tissue and ribosomal Minute mutations 
      to reduce fitness in groups of cells. We take a quantitative approach combining
      lineage tracing and biophysical modeling and address how cell competition affects
      stem cell and tissue population dynamics. We show that healthy cells induce
      clonal extinction in weak tissues, targeting both stem and differentiated cells
      for elimination. We also find that competition induces stem cell proliferation
      and self-renewal in healthy tissue, promoting selective advantage and tissue
      colonization. Finally, we show that winner cell proliferation is fueled by the
      JAK-STAT ligand Unpaired-3, produced by Minute(-/+) cells in response to chronic 
      JNK stress signaling.

AB  - In early embryos, the DNA damage checkpoint is silent until the midblastula
      transition (MBT) because of maternal limiting factors of unknown identity. Here
      we identify the RAD18 ubiquitin ligase as one such factor in Xenopus. We show, in
      vitro and in vivo, that inactivation of RAD18 function leads to DNA
      damage-dependent checkpoint activation, monitored by CHK1 phosphorylation.
      Moreover, we show that the abundance of both RAD18 and PCNA monoubiquitylated
      (mUb) are developmentally regulated. Increased DNA abundance limits the
      availability of RAD18 close to the MBT, thereby reducing PCNA(mUb) and inducing
      checkpoint derepression. Furthermore, we show that this embryonic-like regulation
      can be reactivated in somatic mammalian cells by ectopic RAD18 expression,
      therefore conferring resistance to DNA damage. Finally, we find high RAD18
      expression in cancer stem cells highly resistant to DNA damage. Together, these
      data propose RAD18 as a critical embryonic checkpoint-inhibiting factor and
      suggest that RAD18 deregulation may have unexpected oncogenic potential.

AB  - CRISPR-based technologies have emerged as powerful tools to alter genomes and
      mark chromosomal loci, but an inexpensive method for generating large numbers of 
      RNA guides for whole genome screening and labeling is lacking. Using a method
      that permits library construction from any source of DNA, we generated guide
      libraries that label repetitive loci or a single chromosomal locus in Xenopus egg
      extracts and show that a complex library can target the E. coli genome at high
      frequency.

AB  - In vertebrates, mechano-electrical transduction of sound is accomplished by
      sensory hair cells. Whereas mammalian hair cells are not replaced when lost, in
      fish they constantly renew and regenerate after injury. In vivo tracking and cell
      fate analyses of all dividing cells during lateral line hair cell regeneration
      revealed that support and hair cell progenitors localize to distinct tissue
      compartments. Importantly, we find that the balance between self-renewal and
      differentiation in these compartments is controlled by spatially restricted Notch
      signaling and its inhibition of Wnt-induced proliferation. The ability to
      simultaneously study and manipulate individual cell behaviors and multiple
      pathways in vivo transforms the lateral line into a powerful paradigm to
      mechanistically dissect sensory organ regeneration. The striking similarities to 
      other vertebrate stem cell compartments uniquely place zebrafish to help
      elucidate why mammals possess such low capacity to regenerate hair cells.

AB  - How tissues acquire their characteristic shape is a fundamental unresolved
      question in biology. While genes have been characterized that control local
      mechanical forces to elongate epithelial tissues, genes controlling global forces
      in epithelia have yet to be identified. Here, we describe a genetic pathway that 
      shapes appendages in Drosophila by defining the pattern of global tensile forces 
      in the tissue. In the appendages, shape arises from tension generated by cell
      constriction and localized anchorage of the epithelium to the cuticle via the
      apical extracellular-matrix protein Dumpy (Dp). Altering Dp expression in the
      developing wing results in predictable changes in wing shape that can be
      simulated by a computational model that incorporates only tissue contraction and 
      localized anchorage. Three other wing shape genes, narrow, tapered, and
      lanceolate, encode components of a pathway that modulates Dp distribution in the 
      wing to refine the global force pattern and thus wing shape.

AB  - Ciliary transport is required for ciliogenesis, signal transduction, and
      trafficking of receptors to the primary cilium. Mutations in inositol
      polyphosphate 5-phosphatase E (INPP5E) have been associated with ciliary
      dysfunction; however, its role in regulating ciliary phosphoinositides is
      unknown. Here we report that in neural stem cells, phosphatidylinositol
      4-phosphate (PI4P) is found in high levels in cilia whereas phosphatidylinositol 
      (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is not detectable. Upon INPP5E inactivation,
      PI(4,5)P2 accumulates at the ciliary tip whereas PI4P is depleted. This is
      accompanied by recruitment of the PI(4,5)P2-interacting protein TULP3 to the
      ciliary membrane, along with Gpr161. This results in an increased production of
      cAMP and a repression of the Shh transcription gene Gli1. Our results reveal the 
      link between ciliary regulation of phosphoinositides by INPP5E and Shh regulation
      via ciliary trafficking of TULP3/Gpr161 and also provide mechanistic insight into
      ciliary alterations found in Joubert and MORM syndromes resulting from INPP5E
      mutations.

AB  - Chronic inflammation is associated with tumorigenesis, but how acute inflammation
      affects the tumor microenvironment is less known. Recently, Antonio et al. (2015)
      found that neutrophils attracted to an acute wound such as a biopsy drive cell
      proliferation of nearby pre-neoplastic cells, suggesting that acute wounds may
      promote cancer progression.

AB  - The mechanisms that drive the spiral wrapping of the myelin sheath around axons
      are poorly understood. Two papers in this issue of Developmental Cell demonstrate
      that actin disassembly, rather than actin assembly, predominates during
      oligodendrocyte maturation and is critical for the genesis of the central myelin 
      sheath.

TI  - Brassinosteroid signaling regulates leaf erectness in Oryza sativa via the
      control of a specific U-type cyclin and cell proliferation.

AB  - Leaf erectness is key in determining plant architecture and yield, particularly
      in cereal crops. Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a unique role in controlling this
      trait in monocots, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain
      big mysteries. Here we report that the abaxial sclerenchyma cell number of rice
      lamina joints (LJs) is closely related to leaf erectness, and BR signaling
      tightly regulates their proliferation. We identified a rice U-type cyclin CYC
      U4;1 enriched in rice LJs, with its expression accompanying LJ development.
      Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role 
      in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell
      proliferation. Furthermore, BR signaling inhibits the abaxial sclerenchyma cell
      division by coordinately regulating CYC U4;1 expression through BES1 and CYC U4;1
      protein activity through GSK3 kinases. These results support a key role of the
      cyclin CYC U4;1 in mediating BR-regulated cell division to control leaf
      erectness.

AB  - FGF, BMP, and WNT balance embryonic nephron progenitor cell (NPC) renewal and
      differentiation. By modulating these pathways, we have created an in vitro niche 
      in which NPCs from embryonic kidneys or derived from human embryonic stem cells
      can be propagated. NPC cultures expanded up to one billion-fold in this
      environment can be induced to form tubules expressing nephron differentiation
      markers. Single-cell culture reveals phenotypic variability within the early
      CITED1-expressing NPC compartment, indicating that it is a mixture of cells with 
      varying progenitor potential. Furthermore, we find that the developmental age of 
      NPCs does not correlate with propagation capacity, indicating that cessation of
      nephrogenesis is related to factors other than an intrinsic clock. This in vitro 
      nephron progenitor niche will have important applications for expansion of cells 
      for engraftment and will facilitate investigation of mechanisms that determine
      the balance between renewal and differentiation in these cells.

AB  - Intercellular communications are essential for cell proliferation and
      differentiation during plant embryogenesis. However, analysis of intercellular
      communications in living material in real time is difficult owing to the
      restricted accessibility of the embryo within the flower. We established a
      live-embryo imaging system to visualize cell division and cell fate specification
      in Arabidopsis thaliana from zygote division in real time. We generated a
      cell-division lineage tree for early embryogenesis in Arabidopsis. Lineage
      analysis showed that both the direction and time course of cell division between 
      sister cells differed along the apical-basal or radial axes. Using the
      Arabidopsis kpl mutant, in which single-fertilization events are frequent, we
      showed that endosperm development is not required for pattern formation during
      early embryogenesis. Optical manipulation demonstrated that damage to the embryo 
      initial cell induces cell fate conversion of the suspensor cell to compensate for
      the disrupted embryo initial cell even after cell fate is specified.

AB  - Myelin is essential in vertebrates for the rapid propagation of action
      potentials, but the molecular mechanisms driving its formation remain largely
      unknown. Here we show that the initial stage of process extension and axon
      ensheathment by oligodendrocytes requires dynamic actin filament assembly by the 
      Arp2/3 complex. Unexpectedly, subsequent myelin wrapping coincides with the
      upregulation of actin disassembly proteins and rapid disassembly of the
      oligodendrocyte actin cytoskeleton and does not require Arp2/3. Inducing loss of 
      actin filaments drives oligodendrocyte membrane spreading and myelin wrapping in 
      vivo, and the actin disassembly factor gelsolin is required for normal wrapping. 
      We show that myelin basic protein, a protein essential for CNS myelin wrapping
      whose role has been unclear, is required for actin disassembly, and its loss
      phenocopies loss of actin disassembly proteins. Together, these findings provide 
      insight into the molecular mechanism of myelin wrapping and identify it as an
      actin-independent form of mammalian cell motility.

TI  - Actin filament turnover drives leading edge growth during myelin sheath formation
      in the central nervous system.
PG  - 139-151

AB  - During CNS development, oligodendrocytes wrap their plasma membrane around axons 
      to generate multilamellar myelin sheaths. To drive growth at the leading edge of 
      myelin at the interface with the axon, mechanical forces are necessary, but the
      underlying mechanisms are not known. Using an interdisciplinary approach that
      combines morphological, genetic, and biophysical analyses, we identified a key
      role for actin filament network turnover in myelin growth. At the onset of myelin
      biogenesis, F-actin is redistributed to the leading edge, where its
      polymerization-based forces push out non-adhesive and motile protrusions. F-actin
      disassembly converts protrusions into sheets by reducing surface tension and in
      turn inducing membrane spreading and adhesion. We identified the actin
      depolymerizing factor ADF/cofilin1, which mediates high F-actin turnover rates,
      as an essential factor in this process. We propose that F-actin turnover is the
      driving force in myelin wrapping by regulating repetitive cycles of leading edge 
      protrusion and spreading.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) represent a new 
      class of regulators of stem cells. However, the roles of LncRNAs in stem cell
      maintenance and myogenesis remain largely unexamined. For this study, hundreds of
      intergenic LncRNAs were identified that are expressed in myoblasts and regulated 
      during differentiation. One of these LncRNAs, termed LncMyoD, is encoded next to 
      the Myod gene and is directly activated by MyoD during myoblast differentiation. 
      Knockdown of LncMyoD strongly inhibits terminal muscle differentiation, largely
      due to a failure to exit the cell cycle. LncMyoD directly binds to
      IGF2-mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP2) and negatively regulates IMP2-mediated
      translation of proliferation genes such as N-Ras and c-Myc. While the RNA
      sequence of LncMyoD is not well conserved between human and mouse, its locus,
      gene structure, and function are preserved. The MyoD-LncMyoD-IMP2 pathway
      elucidates a mechanism as to how MyoD blocks proliferation to create a permissive
      state for differentiation.

AB  - In many tissues, the stem cell niche must coordinate behavior across multiple
      stem cell lineages. How this is achieved is largely unknown. We have identified
      delayed completion of cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs) as a mechanism
      that regulates the production of stem cell daughters in the Drosophila testis.
      Through live imaging, we show that a secondary F-actin ring is formed through
      regulation of Cofilin activity to block cytokinesis progress after contractile
      ring disassembly. The duration of this block is controlled by Aurora B kinase.
      Additionally, we have identified a requirement for somatic cell encystment of the
      germline in promoting GSC abscission. We suggest that this non-autonomous role
      promotes coordination between stem cell lineages. These findings reveal the
      mechanisms by which cytokinesis is inhibited and reinitiated in GSCs and why such
      complex regulation exists within the stem cell niche.

AB  - The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling cascade that modulates tissue growth. 
      Although its core elements are well defined, factors modulating Hippo
      transcriptional outputs remain elusive. Here we show that components of the
      steroid-responsive ecdysone (Ec) pathway modulate Hippo transcriptional effects
      in imaginal disc cells. The Ec receptor coactivator Taiman (Tai) interacts with
      the Hippo transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki) and promotes expression of
      canonical Yki-responsive genes. Tai enhances Yki-driven growth, while Tai loss,
      or a form of Tai unable to bind Yki, suppresses Yki-driven tissue growth. This
      growth suppression is not correlated with impaired induction of canonical
      Hippo-responsive genes but with suppression of a distinct pro-growth program of
      Yki-induced/Tai-dependent genes, including the germline stem cell factors nanos
      and piwi. These data reveal Hippo/Ec pathway crosstalk in the form a Yki-Tai
      complex that collaboratively induces germline genes as part of a transcriptional 
      program that is normally repressed in developing somatic epithelia.

AB  - Neuron identity transformations occur upon removal of specific regulatory factors
      in many different cellular contexts, thereby revealing the fundamental principle 
      of alternative cell identity choices made during nervous system development. One 
      common molecular interpretation of such homeotic cell identity transformations is
      that a regulatory factor has a dual function in activating genes defining one
      cellular identity and repressing genes that define an alternative identity. We
      provide evidence for an alternative, competition-based mechanism. We show that
      the MEC-3 LIM homeodomain protein can outcompete the execution of a
      neuropeptidergic differentiation program by direct interaction with the
      UNC-86/Brn3 POU homeodomain protein. MEC-3 thereby prevents UNC-86 from
      collaborating with the Zn finger transcription factor PAG-3/Gfi to induce
      peptidergic neuron identity and directs UNC-86 to induce an alternative
      differentiation program toward a glutamatergic neuronal identity. Homeotic
      control of neuronal identity programs has implications for the evolution of
      neuronal cell types.

AB  - Centromeres are essential chromosomal structures that mediate accurate chromosome
      segregation during cell division. Centromeres are specified epigenetically by the
      heritable incorporation of the centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A. While many 
      of the primary factors that mediate centromeric deposition of CENP-A are known,
      the chromatin and DNA requirements of this process have remained elusive. Here,
      we uncover a role for transcription in Drosophila CENP-A deposition. Using an
      inducible ectopic centromere system that uncouples CENP-A deposition from
      endogenous centromere function and cell-cycle progression, we demonstrate that
      CENP-A assembly by its loading factor, CAL1, requires RNAPII-mediated
      transcription of the underlying DNA. This transcription depends on the CAL1
      binding partner FACT, but not on CENP-A incorporation. Our work establishes
      RNAPII passage as a key step in chaperone-mediated CENP-A chromatin establishment
      and propagation.

AB  - The field of angiogenesis research has primarily focused on the mechanisms of
      sprouting angiogenesis. Yet vascular networks formed by vessel sprouting
      subsequently undergo extensive vascular remodeling to form a functional and
      mature vasculature. This "trimming" includes distinct processes of vascular
      pruning, the regression of selected vascular branches. In some situations
      complete vascular networks may undergo physiological regression. Vessel
      regression is an understudied yet emerging field of research. This review
      summarizes the state-of-the-art of vessel pruning and regression with a focus on 
      the cellular processes and the molecular regulators of vessel maintenance and
      regression.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Elewa et al. (2015) show that combinatorial 
      action of RNA binding proteins modulates poly(A) tail length of maternal mRNAs,
      leading to asymmetric expression of a cell fate determinant in early C. elegans
      embryos. Genome-wide profiling suggests this mechanism may be widely used to
      establish cell identities.

AB  - In many adult tissues, homeostasis relies on self-renewing stem cells that are
      primed for differentiation. The reconciliation mechanisms of these
      characteristics remain a fundamental question in stem cell biology. We propose
      that regulation at the post-transcriptional level is essential for homeostasis in
      murine spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Here, we show that Nanos2, an
      evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein, works with other cellular messenger
      ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) components to ensure the primitive status of SSCs
      through a dual mechanism that involves (1) direct recruitment and translational
      repression of genes that promote spermatogonial differentiation and (2)
      repression of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative
      pathway for SSC self-renewal, by sequestration of the core factor mTOR in mRNPs. 
      This mechanism links mRNA turnover to mTORC1 signaling through Nanos2-containing 
      mRNPs and establishes a post-transcriptional buffering system to facilitate SSC
      homeostasis in the fluctuating environment within the seminiferous tubule.

AB  - Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays essential roles in animal development and tissue
      homeostasis, and its misregulation causes congenital diseases and cancers.
      Regulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis of Ci/Gli
      transcription factors is central to Hh signaling, but whether deubiquitinase is
      involved in this process remains unknown. Here, we show that Hh stimulates the
      binding of a ubiquitin-specific protease Usp7 to Ci, which positively regulates
      Hh signaling activity through inhibiting Ci ubiquitination and degradation
      mediated by both Slimb-Cul1 and Hib-Cul3 E3 ligases. Furthermore, we find that
      Usp7 forms a complex with GMP-synthetase (GMPS) to promote Hh pathway activity.
      Finally, we show that the mammalian counterpart of Usp7, HAUSP, positively
      regulates Hh signaling by modulating Gli ubiquitination and stability. Our
      findings reveal a conserved mechanism by which Ci/Gli is stabilized by a
      deubiquitination enzyme and identify Usp7/HUASP as a critical regulator of Hh
      signaling and potential therapeutic target for Hh-related cancers.

AB  - Inter-organellar communication is vital for successful innate immune responses
      that confer defense against pathogens. However, little is known about how
      chloroplasts, which are a major production site of pro-defense molecules,
      communicate and coordinate with other organelles during defense. Here we show
      that chloroplasts send out dynamic tubular extensions called stromules during
      innate immunity or exogenous application of the pro-defense signals, hydrogen
      peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid. Interestingly, numerous stromules surround
      nuclei during defense response, and these connections correlate with an
      accumulation of chloroplast-localized NRIP1 defense protein and H2O2 in the
      nucleus. Furthermore, silencing and knockout of chloroplast unusual positioning 1
      (CHUP1) that encodes a chloroplast outer envelope protein constitutively induces 
      stromules in the absence of pathogen infection and enhances programmed cell
      death. These results support a model in which stromules aid in the amplification 
      and/or transport of pro-defense signals into the nucleus and other subcellular
      compartments during immunity.

AB  - Pericytes are critical for cerebrovascular maturation and development of the
      blood-brain barrier (BBB), but their role in maintenance of the adult BBB, and
      how CNS pericytes differ from those of other tissues, is less well understood. We
      show that the forkhead transcription factor Foxf2 is specifically expressed in
      pericytes of the brain and that Foxf2(-/-) embryos develop intracranial
      hemorrhage, perivascular edema, thinning of the vascular basal lamina, an
      increase of luminal endothelial caveolae, and a leaky BBB. Foxf2(-/-) brain
      pericytes were more numerous, proliferated faster, and expressed significantly
      less Pdgfrbeta. Tgfbeta-Smad2/3 signaling was attenuated, whereas phosphorylation
      of Smad1/5 and p38 were enhanced. Tgfbeta pathway components, including Tgfbeta2,
      Tgfbetar2, Alk5, and integrins alphaVbeta8, were reduced. Foxf2 inactivation in
      adults resulted in BBB breakdown, endothelial thickening, and increased
      trans-endothelial vesicular transport. On the basis of these results, FOXF2
      emerges as an interesting candidate locus for stroke susceptibility in humans.

TI  - Taranis Protects Regenerating Tissue from Fate Changes Induced by the Wound
      Response in Drosophila.

AB  - Regenerating tissue must replace lost structures with cells of the proper
      identity and function. How regenerating tissue establishes or maintains correct
      cell fates during regrowth is an open question. We have identified a gene,
      taranis, that is essential for maintaining proper cell fate in damaged and
      regenerating Drosophila wing imaginal discs but that is dispensable for these
      fates in normal wing development. In regenerating tissue with reduced levels of
      Taranis, expression of the posterior selector gene engrailed is silenced through 
      an autoregulatory silencing mechanism that requires the PRC1 component
      polyhomeotic, resulting in a transformation of posterior tissue into anterior
      tissue late in regeneration. An essential component of the wound response, JNK
      signaling, induces this misregulation of engrailed expression. Taranis can
      suppress these JNK-induced cell fate changes without interfering with JNK
      signaling activity. Thus, taranis protects regenerating tissue from deleterious
      side effects of wound healing and regeneration.

TI  - POS-1 Promotes Endo-mesoderm Development by Inhibiting the Cytoplasmic
      Polyadenylation of neg-1 mRNA.

AB  - The regulation of mRNA translation is of fundamental importance in biological
      mechanisms ranging from embryonic axis specification to the formation of
      long-term memory. POS-1 is one of several CCCH zinc-finger RNA-binding proteins
      that regulate cell fate specification during C. elegans embryogenesis.
      Paradoxically, pos-1 mutants exhibit striking defects in endo-mesoderm
      development but have wild-type distributions of SKN-1, a key determinant of
      endo-mesoderm fates. RNAi screens for pos-1 suppressors identified genes encoding
      the cytoplasmic poly(A)-polymerase homolog GLD-2, the Bicaudal-C homolog GLD-3,
      and the protein NEG-1. We show that NEG-1 localizes in anterior nuclei, where it 
      negatively regulates endo-mesoderm fates. In posterior cells, POS-1 binds the
      neg-1 3' UTR to oppose GLD-2 and GLD-3 activities that promote NEG-1 expression
      and cytoplasmic lengthening of the neg-1 mRNA poly(A) tail. Our findings uncover 
      an intricate series of post-transcriptional regulatory interactions that,
      together, achieve precise spatial expression of endo-mesoderm fates in C. elegans
      embryos.

AB  - The diverse morphologies of animal tissues are underlain by different
      configurations of adherent cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we
      elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling
      involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin
      alpha5. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy within the zebrafish paraxial
      mesoderm mesenchyme reveals a physical association between Integrin alpha5 on
      adjacent cell membranes. This Integrin-Integrin complex correlates with
      conformationally inactive Integrin. Cadherin 2 stabilizes both the Integrin
      association and inactive Integrin conformation. Thus, Integrin repression within 
      the adherent mesenchymal interior of the tissue biases Fibronectin
      fibrillogenesis to the tissue surface lacking cell-cell adhesions. Along nascent 
      somite boundaries, Cadherin 2 levels decrease, becoming anti-correlated with
      levels of Integrin alpha5. Simultaneously, Integrin alpha5 clusters and adopts
      the active conformation and then commences ECM assembly. This cross-scale
      regulation of Integrin activation organizes a stereotypic pattern of ECM
      necessary for vertebrate body elongation and segmentation.

AB  - Recent findings have identified highly transcribed genes as a source of genome
      instability; however, the degree to which large-scale shifts in transcriptional
      activity cause DNA damage was not known. One example of a large-scale shift in
      transcriptional activity occurs during development, when maternal regulators are 
      destroyed and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs. Here, we show that ZGA
      triggers widespread chromosome damage in the primordial germ cells of the
      nematode C. elegans. We show that ZGA-induced DNA damage activates a checkpoint
      response, the damage is repaired by factors required for inter-sister homologous 
      recombination, and topoisomerase II plays a role in generating the damage. These 
      findings identify ZGA as a source of intrinsic genome instability in the germline
      and suggest that genome destabilization may be a general consequence of extreme
      shifts in cellular transcriptional load.

AB  - Efficient regeneration following injury is critical for maintaining tissue
      function and enabling organismal survival. Cells reconstituting damaged tissue
      are often generated from resident stem or progenitor cells or from cells that
      have dedifferentiated and become proliferative. While lineage-tracing studies
      have defined cellular sources of regeneration in many tissues, the process by
      which these cells execute the regenerative process is largely obscure. Here, we
      have identified tissue-resident progenitor cells that mediate regeneration of
      zebrafish stripe melanocytes and defined how these cells reconstitute
      pigmentation. Nearly all regeneration melanocytes arise through direct
      differentiation of progenitor cells. Wnt signaling is activated prior to
      differentiation, and inhibition of Wnt signaling impairs regeneration. Additional
      progenitors divide symmetrically to sustain the pool of progenitor cells.
      Combining direct differentiation with symmetric progenitor divisions may serve as
      a means to rapidly repair injured tissue while preserving the capacity to
      regenerate.

AB  - Left-right (LR) asymmetry is essential for organ development and function in
      metazoans, but how initial LR cue is relayed to tissues still remains unclear.
      Here, we propose a mechanism by which the Drosophila LR determinant Myosin ID
      (MyoID) transfers LR information to neighboring cells through the planar cell
      polarity (PCP) atypical cadherin Dachsous (Ds). Molecular interaction between
      MyoID and Ds in a specific LR organizer controls dextral cell polarity of
      adjoining hindgut progenitors and is required for organ looping in adults. Loss
      of Ds blocks hindgut tissue polarization and looping, indicating that Ds is a
      crucial factor for both LR cue transmission and asymmetric morphogenesis. We
      further show that the Ds/Fat and Frizzled PCP pathways are required for the
      spreading of LR asymmetry throughout the hindgut progenitor tissue. These results
      identify a direct functional coupling between the LR determinant MyoID and PCP,
      essential for non-autonomous propagation of early LR asymmetry.

AB  - Transcription factors of the TCF family are key mediators of the Wnt/beta-catenin
      pathway. TCF usually activates transcription on cis-regulatory elements
      containing TCF binding sites when the pathway is active and represses
      transcription when the pathway is inactive. However, some direct targets display 
      an opposite regulation (activated by TCF in the absence of Wnt), but the
      mechanism behind this atypical regulation remains poorly characterized. Here, we 
      use the cis-regulatory region of an opposite target gene, ttx-3, to dissect the
      mechanism of this atypical regulation. Using a combination of genetic, molecular,
      and biochemical experiments, we establish that, in the absence of Wnt pathway
      activation, TCF activates ttx-3 expression via a Zic binding site by forming a
      complex with a Zic transcription factor. This mechanism is later reinforced by
      specific bHLH factors. This study reveals an atypical mode of action for TCF that
      may apply to other binary decisions mediated by Wnt signaling.

      Interphasic Nuclear Pore Complex Assembly.

AB  - In metazoa, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are assembled from constituent
      nucleoporins by two distinct mechanisms: in the re-forming nuclear envelope at
      the end of mitosis and into the intact nuclear envelope during interphase. Here, 
      we show that the nucleoporin Nup153 is required for NPC assembly during
      interphase but not during mitotic exit. It functions in interphasic NPC formation
      by binding directly to the inner nuclear membrane via an N-terminal amphipathic
      helix. This binding facilitates the recruitment of the Nup107-160 complex, a
      crucial structural component of the NPC, to assembly sites. Our work further
      suggests that the nuclear transport receptor transportin and the small GTPase Ran
      regulate the interaction of Nup153 with the membrane and, in this way, direct
      pore complex assembly to the nuclear envelope during interphase.

AB  - Proper morphogenesis of neuronal dendritic spines is essential for the formation 
      of functional synaptic networks. However, it is not known how spines are
      initiated. Here, we identify the inverse-BAR (I-BAR) protein MIM/MTSS1 as a
      nucleator of dendritic spines. MIM accumulated to future spine initiation sites
      in a PIP2-dependent manner and deformed the plasma membrane outward into a
      proto-protrusion via its I-BAR domain. Unexpectedly, the initial protrusion
      formation did not involve actin polymerization. However, PIP2-dependent
      activation of Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly was required for protrusion
      elongation. Overexpression of MIM increased the density of dendritic protrusions 
      and suppressed spine maturation. In contrast, MIM deficiency led to decreased
      density of dendritic protrusions and larger spine heads. Moreover, MIM-deficient 
      mice displayed altered glutamatergic synaptic transmission and compatible
      behavioral defects. Collectively, our data identify an important morphogenetic
      pathway, which initiates spine protrusions by coupling phosphoinositide
      signaling, direct membrane bending, and actin assembly to ensure proper
      synaptogenesis.

AB  - Dynein recruitment to the nuclear envelope is required for pre-mitotic
      nucleus-centrosome interactions in nonneuronal cells and for apical nuclear
      migration in neural stem cells. In each case, dynein is recruited to the nuclear 
      envelope (NE) specifically during G2 via two nuclear pore-mediated mechanisms
      involving RanBP2-BicD2 and Nup133-CENP-F. The mechanisms responsible for
      cell-cycle control of this behavior are unknown. We now find that Cdk1 serves as 
      a direct master controller for NE dynein recruitment in neural stem cells and
      HeLa cells. Cdk1 phosphorylates conserved sites within RanBP2 and activates BicD2
      binding and early dynein recruitment. Late recruitment is triggered by a
      Cdk1-induced export of CENP-F from the nucleus. Forced NE targeting of BicD2
      overrides Cdk1 inhibition, fully rescuing dynein recruitment and nuclear
      migration in neural stem cells. These results reveal how NE dynein recruitment is
      cell-cycle regulated and identify the trigger mechanism for apical nuclear
      migration in the brain.

AB  - Ligands stimulate Notch receptors by inducing regulated intramembrane proteolysis
      (RIP) to produce a transcriptional effector. Notch activation requires unmasking 
      of a metalloprotease cleavage site remote from the site of ligand binding,
      raising the question of how proteolytic sensitivity is achieved. Here, we show
      that application of physiologically relevant forces to the Notch1 regulatory
      switch results in sensitivity to metalloprotease cleavage, and bound ligands
      induce Notch signal transduction in cells only in the presence of applied
      mechanical force. Synthetic receptor-ligand systems that remove the native
      ligand-receptor interaction also activate Notch by inducing proteolysis of the
      regulatory switch. Together, these studies show that mechanical force exerted by 
      signal-sending cells is required for ligand-induced Notch activation and
      establish that force-induced proteolysis can act as a mechanism of cellular
      mechanotransduction.

AB  - Recent studies in humans and in genetic mouse models have identified Slit- and
      NTRK-like family (Slitrks) as candidate genes for neuropsychiatric disorders. All
      Slitrk isotypes are highly expressed in the CNS, where they mediate neurite
      outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and neuronal survival. However, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying these functions are not known. Here, we report that Slitrk5
      modulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent biological responses
      through direct interaction with TrkB receptors. Under basal conditions, Slitrk5
      interacts primarily with a transsynaptic binding partner, protein tyrosine
      phosphatase delta (PTPdelta); however, upon BDNF stimulation, Slitrk5 shifts to
      cis-interactions with TrkB. In the absence of Slitrk5, TrkB has a reduced rate of
      ligand-dependent recycling and altered responsiveness to BDNF treatment.
      Structured illumination microscopy revealed that Slitrk5 mediates optimal
      targeting of TrkB receptors to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes through
      recruitment of a Rab11 effector protein, Rab11-FIP3. Thus, Slitrk5 acts as a TrkB
      co-receptor that mediates its BDNF-dependent trafficking and signaling.

AB  - In the absence of Wnt activation, cytosolic beta-catenin is degraded through
      GSK3/CK1-mediated phosphorylation at the N terminus. Here, we show that, upon Wnt
      activation, the stability of nuclear beta-catenin is regulated via
      methylation/demethylation. The protein lysine demethylases Kdm2a and Kdm2b
      regulate the turnover of non-phosphorylated beta-catenin specifically within the 
      nucleus via direct interaction with the fourth and fifth armadillo repeats. The
      lysine residues within this region are required for the methylation of
      non-phosphorylated beta-catenin, which is demethylated by Kdm2a/b and
      subsequently ubiquitylated. During Xenopus embryogenesis, kdm2a/b genes are
      transcribed during early embryogenesis and are required for the specification of 
      the body axis. Kdm2a/b knockdown in Xenopus embryos leads to increases in
      non-phosphorylated and methylated beta-catenin, concurrent with the upregulation 
      of beta-catenin target genes. This mechanism is required for controlling the
      output of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway to maintain normal cellular
      functions.

AB  - Tricellular junctions tightly seal epithelia at the corners of three cells. In
      this issue of Developmental Cell, Byri et al. (2015) show that Anakonda, a novel 
      Drosophila transmembrane protein, contains an unusual tripartite extracellular
      domain organization, which explains the tripartite septum filling the tricellular
      junction, previously revealed by ultrastructure analysis.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Yoshida et al. (2015) report that during
      meiosis I in mouse oocytes, the kinase Aurora B/C continuously destabilizes
      chromosome attachments to spindle microtubules, which potentially provides an
      explanation for the notably high error rate of chromosome segregation in
      mammalian oocytes.

AB  - Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized into topological domains, but how these are 
      established and maintained is poorly understood. Writing in Nature, Crane et al. 
      (2015) show that a specialized condensin complex enforces the domain boundaries
      along the C. elegans X chromosome to equalize transcription from the X between
      males and hermaphrodites.

AB  - Transcriptional mediators of cell stress pathways, including HIF1alpha, ATF4, and
      p53, are key to normal development and play critical roles in disease, including 
      ischemia and cancer. Despite their importance, mechanisms by which pathways
      mediated by these transcription factors interact with one another are not fully
      understood. In addressing the controversial role of HIF1alpha in cardiomyocytes
      (CMs) during heart development, we discovered a mid-gestational requirement for
      HIF1alpha for proliferation of hypoxic CMs, involving metabolic switching and a
      complex interplay among HIF1alpha, ATF4, and p53. Loss of HIF1alpha resulted in
      activation of ATF4 and p53, the latter inhibiting CM proliferation. Bioinformatic
      and biochemical analyses revealed unexpected mechanisms by which HIF1alpha
      intersects with ATF4 and p53 pathways. Our results highlight previously
      undescribed roles of HIF1alpha and interactions among major cell stress pathways 
      that could be targeted to enhance proliferation of CMs in ischemia and may have
      relevance to other diseases, including cancer.

AB  - A model for mitosis suggests that correct kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT)
      attachments are stabilized by spatial separation of the attachment sites from
      Aurora B kinase through sister KT stretching. However, the spatiotemporal
      regulation of attachment stability during meiosis I (MI) in oocytes remains
      unclear. Here, we found that in mouse oocytes, Aurora B and C (B/C) are located
      in close proximity to KT-MT attachment sites after bivalent stretching due to an 
      intrinsic property of the MI chromosomes. The Aurora B/C activity destabilizes
      correct attachments while allowing a considerable amount of incorrect attachments
      to form. KT-MT attachments are eventually stabilized through KT dephosphorylation
      by PP2A-B56 phosphatase, which is progressively recruited to KTs depending on the
      BubR1 phosphorylation resulting from the timer Cdk1 and independent of bivalent
      stretching. Thus, oocytes lack a mechanism for coordinating bivalent stretching
      and KT phosphoregulation during MI, which may explain the high frequency of KT-MT
      attachment errors.

      Maintains Phosphoinositide Signaling Competence.

AB  - Sustained agonist-induced production of the second messengers InsP3 and
      diacylglycerol requires steady delivery of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) from its
      site of synthesis in the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) to maintain PtdIns(4,5)P2
      levels. Similarly, phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), generated from diacylglycerol in
      the PM, has to reach the ER for PtdIns resynthesis. Here, we show that the
      Drosophila RdgB homolog, Nir2, a presumed PtdIns transfer protein, not only
      transfers PtdIns from the ER to the PM but also transfers PtdOH to the opposite
      direction at ER-PM contact sites. PtdOH delivery to the ER is impaired in
      Nir2-depleted cells, leading to limited PtdIns synthesis and ultimately to loss
      of signaling from phospholipase C-coupled receptors. These studies reveal a
      unique feature of Nir2, namely its ability to serve as a highly localized lipid
      exchanger that ensures that PtdIns synthesis is matched with PtdIns(4,5)P2
      utilization so that cells maintain their signaling competence.

AB  - Stem cells in plants and animals are maintained pluripotent by signals from
      adjacent niche cells. In plants, WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factors are
      central regulators of stem cell maintenance in different meristem types, yet
      their molecular mode of action has remained elusive. Here we show that in the
      Arabidopsis root meristem, the WOX5 protein moves from the root niche organizer, 
      the quiescent center, into the columella stem cells, where it directly represses 
      the transcription factor gene CDF4. This creates a gradient of CDF4
      transcription, which promotes differentiation opposite to the WOX5 gradient,
      allowing stem cell daughter cells to exit the stem cell state. We further show
      that WOX5 represses CDF4 transcription by recruiting TPL/TPR co-repressors and
      the histone deacetylase HDA19, which consequently induces histone deacetylation
      at the CDF4 regulatory region. Our results show that chromatin-mediated
      repression of differentiation programs is a common strategy in plant and animal
      stem cell niches.

AB  - Exposing cells to folding stress causes a subset of their proteins to misfold and
      accumulate in inclusion bodies (IBs). IB formation and clearance are both active 
      processes, but little is known about their mechanism. To shed light on this
      issue, we performed a screen with over 4,000 fluorescently tagged yeast proteins 
      for co-localization with a model misfolded protein that marks IBs during folding 
      stress. We identified 13 proteins that co-localize to IBs. Remarkably, one of
      these IB proteins, the uncharacterized and conserved protein Iml2, exhibited
      strong physical interactions with lipid droplet (LD) proteins. Indeed, we here
      show that IBs and LDs are spatially and functionally linked. We further
      demonstrate a mechanism for IB clearance via a sterol-based metabolite emanating 
      from LDs. Our findings therefore uncover a function for Iml2 and LDs in
      regulating a critical stage of cellular proteostasis.

AB  - Nuclear size changes dynamically during development and has long been observed to
      correlate with the space surrounding the nucleus, as well as with the volume of
      the cell. Here we combine an in vitro cell-free system of Xenopus laevis egg
      extract with microfluidic devices to systematically analyze the effect of spatial
      constraints. The speed of nuclear expansion depended on the available space
      surrounding the nucleus up to a threshold volume in the nanoliter range, herein
      referred to as the nuclear domain. Under spatial constraints smaller than this
      nuclear domain, the size of microtubule-occupied space surrounding the nucleus
      turned out to be limiting for the accumulation of membranes around the nucleus
      via the motor protein dynein, therefore determining the speed of nuclear
      expansion. This mechanism explains how spatial information surrounding the
      nucleus, such as the positioning of the nucleus inside the cell, can control
      nuclear expansion.

AB  - During cell division, polarized epithelial cells employ mechanisms to preserve
      cell polarity and tissue integrity. In dividing cells of the mammalian skin,
      planar cell polarity (PCP) is maintained through the bulk internalization, equal 
      segregation, and polarized recycling of cortical PCP proteins. The dramatic
      redistribution of PCP proteins coincides precisely with cell-cycle progression,
      but the mechanisms coordinating PCP and mitosis are unknown. Here we identify
      Plk1 as a master regulator of PCP dynamics during mitosis. Plk1 interacts with
      core PCP component Celsr1 via a conserved polo-box domain (PBD)-binding motif,
      localizes to mitotic endosomes, and directly phosphorylates Celsr1.
      Plk1-dependent phosphorylation activates the endocytic motif specifically during 
      mitosis, allowing bulk recruitment of Celsr1 into endosomes. Inhibiting Plk1
      activity blocks PCP internalization and perturbs PCP asymmetry. Mimicking
      dileucine motif phosphorylation is sufficient to drive Celsr1 internalization
      during interphase. Thus, Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Celsr1 ensures that PCP
      redistribution is precisely coordinated with mitotic entry.

TI  - The Triple-Repeat Protein Anakonda Controls Epithelial Tricellular Junction
      Formation in Drosophila.

AB  - In epithelia, specialized tricellular junctions (TCJs) mediate cell contacts at
      three-cell vertices. TCJs are fundamental to epithelial biology and disease, but 
      only a few TCJ components are known, and how they assemble at tricellular
      vertices is not understood. Here we describe a transmembrane protein, Anakonda
      (Aka), which localizes to TCJs and is essential for the formation of tricellular,
      but not bicellular, junctions in Drosophila. Loss of Aka causes epithelial
      barrier defects associated with irregular TCJ structure and geometry, suggesting 
      that Aka organizes cell corners. Aka is necessary and sufficient for accumulation
      of Gliotactin at TCJs, suggesting that Aka initiates TCJ assembly by recruiting
      other proteins to tricellular vertices. Aka's extracellular domain has an unusual
      tripartite repeat structure that may mediate self-assembly, directed by the
      geometry of tricellular vertices. Conversely, Aka's cytoplasmic tail is
      dispensable for TCJ localization. Thus, extracellular interactions, rather than
      TCJ-directed intracellular transport, appear to mediate TCJ assembly.

AB  - Biological tissues must generate forces to shape organs and achieve proper
      development. Such forces often result from the contraction of an apical
      acto-myosin meshwork. Here we describe an alternative mechanism for tissue
      contraction, based on individual cell volume change. We show that during
      Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), a wound healing-related process, the contraction 
      of the amnioserosa (AS) is associated with a major reduction of the volume of its
      cells, triggered by caspase activation at the onset of the apoptotic program of
      AS cells. Cell volume decrease results in a contractile force that promotes
      tissue shrinkage. Estimating mechanical tensions with laser dissection and using 
      3D biophysical modeling, we show that the cell volume decrease acts together with
      the contraction of the actin cable surrounding the tissue to govern DC kinetics. 
      Our study identifies a mechanism by which tissues generate forces and movements
      by modulating individual cell volume during development.

AB  - Maturation of a vascular plexus is a critical and yet incompletely understood
      process in organ development, and known maturation factors act universally in all
      vascular beds. In this study, we show that CXCL12 is an organ-specific maturation
      factor of particular relevance in coronary arterial vasculature. In vitro, CXCL12
      does not influence nascent vessel formation, but promotes higher-order complexity
      of preinitiated vessels. In the heart, CXCL12 is expressed principally by the
      epicardium, and its receptor CXCR4 is expressed by coronary endothelial cells.
      CXCL12 is not a chemotactic signal for endothelial cell migration, but rather
      acts in a paracrine manner to influence the maturation of the coronary vascular
      plexus. Mutants in CXCL12 signaling show an excess of immature capillary chains
      and a selective failure in arterial maturation, and become leaky with the onset
      of coronary perfusion. Failed maturation of the coronary system explains the
      late-gestation lethality of these mutants.

AB  - The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 have many functions during embryonic 
      and post-natal life. We used murine models to investigate the role of
      CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in cardiac development and found that embryonic
      Cxcl12-null hearts lacked intra-ventricular coronary arteries (CAs) and exhibited
      absent or misplaced CA stems. We traced the origin of this phenotype to defects
      in the early stages of CA stem formation. CA stems derive from the peritruncal
      plexus, an encircling capillary network that invades the wall of the developing
      aorta. We showed that CXCL12 is present at high levels in the outflow tract,
      while peritruncal endothelial cells (ECs) express CXCR4. In the absence of
      CXCL12, ECs were abnormally localized and impaired in their ability to anastomose
      with the aortic lumen. We propose that CXCL12 is required for connection of
      peritruncal plexus ECs to the aortic endothelium and thus plays a vital role in
      CA formation.

AB  - Interruption of the coronary blood supply severely impairs heart function with
      often fatal consequences for patients. However, the formation and maturation of
      these coronary vessels is not fully understood. Here we provide a detailed
      analysis of coronary vessel development in zebrafish. We observe that coronary
      vessels form in zebrafish by angiogenic sprouting of arterial cells derived from 
      the endocardium at the atrioventricular canal. Endothelial cells express the
      CXC-motif chemokine receptor Cxcr4a and migrate to vascularize the ventricle
      under the guidance of the myocardium-expressed ligand Cxcl12b. cxcr4a mutant
      zebrafish fail to form a vascular network, whereas ectopic expression of Cxcl12b 
      ligand induces coronary vessel formation. Importantly, cxcr4a mutant zebrafish
      fail to undergo heart regeneration following injury. Our results suggest that
      chemokine signaling has an essential role in coronary vessel formation by
      directing migration of endocardium-derived endothelial cells. Poorly developed
      vasculature in cxcr4a mutants likely underlies decreased regenerative potential
      in adults.

      Regulation of Lysosomal Ca2+ Release.

AB  - Promoting lysosomal trafficking represents a promising therapeutic approach for
      lysosome storage diseases. Efficient Ca(2+) mobilization from lysosomes is
      important for lysosomal trafficking. Ca(2+) release from lysosomes could generate
      a negative potential in the lumen to disturb subsequent Ca(2+) release in the
      absence of counter ion flux. Here we report that lysosomes express
      big-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels that form physical and
      functional coupling with the lysosomal Ca(2+) release channel, TRPML1. Ca(2+)
      release via TRPML1 causes BK activation, which in turn facilitates further
      lysosomal Ca(2+) release and membrane trafficking. Importantly, BK overexpression
      rescues the impaired TRPML1-mediated Ca(2+) release and abnormal lysosomal
      storage in cells from Niemann-Pick C1 patients. Therefore, we have identified a
      lysosomal K(+) channel that provides a positive feedback mechanism to facilitate 
      TRPML1-mediated Ca(2+) release and membrane trafficking. Our findings suggest
      that upregulating BK may be a potential therapeutic strategy for certain
      lysosomal storage diseases and common neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Sensory dendrites innervate peripheral tissues through cell-cell interactions
      that are poorly understood. The proprioceptive neuron PVD in C. elegans extends
      regular terminal dendritic branches between muscle and hypodermis. We found that 
      the PVD branch pattern was instructed by adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM, which
      formed regularly spaced stripes on the hypodermal cell. The regularity of the
      SAX-7 pattern originated from the repeated and regularly spaced dense body of the
      sarcomeres in the muscle. The extracellular proteoglycan UNC-52/Perlecan linked
      the dense body to the hemidesmosome on the hypodermal cells, which in turn
      instructed the SAX-7 stripes and PVD dendrites. Both UNC-52 and hemidesmosome
      components exhibited highly regular stripes that interdigitated with the SAX-7
      stripe and PVD dendrites, reflecting the striking precision of subcellular
      patterning between muscle, hypodermis, and dendrites. Hence, the muscular
      contractile apparatus provides the instructive cues to pattern proprioceptive
      dendrites.

AB  - Anillins and Mid1 are scaffold proteins that play key roles in anchorage of the
      contractile ring at the cell equator during cytokinesis in animals and fungi,
      respectively. Here, we report crystal structures and functional analysis of human
      anillin and S. pombe Mid1. The combined data show anillin contains a cryptic C2
      domain and a Rho-binding domain. Together with the tethering PH domain, three
      membrane-associating elements synergistically bind to RhoA and phospholipids to
      anchor anillin at the cleavage furrow. Surprisingly, Mid1 also binds to the
      membrane through a cryptic C2 domain. Dimerization of Mid1 leads to high affinity
      and preference for PI(4,5)P2, which stably anchors Mid1 at the division plane,
      bypassing the requirement for Rho GTPase. These findings uncover the unexpected
      general machinery and the divergent regulatory logics for the anchorage of the
      contractile ring through the anillin/Mid1 family proteins from yeast to humans.

AB  - Blood cell development in Drosophila shares significant similarities with
      vertebrate. The conservation ranges from biphasic mode of hematopoiesis to
      signaling molecules crucial for progenitor cell formation, maintenance, and
      differentiation. Primitive hematopoiesis in Drosophila ensues in embryonic head
      mesoderm, whereas definitive hematopoiesis happens in larval hematopoietic organ,
      the lymph gland. This organ, with the onset of pupation, ruptures to release
      hemocytes into circulation. It is believed that the adult lacks a hematopoietic
      organ and survives on the contribution of both embryonic and larval
      hematopoiesis. However, our studies revealed a surge of blood cell development in
      the dorsal abdominal hemocyte clusters of adult fly. These active hematopoietic
      hubs are capable of blood cell specification and can respond to bacterial
      challenges. The presence of progenitors and differentiated hemocytes embedded in 
      a functional network of Laminin A and Pericardin within this hematopoietic hub
      projects it as a simple version of the vertebrate bone marrow.

AB  - Fundamental to cellular processes are directional movements driven by molecular
      motors. A common theme for these and other molecular machines driven by ATP is
      that controlled release of hydrolysis products is essential for using the
      chemical energy efficiently. Mechanochemical transduction by myosin motors on
      actin is coupled to unknown structural changes that result in the sequential
      release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and MgADP. We present here a myosin structure
      possessing an actin-binding interface and a tunnel (back door) that creates an
      escape route for Pi with a minimal rotation of the myosin lever arm that drives
      movements. We propose that this state represents the beginning of the powerstroke
      on actin and that Pi translocation from the nucleotide pocket triggered by actin 
      binding initiates myosin force generation. This elucidates how actin initiates
      force generation and movement and may represent a strategy common to many
      molecular machines.

AB  - Throughout the developing nervous system, neural stem and progenitor cells give
      rise to diverse classes of neurons and glia in a spatially and temporally
      coordinated manner. In the ventral spinal cord, much of this diversity emerges
      through the morphogen actions of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Interpretation of the Shh 
      gradient depends on both the amount of ligand and duration of exposure, but the
      mechanisms permitting prolonged responses to Shh are not well understood. We
      demonstrate that Notch signaling plays an essential role in this process,
      enabling neural progenitors to attain sufficiently high levels of Shh pathway
      activity needed to direct the ventral-most cell fates. Notch activity regulates
      subcellular localization of the Shh receptor Patched1, gating the translocation
      of the key effector Smoothened to primary cilia and its downstream signaling
      activities. These data reveal an unexpected role for Notch shaping the
      interpretation of the Shh morphogen gradient and influencing cell fate
      determination.

AB  - Membrane trafficking is key to the cell biological mechanisms underlying
      development. Rab GTPases control specific membrane compartments, from core
      secretory and endocytic machinery to less-well-understood compartments. We tagged
      all 27 Drosophila Rabs with YFP(MYC) at their endogenous chromosomal loci,
      determined their expression and subcellular localization in six tissues
      comprising 23 cell types, and provide this data in an annotated, searchable image
      database. We demonstrate the utility of these lines for controlled knockdown and 
      show that similar subcellular localization can predict redundant functions. We
      exploit this comprehensive resource to ask whether a common Rab compartment
      architecture underlies epithelial polarity. Strikingly, no single arrangement of 
      Rabs characterizes the five epithelia we examine. Rather, epithelia flexibly
      polarize Rab distribution, producing membrane trafficking architectures that are 
      tissue- and stage-specific. Thus, the core machinery responsible for epithelial
      polarization is unlikely to rely on polarized positioning of specific Rab
      compartments.

AB  - Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons arise from heterogeneous precursors
      that differentiate in two neurogenic waves, respectively controlled by Neurog2
      and Neurog1. We show here that transgenic mice expressing a Zeb1/2
      dominant-negative form (DBZEB) exhibit reduced numbers of nociceptors and altered
      pain sensitivity. This reflects an early impairment of Neurog1-dependent
      neurogenesis due to the depletion of specific sensory precursor pools, which is
      slightly later partially compensated by the contribution of boundary cap cells
      (BCCs). Indeed, combined DBZEB expression and genetic BCCs ablation entirely
      deplete second wave precursors and, in turn, nociceptors, thus recapitulating the
      Neurog1(-/-) neuronal phenotype. Altogether, our results uncover roles for Zeb
      family members in the developing DRGs; they show that the Neurog1-dependent
      sensory neurogenesis can be functionally partitioned in two successive phases;
      and finally, they illustrate plasticity in the developing peripheral
      somatosensory system supported by the BCCs, thereby providing a rationale for
      sensory precursor diversity.

AB  - The abundance of cell-surface membrane proteins is regulated by internalization
      and delivery into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular bodies (MVBs).
      Many cargoes are ubiquitinated, allowing access to an ESCRT-dependent pathway
      into MVBs. Yet how nonubiquitinated proteins, such as
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, enter MVBs is unclear, supporting
      the possibility of mechanistically distinct ILV biogenesis pathways. Here we show
      that a family of highly ubiquitinated tetraspan Cos proteins provides a Ub signal
      in trans, allowing sorting of nonubiquitinated MVB cargo into the canonical
      ESCRT- and Ub-dependent pathway. Cos proteins create discrete endosomal
      subdomains that concentrate Ub cargo prior to their envelopment into ILVs, and
      the activity of Cos proteins is required not only for efficient sorting of
      canonical Ub cargo but also for sorting nonubiquitinated cargo into MVBs.
      Expression of these proteins increases during nutrient stress through an
      NAD(+)/Sir2-dependent mechanism that in turn accelerates the downregulation of a 
      broad range of cell-surface proteins.

AB  - Human centromeres are specified by a stably inherited epigenetic mark that
      maintains centromere position and function through a two-step mechanism relying
      on self-templating centromeric chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant
      CENP-A, followed by CENP-A-dependent nucleation of kinetochore assembly.
      Nevertheless, natural human centromeres are positioned within specific megabase
      chromosomal regions containing alpha-satellite DNA repeats, which contain binding
      sites for the DNA sequence-specific binding protein CENP-B. We now demonstrate
      that CENP-B directly binds both CENP-A's amino-terminal tail and CENP-C, a key
      nucleator of kinetochore assembly. DNA sequence-dependent binding of CENP-B
      within alpha-satellite repeats is required to stabilize optimal centromeric
      levels of CENP-C. Chromosomes bearing centromeres without bound CENP-B, including
      the human Y chromosome, are shown to mis-segregate in cells at rates several-fold
      higher than chromosomes with CENP-B-containing centromeres. These data
      demonstrate a DNA sequence-specific enhancement by CENP-B of the fidelity of
      epigenetically defined human centromere function.

AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are selective transport channels embedded in the
      nuclear envelope. The cylindrical NPC core forms a protein coat lining a highly
      curved membrane opening and has a basket-like structure appended to the
      nucleoplasmic side. How NPCs interact with lipids, promoting membrane bending and
      NPC integrity, is poorly understood. Here we show that the NPC basket proteins
      Nup1 and Nup60 directly induce membrane curvature by amphipathic helix insertion 
      into the lipid bilayer. In a cell-free system, both Nup1 and Nup60 transform
      spherical liposomes into highly curved membrane structures. In vivo, high levels 
      of the Nup1/Nup60 amphipathic helices cause deformation of the yeast nuclear
      membrane, whereas adjacent helical regions contribute to anchoring the basket to 
      the NPC core. Basket amphipathic helices are functionally linked to distinct
      transmembrane nucleoporins of the NPC core, suggesting a key contribution to the 
      membrane remodeling events that underlie NPC assembly.

AB  - Early anatomists noted the close juxtaposition of arteries and veins, which
      modern physiologists proposed aided temperature regulation. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Kidoya and colleagues (2015) demonstrate that the secreted
      protein Apelin and hematopoietic-endothelial cell interactions create this
      arrangement, providing genetic evidence for its function as a heat-exchange
      mechanism.

AB  - TORC1 regulates growth and metabolism, in part, by influencing transcriptional
      programs. Here, we identify REPTOR and REPTOR-BP as transcription factors
      downstream of TORC1 that are required for approximately 90% of the
      transcriptional induction that occurs upon TORC1 inhibition in Drosophila. Thus, 
      REPTOR and REPTOR-BP are major effectors of the transcriptional stress response
      induced upon TORC1 inhibition, analogous to the role of FOXO downstream of Akt.
      We find that, when TORC1 is active, it phosphorylates REPTOR on Ser527 and
      Ser530, leading to REPTOR cytoplasmic retention. Upon TORC1 inhibition, REPTOR
      becomes dephosphorylated in a PP2A-dependent manner, shuttles into the nucleus,
      joins its partner REPTOR-BP to bind target genes, and activates their
      transcription. In vivo functional analysis using knockout flies reveals that
      REPTOR and REPTOR-BP play critical roles in maintaining energy homeostasis and
      promoting animal survival upon nutrient restriction.

AB  - Molecular pathways regulating the development of arterial and venous endothelial 
      cells (ECs) are now well established, but control of parallel arterial-venous
      alignment is unclear. Here we report that arterial-venous alignment in the skin
      is determined by apelin receptor (APJ) expression in venous ECs. One of the
      activators of APJ is apelin. We found that apelin is produced by arterial ECs
      during embryogenesis, induces chemotaxis of venous ECs, and promotes the
      production of secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) by APJ(+) ECs. sFRP1
      stimulates matrix metalloproteinase production by Ly6B.2(+) neutrophil-like cells
      located between the arteries and veins, resulting in remodeling of extracellular 
      matrices to support venous displacement. Moreover, using apelin- or APJ-deficient
      mice, which exhibit arterial-venous disorganization, we found that
      arterial-venous alignment is involved in thermoregulation, possibly by regulating
      countercurrent heat exchange. We hypothesize that the evolution of parallel
      juxtapositional arterial-venous alignment was an adaptation to reduce body heat
      loss.

AB  - Food deprivation suppresses animal growth and development but spares the systems 
      essential for foraging. The mechanisms underlying this selective development, and
      potential roles of lipids in it, are unclear. When C. elegans hatch in a
      food-free environment, postembryonic growth and development stall, but sensory
      neuron differentiation and neuronal development required for food responses
      continue. Here, we show that monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) and 
      their derivative, d17iso-glucosylceramide, function in the intestine to promote
      foraging behavior and sensory neuron maturation through both TORC1-dependent and 
      -independent mechanisms. We show that mmBCFAs impact the expression of a subset
      of genes, including ceh-36/Hox, which we show to play a key role in mediating the
      regulation of the neuronal functions by this lipid pathway. This study uncovers
      that a lipid pathway promotes neuronal functions involved in foraging under both 
      fed and fasting conditions and adds critical insight into the physiological
      functions of TORC1.

AB  - Morphogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration of epithelial tissues rely on the
      accurate orientation of cell divisions, which is specified by the mitotic spindle
      axis. To remain in the epithelial plane, symmetrically dividing epithelial cells 
      align their mitotic spindle axis with the plane. Here, we show that this
      alignment depends on epithelial cell-cell communication via semaphorin-plexin
      signaling. During kidney morphogenesis and repair, renal tubular epithelial cells
      lacking the transmembrane receptor Plexin-B2 or its semaphorin ligands fail to
      correctly orient the mitotic spindle, leading to severe defects in epithelial
      architecture and function. Analyses of a series of transgenic and knockout mice
      indicate that Plexin-B2 controls the cell division axis by signaling through its 
      GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and Cdc42. Our data uncover
      semaphorin-plexin signaling as a central regulatory mechanism of mitotic spindle 
      orientation necessary for the alignment of epithelial cell divisions with the
      epithelial plane.

AB  - Plant root development is informed by numerous edaphic cues. Phosphate (Pi)
      availability impacts the root system architecture by adjusting meristem activity.
      However, the sensory mechanisms monitoring external Pi status are elusive. Two
      functionally interacting Arabidopsis genes, LPR1 (ferroxidase) and PDR2 (P5-type 
      ATPase), are key players in root Pi sensing, which is modified by iron (Fe)
      availability. We show that the LPR1-PDR2 module facilitates, upon Pi limitation, 
      cell-specific apoplastic Fe and callose deposition in the meristem and elongation
      zone of primary roots. Expression of cell-wall-targeted LPR1 determines the sites
      of Fe accumulation as well as callose production, which interferes with
      symplastic communication in the stem cell niche, as demonstrated by impaired
      SHORT-ROOT movement. Antagonistic interactions of Pi and Fe availability control 
      primary root growth via meristem-specific callose formation, likely triggered by 
      LPR1-dependent redox signaling. Our results link callose-regulated cell-to-cell
      signaling in root meristems to the perception of an abiotic cue.

AB  - In metazoans, cytokinesis is triggered by activation of the GTPase RhoA at the
      equatorial plasma membrane. ECT-2, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
      required for RhoA activation, is activated by the centralspindlin complex that
      concentrates on spindle midzone microtubules. However, these microtubules and the
      plasma membrane are not generally in apposition, and thus the mechanism by which 
      RhoA is activated at the cell equator remains unknown. Here we report that a
      regulated pool of membrane-bound, oligomeric centralspindlin stimulates RhoA
      activation. The membrane-binding C1 domain of CYK-4, a centralspindlin component,
      promotes furrow initiation in C. elegans embryos and human cells. Membrane
      localization of centralspindlin oligomers is globally inhibited by PAR-5/14-3-3. 
      This activity is antagonized by the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), resulting
      in RhoA activation at the nascent cleavage site. Therefore, CPC-directed
      centralspindlin oligomerization during anaphase induces contractile ring assembly
      at the membrane.

AB  - The positioning of lysosomes within the cytoplasm is emerging as a critical
      determinant of many lysosomal functions. Here we report the identification of a
      multisubunit complex named BORC that regulates lysosome positioning. BORC
      comprises eight subunits, some of which are shared with the BLOC-1 complex
      involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and the others of
      which are products of previously uncharacterized open reading frames. BORC
      associates peripherally with the lysosomal membrane, where it functions to
      recruit the small GTPase Arl8. This initiates a chain of interactions that
      promotes the kinesin-dependent movement of lysosomes toward the plus ends of
      microtubules in the peripheral cytoplasm. Interference with BORC or other
      components of this pathway results in collapse of the lysosomal population into
      the pericentriolar region. In turn, this causes reduced cell spreading and
      migration, highlighting the importance of BORC-dependent centrifugal transport
      for non-degradative functions of lysosomes.

TI  - CALM regulates clathrin-coated vesicle size and maturation by directly sensing
      and driving membrane curvature.
PG  - 163-75

AB  - The size of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) is remarkably uniform,
      suggesting that it is optimized to achieve the appropriate levels of cargo and
      lipid internalization. The three most abundant proteins in mammalian endocytic
      CCVs are clathrin and the two cargo-selecting, clathrin adaptors, CALM and AP2.
      Here we demonstrate that depletion of CALM causes a substantial increase in the
      ratio of "open" clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) to "necked"/"closed" CCVs and a
      doubling of CCP/CCV diameter, whereas AP2 depletion has opposite effects.
      Depletion of either adaptor, however, significantly inhibits endocytosis of
      transferrin and epidermal growth factor. The phenotypic effects of CALM depletion
      can be rescued by re-expression of wild-type CALM, but not with CALM that lacks a
      functional N-terminal, membrane-inserting, curvature-sensing/driving amphipathic 
      helix, the existence and properties of which are demonstrated. CALM is thus a
      major factor in controlling CCV size and maturation and hence in determining the 
      rates of endocytic cargo uptake.

AB  - Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the main trafficking route from the plasma
      membrane to the cytoplasm, is critical to many fundamental cellular processes.
      Clathrin, coupled to the membrane by adaptor proteins, is thought to play a major
      structural role in endocytosis by self-assembling into a cage-like lattice around
      the forming vesicle. Although clathrin adaptors are essential for endocytosis,
      little is known about their structural role in this process. Here we show that
      the membrane-binding domains of two conserved clathrin adaptors, Sla2 and Ent1,
      co-assemble in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner to form organized lattices on
      membranes. We determined the structure of the co-assembled lattice by electron
      cryo-microscopy and designed mutations that specifically impair the lattice
      formation in vitro. We show that these mutations block endocytosis in vivo. We
      suggest that clathrin adaptors not only link the polymerized clathrin to the
      membrane but also form an oligomeric structure, which is essential for membrane
      remodeling during endocytosis.

AB  - In order for an organism to maintain its form, it must be able to withstand
      physical perturbation, including the pull of gravity. A recent study in Nature
      from Porazinski and colleagues (2015) suggests that mechanisms promoting tissue
      tension are critical to resist the Earth's downward pull.

AB  - Intracellular trafficking requires careful positioning of organelles within the
      cellular three-dimensional space. Pu et al. (2015) now provide evidence for a
      multisubunit complex, named BORC, that regulates the positioning of lysosomes at 
      the cell periphery and consequently affects cell migration.

AB  - Endocytosis is the physical battle to form a new vesicle in the face of
      counteracting forces, such as membrane tension. Skruzny et al. (2015) and Miller 
      et al. (2015) now shed light on endocytic proteins that bear a "Helix 0" and on
      the proteins' role in the struggle to make clathrin-coated vesicles.

AB  - During embryogenesis, ectodermal stem cells adopt different fates and form
      diverse ectodermal organs, such as teeth, hair follicles, mammary glands, and
      salivary glands. Interestingly, these ectodermal organs differ in their tissue
      homeostasis, which leads to differential abilities for continuous growth
      postnatally. Mouse molars lose the ability to grow continuously, whereas incisors
      retain this ability. In this study, we found that a BMP-Smad4-SHH-Gli1 signaling 
      network may provide a niche supporting transient Sox2+ dental epithelial stem
      cells in mouse molars. This mechanism also plays a role in continuously growing
      mouse incisors. The differential fate of epithelial stem cells in mouse molars
      and incisors is controlled by this BMP/SHH signaling network, which partially
      accounts for the different postnatal growth potential of molars and incisors.
      Collectively, our study highlights the importance of crosstalk between two
      signaling pathways, BMP and SHH, in regulating the fate of epithelial stem cells 
      during organogenesis.

TI  - Activation of Galphai at the Golgi by GIV/Girdin imposes finiteness in Arf1
      signaling.

AB  - A long-held tenet of heterotrimeric G protein signal transduction is that it is
      triggered by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the PM. Here, we demonstrate 
      that Gi is activated in the Golgi by GIV/Girdin, a non-receptor
      guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GIV-dependent activation of Gi at the
      Golgi maintains the finiteness of the cyclical activation of ADP-ribosylation
      factor 1 (Arf1), a fundamental step in vesicle traffic in all eukaryotes. Several
      interactions with other major components of Golgi trafficking-e.g., active Arf1, 
      its regulator, ArfGAP2/3, and the adaptor protein beta-COP-enable GIV to
      coordinately regulate Arf1 signaling. When the GIV-Galphai pathway is selectively
      inhibited, levels of GTP-bound Arf1 are elevated and protein transport along the 
      secretory pathway is delayed. These findings define a paradigm in non-canonical G
      protein signaling at the Golgi, which places GIV-GEF at the crossroads between
      signals gated by the trimeric G proteins and the Arf family of monomeric GTPases.

AB  - Cell polarization is linked to fate determination during asymmetric division of
      plant stem cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In
      Arabidopsis, BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE (BASL) is polarized to
      control stomatal asymmetric division. A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      cascade determines terminal stomatal fate by promoting the degradation of the
      lineage determinant SPEECHLESS (SPCH). Here, we demonstrate that a
      positive-feedback loop between BASL and the MAPK pathway constitutes a polarity
      module at the cortex. Cortical localization of BASL requires phosphorylation
      mediated by MPK3/6. Phosphorylated BASL functions as a scaffold and recruits the 
      MAPKKK YODA and MPK3/6 to spatially concentrate signaling at the cortex.
      Activated MPK3/6 reinforces the feedback loop by phosphorylating BASL and
      inhibits stomatal fate by phosphorylating SPCH. Polarization of the BASL-MAPK
      signaling feedback module represents a mechanism connecting cell polarity to fate
      differentiation during asymmetric stem cell division in plants.

AB  - Current dogma suggests that salivary gland homeostasis is stem cell dependent.
      However, the extent of stem cell contribution to salivary gland maintenance has
      not been determined. We investigated acinar cell replacement during homeostasis, 
      growth, and regeneration, using an inducible CreER(T2) expressed under the
      control of the Mist1 gene locus. Genetic labeling, followed by a chase period,
      showed that acinar cell replacement is not driven by the differentiation of
      unlabeled stem cells. Analysis using R26(Brainbow2.1) reporter revealed continued
      proliferation and clonal expansion of terminally differentiated acinar cells in
      all major salivary glands. Induced injury also demonstrated the regenerative
      potential of pre-labeled acinar cells. Our results support a revised model for
      salivary gland homeostasis based predominantly on self-duplication of acinar
      cells, rather than on differentiation of stem cells. The proliferative capacity
      of differentiated acinar cells may prove critical in the implementation of
      cell-based strategies to restore the salivary glands.

AB  - Developmental transitions can be described in terms of morphology and the roles
      of individual genes, but also in terms of global transcriptional and epigenetic
      changes. Temporal dissections of transcriptome changes, however, are rare for
      intact, developing tissues. We used RNA sequencing and microarray platforms to
      quantify gene expression from labeled cells isolated by fluorescence-activated
      cell sorting to generate cell-type-specific transcriptomes during development of 
      an adult stem-cell lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf. We show that regulatory
      modules in this early lineage link cell types that had previously been considered
      to be under separate control and provide evidence for recruitment of individual
      members of gene families for different developmental decisions. Because stomata
      are physiologically important and because stomatal lineage cells exhibit
      exemplary division, cell fate, and cell signaling behaviors, this dataset serves 
      as a valuable resource for further investigations of fundamental developmental
      processes.

AB  - Condensin I is a five-subunit protein complex that plays a central role in
      mitotic chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes. To dissect its
      mechanism of action, we reconstituted wild-type and mutant complexes from
      recombinant subunits and tested their abilities to assemble chromosomes in
      Xenopus egg cell-free extracts depleted of endogenous condensins. We find that
      ATP binding and hydrolysis by SMC subunits have distinct contributions to the
      action of condensin I and that continuous ATP hydrolysis is required for
      structural maintenance of chromosomes. Mutant complexes lacking either one of two
      HEAT subunits produce abnormal chromosomes with highly characteristic defects and
      have contrasting structural effects on chromosome axes preassembled with the
      wild-type complex. We propose that balancing acts of the two HEAT subunits
      support dynamic assembly of chromosome axes under the control of the SMC ATPase
      cycle, thereby governing construction of rod-shaped chromosomes in eukaryotic
      cells.

AB  - In metazoan adherens junctions, beta-catenin links the cytoplasmic tail of
      classical cadherins to the F-actin-binding protein alpha-catenin. Phosphorylation
      of a Ser/Thr-rich region in the cadherin tail dramatically enhances affinity for 
      beta-catenin and promotes cell-cell adhesion in cell culture systems, but its
      importance has not been demonstrated in vivo. Here, we identify a critical
      phosphorylated serine in the C. elegans cadherin HMR-1 required for strong
      binding to the beta-catenin homolog HMP-2. Ablation of this phosphoserine
      interaction produces developmental defects that resemble full loss-of-function
      (Hammerhead and Humpback) phenotypes. Most metazoans possess a single gene for
      beta-catenin, which is also a transcriptional coactivator in Wnt signaling.
      Nematodes and planaria, however, have a set of paralogous beta-catenins; for
      example, C. elegans HMP-2 functions only in cell-cell adhesion, whereas SYS-1
      mediates transcriptional activation through interactions with POP-1/Tcf. Our
      structural data define critical sequence differences responsible for the unique
      ligand specificities of these two proteins.

AB  - Tumors kill patients not only through well-characterized perturbations to their
      local environment but also through poorly understood pathophysiological
      interactions with distant tissues. Here, we use a Drosophila tumor model to
      investigate the elusive mechanisms underlying such long-range interactions.
      Transplantation of tumors into adults induces robust wasting of adipose, muscle, 
      and gonadal tissues that are distant from the tumor, phenotypes that resemble the
      cancer cachexia seen in human patients. Notably, malignant, but not benign,
      tumors induce peripheral wasting. We identify the insulin growth factor binding
      protein (IGFBP) homolog ImpL2, an antagonist of insulin signaling, as a secreted 
      factor mediating wasting. ImpL2 is sufficient to drive tissue loss, and insulin
      activity is reduced in peripheral tissues of tumor-bearing hosts. Importantly,
      knocking down ImpL2, specifically in the tumor, ameliorates wasting phenotypes.
      We propose that the tumor-secreted IGFBP creates insulin resistance in distant
      tissues, thus driving a systemic wasting response.

AB  - Organ wasting, related to changes in nutrition and metabolic activity of cells
      and tissues, is observed under conditions of starvation and in the context of
      diseases, including cancers. We have developed a model for organ wasting in adult
      Drosophila, whereby overproliferation induced by activation of Yorkie, the Yap1
      oncogene ortholog, in intestinal stem cells leads to wasting of the ovary, fat
      body, and muscle. These organ-wasting phenotypes are associated with a reduction 
      in systemic insulin/IGF signaling due to increased expression of the secreted
      insulin/IGF antagonist ImpL2 from the overproliferating gut. Strikingly,
      expression of rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes and central components of the
      insulin/IGF pathway is upregulated with activation of Yorkie in the gut, which
      may provide a mechanism for this overproliferating tissue to evade the effect of 
      ImpL2. Altogether, our study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying
      organ-wasting phenotypes in Drosophila and how overproliferating tissues adapt to
      global changes in metabolism.

AB  - Genetically identical cells in culture often exhibit significant variations, or
      noise, in gene expression, largely due to transcriptional bursting. Halpern et
      al. (2015) have developed methods to study gene bursting in tissues to find that 
      this transcriptional bursting also occurs in the mammalian liver and may
      contribute to functional plasticity in hepatocytes.

AB  - Reporting in Developmental Cell, Stephan et al. (2015) demonstrate critical
      axonal and presynaptic functions from acquisition of an enormous exon by the
      Drosophila ank2 gene. They propose that highly elongated ank2-XL molecules,
      associated with the plasma membrane through spectrin and ank2-L, extend deep into
      the axoplasm to promote microtubule organization.

AB  - Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is critical for mechanistic target of
      rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation in response to growth factors and amino
      acids (AAs). Whereas growth factors inhibit the tuberous sclerosis complex
      (TSC1-TSC2), a negative Rheb regulator, the role of AAs in Rheb activation
      remains unknown. Here, we identify microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1) as the
      essential link between Rheb and mTORC1 activation. MCRS1, in an AA-dependent
      manner, maintains Rheb at lysosome surfaces, connecting Rheb to mTORC1. MCRS1
      suppression in human cancer cells using small interference RNA or mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts using an inducible-Cre/Lox system reduces mTORC1 activity. MCRS1
      depletion promotes Rheb/TSC2 interaction, rendering Rheb inactive and
      delocalizing it from lysosomes to recycling endocytic vesicles, leading to mTORC1
      inactivation. These findings have important implications for signaling mechanisms
      in various pathologies, including diabetes mellitus and cancer.

AB  - Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is critical in development and oncogenesis, but
      the mechanisms regulating this pathway remain unclear. Although protein
      phosphorylation clearly affects Shh signaling, little is known about phosphatases
      governing the pathway. Here, we conducted a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of
      the phosphatome and identified Eya1 as a positive regulator of Shh signaling. We 
      find that the catalytically active phosphatase Eya1 cooperates with the
      DNA-binding protein Six1 to promote gene induction in response to Shh and that
      Eya1/Six1 together regulate Gli transcriptional activators. We show that Eya1,
      which is mutated in a human deafness disorder, branchio-oto-renal syndrome, is
      critical for Shh-dependent hindbrain growth and development. Moreover, Eya1
      drives the growth of medulloblastoma, a Shh-dependent hindbrain tumor. Together, 
      these results identify Eya1 and Six1 as key components of the Shh transcriptional
      network in normal development and in oncogenesis.

AB  - The dimensions of axons and synaptic terminals determine cell-intrinsic
      properties of neurons; however, the cellular mechanisms selectively controlling
      establishment and maintenance of neuronal compartments remain poorly understood. 
      Here, we show that two giant Drosophila Ankyrin2 isoforms, Ank2-L and Ank2-XL,
      and the MAP1B homolog Futsch form a membrane-associated microtubule-organizing
      complex that determines axonal diameter, supports axonal transport, and provides 
      independent control of synaptic dimensions and stability. Ank2-L controls
      microtubule and synaptic stability upstream of Ank2-XL that selectively controls 
      microtubule organization. Synergistically with Futsch, Ank2-XL provides
      three-dimensional microtubule organization and is required to establish
      appropriate synaptic dimensions and release properties. In axons, the
      Ank2-XL/Futsch complex establishes evenly spaced, grid-like microtubule
      organization and determines axonal diameter in the absence of neurofilaments.
      Reduced microtubule spacing limits anterograde transport velocities of
      mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. Our data identify control of microtubule
      architecture as a central mechanism to selectively control neuronal dimensions,
      functional properties, and connectivity.

AB  - Exposure to environmental teratogenic pollutant leads to severe birth defects.
      However, the biological events underlying these developmental abnormalities
      remain undefined. Here, we report a molecular link between an environmental
      stress response pathway and key developmental genes during craniofacial
      development. Strikingly, mutant mice with impaired Pax3/7 function display severe
      craniofacial defects. We show that these are associated with an upregulation of
      the signaling pathway mediated by the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the
      receptor to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), revealing a genetic
      interaction between Pax3 and AHR signaling. Activation of AHR signaling in
      Pax3-deficient embryos drives facial mesenchymal cells out of the cell cycle
      through the upregulation of p21 expression. Accordingly, inhibiting AHR activity 
      rescues the cycling status of these cells and the facial closure of Pax3/7
      mutants. Together, our findings demonstrate that the regulation of AHR signaling 
      by Pax3/7 is required to protect against TCDD/AHR-mediated teratogenesis during
      craniofacial development.

AB  - Drosophila Piwi was reported by Huang et al. (2013) to be guided by piRNAs to
      piRNA-complementary sites in the genome, which then recruits heterochromatin
      protein 1a and histone methyltransferase Su(Var)3-9 to the sites. Among
      additional findings, Huang et al. (2013) also reported Piwi binding sites in the 
      genome and the reduction of RNA polymerase II in euchromatin but its increase in 
      pericentric regions in piwi mutants. Marinov et al. (2015) disputed the validity 
      of the Huang et al. bioinformatic pipeline that led to the last two claims. Here 
      we report our independent reanalysis of the data using current bioinformatic
      methods. Our reanalysis agrees with Marinov et al. (2015) that Piwi's genomic
      targets still remain to be identified but confirms the Huang et al. claim that
      Piwi influences RNA polymerase II distribution in the genome. This Matters
      Arising Response addresses the Marinov et al. (2015) Matters Arising, published
      concurrently in this issue of Developmental Cell.

AB  - Huang et al. (2013) recently reported that chromatin immunoprecipitation
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals the genome-wide sites of occupancy by Piwi, a
      piRNA-guided Argonaute protein central to transposon silencing in Drosophila.
      Their study also reported that loss of Piwi causes widespread rewiring of
      transcriptional patterns, as evidenced by changes in RNA polymerase II occupancy 
      across the genome. Here we reanalyze their data and report that the underlying
      deep-sequencing dataset does not support the authors' genome-wide conclusions.

AB  - The outer segment (OS) of the rod photoreceptor is a light-sensing cilium
      containing ~1,000 membrane-bound discs. Each day, discs constituting the distal
      tenth of the OS are shed, whereas nascent discs are formed at the base of the OS 
      through the incorporation of molecules transported from the inner segment. The
      mechanisms regulating these processes remain elusive. Here, we show that
      rhodopsin preferentially enters the OS in the dark. Photoexcitation of post-Golgi
      rhodopsins retains them in the inner segment. Disc-rim protein peripherin2/rds
      enters the OS following a rhythm complementary to that of rhodopsin. Light-dark
      cycle-regulated protein trafficking serves as a mechanism to segregate
      rhodopsin-rich and peripherin2/rds-rich discs into alternating stacks, which are 
      flanked by characteristic cytoplasmic pockets. This periodic cytostructure
      divides the OS into approximately ten fractions, each containing discs
      synthesized in a single day. This mechanism may explain how the rod photoreceptor
      balances the quantity of discs added and removed daily.

AB  - Dishevelled (DVL) proteins serve as crucial regulators that transduce canonical
      Wnt signals to the GSK3beta-destruction complex, resulting in the stabilization
      of beta-catenin. Emerging evidence underscores the nuclear functions of DVLs,
      which are critical for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. However, the mechanism
      underlying DVL nuclear localization remains poorly understood. Here we discovered
      two Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors, FOXK1 and FOXK2, as bona fide
      DVL-interacting proteins. FOXK1 and FOXK2 positively regulate Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling by translocating DVL into the nucleus. Moreover, FOXK1 and FOXK2
      protein levels are elevated in human colorectal cancers and correlate with DVL
      nuclear localization. Conditional expression of Foxk2 in mice induced intestinal 
      hyper-proliferation that featured enhanced DVL nuclear localization and
      upregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Together, our results not only reveal a
      mechanism by which DVL is translocated into the nucleus but also suggest
      unexpected roles of FOXK1 and FOXK2 in regulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

AB  - Progenitor differentiation requires remodeling of genomic expression; however, in
      many tissues, such as epidermis, the spectrum of remodeled genes and the
      transcription factors (TFs) that control them are not fully defined. We performed
      kinetic transcriptome analysis during regeneration of differentiated epidermis
      and identified gene sets enriched in progenitors (594 genes), in early (159
      genes), and in late differentiation (387 genes). Module mapping of 1,046 TFs
      identified MAF and MAFB as necessary and sufficient for progenitor
      differentiation. MAF:MAFB regulated 393 genes altered in this setting.
      Integrative analysis identified ANCR and TINCR lncRNAs as essential upstream
      MAF:MAFB regulators. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated MAF:MAFB binding to known
      epidermal differentiation TF genes whose expression they controlled, including
      GRHL3, ZNF750, KLF4, and PRDM1. Each of these TFs rescued expression of specific 
      MAF:MAFB target gene subsets in the setting of MAF:MAFB loss, indicating they act
      downstream of MAF:MAFB. A lncRNA-TF network is thus essential for epidermal
      differentiation.

AB  - Parasympathetic innervation is critical for submandibular gland (SMG) development
      and regeneration. Parasympathetic ganglia (PSG) are derived from Schwann cell
      precursors that migrate along nerves, differentiate into neurons, and coalesce
      within their target tissue to form ganglia. However, signals that initiate
      gangliogenesis after the precursors differentiate into neurons are unknown. We
      found that deleting negative regulators of FGF signaling, Sprouty1 and Sprouty2
      (Spry1/2DKO), resulted in a striking loss of gangliogenesis, innervation, and
      keratin 5-positive (K5+) epithelial progenitors in the SMG. Here we identify Wnts
      produced by K5+ progenitors in the SMG as key mediators of gangliogenesis. Wnt
      signaling increases survival and proliferation of PSG neurons, and inhibiting Wnt
      signaling disrupts gangliogenesis and organ innervation. Activating Wnt signaling
      and reducing FGF gene dosage rescues gangliogenesis and innervation in both the
      Spry1/2DKO SMG and pancreas. Thus, K5+ progenitors produce Wnt signals to
      establish the PSG-epithelial communication required for organ innervation and
      progenitor cell maintenance.

AB  - Reporting recently in Nature Cell Biology, Lu et al. (2015) identify two
      Eps15-homology-domain-containing proteins as critical effectors of ciliary
      vesicle formation, an early event in ciliogenesis. Functional dissection reveals 
      that one of them works to convert small vesicles associated with mother centriole
      distal appendages into a larger ciliary vesicle.

AB  - During meiotic prophase, the repair of induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
      promotes interactions between homologous chromosomes (homologs). A study by Joshi
      et al. (2015) now highlights how the global DSB activity in a nucleus influences 
      the choice between the homolog and the sister chromatid for DSB repair.

AB  - Upon nutrient deprivation, cells metabolize fatty acids (FAs) in mitochondria to 
      supply energy, but how FAs, stored as triacylglycerols in lipid droplets, reach
      mitochondria has been mysterious. Rambold et al. (2015) now show that FA
      mobilization depends on triacylglycerol lipolysis, whereas autophagy feeds the
      lipid droplet pool for continued fueling of mitochondria.

AB  - We investigate how outgrowth at the basolateral cell membrane is coordinated with
      apical lumen formation in the development of a biological tube by characterizing 
      exc-6, a gene required for C. elegans excretory cell (EC) tubulogenesis. We show 
      that EXC-6 is orthologous to the human formin INF2, which polymerizes filamentous
      actin (F-actin) and binds microtubules (MTs) in vitro. Dominant INF2 mutations
      cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease, and
      FSGS+Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. We show that activated INF2 can substitute
      for EXC-6 in C. elegans and that disease-associated mutations cause constitutive 
      activity. Using genetic analysis and live imaging, we show that exc-6 regulates
      MT and F-actin accumulation at EC tips and dynamics of basolateral-localized MTs,
      indicating that EXC-6 organizes F-actin and MT cytoskeletons during
      tubulogenesis. The pathology associated with INF2 mutations is believed to
      reflect misregulation of F-actin, but our results suggest alternative or
      additional mechanisms via effects on MT dynamics.

AB  - Secreted Wnt morphogens are essential for embryogenesis and homeostasis and
      require a lipid/palmitoleoylate modification for receptor binding and activity.
      Notum is a secreted Wnt antagonist that belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase
      superfamily, but its mechanism of action and roles in vertebrate embryogenesis
      are not fully understood. Here, we report that Notum hydrolyzes the Wnt
      palmitoleoylate adduct extracellularly, resulting in inactivated Wnt proteins
      that form oxidized oligomers incapable of receptor binding. Thus, Notum is a Wnt 
      deacylase, and palmitoleoylation is obligatory for the Wnt structure that
      maintains its active monomeric conformation. Notum is expressed in naive ectoderm
      and neural plate in Xenopus and is required for neural and head induction. These 
      findings suggest that Notum is a prerequisite for the "default" neural fate and
      that distinct mechanisms of Wnt inactivation by the Tiki protease in the
      Organizer and the Notum deacylase in presumptive neuroectoderm orchestrate
      vertebrate brain development.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 technology of genome editing has greatly facilitated the targeted
      inactivation of genes in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of organisms. In
      zebrafish, it allows the rapid generation of knockout lines by simply injecting a
      guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell stage embryos. Here, we report a
      simple and scalable CRISPR-based vector system for tissue-specific gene
      inactivation in zebrafish. As proof of principle, we used our vector with the
      gata1 promoter driving Cas9 expression to silence the urod gene, implicated in
      heme biosynthesis, specifically in the erythrocytic lineage. Urod targeting
      yielded red fluorescent erythrocytes in zebrafish embryos, recapitulating the
      phenotype observed in the yquem mutant. While F0 embryos displayed mosaic gene
      disruption, the phenotype appeared very penetrant in stable F1 fish. This vector 
      system constitutes a unique tool to spatially control gene knockout and greatly
      broadens the scope of loss-of-function studies in zebrafish.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) provide cellular energy under starvation, yet how they mobilize
      and move into mitochondria in starved cells, driving oxidative respiration, is
      unclear. Here, we clarify this process by visualizing FA trafficking with a
      fluorescent FA probe. The labeled FA accumulated in lipid droplets (LDs) in
      well-fed cells but moved from LDs into mitochondria when cells were starved.
      Autophagy in starved cells replenished LDs with FAs, increasing LD number over
      time. Cytoplasmic lipases removed FAs from LDs, enabling their transfer into
      mitochondria. This required mitochondria to be highly fused and localized near
      LDs. When mitochondrial fusion was prevented in starved cells, FAs neither
      homogeneously distributed within mitochondria nor became efficiently metabolized.
      Instead, FAs reassociated with LDs and fluxed into neighboring cells. Thus, FAs
      engage in complex trafficking itineraries regulated by cytoplasmic lipases,
      autophagy, and mitochondrial fusion dynamics, ensuring maximum oxidative
      metabolism and avoidance of FA toxicity in starved cells.

AB  - We and others have shown that the Hippo pathway effectors TAZ and YAP direct Smad
      activity to regulate TGFbeta family-induced cellular responses in stem cell and
      cancer biology. In polarized epithelial cells we showed that the Crumbs complex
      promotes Hippo-dependent cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP localization that restricts
      TGFbeta-induced Smad nuclear accumulation and activity. In this Developmental
      Cell issue, basal-lateral restriction of TGFbeta receptors is proposed as the
      sole mechanism suppressing Smad signaling in epithelial cells. Here we show that 
      basal recruitment of TGFbeta receptors occurs subsequent to Hippo-dependent
      suppression of Smad activity by cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP. Our results demonstrate that
      receptor sequestration and Hippo control of activated Smads are distinct events
      regulating TGFbeta signaling in polarized epithelia and raise interesting
      questions about the function of these pathways in controlling Smad signaling in
      development, homeostasis, and disease. This Matters Arising Response addresses
      the Nallet-Staub et al. (2015) Matters Arising, published concurrently in
      Developmental Cell.

AB  - Cell-cell contacts inhibit cell growth and proliferation in part by activating
      the Hippo pathway that drives the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the
      transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. Cell density and Hippo signaling have
      also been reported to block transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) responses,
      based on the ability of phospho-YAP/TAZ to sequester TGF-beta-activated SMAD
      complexes in the cytoplasm. Herein, we provide evidence that epithelial cell
      polarization interferes with TGF-beta signaling well upstream and independent of 
      cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ. Rather, polarized basolateral presentation of TGF-beta
      receptors I and II deprives apically delivered TGF-beta of access to its
      receptors. Basolateral ligand delivery nonetheless remains entirely effective to 
      induce TGF-beta responses. These data demonstrate that cell-type-specific
      inhibition of TGF-beta signaling by cell density is restricted to polarized
      epithelial cells and reflects the polarized distribution of TGF-beta receptors,
      which thus affects SMAD activation irrespective of Hippo pathway activation.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cell proliferation is high at birth and then rapidly declines. In
      this issue of Developmental Cell,Stolovich-Rain et al. (2015) show that beta
      cells' capacity to increase proliferation in response to injury is unexpectedly
      not acquired until after weaning-related nutritional changes trigger a metabolic 
      and regenerative competence program.

AB  - In Drosophila myoblast fusion, the fusing cell invades another by actin-enriched 
      protrusion. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Kim et al. (2015) examine the
      myoblast fusion mechanism from the perspective of the "receiving" cell and report
      that fusion depends on the ability of this cell to stiffen its actomyosin cortex.

TI  - CENP-A K124 Ubiquitylation Is Required for CENP-A Deposition at the Centromere.
PG  - 589-603

AB  - CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant that epigenetically determines
      centromere identity to ensure kinetochore assembly and proper chromosome
      segregation, but the precise mechanism of its specific localization within
      centromeric heterochromatin remains obscure. We have discovered that
      CUL4A-RBX1-COPS8 E3 ligase activity is required for CENP-A ubiquitylation on
      lysine 124 (K124) and CENP-A centromere localization. A mutation of CENP-A,
      K124R, reduces interaction with HJURP (a CENP-A-specific histone chaperone) and
      abrogates localization of CENP-A to the centromere. Addition of monoubiquitin is 
      sufficient to restore CENP-A K124R to centromeres and the interaction with HJURP,
      indicating that "signaling" ubiquitylation is required for CENP-A loading at
      centromeres. The CUL4A-RBX1 complex is required for loading newly synthesized
      CENP-A and maintaining preassembled CENP-A at centromeres. Thus, CENP-A K124R
      ubiquitylation, mediated by the CUL4A-RBX1-COPS8 complex, is essential for CENP-A
      deposition at the centromere.

AB  - The tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2 are key integrators of growth
      factor signaling. They suppress cell growth and proliferation by acting in a
      heteromeric complex to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
      (mTORC1). In this study, we identify TSC1 as a component of the transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-Smad2/3 pathway. Here, TSC1 functions independently
      of TSC2. TSC1 interacts with the TGF-beta receptor complex and Smad2/3 and is
      required for their association with one another. TSC1 regulates TGF-beta-induced 
      Smad2/3 phosphorylation and target gene expression and controls TGF-beta-induced 
      growth arrest and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hyperactive Akt
      specifically activates TSC1-dependent cytostatic Smad signaling to induce growth 
      arrest. Thus, TSC1 couples Akt activity to TGF-beta-Smad2/3 signaling. This has
      implications for cancer treatments targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinases and Akt
      because they may impair tumor-suppressive cytostatic TGF-beta signaling by
      inhibiting Akt- and TSC1-dependent Smad activation.

      Pbl/Ect2 from the nucleus at mitotic entry drives Rho-dependent activation of
      Myosin-II and, in parallel, induces a switch from Arp2/3 to Diaphanous-mediated
      cortical actin nucleation that depends on Cdc42, aPKC, and Par6. At the same
      time, the mitotic relocalization of these apical protein complexes to more
      lateral cell surfaces enables Cdc42/aPKC/Par6 to take on a mitosis-specific
      function-aiding the assembly of a relatively isotropic metaphase cortex.
      Together, these data reveal how the repolarization and remodeling of the
      actomyosin cortex are coordinated upon entry into mitosis to provide cells with
      the isotropic and rigid form they need to undergo faithful chromosome segregation
      and division in a crowded tissue environment.

AB  - Gametogenesis is dependent on the expression of germline-specific genes. However,
      it remains unknown how the germline epigenome is distinctly established from that
      of somatic lineages. Here we show that genes commonly expressed in somatic
      lineages and spermatogenesis-progenitor cells undergo repression in a genome-wide
      manner in late stages of the male germline and identify underlying mechanisms.
      SCML2, a germline-specific subunit of a Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1),
      establishes the unique epigenome of the male germline through two distinct
      antithetical mechanisms. SCML2 works with PRC1 and promotes RNF2-dependent
      ubiquitination of H2A, thereby marking somatic/progenitor genes on autosomes for 
      repression. Paradoxically, SCML2 also prevents RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of
      H2A on sex chromosomes during meiosis, thereby enabling unique epigenetic
      programming of sex chromosomes for male reproduction. Our results reveal
      divergent mechanisms involving a shared regulator by which the male germline
      epigenome is distinguished from that of the soma and progenitor cells.

AB  - Tissue patterning is established by extracellular growth factors or morphogens.
      Although different theoretical models explaining specific patterns have been
      proposed, our understanding of tissue pattern establishment in vivo remains
      limited. In many animal species, left-right patterning is governed by a
      reaction-diffusion system relying on the different diffusivity of an activator,
      Nodal, and an inhibitor, Lefty. In a genetic screen, we identified a zebrafish
      loss-of-function mutant for the proprotein convertase FurinA. Embryological and
      biochemical experiments demonstrate that cleavage of the Nodal-related Spaw
      proprotein into a mature form by FurinA is required for Spaw gradient formation
      and activation of Nodal signaling. We demonstrate that FurinA is required
      cell-autonomously for the long-range signaling activity of Spaw and no other
      Nodal-related factors. Combined in silico and in vivo approaches support a model 
      in which FurinA controls the signaling range of Spaw by cleaving its proprotein
      into a mature, extracellular form, consequently regulating left-right patterning.

AB  - Membrane fusion is an energy-consuming process that requires tight juxtaposition 
      of two lipid bilayers. Little is known about how cells overcome energy barriers
      to bring their membranes together for fusion. Previously, we have shown that
      cell-cell fusion is an asymmetric process in which an "attacking" cell drills
      finger-like protrusions into the "receiving" cell to promote cell fusion. Here,
      we show that the receiving cell mounts a Myosin II (MyoII)-mediated
      mechanosensory response to its invasive fusion partner. MyoII acts as a
      mechanosensor, which directs its force-induced recruitment to the fusion site,
      and the mechanosensory response of MyoII is amplified by chemical signaling
      initiated by cell adhesion molecules. The accumulated MyoII, in turn, increases
      cortical tension and promotes fusion pore formation. We propose that the
      protrusive and resisting forces from fusion partners put the fusogenic synapse
      under high mechanical tension, which helps to overcome energy barriers for
      membrane apposition and drives cell membrane fusion.

AB  - Because tissue regeneration deteriorates with age, it is generally assumed that
      the younger the animal, the better it compensates for tissue damage. We have
      examined the effect of young age on compensatory proliferation of pancreatic beta
      cells in vivo. Surprisingly, beta cells in suckling mice fail to enter the cell
      division cycle in response to a diabetogenic injury or increased glycolysis. The 
      potential of beta cells for compensatory proliferation is acquired following
      premature weaning to normal chow, but not to a diet mimicking maternal milk. In
      addition, weaning coincides with enhanced glucose-stimulated oxidative
      phosphorylation and insulin secretion from islets. Transcriptome analysis reveals
      that weaning increases the expression of genes involved in replication licensing,
      suggesting a mechanism for increased responsiveness to the mitogenic activity of 
      high glucose. We propose that weaning triggers a discrete maturation step of beta
      cells, elevating both the mitogenic and secretory response to glucose.

AB  - Dicer controls the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and is essential for
      neurogenesis. Recent reports show that the levels and substrate selectivity of
      DICER result in the preferential biogenesis of specific miRNAs in vitro. However,
      how dicer expression levels and miRNA biogenesis are regulated in vivo and how
      this affects neurogenesis is incompletely understood. Here we show that during
      zebrafish hindbrain development dicer expression levels are controlled by miR-107
      to tune the biogenesis of specific miRNAs, such as miR-9, whose levels regulate
      neurogenesis. Loss of miR-107 function stabilizes dicer levels and miR-9
      biogenesis across the ventricular hindbrain zone, resulting in an increase of
      both proliferating progenitors and postmitotic neurons. miR-9 ectopic
      accumulation in differentiating neuronal cells recapitulated the excessive
      neurogenesis phenotype. We propose that miR-107 modulation of dicer levels in
      differentiating neuronal cells is required to maintain the homeostatic levels of 
      specific miRNAs, whose precise accumulation is essential for neurogenesis.

AB  - Adult fish and salamanders regenerate specific neurons as well as entire CNS
      areas after injury. Recent studies shed light on how these anamniotes activate
      progenitor cells, generate the required cell types, and functionally integrate
      these into a complex environment. Some developmental signals and mechanisms are
      recapitulated during neuronal regeneration, whereas others are unique to the
      regeneration process. The use of genetic techniques, such as cell ablation and
      lineage-tracing, in combination with cell-type-specific expression profiling
      reveal factors that initiate, fine-tune, and terminate the regenerative response 
      in anamniotes, with a view to translating findings to non-regenerating species.

AB  - Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key player in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
      Abeta fragments of APP are the major constituent of AD-associated amyloid
      plaques, and mutations or duplications of the gene coding for APP can cause
      familial AD. Here we review the roles of APP in neuronal development, signaling, 
      intracellular transport, and other aspects of neuronal homeostasis. We suggest
      that APP acts as a signaling nexus that transduces information about a range of
      extracellular conditions, including neuronal damage, to induction of
      intracellular signaling events. Subtle disruptions of APP signaling functions may
      be major contributors to AD-causing neuronal dysfunction.

AB  - Proteostasis is maintained by multiple cellular pathways, including protein
      synthesis, quality control, and degradation. An imbalance of neuronal
      proteostasis, associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, leads to
      proteinopathies or neurodegeneration. While genetic variations and protein
      modifications contribute to aggregate formation, components of the proteostasis
      network dictate the fate of protein aggregates. Here we provide an overview of
      proteostasis pathways and their interplay (particularly autophagy) with the
      metabolism of disease-related proteins. We review recent studies on neuronal
      activity-mediated regulation of proteostasis and transcellular propagation of
      protein aggregates in the nervous system. Targeting proteostasis pathways
      therapeutically remains an attractive but challenging task.

AB  - Programmed cell death (PCD) is an evolutionarily conserved contributor to nervous
      system development. In the vertebrate peripheral nervous system, PCD is the basis
      of the neurotrophic theory, whereby cell death results from a surplus of neurons 
      relative to target and competition for neurotrophic factors. In addition to
      stochastic cell death, PCD can be intrinsically determined by cell lineage or
      position and timing in both invertebrate and vertebrate central nervous systems. 
      The underlying PCD molecular mechanisms include intrinsic transcription factor
      cascades and regulators of competence/susceptibility to cell death. Here, we
      provide a framework for understanding neural PCD from its regulation to its
      functions.

AB  - Microglia are macrophages that colonize the brain during development to establish
      a resident population of professional phagocytes that protect against invading
      pathogens and contribute to brain development and homeostasis. As such, these
      cells sit at the interface between immunology and neurobiology. In addition to
      their key roles in brain physiology, microglia offer a great opportunity to
      address central questions in biology relating to how migrating cells find their
      positions in the embryo, adopt a behavior that is appropriate for that position, 
      and interact with their local environment. We aim, in this review, to survey key 
      recent advances in microglial research.

AB  - Myelinated axons are patterned into discrete and often-repeating domains
      responsible for the efficient and rapid transmission of electrical signals. These
      domains include nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments. Disruption of axonal 
      patterning leads to nervous system dysfunction. In this review, we introduce the 
      concept of subcellular patterning as applied to axons and discuss how these
      patterning events depend on both intrinsic, cytoskeletal mechanisms and
      extrinsic, myelinating glia-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - Vertebrate myelination is an evolutionary advancement essential for motor,
      sensory, and higher-order cognitive function. CNS myelin, a multilamellar
      differentiation of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane, ensheaths axons to
      facilitate electrical conduction. Myelination is one of the most pivotal
      cell-cell interactions for normal brain development, involving extensive
      information exchange between differentiating oligodendrocytes and axons. The
      molecular mechanisms of myelination are discussed, along with new perspectives on
      oligodendrocyte plasticity and myelin remodeling of the developing and adult CNS.

AB  - Although many features of neurogenesis during development and in the adult are
      intrinsic to the neurogenic cells themselves, the role of the microenvironment is
      irrefutable. The neurogenic niche is a melting pot of cells and factors that
      influence CNS development. How do the diverse elements assemble and when? How
      does the niche change structurally and functionally during embryogenesis and in
      adulthood? In this review, we focus on the impact of non-neural cells that
      participate in the neurogenic niche, highlighting how cells of different
      embryonic origins influence this critical germinal space.

AB  - The development and function of our brain are governed by a genetic blueprint,
      which reflects dynamic changes over the history of evolution. Recent progress in 
      genetics and genomics, facilitated by next-generation sequencing and single-cell 
      sorting, has identified numerous genomic loci that are associated with a
      neuroanatomical or neurobehavioral phenotype. Here, we review some of the genetic
      changes in both protein-coding and noncoding regions that affect brain
      development and evolution, as well as recent progress in brain transcriptomics.
      Understanding these genetic changes may provide novel insights into neurological 
      and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia.

AB  - Evolutionary modifications in nervous systems enabled organisms to adapt to their
      specific environments and underlie the remarkable diversity of behaviors
      expressed by animals. Resolving the pathways that shaped and modified neural
      circuits during evolution remains a significant challenge. Comparative studies
      have revealed a surprising conservation in the intrinsic signaling systems
      involved in early patterning of bilaterian nervous systems but also raise the
      question of how neural circuit compositions and architectures evolved within
      specific animal lineages. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that
      contributed to the emergence and diversity of animal nervous systems, focusing on
      the circuits governing vertebrate locomotion.

AB  - The foundation of the diverse metazoan nervous systems is laid by embryonic
      patterning mechanisms, involving the generation and movement of neural
      progenitors and their progeny. Here we divide early neurogenesis into discrete
      elements, including origin, pattern, proliferation, and movement of neuronal
      progenitors, which are controlled by conserved gene cassettes. We review these
      neurogenetic mechanisms in representatives of the different metazoan clades, with
      the goal to build a conceptual framework in which one can ask specific questions,
      such as which of these mechanisms potentially formed part of the developmental
      "toolkit" of the bilaterian ancestor and which evolved later.

AB  - Histones and their posttranslational modifications influence the regulation of
      many DNA-dependent processes. Although an essential role for histone-modifying
      enzymes in these processes is well established, defining the specific
      contribution of individual histone residues remains a challenge because many
      histone-modifying enzymes have nonhistone targets. This challenge is exacerbated 
      by the paucity of suitable approaches to genetically engineer histone genes in
      metazoans. Here, we describe a platform in Drosophila for generating and
      analyzing any desired histone genotype, and we use it to test the in vivo
      function of three histone residues. We demonstrate that H4K20 is neither
      essential for DNA replication nor for completion of development, unlike
      inferences drawn from analyses of H4K20 methyltransferases. We also show that
      H3K36 is required for viability and H3K27 is essential for maintenance of
      cellular identity but not for gene activation. These findings highlight the power
      of engineering histones to interrogate genome structure and function in animals.

AB  - The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is the ubiquitin ligase that 
      regulates mitosis by targeting specific proteins for degradation at specific
      times under the control of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). How the APC/C
      recognizes its different substrates is a key problem in the control of cell
      division. Here, we have identified the ABBA motif in cyclin A, BUBR1, BUB1, and
      Acm1, and we show that it binds to the APC/C coactivator CDC20. The ABBA motif in
      cyclin A is required for its proper degradation in prometaphase through competing
      with BUBR1 for the same site on CDC20. Moreover, the ABBA motifs in BUBR1 and
      BUB1 are necessary for the SAC to work at full strength and to recruit CDC20 to
      kinetochores. Thus, we have identified a conserved motif integral to the proper
      control of mitosis that connects APC/C substrate recognition with the SAC.

AB  - Transcription factor complexes have varied effects on cell fate and behavior, but
      how this diversification of function occurs is largely unknown. The Nodal
      signaling pathway has many biological functions that all converge on the
      transcription factors Smad2/3. Smad2/3 has many cofactors, and alternative usage 
      of these may provide a mechanism for modulating Smad2/3 function. Here, we
      investigate how perturbation of the cofactor E2a affects global patterns of
      Smad2/3 binding and gene expression during gastrulation. We find that E2a
      regulates early development in two ways. E2a changes the position of Smad2/3
      binding at the Nodal inhibitor lefty, resulting in direct repression of lefty
      that is critical for mesendoderm specification. Separately, E2a is necessary to
      drive transcription of Smad2/3 target genes, including critical regulators of
      dorsal cell fate and morphogenesis. Overall, we find that E2a functions as both a
      transcriptional repressor and activator to precisely regulate Nodal signaling.

AB  - The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) regulates stemness in animals ranging from worms to
      humans. However, the cause of the dramatic vulval rupturing phenotype of let-7
      mutant C. elegans has remained unknown. Consistent with the notion that miRNAs
      function by coordinately tuning the expression of many targets, bursting may
      result from joint dysregulation of several targets, possibly in the epidermis.
      Alternatively, overexpression of LET-60/RAS, a key vulva development gene and a
      phylogenetically conserved target of let-7, may be responsible. Here, we show
      that let-7 functions in the vulval-uterine system to ensure vulval integrity but 
      that regulation of most targets of let-7, including LET-60/RAS, is dispensable.
      Using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit endogenous let-7 target sites, we found that regulation
      of LIN-41/TRIM71 alone is necessary and sufficient to prevent vulval rupturing.
      Hence, let-7 does not function to reduce gene expression noise broadly, but to
      direct vulval development through extensive regulation of a single, defined
      target.

AB  - Cold stress is a major environmental factor that limits plant growth and
      development. The C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)-dependent cold signaling pathway
      is extensively studied in Arabidopsis; however, the specific protein kinases
      involved in this pathway remain elusive. Here we report that OST1 (open stomata
      1), a well-known Ser/Thr protein kinase in ABA signaling, acts upstream of CBFs
      to positively regulate freezing tolerance. The ost1 mutants show freezing
      hypersensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OST1 exhibit enhanced 
      freezing tolerance. The OST1 kinase is activated by cold stress. Moreover, OST1
      interacts with both the transcription factor ICE1 and the E3 ligase HOS1 in the
      CBF pathway. Cold-activated OST1 phosphorylates ICE1 and enhances its stability
      and transcriptional activity. Meanwhile, OST1 interferes with the interaction
      between HOS1 and ICE1, thus suppressing HOS1-mediated ICE1 degradation under cold
      stress. Our results thus uncover the unexpected roles of OST1 in modulating
      CBF-dependent cold signaling in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Navarro-Lerida et al. (2015) report in this issue of Developmental Cell that RAC1
      nuclear accumulation causes actin-dependent deformation of the nuclear envelope
      and increases nuclear plasticity. It further leads to depletion of cytoplasmic,
      active RAC1 with a concomitant increase in RHOA signaling driving
      actomyosin-mediated cell shape changes. These two properties combine to enhance
      tumor cells invasiveness.

AB  - Cold temperatures trigger the ICE1-CBF-COR transcriptional cascade in plants,
      which reprograms gene expression to increase freezing tolerance. In this issue of
      Developmental Cell, Ding et al. (2015) report that cold stress activates the
      protein kinase OST1 to phosphorylate and thereby stabilize and stimulate ICE1.
      This enhances plant tolerance to freezing temperatures.

AB  - Nuclear membrane microdomains are proposed to act as platforms for regulation of 
      nuclear function, but little is known about the mechanisms controlling their
      formation. Organization of the plasma membrane is regulated by actin
      polymerization, and the existence of an actin pool in the nucleus suggests that a
      similar mechanism might operate here. We show that nuclear membrane organization 
      and morphology are regulated by the nuclear level of active Rac1 through actin
      polymerization-dependent mechanisms. Rac1 nuclear export is mediated by two
      internal nuclear export signals and through its interaction with nucleophosmin-1 
      (B23), which acts as a Rac1 chaperone inside the nucleus. Rac1 nuclear
      accumulation alters the balance between cytosolic Rac1 and Rho, increasing RhoA
      signaling in the cytoplasm and promoting a highly invasive phenotype. Nuclear
      Rac1 shuttling is a finely tuned mechanism for controlling nuclear shape and
      organization and cell invasiveness.

AB  - Hox transcription factors (TFs) are essential for vertebrate development, but how
      these evolutionary conserved proteins function in vivo remains unclear. Because
      Hox proteins have notoriously low binding specificity, they are believed to bind 
      with cofactors, mainly homeodomain TFs Pbx and Meis, to select their specific
      targets. We mapped binding of Meis, Pbx, and Hoxa2 in the branchial arches, a
      series of segments in the developing vertebrate head. Meis occupancy is largely
      similar in Hox-positive and -negative arches. Hoxa2, which specifies second arch 
      (IIBA) identity, recognizes a subset of Meis prebound sites that contain Hox
      motifs. Importantly, at these sites Meis binding is strongly increased. This
      enhanced Meis binding coincides with active enhancers, which are linked to genes 
      highly expressed in the IIBA and regulated by Hoxa2. These findings show that
      Hoxa2 operates as a tissue-specific cofactor, enhancing Meis binding to specific 
      sites that provide the IIBA with its anatomical identity.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules mark the sites
      where the GTPase Drp1 promotes mitochondrial fission via a largely unknown
      mechanism. Here, we show that the SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (Syn17) is present on
      raft-like structures of ER-mitochondria contact sites and promotes mitochondrial 
      fission by determining Drp1 localization and activity. The hairpin-like
      C-terminal hydrophobic domain, including Lys-254, but not the SNARE domain, is
      important for this regulation. Syn17 also regulates ER Ca(2+) homeostasis and
      interferes with Rab32-mediated regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Starvation
      disrupts the Syn17-Drp1 interaction, thus favoring mitochondrial elongation
      during autophagy. Because we also demonstrate that Syn17 is an ancient SNARE, our
      findings suggest that Syn17 is one of the original key regulators for
      ER-mitochondria contact sites present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. As 
      such, Syn17 acts as a switch that responds to nutrient conditions and integrates 
      functions for the ER and autophagosomes with mitochondrial dynamics.

AB  - The proteins of the Hedgehog (Hh) family are secreted proteins exerting short-
      and long-range control over various cell fates in developmental patterning. The
      Hh gradient in Drosophila wing imaginal discs consists of apical and basolateral 
      secreted pools, but the mechanisms governing the overall establishment of the
      gradient remain unclear. We investigated the relative contributions of
      endocytosis and recycling to control the Hh gradient. We show that, upon its
      initial apical secretion, Hh is re-internalized. We examined the effect of the
      resistance-nodulation-division transporter Dispatched (Disp) on long-range Hh
      signaling and unexpectedly found that Disp is specifically required for apical
      endocytosis of Hh. Re-internalized Hh is then regulated in a Rab5- and
      Rab4-dependent manner to ensure its long-range activity. We propose that
      Hh-producing cells integrate endocytosis and recycling as two instrumental
      mechanisms contributing to regulate the long-range activity of Hh.

AB  - Unidirectional zippering is a key step in neural tube closure that remains poorly
      understood. Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to
      identify the mechanism for zippering in a basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. We 
      show that myosin II is activated sequentially from posterior to anterior along
      the neural/epidermal (Ne/Epi) boundary just ahead of the advancing zipper. This
      promotes rapid shortening of Ne/Epi junctions, driving the zipper forward and
      drawing the neural folds together. Cell contact rearrangements (Ne/Epi + Ne/Epi
      --> Ne/Ne + Epi/Epi) just behind the zipper lower tissue resistance to zipper
      progression by allowing transiently stretched cells to detach and relax toward
      isodiametric shapes. Computer simulations show that measured differences in
      junction tension, timing of primary contractions, and delay before cell
      detachment are sufficient to explain the speed and direction of zipper
      progression and highlight key advantages of a sequential contraction mechanism
      for robust efficient zippering.

AB  - In budding yeast, over 60 proteins functioning in at least five modules are
      recruited to endocytic sites with predictable order and timing. However, how
      sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are initiated and stabilized is not well
      understood. Here, the casein kinase 1 (CK1) Hrr25 is shown to be an endocytic
      protein and to be among the earliest proteins to appear at endocytic sites. Hrr25
      absence or overexpression decreases or increases the rate of endocytic site
      initiation, respectively. Ede1, an early endocytic Eps15-like protein important
      for endocytic initiation, is an Hrr25 target and is required for Hrr25
      recruitment to endocytic sites. Hrr25 phosphorylation of Ede1 is required for
      Hrr25-Ede1 interaction and promotes efficient initiation of endocytic sites.
      These observations indicate that Hrr25 kinase and Ede1 cooperate to initiate and 
      stabilize endocytic sites. Analysis of the mammalian homologs CK1delta/epsilon
      suggests a conserved role for these protein kinases in endocytic site initiation 
      and stabilization.

AB  - Mechanotransduction pathways are activated in response to biophysical stimuli
      during the development or homeostasis of organs and tissues. In zebrafish, the
      blood-flow-sensitive transcription factor Klf2a promotes VEGF-dependent
      angiogenesis. However, the means by which the Klf2a mechanotransduction pathway
      is regulated to prevent continuous angiogenesis remain unknown. Here we report
      that the upregulation of klf2 mRNA causes enhanced egfl7 expression and
      angiogenesis signaling, which underlies cardiovascular defects associated with
      the loss of cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) proteins in the zebrafish
      embryo. Using CCM-protein-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we
      show that the misexpression of KLF2 mRNA requires the extracellular
      matrix-binding receptor beta1 integrin and occurs in the absence of blood flow.
      Downregulation of beta1 integrin rescues ccm mutant cardiovascular malformations 
      in zebrafish. Our work reveals a beta1 integrin-Klf2-Egfl7-signaling pathway that
      is tightly regulated by CCM proteins. This regulation prevents angiogenic
      overgrowth and ensures the quiescence of endothelial cells.

AB  - The cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) pathway is required in endothelial
      cells for normal cardiovascular development and to prevent postnatal vascular
      malformations, but its molecular effectors are not well defined. Here we show
      that loss of CCM signaling in endocardial cells results in mid-gestation heart
      failure associated with premature degradation of cardiac jelly. CCM deficiency
      dramatically alters endocardial and endothelial gene expression, including
      increased expression of the Klf2 and Klf4 transcription factors and the Adamts4
      and Adamts5 proteases that degrade cardiac jelly. These changes in gene
      expression result from increased activity of MEKK3, a mitogen-activated protein
      kinase that binds CCM2 in endothelial cells. MEKK3 is both necessary and
      sufficient for expression of these genes, and partial loss of MEKK3 rescues
      cardiac defects in CCM-deficient embryos. These findings reveal a molecular
      mechanism by which CCM signaling controls endothelial gene expression during
      cardiovascular development that may also underlie CCM formation.

AB  - Polyploidization is a natural process that frequently accompanies
      differentiation; its deregulation is linked to genomic instability and cancer.
      Despite its relevance, why cells select different polyploidization mechanisms is 
      unknown. Here we report a systematic genetic analysis of endomitosis, a process
      in which megakaryocytes become polyploid by entering mitosis but aborting
      anaphase. Whereas ablation of the APC/C cofactor Cdc20 results in mitotic arrest 
      and severe thrombocytopenia, lack of the kinases Aurora-B, Cdk1, or Cdk2 does not
      affect megakaryocyte polyploidization or platelet levels. Ablation of Cdk1 forces
      a switch to endocycles without mitosis, whereas polyploidization in the absence
      of Cdk1 and Cdk2 occurs in the presence of aberrant re-replication events.
      Importantly, ablation of these kinases rescues the defects in Cdc20 null
      megakaryocytes. These findings suggest that endomitosis can be functionally
      replaced by alternative polyploidization mechanisms in vivo and provide the
      cellular basis for therapeutic approaches aimed to discriminate mitotic and
      polyploid cells.

AB  - Accurate targeting of transcriptional enhancers to the correct promoter poses a
      significant information problem in higher eukaryotes. Enhancer-core promoter
      specificity may provide one solution. Reporting recently in Nature, Zabidi et al.
      (2014) uncover, via a genome-wide analysis approach, two general classes of
      enhancer-promoter interactions differentially regulating "housekeeping" versus

AB  - Pseudostratified epithelia are widespread during animal development and feature
      elongated cells whose nuclei adopt various positions along the apicobasal cell
      axis. Before mitosis, nuclei migrate toward the apical surface, and subsequent
      divisions occur apically. So far, the exact purpose of this nuclear migration
      remained elusive. One hypothesis was that apical migration ensures that nuclei
      and centrosomes meet for mitosis. We here demonstrate that in zebrafish
      neuroepithelia apical nuclear migration occurs independently of centrosome
      position or integrity. It is a highly reproducible phenomenon linked to the cell 
      cycle via CDK1 activity. We propose that the robustness of bringing nuclei
      apically for mitosis ensures that cells are capable of reintegrating into the
      epithelium after division. Nonapical divisions lead to cell delamination and
      formation of cell clusters that subsequently interfere with neuronal layering.
      Therefore, positioning divisions apically in pseudostratified neuroepithelia
      could serve to safeguard epithelial integrity and enable proper proliferation and
      maturation.

AB  - E-cadherin is the major adhesion receptor in epithelial adherens junctions, which
      connect cells to form tissues and are essential for morphogenesis and
      homeostasis. The mechanism by which E-cadherin monomers cluster and become
      organized in adherens junctions remains poorly understood. Here, using
      superresolution microscopy techniques in combination with structure-informed
      functional mutations, we found that loosely organized clusters of approximately
      five E-cadherin molecules that form independently of cis or trans interactions,
      and that are delimited by the cortical F-actin meshwork, are the precursors of
      trans-ligated adhesive clusters that make up the adherens junction. The density
      of E-cadherin clusters was wide ranged, and notably, we could detect densities
      consistent with the crystal lattice structure at the core of adhesive clusters,
      which were dependent on extracellular domain interactions. Thus, our results
      elucidate the nanoscale architecture of adherens junctions, as well as the
      molecular mechanisms driving its assembly.

TI  - Phosphorylation of cohesin Rec11/SA3 by casein kinase 1 promotes homologous
      recombination by assembling the meiotic chromosome axis.

AB  - In meiosis, cohesin is required for sister chromatid cohesion, as well as meiotic
      chromosome axis assembly and recombination. However, mechanisms underlying the
      multifunctional nature of cohesin remain elusive. Here, we show that fission
      yeast casein kinase 1 (CK1) plays a crucial role in assembling the meiotic
      chromosome axis (so-called linear element: LinE) and promoting recombination. An 
      in vitro phosphorylation screening assay identified meiotic cohesin subunit
      Rec11/SA3 as an excellent substrate of CK1. The phosphorylation of Rec11 by CK1
      mediates the interaction with the Rec10/Red1/SCP2 axis component, a key step in
      meiotic chromosome axis assembly, and is dispensable for sister chromatid
      cohesion. Crucially, the expression of Rec11-Rec10 fusion protein nearly
      completely bypasses the requirement for CK1 or cohesin phosphorylation for LinE
      assembly and recombination. This study uncovers a central mechanism of the
      cohesin-dependent assembly of the meiotic chromosome axis and recombination
      apparatus that acts independently of sister chromatid cohesion.

AB  - The E proteins and Id proteins are, respectively, the positive and negative
      heterodimer partners for the basic-helix-loop-helix protein family and as such
      contribute to a remarkably large number of cell-fate decisions. E proteins and Id
      proteins also function to inhibit or promote cell proliferation and cancer. Using
      a genetic modifier screen in Drosophila, we show that the Id protein
      Extramacrochaetae enables growth by suppressing activation of the
      Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway of tumor suppressors, activation that requires
      transcriptional activation of the expanded gene by the E protein Daughterless.
      Daughterless protein binds to an intronic enhancer in the expanded gene, both
      activating the SWH pathway independently of the transmembrane protein Crumbs and 
      bypassing the negative feedback regulation that targets the same expanded
      enhancer. Thus, the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway has a cell-autonomous function
      to prevent inappropriate differentiation due to transcription factor imbalance
      and monitors the intrinsic developmental status of progenitor cells, distinct
      from any responses to cell-cell interactions.

AB  - During blood vessel formation, endothelial cells (ECs) establish cell-cell
      junctions and rearrange to form multicellular tubes. Here, we show that during
      lumen formation, the actin nucleator and elongation factor, formin-like 3
      (fmnl3), localizes to EC junctions, where filamentous actin (F-actin) cables
      assemble. Fluorescent actin reporters and fluorescence recovery after
      photobleaching experiments in zebrafish embryos identified a pool of dynamic
      F-actin with high turnover at EC junctions in vessels. Knockdown of fmnl3
      expression, chemical inhibition of formin function, and expression of
      dominant-negative fmnl3 revealed that formin activity maintains a stable F-actin 
      content at EC junctions by continual polymerization of F-actin cables. Reduced
      actin polymerization leads to destabilized endothelial junctions and consequently
      to failure in blood vessel lumenization and lumen instability. Our findings
      highlight the importance of formin activity in blood vessel morphogenesis.

TI  - Cdc42 mediates Bmp-induced sprouting angiogenesis through Fmnl3-driven assembly

AB  - During angiogenesis in vivo, endothelial cells (ECs) at the tips of vascular
      sprouts actively extend filopodia that are filled with bundles of linear actin
      filaments. To date, signaling pathways involved in the formation of endothelial
      filopodia have been studied using in-vitro-cultured ECs that behave differently
      from those in vivo. Herein, we have delineated a signaling pathway that governs
      the assembly of endothelial filopodia during angiogenic sprouting of the caudal
      vein plexus (CVP) in zebrafish. During CVP formation, bone morphogenetic protein 
      induces the extension of endothelial filopodia and their migration via
      Arhgef9b-mediated activation of Cdc42. Active Cdc42 binds to and stimulates
      Formin-like 3, an actin-regulatory protein of the formin family, which, in turn, 
      promotes the extension of endothelial filopodia to facilitate angiogenic
      sprouting of the CVP. Thus, this study has elucidated molecular mechanisms
      underlying the formation of endothelial filopodia and their role in angiogenesis 
      in vivo.

AB  - Blood vessel stability is essential for embryonic development; in the adult, many
      diseases are associated with loss of vascular integrity. The ETS transcription
      factor ERG drives expression of VE-cadherin and controls junctional integrity. We
      show that constitutive endothelial deletion of ERG (Erg(cEC-KO)) in mice causes
      embryonic lethality with vascular defects. Inducible endothelial deletion of ERG 
      (Erg(iEC-KO)) results in defective physiological and pathological angiogenesis in
      the postnatal retina and tumors, with decreased vascular stability. ERG controls 
      the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by promoting beta-catenin stability, through signals
      mediated by VE-cadherin and the Wnt receptor Frizzled-4. Wnt signaling is
      decreased in ERG-deficient endothelial cells; activation of Wnt signaling with
      lithium chloride, which stabilizes beta-catenin levels, corrects vascular defects
      in Erg(cEC-KO) embryos. Finally, overexpression of ERG in vivo reduces
      permeability and increases stability of VEGF-induced blood vessels. These data
      demonstrate that ERG is an essential regulator of angiogenesis and vascular
      stability through Wnt signaling.

AB  - Studies in flies, mice, and human models have provided a conceptual framework for
      how paracrine interactions between damaged cells and the surrounding tissue
      control tissue repair. These studies have amassed evidence for an evolutionarily 
      conserved secretory program that regulates tissue homeostasis. This program
      coordinates cell survival and proliferation during tissue regeneration and repair
      in young animals. By virtue of chronic engagement, however, it also contributes
      to the age-related decline of tissue homeostasis leading to degeneration,
      metabolic dysfunction, and cancer. Here, we review recent studies that shed light
      on the nature and regulation of this evolutionarily conserved secretory program.

AB  - The morpholino anti-sense technology has been used extensively to test gene
      function. The zebrafish model allows a detailed comparison of knockdown
      (anti-sense) and knockout (mutation) effects. Recent studies reveal that these
      two approaches can often lead to surprisingly different phenotypes, thus raising 
      a number of important questions.

AB  - How cells regulate the distribution of a limited pool of actin between two
      competing structures has long been a mystery. Complementary studies from Suarez
      et al. (2015) and Rotty et al. (2015) now show that profilin controls the
      partitioning of actin monomers between competing actin networks assembled by
      Arp2/3 complex and formins or Ena/VASP.

AB  - Although axon guidance mechanisms are well conserved across the animal kingdom,
      neuronal circuit complexity increases dramatically in evolution. Reporting
      recently in Neuron, Zelina et al. (2014) uncover mammalian-specific changes in
      Robo3 that result in a switch from repellent to attractive signaling and may have
      contributed to increased mammalian circuit complexity.

AB  - In this issue of Developmental Cell, Yu et al. (2015) demonstrate that CENP-A
      phosphorylation by CDK1 inhibits its association with the chaperone protein HJURP
      and that the removal of this modification at mitotic exit is a key regulatory
      event that controls the timing of new CENP-A nucleosome formation at centromeres.

TI  - Ankrd11 is a chromatin regulator involved in autism that is essential for neural 
      development.

AB  - Ankrd11 is a potential chromatin regulator implicated in neural development and
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with no known function in the brain. Here, we show
      that knockdown of Ankrd11 in developing murine or human cortical neural
      precursors caused decreased proliferation, reduced neurogenesis, and aberrant
      neuronal positioning. Similar cellular phenotypes and aberrant ASD-like behaviors
      were observed in Yoda mice carrying a point mutation in the Ankrd11 HDAC-binding 
      domain. Consistent with a role for Ankrd11 in histone acetylation, Ankrd11 was
      associated with chromatin and colocalized with HDAC3, and expression and histone 
      acetylation of Ankrd11 target genes were altered in Yoda neural precursors.
      Moreover, the Ankrd11 knockdown-mediated decrease in precursor proliferation was 
      rescued by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity or expressing HDAC3.
      Thus, Ankrd11 is a crucial chromatin regulator that controls histone acetylation 
      and gene expression during neural development, thereby providing a likely
      explanation for its association with cognitive dysfunction and ASD.

      deposition at centromeres.

AB  - The H3 histone variant CENP-A is an epigenetic marker critical for the centromere
      identity and function. However, the precise regulation of the spatiotemporal
      deposition and propagation of CENP-A at centromeres during the cell cycle is
      still poorly understood. Here, we show that CENP-A is phosphorylated at Ser68
      during early mitosis by Cdk1. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of
      Ser68 eliminates the binding of CENP-A to the assembly factor HJURP, thus
      preventing the premature loading of CENP-A to the centromere prior to mitotic
      exit. Because Cdk1 activity is at its minimum at the mitotic exit, the ratio of
      Cdk1/PP1alpha activity changes in favor of Ser68 dephosphorylation, thus making
      CENP-A available for centromeric deposition by HJURP. Thus, we reveal that
      dynamic phosphorylation of CENP-A Ser68 orchestrates the spatiotemporal assembly 
      of newly synthesized CENP-A at active centromeres during the cell cycle.

AB  - Fission yeast cells use Arp2/3 complex and formin to assemble diverse filamentous
      actin (F-actin) networks within a common cytoplasm for endocytosis, division, and
      polarization. Although these homeostatic F-actin networks are usually
      investigated separately, competition for a limited pool of actin monomers
      (G-actin) helps to regulate their size and density. However, the mechanism by
      which G-actin is correctly distributed between rival F-actin networks is not
      clear. Using a combination of cell biological approaches and in vitro
      reconstitution of competition between actin assembly factors, we found that the
      small G-actin binding protein profilin directly inhibits Arp2/3 complex-mediated 
      actin assembly. Profilin is therefore required for formin to compete effectively 
      with excess Arp2/3 complex for limited G-actin and to assemble F-actin for
      contractile ring formation in dividing cells.

AB  - Cells contain multiple F-actin assembly pathways, including the Arp2/3 complex,
      formins, and Ena/VASP, which have largely been analyzed separately. They
      collectively generate the bulk of F-actin from a common pool of G-actin; however,
      the interplay and/or competition between these pathways remains poorly
      understood. Using fibroblast lines derived from an Arpc2 conditional knockout
      mouse, we established matched-pair cells with and without the Arp2/3 complex.
      Arpc2(-/-) cells lack lamellipodia and migrate more slowly than WT cells but have
      F-actin levels indistinguishable from controls. Actin assembly in Arpc2(-/-)
      cells was resistant to cytochalasin-D and was highly dependent on profilin-1 and 
      Ena/VASP but not formins. Profilin-1 depletion in WT cells increased F-actin and 
      Arp2/3 complex in lamellipodia. Conversely, addition of exogenous profilin-1
      inhibited Arp2/3 complex actin nucleation in vitro and in vivo. Antagonism of the
      Arp2/3 complex by profilin-1 in cells appears to maintain actin homeostasis by
      balancing Arp2/3 complex-dependent and -independent actin assembly pathways.

TI  - The Pallbearer E3 ligase promotes actin remodeling via RAC in efferocytosis by
      degrading the ribosomal protein S6.

AB  - Clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is achieved through phagocytosis by 
      professional or amateur phagocytes. It is critical for tissue homeostasis and
      remodeling in all animals. Failure in this process can contribute to the
      development of inflammatory autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. We found
      previously that the PALL-SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase complex promotes apoptotic cell 
      clearance, but it remained unclear how it did so. Here we show that the F-box
      protein PALL interacts with phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (RpS6) to promote
      its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This leads to RAC2 GTPase
      upregulation and activation and F-actin remodeling that promotes efferocytosis.
      We further show that the specific role of PALL in efferocytosis is driven by its 
      apoptotic cell-induced nuclear export. Finding a role for RpS6 in the negative
      regulation of efferocytosis provides the opportunity to develop new strategies to
      regulate this process.

PG  - 97-108
LID - 10.1016/j.devcel.2014.11.018 [doi]
AB  - The widespread availability of programmable site-specific nucleases now enables
      targeted gene disruption in the zebrafish. In this study, we applied
      site-specific nucleases to generate zebrafish lines bearing individual mutations 
      in more than 20 genes. We found that mutations in only a small proportion of
      genes caused defects in embryogenesis. Moreover, mutants for ten different genes 
      failed to recapitulate published Morpholino-induced phenotypes (morphants). The
      absence of phenotypes in mutant embryos was not likely due to maternal effects or
      failure to eliminate gene function. Consistently, a comparison of published
      morphant defects with the Sanger Zebrafish Mutation Project revealed that
      approximately 80% of morphant phenotypes were not observed in mutant embryos,
      similar to our mutant collection. Based on these results, we suggest that mutant 
      phenotypes become the standard metric to define gene function in zebrafish, after
      which Morpholinos that recapitulate respective phenotypes could be reliably
      applied for ancillary analyses.
