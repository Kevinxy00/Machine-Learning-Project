AB  - Necroptosis, a form of regulated necrotic cell death mediated by RIPK1
      (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1) kinase activity, RIPK3, and MLKL
      (mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase), can be activated under
      apoptosis-deficient conditions. Modulating the activation of RIPK1 by
      ubiquitination and phosphorylation is critical to control both necroptosis and
      apoptosis. Mutant mice with kinase-dead RIPK1 or RIPK3 and MLKL deficiency show
      no detrimental phenotype in regard to development and adult homeostasis. However,
      necroptosis and apoptosis can be activated in response to various mutations that 
      result in the abortion of the defective embryos and human inflammatory and
      neurodegenerative pathologies. RIPK1 inhibition represents a key therapeutic
      strategy for treatment of diseases where blocking both necroptosis and apoptosis 
      can be beneficial.

      hematopoiesis.
PG  - 324-326
LID - 10.1101/gad.314013.118 [doi]
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside and are maintained in specialized
      microenvironments within the bone marrow known as niches, which are comprised of 
      various cell types. Among them, leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing CXC chemokine
      ligand 12 (CXCL12)-abundant reticular (CAR) cells are known to create a niche for
      HSCs and at the same time to give rise to osteoblasts. These two functions of
      CAR/LepR(+) cells appear to be tightly but inversely regulated to ensure adequate
      physical space for HSCs. However, how osteogenesis is prevented in CAR cells to
      maintain spaces available for HSCs and hematopoiesis remains unclear. In this
      issue of Genes & Development, Seike and colleagues (pp. 359-372) report that the 
      transcription factor early B-cell factor (Ebf3) is preferentially expressed by
      CAR/LepR(+) cells and inhibits CAR cell differentiation into osteoblasts while at
      the same time maintaining self-renewal of CAR/LepR(+) cells. Using conditional
      knockout and retroviral systems, the investigators show that loss of Ebf3 in CAR 
      cells impairs HSC numbers and leads to osteosclerosis. This study provides novel 
      insights into transcriptional requirements for CAR cell bone formation by
      identifying Ebf3 as a niche factor secreted from CAR/Lepr(+) cells that regulates
      the interplay between osteogenesis and hematopoiesis.

LID - 10.1101/gad.314187.118 [doi]
AB  - Each spring, we get out of bed 1 h ahead of our biological wake-up time due to
      the misalignment of internal clocks with the light-dark cycle. Genetic
      discoveries revealed that clock genes encode transcription factors that are
      expressed throughout many tissues, yet a gap has remained in understanding the
      temporal dynamics of transcription. Two groups now apply circular chromosome
      conformation capture and high-throughput sequencing to dissect how "time of
      day"-dependent changes in chromatin drive core clock oscillations. A surprise is 
      the finding that disruption of enhancer-promoter contacts within chromatin leads 
      to an advance in the "wake-up" time of mice. Furthermore, the assembly of
      transcriptionally active domains of chromatin requires the ordered recruitment of
      core clock transcription factors each day. These studies show that waking up
      involves highly dynamic changes in the three-dimensional positioning of genes
      within the cell.

AB  - The circadian clock in animals orchestrates widespread oscillatory gene
      expression programs, which underlie 24-h rhythms in behavior and physiology.
      Several studies have shown the possible roles of transcription factors and
      chromatin marks in controlling cyclic gene expression. However, how daily active 
      enhancers modulate rhythmic gene transcription in mammalian tissues is not known.
      Using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) combined with sequencing
      (4C-seq), we discovered oscillatory promoter-enhancer interactions along the 24-h
      cycle in the mouse liver and kidney. Rhythms in chromatin interactions were
      abolished in arrhythmic Bmal1 knockout mice. Deleting a contacted intronic
      enhancer element in the Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene was sufficient to compromise
      the rhythmic chromatin contacts in tissues. Moreover, the deletion reduced the
      daily dynamics of Cry1 transcriptional burst frequency and, remarkably, shortened
      the circadian period of locomotor activity rhythms. Our results establish
      oscillating and clock-controlled promoter-enhancer looping as a regulatory layer 
      underlying circadian transcription and behavior.

LID - 10.1101/gad.305854.117 [doi]
AB  - In BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells, a global metabolomic analysis discloses a decrease
      in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) levels upon PLX4032 treatment that 
      is conveyed by a STAT5 inhibition and a transcriptional regulation of the
      nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) gene. NAMPT inhibition decreases
      melanoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while forced NAMPT
      expression renders melanoma cells resistant to PLX4032. NAMPT expression induces 
      transcriptomic and epigenetic reshufflings that steer melanoma cells toward an
      invasive phenotype associated with resistance to targeted therapies and
      immunotherapies. Therefore, NAMPT, the key enzyme in the NAD(+) salvage pathway, 
      appears as a rational target in targeted therapy-resistant melanoma cells and a
      key player in phenotypic plasticity of melanoma cells.

LID - 10.1101/gad.311639.118 [doi]
AB  - The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF10 fusion oncoprotein recruits DOT1L to the
      homeobox A (HOXA) gene cluster through its octapeptide motif leucine zipper
      (OM-LZ), thereby inducing and maintaining the MLL-AF10-associated leukemogenesis.
      However, the recognition mechanism between DOT1L and MLL-AF10 is unclear. Here,
      we present the crystal structures of both apo AF10(OM-LZ) and its complex with
      the coiled-coil domain of DOT1L. Disruption of the DOT1L-AF10 interface abrogates
      MLL-AF10-associated leukemic transformation. We further show that zinc stabilizes
      the DOT1L-AF10 complex and may be involved in the regulation of the HOXA gene
      expression. Our studies may also pave the way for the rational design of
      therapeutic drugs against MLL-rearranged leukemia.

AB  - Bone marrow is the tissue filling the space between bone surfaces. Hematopoietic 
      stem cells (HSCs) are maintained by special microenvironments known as niches
      within bone marrow cavities. Mesenchymal cells, termed CXC chemokine ligand 12
      (CXCL12)-abundant reticular (CAR) cells or leptin receptor-positive (LepR(+))
      cells, are a major cellular component of HSC niches that gives rise to
      osteoblasts in bone marrow. However, it remains unclear how osteogenesis is
      prevented in most CAR/LepR(+) cells to maintain HSC niches and marrow cavities.
      Here, using lineage tracing, we found that the transcription factor early B-cell 
      factor 3 (Ebf3) is preferentially expressed in CAR/LepR(+) cells and that
      Ebf3-expressing cells are self-renewing mesenchymal stem cells in adult marrow.
      When Ebf3 is deleted in CAR/LepR(+) cells, HSC niche function is severely
      impaired, and bone marrow is osteosclerotic with increased bone in aged mice. In 
      mice lacking Ebf1 and Ebf3, CAR/LepR(+) cells exhibiting a normal morphology are 
      abundantly present, but their niche function is markedly impaired with depleted
      HSCs in infant marrow. Subsequently, the mutants become progressively more
      osteosclerotic, leading to the complete occlusion of marrow cavities in early
      adulthood. CAR/LepR(+) cells differentiate into bone-producing cells with reduced
      HSC niche factor expression in the absence of Ebf1/Ebf3 Thus, HSC cellular niches
      express Ebf3 that is required to create HSC niches, to inhibit their osteoblast
      differentiation, and to maintain spaces for HSCs.

TI  - Dendrite regeneration of adult Drosophila sensory neurons diminishes with aging
      and is inhibited by epidermal-derived matrix metalloproteinase 2.

AB  - Dendrites possess distinct structural and functional properties that enable
      neurons to receive information from the environment as well as other neurons.
      Despite their key role in neuronal function, current understanding of the ability
      of neurons to regenerate dendrites is lacking. This study characterizes the
      structural and functional capacity for dendrite regeneration in vivo in adult
      animals and examines the effect of neuronal maturation on dendrite regeneration. 
      We focused on the class IV dendritic arborization (c4da) neuron of the Drosophila
      sensory system, which has a dendritic arbor that undergoes dramatic remodeling
      during the first 3 d of adult life and then maintains a relatively stable
      morphology thereafter. Using a laser severing paradigm, we monitored regeneration
      after acute and spatially restricted injury. We found that the capacity for
      regeneration was present in adult neurons but diminished as the animal aged.
      Regenerated dendrites recovered receptive function. Furthermore, we found that
      the regenerated dendrites show preferential alignment with the extracellular
      matrix (ECM). Finally, inhibition of ECM degradation by inhibition of matrix
      metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2) to preserve the extracellular environment
      characteristics of young adults led to increased dendrite regeneration. These
      results demonstrate that dendrites retain regenerative potential throughout
      adulthood and that regenerative capacity decreases with aging.

      lethality.
PG  - 373-388
LID - 10.1101/gad.307330.117 [doi]
AB  - It has been well established that histone and DNA modifications are critical to
      maintaining the equilibrium between pluripotency and differentiation during early
      embryogenesis. Mutations in key regulators of DNA methylation have shown that the
      balance between gene regulation and function is critical during neural
      development in early years of life. However, there have been no identified cases 
      linking epigenetic regulators to aberrant human development and fetal demise.
      Here, we demonstrate that a homozygous inactivating mutation in the histone
      deacetylase SIRT6 results in severe congenital anomalies and perinatal lethality 
      in four affected fetuses. In vitro, the amino acid change at Asp63 to a histidine
      results in virtually complete loss of H3K9 deacetylase and demyristoylase
      functions. Functionally, SIRT6 D63H mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) fail to
      repress pluripotent gene expression, direct targets of SIRT6, and exhibit an even
      more severe phenotype than Sirt6-deficient ESCs when differentiated into embryoid
      bodies (EBs). When terminally differentiated toward cardiomyocyte lineage, D63H
      mutant mESCs maintain expression of pluripotent genes and fail to form functional
      cardiomyocyte foci. Last, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived
      from D63H homozygous fetuses fail to differentiate into EBs, functional
      cardiomyocytes, and neural progenitor cells due to a failure to repress
      pluripotent genes. Altogether, our study described a germline mutation in SIRT6
      as a cause for fetal demise, defining SIRT6 as a key factor in human development 
      and identifying the first mutation in a chromatin factor behind a human syndrome 
      of perinatal lethality.

TI  - Wild-type and cancer-related p53 proteins are preferentially degraded by MDM2 as 
      dimers rather than tetramers.
PG  - 430-447
LID - 10.1101/gad.304071.117 [doi]
AB  - The p53 tumor suppressor protein is the most well studied as a regulator of
      transcription in the nucleus, where it exists primarily as a tetramer. However,
      there are other oligomeric states of p53 that are relevant to its regulation and 
      activities. In unstressed cells, p53 is normally held in check by MDM2 that
      targets p53 for transcriptional repression, proteasomal degradation, and
      cytoplasmic localization. Here we discovered a hydrophobic region within the MDM2
      N-terminal domain that binds exclusively to the dimeric form of the p53
      C-terminal domain in vitro. In cell-based assays, MDM2 exhibits superior binding 
      to, hyperdegradation of, and increased nuclear exclusion of dimeric p53 when
      compared with tetrameric wild-type p53. Correspondingly, impairing the
      hydrophobicity of the newly identified N-terminal MDM2 region leads to p53
      stabilization. Interestingly, we found that dimeric mutant p53 is partially
      unfolded and is a target for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 20S
      proteasome. Finally, forcing certain tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 into dimer
      configuration results in hyperdegradation of mutant p53 and inhibition of
      p53-mediated cancer cell migration. Gaining insight into different oligomeric
      forms of p53 may provide novel approaches to cancer therapy.

TI  - Cooperative recruitment of Yan via a high-affinity ETS supersite organizes
      repression to confer specificity and robustness to cardiac cell fate
      specification.
PG  - 389-401
LID - 10.1101/gad.307132.117 [doi]
AB  - Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are defined by unique combinations of transcription
      factor-binding sites. Emerging evidence suggests that the number, affinity, and
      organization of sites play important roles in regulating enhancer output and,
      ultimately, gene expression. Here, we investigate how the cis-regulatory logic of
      a tissue-specific CRM responsible for even-skipped (eve) induction during
      cardiogenesis organizes the competing inputs of two E-twenty-six (ETS) members:
      the activator Pointed (Pnt) and the repressor Yan. Using a combination of
      reporter gene assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we suggest that Yan and Pnt
      have distinct syntax preferences. Not only does Yan prefer high-affinity sites,
      but an overlapping pair of such sites is necessary and sufficient for Yan to tune
      Eve expression levels in newly specified cardioblasts and block ectopic Eve
      induction and cell fate specification in surrounding progenitors.
      Mechanistically, the efficient Yan recruitment promoted by this high-affinity ETS
      supersite not only biases Yan-Pnt competition at the specific CRM but also
      organizes Yan-repressive complexes in three dimensions across the eve locus.
      Taken together, our results uncover a novel mechanism by which differential
      interpretation of CRM syntax by a competing repressor-activator pair can confer
      both specificity and robustness to developmental transitions.

AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant mRNA modification in
      eukaryotes, playing crucial roles in multiple biological processes. m(6)A is
      catalyzed by the activity of methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), which depends on 
      additional proteins whose precise functions remain poorly understood. Here we
      identified Zc3h13 (zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13)/Flacc
      [Fl(2)d-associated complex component] as a novel interactor of m(6)A
      methyltransferase complex components in Drosophila and mice. Like other
      components of this complex, Flacc controls m(6)A levels and is involved in sex
      determination in Drosophila We demonstrate that Flacc promotes m(6)A deposition
      by bridging Fl(2)d to the mRNA-binding factor Nito. Altogether, our work advances
      the molecular understanding of conservation and regulation of the m(6)A
      machinery.

TI  - The cryo-EM structure of the SF3b spliceosome complex bound to a splicing
      modulator reveals a pre-mRNA substrate competitive mechanism of action.
PG  - 309-320

AB  - Somatic mutations in spliceosome proteins lead to dysregulated RNA splicing and
      are observed in a variety of cancers. These genetic aberrations may offer a
      potential intervention point for targeted therapeutics. SF3B1, part of the U2
      small nuclear RNP (snRNP), is targeted by splicing modulators, including E7107,
      the first to enter clinical trials, and, more recently, H3B-8800. Modulating
      splicing represents a first-in-class opportunity in drug discovery, and
      elucidating the structural basis for the mode of action opens up new
      possibilities for structure-based drug design. Here, we present the cryogenic
      electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SF3b subcomplex (SF3B1, SF3B3,
      PHF5A, and SF3B5) bound to E7107 at 3.95 A. This structure shows that E7107 binds
      in the branch point adenosine-binding pocket, forming close contacts with key
      residues that confer resistance upon mutation: SF3B1(R1074H) and PHF5A(Y36C) The 
      structure suggests a model in which splicing modulators interfere with branch
      point adenosine recognition and supports a substrate competitive mechanism of
      action (MOA). Using several related chemical probes, we validate the pose of the 
      compound and support their substrate competitive MOA by comparing their activity 
      against both strong and weak pre-mRNA substrates. Finally, we present functional 
      data and structure-activity relationship (SAR) on the PHF5A(R38C) mutation that
      sensitizes cells to some chemical probes but not others. Developing small
      molecule splicing modulators represents a promising therapeutic approach for a
      variety of diseases, and this work provides a significant step in enabling
      structure-based drug design for these elaborate natural products. Importantly,
      this work also demonstrates that the utilization of cryo-EM in drug discovery is 
      coming of age.

AB  - Tissue-tissue communications are integral to organismal aging, orchestrating a
      body-wide aging process. The brain plays a key role in this process by detecting 
      and processing signals from the environment and then communicating them to distal
      tissues such as the gut to regulate longevity. How this is achieved, however, is 
      poorly understood. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we identified
      two distinct neuroendocrine signaling circuits by which the worm nervous system
      senses cool and warm environmental temperatures through cool- and warm-sensitive 
      neurons and then signals the gut to extend and shorten life span, respectively.
      The prolongevity "cool" circuit uses the small neurotransmitters glutamate and
      serotonin, whereas the anti-longevity "warm" circuit is mediated by insulin-like 
      neuropeptides. Both types of neuroendocrine signals converge on the gut through
      their cognate receptors to differentially regulate the transcription factor
      DAF-16/FOXO, leading to opposing outcomes in longevity. Our study illustrates how
      the brain detects and processes environmental signals to bidirectionally regulate
      longevity by signaling the gut.

AB  - Enhancers are important genomic regulatory elements directing cell type-specific 
      transcription. They assume a key role during development and disease, and their
      identification and functional characterization have long been the focus of
      scientific interest. The advent of next-generation sequencing and clustered
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9-based genome editing
      has revolutionized the means by which we study enhancer biology. In this review, 
      we cover recent developments in the prediction of enhancers based on chromatin
      characteristics and their identification by functional reporter assays and
      endogenous DNA perturbations. We discuss that the two latter approaches provide
      different and complementary insights, especially in assessing enhancer
      sufficiency and necessity for transcription activation. Furthermore, we discuss
      recent insights into mechanistic aspects of enhancer function, including findings
      about cofactor requirements and the role of post-translational histone
      modifications such as monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1). Finally, we
      survey how these approaches advance our understanding of transcription regulation
      with respect to promoter specificity and transcriptional bursting and provide an 
      outlook covering open questions and promising developments.

AB  - Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosines (A) to inosines
      (I) in stretches of dsRNA. The biological purpose of these editing events for the
      vast majority of ADAR substrates is largely unknown. In this issue of Genes &
      Development, Reich and colleagues (pp. 271-282) demonstrate that in
      Caenorhabditis elegans, A-to-I editing in double-stranded regions of
      protein-coding transcripts protects these RNAs from targeting by the RNAi
      pathway. Disruption of this safeguard through loss of ADAR activity coupled with 
      enhanced RNAi results in developmental abnormalities and profound changes in gene
      expression that suggest aberrant induction of an antiviral response. Thus,
      editing of cellular dsRNA by ADAR helps prevent host RNA silencing and
      inadvertent antiviral activity.

      sensed by the nervous system, which consequently triggers signaling outputs
      toward peripheral tissues to regulate gene expression systematically. Thus,
      understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms behind environmentally
      triggered neuron-periphery cross-talk is crucial for the promotion of an
      organism's health and longevity.

AB  - A delicate balance in the levels of proteins that regulate the p53 tumor
      suppressor pathway exists such that subtle changes alter p53 tumor suppressor
      activity and cancer risk. Many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 
      pathway alter p53 transcriptional activity and are associated with cancer risk.
      In addition, some SNPs influence the gain-of-function (GOF) activities of mutant 
      p53 through unknown mechanisms. In this issue of Genes & Development, Basu and
      colleagues (pp. 230-243) provide direct evidence that the presence of an R72
      polymorphism enhances the GOF invasive and metastatic properties of mutant p53 by
      regulating interactions with PGC-1alpha, an important regulator of mitochondrial 
      biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. The study culminates with evidence that
      R72 is associated with worse outcomes in human breast cancer.

AB  - DNA replication origins in hyperacetylated euchromatin fire preferentially during
      early S phase. However, how acetylation controls DNA replication timing is
      unknown. TICRR/TRESLIN is an essential protein required for the initiation of DNA
      replication. Here, we report that TICRR physically interacts with the
      acetyl-histone binding bromodomain (BRD) and extraterminal (BET) proteins BRD2
      and BRD4. Abrogation of this interaction impairs TICRR binding to acetylated
      chromatin and disrupts normal S-phase progression. Our data reveal a novel
      function for BET proteins and establish the TICRR-BET interaction as a potential 
      mechanism for epigenetic control of DNA replication.

LID - 10.1101/gad.310896.117 [doi]
AB  - Transcription elongation rate influences cotranscriptional pre-mRNA maturation,
      but how such kinetic coupling works is poorly understood. The formation of
      nonadenylated histone mRNA 3' ends requires recognition of an RNA structure by
      stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). We report that slow transcription by mutant RNA
      polymerase II (Pol II) caused accumulation of polyadenylated histone mRNAs that
      extend past the stem-loop processing site. UV irradiation, which decelerates Pol 
      II elongation, also induced long poly(A)(+) histone transcripts. Inhibition of 3'
      processing by slow Pol II correlates with failure to recruit SLBP to histone
      genes. Chemical probing of nascent RNA structure showed that the stem-loop fails 
      to fold in transcripts made by slow Pol II, thereby explaining the absence of
      SLBP and failure to process 3' ends. These results show that regulation of
      transcription speed can modulate pre-mRNA processing by changing nascent RNA
      structure and suggest a mechanism by which alternative processing could be
      controlled.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) ablation promotes tissue fibrosis and hypoxia 
      to induce aggressive basal-like breast cancers.
PG  - 244-257
LID - 10.1101/gad.301366.117 [doi]
AB  - The discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is overexpressed in breast carcinoma
      cells. Low DDR1 expression is associated with worse relapse-free survival,
      reflecting its controversial role in cancer progression. We detected DDR1 on
      luminal cells but not on myoepithelial cells of DDR1(+/+) mice. We found that
      DDR1 loss compromises cell adhesion, consistent with data that older DDR1(-/-)
      mammary glands had more basal/myoepithelial cells. Basal cells isolated from
      older mice exerted higher traction forces than the luminal cells, in agreement
      with increased mammary branches observed in older DDR1(-/-) mice and higher
      branching by their isolated organoids. When we crossed DDR1(-/-) mice with
      MMTV-PyMT mice, the PyMT/DDR1(-/-) mammary tumors grew faster and had increased
      epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis with a more basal phenotype and
      increased lung metastases. DDR1 deletion induced basal differentiation of
      CD90(+)CD24(+) cancer cells, and the increase in basal cells correlated with
      tumor cell mitoses. K14(+) basal cells, including K8(+)K14(+) cells, were
      increased adjacent to necrotic fields. These data suggest that the absence of
      DDR1 provides a growth and adhesion advantage that favors the expansion of basal 
      cells, potentiates fibrosis, and enhances necrosis/hypoxia and basal
      differentiation of transformed cells to increase their aggression and metastatic 
      potential.

      pathway.
PG  - 271-282
LID - 10.1101/gad.310672.117 [doi]
AB  - Cellular dsRNAs are edited by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). While
      editing can alter mRNA-coding potential, most editing occurs in noncoding
      sequences, the function of which is poorly understood. Using dsRNA
      immunoprecipitation (dsRIP) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identified 1523
      regions of clustered A-to-I editing, termed editing-enriched regions (EERs), in
      four stages of Caenorhabditis elegans development, often with highest expression 
      in embryos. Analyses of small RNA-seq data revealed 22- to 23-nucleotide (nt)
      siRNAs, reminiscent of viral siRNAs, that mapped to EERs and were abundant in
      adr-1;adr-2 mutant animals. Consistent with roles for these siRNAs in silencing, 
      EER-associated genes (EAGs) were down-regulated in adr-1;adr-2 embryos, and this 
      was dependent on associated EERs and the RNAi factor RDE-4. We observed that
      ADARs genetically interact with the 26G endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) pathway,
      which likely competes for RNAi components; deletion of factors required for this 
      pathway (rrf-3 or ergo-1) in adr-1;adr-2 mutant strains caused a synthetic
      phenotype that was rescued by deleting antiviral RNAi factors. Poly(A)(+) RNA-seq
      revealed EAG down-regulation and antiviral gene induction in adr-1;adr-2;rrf-3
      embryos, and these expression changes were dependent on rde-1 and rde-4 Our data 
      suggest that ADARs restrict antiviral silencing of cellular dsRNAs.

TI  - Mutant p53 controls tumor metabolism and metastasis by regulating PGC-1alpha.
PG  - 230-243
LID - 10.1101/gad.309062.117 [doi]
AB  - Mutant forms of p53 protein often possess protumorigenic functions, conferring
      increased survival and migration to tumor cells via their "gain-of-function"
      activity. Whether and how a common polymorphism in TP53 at amino acid 72
      (Pro72Arg; referred to here as P72 and R72) impacts this gain of function has not
      been determined. We show that mutant p53 enhances migration and metastasis of
      tumors through the ability to bind and regulate PGC-1alpha and that this
      regulation is markedly impacted by the codon 72 polymorphism. Tumor cells with
      the R72 variant of mutant p53 show increased PGC-1alpha function along with
      greatly increased mitochondrial function and metastatic capability. Breast
      cancers containing mutant p53 and the R72 variant show poorer prognosis compared 
      with P72. The combined results reveal PGC-1alpha as a novel "gain-of-function"
      partner of mutant p53 and indicate that the codon 72 polymorphism influences the 
      impact of mutant p53 on metabolism and metastasis.

LID - 10.1101/gad.308510.117 [doi]
AB  - Meiotic crossover formation requires the stabilization of early recombination
      intermediates by a set of proteins and occurs within the environment of the
      chromosome axis, a structure important for the regulation of meiotic
      recombination events. The molecular mechanisms underlying and connecting
      crossover recombination and axis localization are elusive. Here, we identified
      the ZZS (Zip2-Zip4-Spo16) complex, required for crossover formation, which
      carries two distinct activities: one provided by Zip4, which acts as hub through 
      physical interactions with components of the chromosome axis and the crossover
      machinery, and the other carried by Zip2 and Spo16, which preferentially bind
      branched DNA molecules in vitro. We found that Zip2 and Spo16 share structural
      similarities to the structure-specific XPF-ERCC1 nuclease, although it lacks
      endonuclease activity. The XPF domain of Zip2 is required for crossover
      formation, suggesting that, together with Spo16, it has a noncatalytic DNA
      recognition function. Our results suggest that the ZZS complex shepherds
      recombination intermediates toward crossovers as a dynamic structural module that
      connects recombination events to the chromosome axis. The identification of the
      ZZS complex improves our understanding of the various activities required for
      crossover implementation and is likely applicable to other organisms, including
      mammals.

      control of insulin receptor localization.
PG  - 156-164
LID - 10.1101/gad.305870.117 [doi]
AB  - Insulin resistance, the failure to activate insulin signaling in the presence of 
      ligand, leads to metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Physical activity
      and mechanical stress have been shown to protect against insulin resistance, but 
      the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we address this relationship in
      the Drosophila larval fat body, an insulin-sensitive organ analogous to
      vertebrate adipose tissue and livers. We found that insulin signaling in
      Drosophila fat body cells is abolished in the absence of physical activity and
      mechanical stress even when excess insulin is present. Physical movement is
      required for insulin sensitivity in both intact larvae and fat bodies cultured ex
      vivo. Interestingly, the insulin receptor and other downstream components are
      recruited to the plasma membrane in response to mechanical stress, and this
      membrane localization is rapidly lost upon disruption of larval or tissue
      movement. Sensing of mechanical stimuli is mediated in part by integrins, whose
      activation is necessary and sufficient for mechanical stress-dependent insulin
      signaling. Insulin resistance develops naturally during the transition from the
      active larval stage to the immotile pupal stage, suggesting that regulation of
      insulin sensitivity by mechanical stress may help coordinate developmental
      programming with metabolism.

TI  - Dynamic EBF1 occupancy directs sequential epigenetic and transcriptional events
      in B-cell programming.
PG  - 96-111
LID - 10.1101/gad.309583.117 [doi]
AB  - B-cell fate determination requires the action of transcription factors that
      operate in a regulatory network to activate B-lineage genes and repress
      lineage-inappropriate genes. However, the dynamics and hierarchy of events in
      B-cell programming remain obscure. To uncouple the dynamics of transcription
      factor expression from functional consequences, we generated induction systems in
      developmentally arrested Ebf1(-/-) pre-pro-B cells to allow precise experimental 
      control of EBF1 expression in the genomic context of progenitor cells. Consistent
      with the described role of EBF1 as a pioneer transcription factor, we show in a
      time-resolved analysis that EBF1 occupancy coincides with EBF1 expression and
      precedes the formation of chromatin accessibility. We observed dynamic patterns
      of EBF1 target gene expression and sequential up-regulation of transcription
      factors that expand the regulatory network at the pro-B-cell stage. A continuous 
      EBF1 function was found to be required for Cd79a promoter activity and for the
      maintenance of an accessible chromatin domain that is permissive for binding of
      other transcription factors. Notably, transient EBF1 occupancy was detected at
      lineage-inappropriate genes prior to their silencing in pro-B cells. Thus,
      persistent and transient functions of EBF1 allow for an ordered sequence of
      epigenetic and transcriptional events in B-cell programming.

AB  - Multiple congenital disorders often present complex phenotypes, but how the
      mutation of individual genetic factors can lead to multiple defects remains
      poorly understood. In the present study, we used human neuroepithelial (NE) cells
      and CHARGE patient-derived cells as an in vitro model system to identify the
      function of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 7 (CHD7) in NE-neural crest
      bifurcation, thus revealing an etiological link between the central nervous
      system (CNS) and craniofacial anomalies observed in CHARGE syndrome. We found
      that CHD7 is required for epigenetic activation of superenhancers and
      CNS-specific enhancers, which support the maintenance of the NE and CNS lineage
      identities. Furthermore, we found that BRN2 and SOX21 are downstream effectors of
      CHD7, which shapes cellular identities by enhancing a CNS-specific cellular
      program and indirectly repressing non-CNS-specific cellular programs. Based on
      our results, CHD7, through its interactions with superenhancer elements, acts as 
      a regulatory hub in the orchestration of the spatiotemporal dynamics of
      transcription factors to regulate NE and CNS lineage identities.

AB  - Stem cell fate is orchestrated by core transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic
      modifications. Although regulatory genes that control cell type specification are
      identified, the transcriptional circuit and the cross-talk among regulatory
      factors during cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. To identify the
      "time-lapse" TF networks during B-lineage commitment, we used multipotent
      progenitors harboring a tamoxifen-inducible form of Id3, an in vitro system in
      which virtually all cells became B cells within 6 d by simply withdrawing
      4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Transcriptome and epigenome analysis at multiple time
      points revealed that approximately 10%-30% of differentially expressed genes were
      virtually controlled by the core TFs, including E2A, EBF1, and PAX5. Strikingly, 
      we found unexpected transcriptional priming before the onset of the key TF
      program. Inhibition of the immediate early genes such as Nr4a2, Klf4, and Egr1
      severely impaired the generation of B cells. Integration of multiple data sets,
      including transcriptome, protein interactome, and epigenome profiles, identified 
      three representative transcriptional circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq) analysis of lymphoid progenitors in bone marrow strongly supported the 
      three-step TF network model during specification of multipotent progenitors
      toward B-cell lineage in vivo. Thus, our findings will provide a blueprint for
      studying the normal and neoplastic development of B lymphocytes.

TI  - KMT2D regulates p63 target enhancers to coordinate epithelial homeostasis.
PG  - 181-193
LID - 10.1101/gad.306241.117 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial tissues rely on a highly coordinated balance between self-renewal,
      proliferation, and differentiation, disruption of which may drive carcinogenesis.
      The epigenetic regulator KMT2D (MLL4) is one of the most frequently mutated genes
      in all cancers, particularly epithelial cancers, yet its normal function in these
      tissues is unknown. Here, we identify a novel role for KMT2D in coordinating this
      fine balance, as depletion of KMT2D from undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes
      results in reduced proliferation, premature spurious activation of terminal
      differentiation genes, and disorganized epidermal stratification. Genome-wide,
      KMT2D interacts with p63 and is enriched at its target enhancers. Depletion of
      KMT2D results in a broad loss of enhancer histone modifications H3 Lys 4 (H3K4)
      monomethylation (H3K4me1) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) as well as reduced
      expression of p63 target genes, including key genes involved in epithelial
      development and adhesion. Together, these results reveal a critical role for
      KMT2D in the control of epithelial enhancers and p63 target gene expression,
      including the requirement of KMT2D for the maintenance of epithelial progenitor
      gene expression and the coordination of proper terminal differentiation.

LID - 10.1101/gad.307884.117 [doi]
AB  - Daily body temperature rhythm (BTR) is essential for maintaining homeostasis. BTR
      is regulated separately from locomotor activity rhythms, but its molecular basis 
      is largely unknown. While mammals internally regulate BTR, ectotherms, including 
      Drosophila, exhibit temperature preference rhythm (TPR) behavior to regulate BTR.
      Here, we demonstrate that the diuretic hormone 31 receptor (DH31R) mediates TPR
      during the active phase in Drosophila DH31R is expressed in clock cells, and its 
      ligand, DH31, acts on clock cells to regulate TPR during the active phase.
      Surprisingly, the mouse homolog of DH31R, calcitonin receptor (Calcr), is
      expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and mediates body temperature
      fluctuations during the active phase in mice. Importantly, DH31R and Calcr are
      not required for coordinating locomotor activity rhythms. Our results represent
      the first molecular evidence that BTR is regulated distinctly from locomotor
      activity rhythms and show that DH31R/Calcr is an ancient specific mediator of BTR
      during the active phase in organisms ranging from ectotherms to endotherms.

      activity.
PG  - 127-139
LID - 10.1101/gad.308528.117 [doi]
AB  - Termination is a ubiquitous phase in every transcription cycle but is
      incompletely understood and a subject of debate. We used gene editing as a new
      approach to address its mechanism through engineered conditional depletion of the
      5' --> 3' exonuclease Xrn2 or the polyadenylation signal (PAS) endonuclease
      CPSF73 (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73). The ability to
      rapidly control Xrn2 reveals a clear and general role for it in cotranscriptional
      degradation of 3' flanking region RNA and transcriptional termination. This
      defect is characterized genome-wide at high resolution using mammalian native
      elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq). An Xrn2 effect on termination
      requires prior RNA cleavage, and we provide evidence for this by showing that
      catalytically inactive CPSF73 cannot restore termination to cells lacking
      functional CPSF73. Notably, Xrn2 plays no significant role in either Histone or
      small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene termination even though both RNA classes undergo
      3' end cleavage. In sum, efficient termination on most protein-coding genes
      involves CPSF73-mediated RNA cleavage and cotranscriptional degradation of
      polymerase-associated RNA by Xrn2. However, as CPSF73 loss caused more extensive 
      readthrough transcription than Xrn2 elimination, it likely plays a more
      underpinning role in termination.

TI  - Competent for commitment: you've got to have heart!
PG  - 4-13
LID - 10.1101/gad.308353.117 [doi]
AB  - The mature heart is composed primarily of four different cell types: cardiac
      myocytes, endothelium, smooth muscle, and fibroblasts. These cell types derive
      from pluripotent progenitors that become progressively restricted with regard to 
      lineage potential, giving rise to multipotent cardiac progenitor cells and,
      ultimately, the differentiated cell types of the heart. Recent studies have begun
      to shed light on the defining characteristics of the intermediary cell types that
      exist transiently during this developmental process and the extrinsic and
      cell-autonomous factors that influence cardiac lineage decisions and cellular
      competence. This information will shape our understanding of congenital and adult
      cardiac disease and guide regenerative therapeutic approaches. In addition,
      cardiac progenitor specification can serve as a model for understanding basic
      mechanisms regulating the acquisition of cellular identity. In this review, we
      present the concept of "chromatin competence" that describes the potential for
      three-dimensional chromatin organization to function as the molecular
      underpinning of the ability of a progenitor cell to respond to inductive lineage 
      cues and summarize recent studies advancing our understanding of cardiac cell
      specification, gene regulation, and chromatin organization and how they impact
      cardiac development.

TI  - Enhancer transcription: what, where, when, and why?
PG  - 1-3
LID - 10.1101/gad.311605.118 [doi]
AB  - Following the discovery of widespread enhancer transcription, enhancers and
      promoters have been found to be far more similar than previously thought. In this
      issue of Genes & Development, two studies (Henriques and colleagues [pp. 26-41]
      and Mikhaylichenko and colleagues [pp. 42-57]) shine new light on the
      transcriptional nature of promoters and enhancers in Drosophila Together, these
      studies support recent work in mammalian cells that indicates that most active
      enhancers drive local transcription using factors and mechanisms similar to those
      of promoters. Intriguingly, enhancer transcription is shown to be coordinated by 
      SPT5- and P-TEFb-mediated pause-release, but the pause half-life is shorter, and 
      termination is more rapid at enhancers than at promoters. Moreover, bidirectional
      transcription from promoters is associated with enhancer activity, lending
      further credence to models in which regulatory elements exist along a spectrum of
      promoter-ness and enhancer-ness. We propose a general unified model to explain
      possible functions of transcription at enhancers.

TI  - Protein synthesis controls phosphate homeostasis.
PG  - 79-92
LID - 10.1101/gad.309245.117 [doi]
AB  - Phosphorus is an essential element assimilated largely as orthophosphate (Pi).
      Cells respond to Pi starvation by importing Pi from their surroundings. We now
      report that impaired protein synthesis alone triggers a Pi starvation response
      even when Pi is plentiful in the extracellular milieu. In the bacterium
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, this response entails phosphorylation of
      the regulatory protein PhoB and transcription of PhoB-dependent Pi transporter
      genes and is eliminated upon stimulation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
      hydrolysis. When protein synthesis is impaired due to low cytoplasmic magnesium
      (Mg(2+)), Salmonella triggers the Pi starvation response because ribosomes are
      destabilized, which reduces ATP consumption and thus free cytoplasmic Pi. This
      response is transient because low cytoplasmic Mg(2+) promotes an uptake in Mg(2+)
      and a decrease in ATP levels, which stabilizes ribosomes, resulting in ATP
      consumption and Pi increase, thus ending the response. Notably, pharmacological
      inhibition of protein synthesis also elicited a Pi starvation response in the
      bacterium Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Our findings
      identify a regulatory connection between protein synthesis and Pi homeostasis
      that is widespread in nature.

TI  - Recognition of histone acetylation by the GAS41 YEATS domain promotes H2A.Z
      deposition in non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 58-69
LID - 10.1101/gad.303784.117 [doi]
AB  - Histone acetylation is associated with active transcription in eukaryotic cells. 
      It helps to open up the chromatin by neutralizing the positive charge of histone 
      lysine residues and providing binding platforms for "reader" proteins. The
      bromodomain (BRD) has long been thought to be the sole protein module that
      recognizes acetylated histones. Recently, we identified the YEATS domain of AF9
      (ALL1 fused gene from chromosome 9) as a novel acetyl-lysine-binding module and
      showed that the ENL (eleven-nineteen leukemia) YEATS domain is an essential
      acetyl-histone reader in acute myeloid leukemias. The human genome encodes four
      YEATS domain proteins, including GAS41, a component of chromatin remodelers
      responsible for H2A.Z deposition onto chromatin; however, the importance of the
      GAS41 YEATS domain in human cancer remains largely unknown. Here we report that
      GAS41 is frequently amplified in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is 
      required for cancer cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. Biochemical
      and crystal structural studies demonstrate that GAS41 binds to histone H3
      acetylated on H3K27 and H3K14, a specificity that is distinct from that of AF9 or
      ENL. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] followed by high-throughput
      sequencing) analyses in lung cancer cells reveal that GAS41 colocalizes with
      H3K27ac and H3K14ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes. Depletion of 
      GAS41 or disruption of the interaction between its YEATS domain and acetylated
      histones impairs the association of histone variant H2A.Z with chromatin and
      consequently suppresses cancer cell growth and survival both in vitro and in
      vivo. Overall, our study identifies GAS41 as a histone acetylation reader that
      promotes histone H2A.Z deposition in NSCLC.

PG  - 14-19
LID - 10.1101/gad.307918.117 [doi]
AB  - A general feature of animal aging is decline in learning and memory. Here we show
      that in Caenorhabditis elegans, a significant portion of this decline is due to
      accumulation of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of neural
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). We show that activation of a specific
      pair of interneurons either through genetic means or by depletion of KYNA
      significantly improves learning capacity in aged animals even when the
      intervention is applied in aging animals. KYNA depletion also improves memory. We
      show that insulin signaling is one factor in KYNA accumulation.

LID - 10.1101/gad.307736.117 [doi]
AB  - We combined classical salt fractionation with chromatin immunoprecipitation to
      recover human centromeric chromatin under native conditions. We found that >85%
      of the total centromeric chromatin is insoluble under conditions typically used
      for native chromatin extraction. To map both soluble and insoluble chromatin in
      situ, we combined CUT&RUN (cleavage under targets and release using nuclease), a 
      targeted nuclease method, with salt fractionation. Using this approach, we
      observed unexpected structural and conformational variations of centromere
      protein A (CENP-A)-containing complexes on different alpha-satellite dimeric
      units within highly homogenous arrays. Our results suggest that slight
      alpha-satellite sequence differences control the structure and occupancy of the
      associated centromeric chromatin complex.

PG  - 70-78
LID - 10.1101/gad.309138.117 [doi]
AB  - The number of known long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) functions is rapidly growing, but
      how those functions are encoded in their sequence and structure remains poorly
      understood. NORAD (noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage) is a recently
      characterized, abundant, and highly conserved lncRNA that is required for proper 
      mitotic divisions in human cells. NORAD acts in the cytoplasm and antagonizes
      repressors from the Pumilio family that bind at least 17 sites spread through 12 
      repetitive units in NORAD sequence. Here we study conserved sequences in NORAD
      repeats, identify additional interacting partners, and characterize the
      interaction between NORAD and the RNA-binding protein SAM68 (KHDRBS1), which is
      required for NORAD function in antagonizing Pumilio. These interactions provide a
      paradigm for how repeated elements in a lncRNA facilitate function.

      directionality of eRNA transcription.

LID - 10.1101/gad.308619.117 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression is regulated by promoters, which initiate transcription, and
      enhancers, which control their temporal and spatial activity. However, the
      discovery that mammalian enhancers also initiate transcription questions the
      inherent differences between enhancers and promoters. Here, we investigate the
      transcriptional properties of enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis using
      characterized developmental enhancers. We show that while the timing of enhancer 
      transcription is generally correlated with enhancer activity, the levels and
      directionality of transcription are highly varied among active enhancers. To
      assess how this impacts function, we developed a dual transgenic assay to
      simultaneously measure enhancer and promoter activities from a single element in 
      the same embryo. Extensive transgenic analysis revealed a relationship between
      the direction of endogenous transcription and the ability to function as an
      enhancer or promoter in vivo, although enhancer RNA (eRNA) production and
      activity are not always strictly coupled. Some enhancers (mainly bidirectional)
      can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression.
      Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while
      unidirectional promoters generally cannot. The balance between enhancer and
      promoter activity is generally reflected in the levels and directionality of eRNA
      transcription and is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements
      themselves.

TI  - Widespread transcriptional pausing and elongation control at enhancers.
PG  - 26-41
LID - 10.1101/gad.309351.117 [doi]
AB  - Regulation by gene-distal enhancers is critical for cell type-specific and
      condition-specific patterns of gene expression. Thus, to understand the basis of 
      gene activity in a given cell type or tissue, we must identify the precise
      locations of enhancers and functionally characterize their behaviors. Here, we
      demonstrate that transcription is a nearly universal feature of enhancers in
      Drosophila and mammalian cells and that nascent RNA sequencing strategies are
      optimal for identification of both enhancers and superenhancers. We dissect the
      mechanisms governing enhancer transcription and discover remarkable similarities 
      to transcription at protein-coding genes. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
      undergoes regulated pausing and release at enhancers. However, as compared with
      mRNA genes, RNAPII at enhancers is less stable and more prone to early
      termination. Furthermore, we found that the level of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4)
      methylation at enhancers corresponds to transcriptional activity such that highly
      active enhancers display H3K4 trimethylation rather than the H3K4 monomethylation
      considered a hallmark of enhancers. Finally, our work provides insights into the 
      unique characteristics of superenhancers, which stimulate high-level gene
      expression through rapid pause release; interestingly, this property renders
      associated genes resistant to the loss of factors that stabilize paused RNAPII.

PG  - 2337-2342
LID - 10.1101/gad.307116.117 [doi]
AB  - SMAD4 constrains progression of Pten-null prostate cancer and serves as a common 
      downstream node of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and bone
      morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways. Here, we dissected the roles of TGFbeta
      receptor II (TGFBR2) and BMP receptor II (BMPR2) using a Pten-null prostate
      cancer model. These studies demonstrated that the molecular actions of TGFBR2
      result in both SMAD4-dependent constraint of proliferation and SMAD4-independent 
      activation of apoptosis. In contrast, BMPR2 deletion extended survival relative
      to Pten deletion alone, establishing its promoting role in BMP6-driven prostate
      cancer progression. These analyses reveal the complexity of TGFbeta-BMP signaling
      and illuminate potential therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.

AB  - One of the most striking results in the area of chromatin and cancer in recent
      years has been the identification of recurrent mutations in histone genes in
      pediatric cancers. These mutations occur at high frequency and lead to the
      expression of mutant histones that exhibit oncogenic features. Thus, they are
      termed oncohistones. Thus far, mutations have been found in the genes encoding
      histone H3 and its variants. The expression of the oncohistones affects the
      global chromatin landscape through mechanisms that have just begun to be
      unraveled. In this review, we provide an overview of histone mutations that have 
      been identified and discuss the possible mechanisms by which they contribute to
      tumor development. We further discuss the targeted therapies that have been
      proposed to treat cancers expressing oncohistones.

AB  - The yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex and Sae2 function together to initiate
      DNA end resection, an essential early step in homology-dependent repair of DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this issue of Genes & Development, Wang and
      colleagues (pp. 2331-2336) and Reginato and colleagues (pp. 2325-2330) report
      that a variety of physiological protein blocks, including Ku, RPA, and
      nucleosomes, stimulate MRX-Sae2 endonuclease cleavage in vitro. These studies
      have important implications for how cells deal with a range of barriers to end
      resection and highlight the crucial role of Sae2 in activating MRX cleavage at
      the correct cell cycle stage.

TI  - The RES complex is required for efficient transformation of the precatalytic B
      spliceosome into an activated B(act) complex.
PG  - 2416-2429
LID - 10.1101/gad.308163.117 [doi]
AB  - The precise function of the trimeric retention and splicing (RES) complex in
      pre-mRNA splicing remains unclear. Here we dissected the role of RES during the
      assembly and activation of yeast spliceosomes. The efficiency of pre-mRNA
      splicing was significantly lower in the absence of the RES protein Snu17, and the
      recruitment of its binding partners, Pml1 (pre-mRNA leakage protein 1) and Bud13 
      (bud site selection protein 13), to the spliceosome was either abolished or
      substantially reduced. RES was not required for the assembly of spliceosomal B
      complexes, but its absence hindered efficient B(act) complex formation. DeltaRES 
      spliceosomes were no longer strictly dependent on Prp2 activity for their
      catalytic activation, suggesting that they are structurally compromised. Addition
      of Prp2, Spp2, and UTP to affinity-purified DeltaRES B or a mixture of B/B(act)
      complexes formed on wild-type pre-mRNA led to their disassembly. However, no
      substantial disassembly was observed with DeltaRES spliceosomes formed on a
      truncated pre-mRNA that allows Prp2 binding but blocks its activity. Thus, in the
      absence of RES, Prp2 appears to bind prematurely, leading to the disassembly of
      the DeltaRES B complexes to which it binds. Our data suggest that Prp2 can
      dismantle B complexes with an aberrant protein composition, suggesting that it
      may proofread the spliceosome's RNP structure prior to activation.

TI  - Afadin and RhoA control pancreatic endocrine mass via lumen morphogenesis.
PG  - 2376-2390
LID - 10.1101/gad.307637.117 [doi]
AB  - Proper lumen morphogenesis during pancreas development is critical to endocrine
      and exocrine cell fate. Recent studies showed that a central network of lumens
      (termed core), but not the surrounding terminal branches (termed periphery),
      produces most islet endocrine cells. To date, it remains unclear how pancreatic
      lumens form and remodel and which aspects of lumen morphogenesis influence cell
      fate. Importantly, models testing the function of the central lumen network as an
      endocrine niche are lacking. Here, we identify mechanisms underlying lumen
      formation and remodeling and show that central lumen network morphogenesis
      impacts pancreatic endocrine mass. We show that loss of the scaffolding protein
      Afadin disrupts de novo lumenogenesis and lumen continuity in the tip epithelium.
      Codepletion of the actomyosin regulator RhoA and Afadin results in defects in the
      central lumens and arrests lumen remodeling. This arrest leads to prolonged
      perdurance of the central lumen network over developmental time and expansion of 
      the endocrine progenitor population and, eventually, endocrine mass. Our study
      uncovers essential roles of Afadin and RhoA in pancreatic central lumen
      morphogenesis, which subsequently determines endocrine cell mass.

      rate-limiting step in determining origin firing timing.
PG  - 2405-2415
LID - 10.1101/gad.306571.117 [doi]
AB  - Initiation of eukaryotic chromosome replication follows a spatiotemporal program.
      The current model suggests that replication origins compete for a limited pool of
      initiation factors. However, it remains to be answered how these limiting factors
      are preferentially recruited to early origins. Here, we report that Dbf4 is
      enriched at early origins through its interaction with forkhead transcription
      factors Fkh1 and Fkh2. This interaction is mediated by the Dbf4 C terminus and
      was successfully reconstituted in vitro. An interaction-defective mutant,
      dbf4DeltaC, phenocopies fkh alleles in terms of origin firing. Remarkably,
      genome-wide replication profiles reveal that the direct fusion of the DNA-binding
      domain (DBD) of Fkh1 to Dbf4 restores the Fkh-dependent origin firing but
      interferes specifically with the pericentromeric origin activation. Furthermore, 
      Dbf4 interacts directly with Sld3 and promotes the recruitment of downstream
      limiting factors. These data suggest that Fkh1 targets Dbf4 to a subset of
      noncentromeric origins to promote early replication in a manner that is
      reminiscent of the recruitment of Dbf4 to pericentromeric origins by Ctf19.

TI  - ARID5B as a critical downstream target of the TAL1 complex that activates the
      oncogenic transcriptional program and promotes T-cell leukemogenesis.
PG  - 2343-2360
LID - 10.1101/gad.302646.117 [doi]
AB  - The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL induces an aberrant transcriptional
      program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. However, the
      critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL
      pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified AT-rich interactive domain 
      5B (ARID5B) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional
      program in T-ALL. ARID5B expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 
      stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human
      T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the ARID5B gene locus is
      activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells.
      Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active
      transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately
      control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and 
      its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene MYC
      Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells, and
      forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention,
      differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our
      results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by 
      positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and MYC in T-ALL,
      thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.

AB  - DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination is initiated by DNA
      end resection, which is commenced by the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex and Sae2 in
      yeast. Here we report that the nonhomologous end joining factor Ku limits the
      exonuclease activity of Mre11 and promotes its endonuclease to cleave
      5'-terminated DNA strands at break sites. Following initial endonucleolytic
      cleavage past the obstacle, Exo1 specifically extends the resection track,
      leading to the generation of long 3' overhangs that are required for homologous
      recombination. These experiments provide mechanistic insights into how
      short-range and long-range DNA end resection enzymes overcome obstacles near
      broken DNA ends to initiate recombination.

TI  - Transcription factor-dependent 'anti-repressive' mammalian enhancers exclude
      H3K27me3 from extended genomic domains.
PG  - 2391-2404
LID - 10.1101/gad.308536.117 [doi]
AB  - Compacted chromatin and nucleosomes are known barriers to gene expression; the
      nature and relative importance of other transcriptional constraints remain
      unclear, especially at distant enhancers. Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2)
      places the histone mark H3K27me3 predominantly at promoters, where its silencing 
      activity is well documented. In adult tissues, enhancers lack H3K27me3, and it is
      unknown whether intergenic H3K27me3 deposits affect nearby genes. In primary
      intestinal villus cells, we identified hundreds of tissue-restricted enhancers
      that require the transcription factor (TF) CDX2 to prevent the incursion of
      H3K27me3 from adjoining areas of elevated basal marking into large
      well-demarcated genome domains. Similarly, GATA1-dependent enhancers exclude
      H3K27me3 from extended regions in erythroid blood cells. Excess intergenic
      H3K27me3 in both TF-deficient tissues is associated with extreme mRNA deficits,
      which are significantly rescued in intestinal cells lacking PRC2. Explaining
      these observations, enhancers show TF-dependent binding of the H3K27 demethylase 
      KDM6A. Thus, in diverse cell types, certain genome regions far from promoters
      accumulate H3K27me3, and optimal gene expression depends on enhancers clearing
      this repressive mark. These findings reveal new "anti-repressive" function for
      hundreds of tissue-specific enhancers.

AB  - The budding yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex and Sae2 function together in
      DNA end resection during homologous recombination. Here we show that the Ku
      complex shields DNA ends from exonucleolytic digestion but facilitates
      endonucleolytic scission by MRX with a dependence on ATP and Sae2. The incision
      site is enlarged into a DNA gap via the exonuclease activity of MRX, which is
      stimulated by Sae2 without ATP being present. RPA renders a partially resected or
      palindromic DNA structure susceptible to MRX-Sae2, and internal protein blocks
      also trigger DNA cleavage. We present models for how MRX-Sae2 creates entry sites
      for the long-range resection machinery.

PG  - 2361-2375
LID - 10.1101/gad.304501.117 [doi]
AB  - Both the MRTF-SRF and the YAP-TEAD transcriptional regulatory networks respond to
      extracellular signals and mechanical stimuli. We show that the MRTF-SRF pathway
      is activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The MRTFs are required in
      addition to the YAP pathway for CAF contractile and proinvasive properties. We
      compared MRTF-SRF and YAP-TEAD target gene sets and identified genes directly
      regulated by one pathway, the other, or both. Nevertheless, the two pathways
      exhibit mutual dependence. In CAFs, expression of direct MRTF-SRF genomic targets
      is also dependent on YAP-TEAD activity, and, conversely, YAP-TEAD target gene
      expression is also dependent on MRTF-SRF signaling. In normal fibroblasts,
      expression of activated MRTF derivatives activates YAP, while activated YAP
      derivatives activate MRTF. Cross-talk between the pathways requires recruitment
      of MRTF and YAP to DNA via their respective DNA-binding partners (SRF and TEAD)
      and is therefore indirect, arising as a consequence of activation of their target
      genes. In both CAFs and normal fibroblasts, we found that YAP-TEAD activity is
      sensitive to MRTF-SRF-induced contractility, while MRTF-SRF signaling responds to
      YAP-TEAD-dependent TGFbeta signaling. Thus, the MRF-SRF and YAP-TEAD pathways
      interact indirectly through their ability to control cytoskeletal dynamics.

AB  - Chromatin is organized into higher-order structures that form subcompartments in 
      interphase nuclei. Different categories of specialized enzymes act on chromatin
      and regulate its compaction and biophysical characteristics in response to
      physiological conditions. We present an overview of the function of chromatin
      structure and its dynamic changes in response to genotoxic stress, focusing on
      both subnuclear organization and the physical mobility of DNA. We review the
      requirements and mechanisms that cause chromatin relocation, enhanced mobility,
      and chromatin unfolding as a consequence of genotoxic lesions. An intriguing link
      has been established recently between enhanced chromatin dynamics and histone
      loss.

TI  - The HoxD cluster is a dynamic and resilient TAD boundary controlling the
      segregation of antagonistic regulatory landscapes.
PG  - 2264-2281
LID - 10.1101/gad.307769.117 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian HoxD cluster lies between two topologically associating domains
      (TADs) matching distinct enhancer-rich regulatory landscapes. During limb
      development, the telomeric TAD controls the early transcription of Hoxd genes in 
      forearm cells, whereas the centromeric TAD subsequently regulates more posterior 
      Hoxd genes in digit cells. Therefore, the TAD boundary prevents the terminal
      Hoxd13 gene from responding to forearm enhancers, thereby allowing proper limb
      patterning. To assess the nature and function of this CTCF-rich DNA region in
      embryos, we compared chromatin interaction profiles between proximal and distal
      limb bud cells isolated from mutant stocks where various parts of this boundary
      region were removed. The resulting progressive release in boundary effect
      triggered inter-TAD contacts, favored by the activity of the newly accessed
      enhancers. However, the boundary was highly resilient, and only a 400-kb
      deletion, including the whole-gene cluster, was eventually able to merge the
      neighboring TADs into a single structure. In this unified TAD, both proximal and 
      distal limb enhancers nevertheless continued to work independently over a
      targeted transgenic reporter construct. We propose that the whole HoxD cluster is
      a dynamic TAD border and that the exact boundary position varies depending on
      both the transcriptional status and the developmental context.

TI  - Heat-shock protein 40 is the key farnesylation target in meristem size control,
      abscisic acid signaling, and drought resistance.
PG  - 2282-2295
LID - 10.1101/gad.301242.117 [doi]
AB  - Protein farnesylation is central to molecular cell biology. In plants, protein
      farnesyl transferase mutants are pleiotropic and exhibit defective meristem
      organization, hypersensitivity to the hormone abscisic acid, and increased
      drought resistance. The precise functions of protein farnesylation in plants
      remain incompletely understood because few relevant farnesylated targets have
      been identified. Here, we show that defective farnesylation of a single
      factor-heat-shock protein 40 (HSP40), encoded by the J2 and J3 genes-is
      sufficient to confer ABA hypersensitivity, drought resistance, late flowering,
      and enlarged meristems, indicating that altered function of chaperone client
      proteins underlies most farnesyl transferase mutant phenotypes. We also show that
      expression of an abiotic stress-related microRNA (miRNA) regulon controlled by
      the transcription factor SPL7 requires HSP40 farnesylation. Expression of a
      truncated SPL7 form mimicking its activated proteolysis fragment of the
      membrane-bound SPL7 precursor partially restores accumulation of SPL7-dependent
      miRNAs in farnesyl transferase mutants. These results implicate the pathway
      directing SPL7 activation from its membrane-bound precursor as an important
      target of farnesylated HSP40, consistent with our demonstration that HSP40
      farnesylation facilitates its membrane association. The results also suggest that
      altered gene regulation via select miRNAs contributes to abiotic stress-related
      phenotypes of farnesyl transferase mutants.

TI  - YAP repression of the WNT3 gene controls hESC differentiation along the cardiac
      mesoderm lineage.
PG  - 2250-2263
LID - 10.1101/gad.307512.117 [doi]
AB  - Activin/SMAD signaling in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) ensures NANOG
      expression and stem cell pluripotency. In the presence of Wnt ligand, the
      Activin/SMAD transcription network switches to cooperate with Wnt/beta-catenin
      and induce mesendodermal (ME) differentiation genes. We show here that the Hippo 
      effector YAP binds to the WNT3 gene enhancer and prevents the gene from being
      induced by Activin in proliferating hESCs. ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) data show
      that YAP impairs SMAD recruitment and the accumulation of P-TEFb-associated RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD)-Ser7 phosphorylation at the WNT3
      gene. CRISPR/CAS9 knockout of YAP in hESCs enables Activin to induce Wnt3
      expression and stabilize beta-catenin, which then synergizes with Activin-induced
      SMADs to activate a subset of ME genes that is required to form cardiac mesoderm.
      Interestingly, exposure of YAP(-/-) hESCs to Activin induces cardiac mesoderm
      markers (BAF60c and HAND1) without activating Wnt-dependent cardiac inhibitor
      genes (CDX2 and MSX1). Moreover, canonical Wnt target genes are up-regulated only
      modestly, if at all, under these conditions. Consequently, YAP-null hESCs exposed
      to Activin differentiate precisely into beating cardiomyocytes without further
      treatment. We conclude that YAP maintains hESC pluripotency by preventing WNT3
      expression in response to Activin, thereby blocking a direct route to embryonic
      cardiac mesoderm formation.

TI  - Hyperactive mTOR and MNK1 phosphorylation of eIF4E confer tamoxifen resistance
      and estrogen independence through selective mRNA translation reprogramming.
PG  - 2235-2249

AB  - The majority of breast cancers expresses the estrogen receptor (ER(+)) and is
      treated with anti-estrogen therapies, particularly tamoxifen in premenopausal
      women. However, tamoxifen resistance is responsible for a large proportion of
      breast cancer deaths. Using small molecule inhibitors, phospho-mimetic proteins, 
      tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, a
      tamoxifen-resistant patient-derived xenograft model, patient tumor tissues, and
      genome-wide transcription and translation studies, we show that tamoxifen
      resistance involves selective mRNA translational reprogramming to an
      anti-estrogen state by Runx2 and other mRNAs. Tamoxifen-resistant translational
      reprogramming is shown to be mediated by increased expression of eIF4E and its
      increased availability by hyperactive mTOR and to require phosphorylation of
      eIF4E at Ser209 by increased MNK activity. Resensitization to tamoxifen is
      restored only by reducing eIF4E expression or mTOR activity and also blocking
      MNK1 phosphorylation of eIF4E. mRNAs specifically translationally up-regulated
      with tamoxifen resistance include Runx2, which inhibits ER signaling and estrogen
      responses and promotes breast cancer metastasis. Silencing Runx2 significantly
      restores tamoxifen sensitivity. Tamoxifen-resistant but not tamoxifen-sensitive
      patient ER(+) breast cancer specimens also demonstrate strongly increased MNK
      phosphorylation of eIF4E. eIF4E levels, availability, and phosphorylation
      therefore promote tamoxifen resistance in ER(+) breast cancer through selective
      mRNA translational reprogramming.

TI  - RNA G-quadruplex secondary structure promotes alternative splicing via the
      RNA-binding protein hnRNPF.
PG  - 2296-2309
LID - 10.1101/gad.305862.117 [doi]
AB  - It is generally thought that splicing factors regulate alternative splicing
      through binding to RNA consensus sequences. In addition to these linear motifs,
      RNA secondary structure is emerging as an important layer in splicing regulation.
      Here we demonstrate that RNA elements with G-quadruplex-forming capacity promote 
      exon inclusion. Destroying G-quadruplex-forming capacity while keeping G tracts
      intact abrogates exon inclusion. Analysis of RNA-binding protein footprints
      revealed that G quadruplexes are enriched in heterogeneous nuclear
      ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNPF)-binding sites and near hnRNPF-regulated
      alternatively spliced exons in the human transcriptome. Moreover, hnRNPF
      regulates an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated CD44 isoform
      switch in a G-quadruplex-dependent manner, which results in inhibition of EMT.
      Mining breast cancer TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data sets, we demonstrate
      that hnRNPF negatively correlates with an EMT gene signature and positively
      correlates with patient survival. These data suggest a critical role for RNA G
      quadruplexes in regulating alternative splicing. Modulation of G-quadruplex
      structural integrity may control cellular processes important for tumor
      progression.

PG  - 2222-2234
LID - 10.1101/gad.306753.117 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have shown that a subset of nucleoporins (Nups) can detach from
      the nuclear pore complex and move into the nuclear interior to regulate
      transcription. One such dynamic Nup, called Nup98, has been implicated in gene
      activation in healthy cells and has been shown to drive leukemogenesis when
      mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that in
      hematopoietic cells, Nup98 binds predominantly to transcription start sites to
      recruit the Wdr82-Set1A/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)
      complex, which is required for deposition of the histone 3 Lys4 trimethyl
      (H3K4me3)-activating mark. Depletion of Nup98 or Wdr82 abolishes Set1A
      recruitment to chromatin and subsequently ablates H3K4me3 at adjacent promoters. 
      Furthermore, expression of a Nup98 fusion protein implicated in aggressive AML
      causes mislocalization of H3K4me3 at abnormal regions and up-regulation of
      associated genes. Our findings establish a function of Nup98 in hematopoietic
      gene activation and provide mechanistic insight into which Nup98 leukemic fusion 
      proteins promote AML.

AB  - Cohesin was identified through its major role in holding sister chromatids
      together. We are learning through analysis of cohesin and other members of the
      protein family (SMC [structural maintenance of chromosomes]) and their regulators
      that these ring complexes contribute to chromosome organization and dynamics
      throughout the cell cycle. We need to consider not only how ring complexes are
      regulated but how they interact with their fluctuating chromatin substrate.

TI  - Sharing the load: Mex67-Mtr2 cofunctions with Los1 in primary tRNA nuclear
      export.

AB  - Eukaryotic transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are exported from the nucleus, their site of
      synthesis, to the cytoplasm, their site of function for protein synthesis. The
      evolutionarily conserved beta-importin family member Los1 (Exportin-t) has been
      the only exporter known to execute nuclear export of newly transcribed
      intron-containing pre-tRNAs. Interestingly, LOS1 is unessential in all tested
      organisms. As tRNA nuclear export is essential, we previously interrogated the
      budding yeast proteome to identify candidates that function in tRNA nuclear
      export. Here, we provide molecular, genetic, cytological, and biochemical
      evidence that the Mex67-Mtr2 (TAP-p15) heterodimer, best characterized for its
      essential role in mRNA nuclear export, cofunctions with Los1 in tRNA nuclear
      export. Inactivation of Mex67 or Mtr2 leads to rapid accumulation of end-matured 
      unspliced tRNAs in the nucleus. Remarkably, merely fivefold overexpression of
      Mex67-Mtr2 can substitute for Los1 in los1Delta cells. Moreover, in vivo
      coimmunoprecipitation assays with tagged Mex67 document that the Mex67 binds
      tRNAs. Our data also show that tRNA exporters surprisingly exhibit differential
      tRNA substrate preferences. The existence of multiple tRNA exporters, each with
      different tRNA preferences, may indicate that the proteome can be regulated by
      tRNA nuclear export. Thus, our data show that Mex67-Mtr2 functions in primary
      nuclear export for a subset of yeast tRNAs.

AB  - Epigenetic maintenance of gene repression is essential for development. Polycomb 
      complexes are central to this memory, but many aspects of the underlying
      mechanism remain unclear. LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) binds
      Polycomb-deposited H3K27me3 and is required for repression of many Polycomb
      target genes in Arabidopsis Here we show that LHP1 binds RNA in vitro through the
      intrinsically disordered hinge region. By independently perturbing the
      RNA-binding hinge region and H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys27)
      recognition, we found that both facilitate LHP1 localization and H3K27me3
      maintenance. Disruption of the RNA-binding hinge region also prevented formation 
      of subnuclear foci, structures potentially important for epigenetic repression.

TI  - Observation of DNA intertwining along authentic budding yeast chromosomes.
PG  - 2151-2161
LID - 10.1101/gad.305557.117 [doi]
AB  - DNA replication of circular genomes generates physically interlinked or catenated
      sister DNAs. These are resolved through transient DNA fracture by type II
      topoisomerases to permit chromosome segregation during cell division.
      Topoisomerase II is similarly required for linear chromosome segregation,
      suggesting that linear chromosomes also remain intertwined following DNA
      replication. Indeed, chromosome resolution defects are a frequent cause of
      chromosome segregation failure and consequent aneuploidies. When and where
      intertwines arise and persist along linear chromosomes are not known, owing to
      the difficulty of demonstrating intertwining of linear DNAs. Here, we used
      excision of chromosomal regions as circular "loop outs" to convert sister
      chromatid intertwines into catenated circles. This revealed intertwining at
      replication termination and cohesin-binding sites, where intertwines are thought 
      to arise and persist but not to a greater extent than elsewhere in the genome.
      Intertwining appears to spread evenly along chromosomes but is excluded from
      heterochromatin. We found that intertwines arise before replication termination, 
      suggesting that replication forks rotate during replication elongation to
      dissipate torsion ahead of the forks. Our approach provides previously
      inaccessible insight into the topology of eukaryotic chromosomes and illuminates 
      a process critical for successful chromosome segregation.

PG  - 2162-2174
LID - 10.1101/gad.306324.117 [doi]
AB  - TFIID binds promoter DNA to recruit RNA polymerase II and other basal factors for
      transcription. Although the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID is
      necessary and sufficient for in vitro transcription, the TBP-associated factor
      (TAF) subunits recognize downstream promoter elements, act as coactivators, and
      interact with nucleosomes. In yeast nuclear extracts, transcription induces
      stable TAF binding to downstream promoter DNA, promoting subsequent
      activator-independent transcription reinitiation. In vivo, promoter responses to 
      TAF mutations correlate with the level of downstream, rather than overall, Taf1
      cross-linking. We propose a new model in which TAFs function as reinitiation
      factors, accounting for the differential responses of promoters to various
      transcription factor mutations.

AB  - ESCO1/2 acetyltransferases mediating SMC3 acetylation and sister chromatid
      cohesion (SCC) are differentially required for genome integrity and development. 
      Here we established chicken DT40 cell lines with mutations in ESCO1/2, SMC3
      acetylation, and the cohesin remover WAPL. Both ESCO1 and ESCO2 promoted SCC,
      while ESCO2 was additionally and specifically required for proliferation and
      centromere integrity. ESCO1 overexpression fully suppressed the slow
      proliferation and centromeric separation phenotypes of esco2 cells but only
      partly suppressed its chromosome arm SCC defects. Concomitant inactivation of
      ESCO1 and ESCO2 caused lethality owing to compromised mitotic chromosome
      segregation. Neither wapl nor acetyl-mimicking smc3-QQ mutations rescued esco1
      esco2 lethality. Notably, esco1 esco2 wapl conditional mutants showed very severe
      proliferation defects associated with catastrophic mitoses and also abnormal
      interphase chromatin organization patterns. The results indicate that cohesion
      establishment by vertebrate ESCO1/2 is linked to interphase chromatin
      architecture formation, a newly identified function of cohesin acetyltransferases
      that is both fundamentally and medically relevant.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms underlying human brain evolution are not fully
      understood; however, previous work suggested that expression of the transcription
      factor CLOCK in the human cortex might be relevant to human cognition and
      disease. In this study, we investigated this novel transcriptional role for CLOCK
      in human neurons by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for
      endogenous CLOCK in adult neocortices and RNA sequencing following CLOCK
      knockdown in differentiated human neurons in vitro. These data suggested that
      CLOCK regulates the expression of genes involved in neuronal migration, and a
      functional assay showed that CLOCK knockdown increased neuronal migratory
      distance. Furthermore, dysregulation of CLOCK disrupts coexpressed networks of
      genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, and the expression of these
      networks is driven by hub genes with human-specific patterns of expression. These
      data support a role for CLOCK-regulated transcriptional cascades involved in
      human brain evolution and function.

PG  - 2175-2185
LID - 10.1101/gad.303677.117 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear gene transcription is coordinated with transcript release from the
      chromatin template and messenger RNA (mRNA) export to the cytoplasm. Here we
      describe the role of nuclear-localized kinase WNK1 (with no lysine [K] 1) in the 
      mammalian mRNA export pathway even though it was previously established as a
      critical regulator of ion homeostasis in the cytoplasm. Our data reveal that WNK1
      phosphorylates the termination factor PCF11 on its RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID). Furthermore, phosphorylation of
      the PCF11 CID weakens its interaction with Pol II. We predict that WNK1 and the
      associated phosphorylation of the PCF11 CID act to promote transcript release
      from chromatin-associated Pol II. This in turn facilitates mRNA export to the
      cytoplasm.

PG  - 2017-2022
LID - 10.1101/gad.301184.117 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian cells must integrate environmental cues to determine coherent
      physiological responses. The transcription factors Myc and YAP-TEAD act
      downstream from mitogenic signals, with the latter responding also to mechanical 
      cues. Here, we show that these factors coordinately regulate genes required for
      cell proliferation. Activation of Myc led to extensive association with its
      genomic targets, most of which were prebound by TEAD. At these loci, recruitment 
      of YAP was Myc-dependent and led to full transcriptional activation. This
      cooperation was critical for cell cycle entry, organ growth, and tumorigenesis.
      Thus, Myc and YAP-TEAD integrate mitogenic and mechanical cues at the
      transcriptional level to provide multifactorial control of cell proliferation.

PG  - 2039-2055
LID - 10.1101/gad.305037.117 [doi]
AB  - The molecular mechanisms driving brain development at risk in autism spectrum
      disorders (ASDs) remain mostly unknown. Previous studies have implicated the
      transcription factor FOXP1 in both brain development and ASD pathophysiology.
      However, the specific molecular pathways both upstream of and downstream from
      FOXP1 are not fully understood. To elucidate the contribution of FOXP1-mediated
      signaling to brain development and, in particular, neocortical development, we
      generated forebrain-specific Foxp1 conditional knockout mice. We show that
      deletion of Foxp1 in the developing forebrain leads to impairments in neonatal
      vocalizations as well as neocortical cytoarchitectonic alterations via neuronal
      positioning and migration. Using a genomics approach, we identified the
      transcriptional networks regulated by Foxp1 in the developing neocortex and found
      that such networks are enriched for downstream targets involved in neurogenesis
      and neuronal migration. We also uncovered mechanistic insight into Foxp1 function
      by demonstrating that sumoylation of Foxp1 during embryonic brain development is 
      necessary for mediating proper interactions between Foxp1 and the NuRD complex.
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that sumoylation of Foxp1 affects neuronal
      differentiation and migration in the developing neocortex. Together, these data
      provide critical mechanistic insights into the function of FOXP1 in the
      developing neocortex and may reveal molecular pathways at risk in ASD.

TI  - The secreted neurotrophin Spatzle 3 promotes glial morphogenesis and supports
      neuronal survival and function.

AB  - Most glial functions depend on establishing intimate morphological relationships 
      with neurons. Significant progress has been made in understanding neuron-glia
      signaling at synaptic and axonal contacts, but how glia support neuronal cell
      bodies is unclear. Here we explored the growth and functions of Drosophila cortex
      glia (which associate almost exclusively with neuronal cell bodies) to understand
      glia-soma interactions. We show that cortex glia tile with one another and with
      astrocytes to establish unique central nervous system (CNS) spatial domains that 
      actively restrict glial growth, and selective ablation of cortex glia causes
      animal lethality. In an RNAi-based screen, we identified alphaSNAP (soluble NSF
      [N-ethylmalemeide-sensitive factor] attachment protein alpha) and several
      components of vesicle fusion and recycling machinery as essential for the
      maintenance of cortex glial morphology and continued contact with neurons.
      Interestingly, loss of the secreted neurotrophin Spatzle 3 (Spz3) phenocopied
      alphaSNAP phenotypes, which included loss of glial ensheathment of neuron cell
      bodies, increased neuronal cell death, and defects in animal behavior. Rescue
      experiments suggest that Spz3 can exert these effects only over very short
      distances. This work identifies essential roles for glial ensheathment of
      neuronal cell bodies in CNS homeostasis as well as Spz3 as a novel signaling
      factor required for maintenance of cortex glial morphology and neuron-glia
      contact.

      cancer pathogenesis by regulating metabolism.

AB  - Mutations and translocations within the COMPASS (complex of proteins associated
      with Set1) family of histone lysine methyltransferases are associated with a
      large number of human diseases, including cancer. Here we report that
      SET1B/COMPASS, which is essential for cell survival, surprisingly has a
      cytoplasmic variant. SET1B, but not its SET domain, is critical for maintaining
      cell viability, indicating a novel catalytic-independent role of SET1B/COMPASS.
      Loss of SET1B or its unique cytoplasmic-interacting protein, BOD1, leads to
      up-regulation of expression of numerous genes modulating fatty acid metabolism,
      including ADIPOR1 (adiponectin receptor 1), COX7C, SDC4, and COQ7 Our detailed
      molecular studies identify ADIPOR1 signaling, which is inactivated in both
      obesity and human cancers, as a key target of SET1B/COMPASS. Collectively, our
      study reveals a cytoplasmic function for a member of the COMPASS family, which
      could be harnessed for therapeutic regulation of signaling in human diseases,
      including cancer.

TI  - Coupling shRNA screens with single-cell RNA-seq identifies a dual role for mTOR
      in reprogramming-induced senescence.
PG  - 2085-2098
LID - 10.1101/gad.297796.117 [doi]
AB  - Expression of the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC (OSKM)
      reprograms somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
      Reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process, suggesting the presence of
      safeguarding mechanisms that counteract cell fate conversion. One such mechanism 
      is senescence. To identify modulators of reprogramming-induced senescence, we
      performed a genome-wide shRNA screen in primary human fibroblasts expressing
      OSKM. In the screen, we identified novel mediators of OSKM-induced senescence and
      validated previously implicated genes such as CDKN1A We developed an innovative
      approach that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with the shRNA
      screen to investigate the mechanism of action of the identified candidates. Our
      data unveiled regulation of senescence as a novel way by which mechanistic target
      of rapamycin (mTOR) influences reprogramming. On one hand, mTOR inhibition blunts
      the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CDKIs), including
      p16(INK4a), p21(CIP1), and p15(INK4b), preventing OSKM-induced senescence. On the
      other hand, inhibition of mTOR blunts the senescence-associated secretory
      phenotype (SASP), which itself favors reprogramming. These contrasting actions
      contribute to explain the complex effect that mTOR has on reprogramming. Overall,
      our study highlights the advantage of combining functional screens with scRNA-seq
      to accelerate the discovery of pathways controlling complex phenotypes.

      blockade.
PG  - 2067-2084
LID - 10.1101/gad.305292.117 [doi]
AB  - There is limited knowledge about the metabolic reprogramming induced by cancer
      therapies and how this contributes to therapeutic resistance. Here we show that
      although inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling markedly decreased glycolysis and 
      restrained tumor growth, these signaling and metabolic restrictions triggered
      autophagy, which supplied the metabolites required for the maintenance of
      mitochondrial respiration and redox homeostasis. Specifically, we found that
      survival of cancer cells was critically dependent on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to
      mobilize lysophospholipids and free fatty acids to sustain fatty acid oxidation
      and oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with this, we observed significantly
      increased lipid droplets, with subsequent mobilization to mitochondria. These
      changes were abrogated in cells deficient for the essential autophagy gene ATG5
      Accordingly, inhibition of PLA2 significantly decreased lipid droplets, decreased
      oxidative phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. Together, these results
      describe how treatment-induced autophagy provides nutrients for cancer cell
      survival and identifies novel cotreatment strategies to override this survival
      advantage.

TI  - RANK rewires energy homeostasis in lung cancer cells and drives primary lung
      cancer.
PG  - 2099-2112
LID - 10.1101/gad.304162.117 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Besides smoking,
      epidemiological studies have linked female sex hormones to lung cancer in women; 
      however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that the
      receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK), the key regulator of
      osteoclastogenesis, is frequently expressed in primary lung tumors, an active
      RANK pathway correlates with decreased survival, and pharmacologic RANK
      inhibition reduces tumor growth in patient-derived lung cancer xenografts. Clonal
      genetic inactivation of KRas(G12D) in mouse lung epithelial cells markedly
      impairs the progression of KRas(G12D) -driven lung cancer, resulting in a
      significant survival advantage. Mechanistically, RANK rewires energy homeostasis 
      in human and murine lung cancer cells and promotes expansion of lung cancer
      stem-like cells, which is blocked by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Our
      data also indicate survival differences in KRas(G12D) -driven lung cancer between
      male and female mice, and we show that female sex hormones can promote lung
      cancer progression via the RANK pathway. These data uncover a direct role for
      RANK in lung cancer and may explain why female sex hormones accelerate lung
      cancer development. Inhibition of RANK using the approved drug denosumab may be a
      therapeutic drug candidate for primary lung cancer.

TI  - A cryptic Tudor domain links BRWD2/PHIP to COMPASS-mediated histone H3K4
      methylation.
PG  - 2003-2014
LID - 10.1101/gad.305201.117 [doi]
AB  - Histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methylation is a chromatin feature enriched at gene
      cis-regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. Here we identify an
      evolutionarily conserved factor, BRWD2/PHIP, which colocalizes with histone H3K4 
      methylation genome-wide in human cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, and
      Drosophila Biochemical analysis of BRWD2 demonstrated an association with the
      Cullin-4-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase-4 (CRL4) complex, nucleosomes, and chromatin
      remodelers. BRWD2/PHIP binds directly to H3K4 methylation through a previously
      unidentified chromatin-binding module related to Royal Family Tudor domains,
      which we named the CryptoTudor domain. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genetic knockouts, we
      demonstrate that COMPASS H3K4 methyltransferase family members differentially
      regulate BRWD2/PHIP chromatin occupancy. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion
      of the single Drosophila homolog dBRWD3 results in altered gene expression and
      aberrant patterns of histone H3 Lys27 acetylation at enhancers and promoters,
      suggesting a cross-talk between these chromatin modifications and transcription
      through the BRWD protein family.

TI  - Genetic interrogation of replicative senescence uncovers a dual role for USP28 in
      coordinating the p53 and GATA4 branches of the senescence program.
PG  - 1933-1938
LID - 10.1101/gad.304857.117 [doi]
AB  - Senescence is a terminal differentiation program that halts the growth of damaged
      cells and must be circumvented for cancer to arise. Here we describe a panel of
      genetic screens to identify genes required for replicative senescence. We uncover
      a role in senescence for the potent tumor suppressor and ATM substrate USP28.
      USP28 controls activation of both the TP53 branch and the GATA4/NFkB branch that 
      controls the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These results
      suggest a role for ubiquitination in senescence and imply a common node
      downstream from ATM that links the TP53 and GATA4 branches of the senescence
      response.

AB  - Maternal imprinting at the Xist gene is essential to achieve paternal
      allele-specific imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals.
      However, the mechanism underlying Xist imprinting is unclear. Here we show that
      the Xist locus is coated with a broad H3K27me3 domain that is established during 
      oocyte growth and persists through preimplantation development in mice. Loss of
      maternal H3K27me3 induces maternal Xist expression and maternal XCI in
      preimplantation embryos. Our study thus identifies maternal H3K27me3 as the
      imprinting mark of Xist.

LID - 10.1101/gad.304782.117 [doi]
AB  - Histone CENP-A-containing nucleosomes play an important role in nucleating
      kinetochores at centromeres for chromosome segregation. However, the molecular
      mechanisms by which CENP-A nucleosomes engage with kinetochore proteins are not
      well understood. Here, we report the finding of a new function for the budding
      yeast Cse4/CENP-A histone-fold domain interacting with inner kinetochore protein 
      Mif2/CENP-C. Strikingly, we also discovered that AT-rich centromere DNA has an
      important role for Mif2 recruitment. Mif2 contacts one side of the nucleosome
      dyad, engaging with both Cse4 residues and AT-rich nucleosomal DNA. Both
      interactions are directed by a contiguous DNA- and histone-binding domain (DHBD) 
      harboring the conserved CENP-C motif, an AT hook, and RK clusters (clusters
      enriched for arginine-lysine residues). Human CENP-C has two related DHBDs that
      bind preferentially to DNA sequences of higher AT content. Our findings suggest
      that a DNA composition-based mechanism together with residues characteristic for 
      the CENP-A histone variant contribute to the specification of centromere
      identity.

      developmental genes in Drosophila.
PG  - 1988-2002
LID - 10.1101/gad.305987.117 [doi]
AB  - Regulatory decisions in Drosophila require Polycomb group (PcG) proteins to
      maintain the silent state and Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins to oppose
      silencing. Since PcG and TrxG are ubiquitous and lack apparent sequence
      specificity, a long-standing model is that targeting occurs via protein
      interactions; for instance, between repressors and PcG proteins. Instead, we
      found that Pc-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) purifies with coactivators Fs(1)h
      [female sterile (1) homeotic] and Enok/Br140 during embryogenesis. Fs(1)h is a
      TrxG member and the ortholog of BRD4, a bromodomain protein that binds to
      acetylated histones and is a key transcriptional coactivator in mammals. Enok and
      Br140, another bromodomain protein, are orthologous to subunits of a mammalian
      MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase complex. Here we confirm PRC1-Br140 and PRC1-Fs(1)h
      interactions and identify their genomic binding sites. PRC1-Br140 bind
      developmental genes in fly embryos, with analogous co-occupancy of PRC1 and a
      Br140 ortholog, BRD1, at bivalent loci in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We
      propose that identification of PRC1-Br140 "bivalent complexes" in fly embryos
      supports and extends the bivalency model posited in mammalian cells, in which the
      coexistence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at developmental promoters represents a
      poised transcriptional state. We further speculate that local competition between
      acetylation and deacetylation may play a critical role in the resolution of
      bivalent protein complexes during development.

      tumorigenesis via activation of FYN kinase.
PG  - 1939-1957
LID - 10.1101/gad.304261.117 [doi]
AB  - Disruption of the balanced modulation of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation has 
      been implicated in the etiology of various human cancers, including breast
      cancer. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase N23 (PTPN23) resides in chromosomal region
      3p21.3, which is hemizygously or homozygously lost in some breast cancer
      patients. In a loss-of-function PTPome screen, our laboratory identified PTPN23
      as a suppressor of cell motility and invasion in mammary epithelial and breast
      cancer cells. Now, our TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database analyses
      illustrate a correlation between low PTPN23 expression and poor survival in
      breast cancers of various subtypes. Therefore, we investigated the
      tumor-suppressive function of PTPN23 in an orthotopic transplantation mouse
      model. Suppression of PTPN23 in Comma 1Dbeta cells induced breast tumors within
      56 wk. In PTPN23-depleted tumors, we detected hyperphosphorylation of the
      autophosphorylation site tyrosine in the SRC family kinase (SFK) FYN as well as
      Tyr142 in beta-catenin. We validated the underlying mechanism of PTPN23 function 
      in breast tumorigenesis as that of a key phosphatase that normally suppresses the
      activity of FYN in two different models. We demonstrated that tumor outgrowth
      from PTPN23-deficient BT474 cells was suppressed in a xenograft model in vivo
      upon treatment with AZD0530, an SFK inhibitor. Furthermore, double knockout of
      FYN and PTPN23 via CRISPR/CAS9 also attenuated tumor outgrowth from PTPN23
      knockout Cal51 cells. Overall, this mechanistic analysis of the tumor-suppressive
      function of PTPN23 in breast cancer supports the identification of FYN as a
      therapeutic target for breast tumors with heterozygous or homozygous loss of
      PTPN23.

TI  - A mutually exclusive stem-loop arrangement in roX2 RNA is essential for
      X-chromosome regulation in Drosophila.
PG  - 1973-1987
LID - 10.1101/gad.304600.117 [doi]
AB  - The X chromosome provides an ideal model system to study the contribution of
      RNA-protein interactions in epigenetic regulation. In male flies, roX long
      noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) harbor several redundant domains to interact with the
      ubiquitin ligase male-specific lethal 2 (MSL2) and the RNA helicase Maleless
      (MLE) for X-chromosomal regulation. However, how these interactions provide the
      mechanics of spreading remains unknown. By using the uvCLAP (UV cross-linking and
      affinity purification) methodology, which provides unprecedented information
      about RNA secondary structures in vivo, we identified the minimal functional unit
      of roX2 RNA. By using wild-type and various MLE mutant derivatives, including a
      catalytically inactive MLE derivative, MLE(GET), we show that the minimal roX RNA
      contains two mutually exclusive stem-loops that exist in a peculiar structural
      arrangement: When one stem-loop is unwound by MLE, an alternate structure can
      form, likely trapping MLE in this perpetually structured region. We show that
      this functional unit is necessary for dosage compensation, as mutations that
      disrupt this formation lead to male lethality. Thus, we propose that roX2 lncRNA 
      contains an MLE-dependent affinity switch to enable reversible interactions of
      the MSL complex to allow dosage compensation of the X chromosome.

      Drosophila.
PG  - 1841-1846
LID - 10.1101/gad.303131.117 [doi]
AB  - Relatively little is known about the in vivo functions of newly emerging genes,
      especially in metazoans. Although prior RNAi studies reported prevalent lethality
      among young gene knockdowns, our phylogenomic analyses reveal that young
      Drosophila genes are frequently restricted to the nonessential male reproductive 
      system. We performed large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of "conserved,
      essential" and "young, RNAi-lethal" genes and broadly confirmed the lethality of 
      the former but the viability of the latter. Nevertheless, certain young gene
      mutants exhibit defective spermatogenesis and/or male sterility. Moreover, we
      detected widespread signatures of positive selection on young male-biased genes. 
      Thus, young genes have a preferential impact on male reproductive system
      function.

AB  - Advances in the enrichment and analysis of rare cells from the bloodstream have
      allowed for detection and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from
      patients with cancer. The analysis of CTCs has provided significant insight into 
      the metastatic process. Studies on the biology of CTCs have begun to elucidate
      the molecular mechanisms of CTC generation, intravasation, survival, interactions
      with components of the blood, extravasation, and colonization of distant organs. 
      Additionally, the study of CTCs has exposed dramatic intrapatient and
      interpatient heterogeneity and their evolution over time. In this review, we
      focus on the current knowledge of CTC biology and the potential clinical
      implications.

PG  - 1823-1824
LID - 10.1101/gad.307439.117 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 occur in a majority of human cancers. Some 
      gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutations endow tumor cells with increased metastatic 
      ability, although our understanding of the underlying mechanism remains
      incomplete. In this issue of Genes & Development, Pourebrahim and colleagues (pp.
      1847-1857) develop a new mouse model of osteosarcoma in which a GOF mutant p53
      allele is expressed specifically in osteoblasts, while the tumor microenvironment
      remains wild type for p53, allowing for the study of cell-autonomous functions.
      In this model, the role of GOF mutant p53 in promoting lung metastasis is shown
      to be critically dependent on the transcription factor Ets2 and is accompanied by
      the elevated expression of a cluster of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).

TI  - Zucchini-dependent piRNA processing is triggered by recruitment to the
      cytoplasmic processing machinery.
PG  - 1858-1869
LID - 10.1101/gad.303214.117 [doi]
AB  - The piRNA pathway represses transposable elements in the gonads and thereby plays
      a vital role in protecting the integrity of germline genomes of animals. Mature
      piRNAs are processed from longer transcripts, piRNA precursors (pre-piRNAs). In
      Drosophila, processing of pre-piRNAs is initiated by piRNA-guided Slicer cleavage
      or the endonuclease Zucchini (Zuc). As Zuc does not have any sequence or
      structure preferences in vitro, it is not known how piRNA precursors are selected
      and channeled into the Zuc-dependent processing pathway. We show that a
      heterologous RNA that lacks complementary piRNAs is processed into piRNAs upon
      recruitment of several piRNA pathway factors. This processing requires Zuc and
      the helicase Armitage (Armi). Aubergine (Aub), Argonaute 3 (Ago3), and components
      of the nuclear RDC complex, which are required for normal piRNA biogenesis in
      germ cells, are dispensable. Our approach allows discrimination of proteins
      involved in the transcription and export of piRNA precursors from components
      required for the cytoplasmic processing steps. piRNA processing correlates with
      localization of the substrate RNA to nuage, a distinct membraneless cytoplasmic
      compartment, which surrounds the nucleus of germ cells, suggesting that
      sequestration of RNA to this subcellular compartment is both necessary and
      sufficient for selecting piRNA biogenesis substrates.

      Quaking functions in splicing and translation.
PG  - 1894-1909
LID - 10.1101/gad.302059.117 [doi]
AB  - Quaking protein isoforms arise from a single Quaking gene and bind the same RNA
      motif to regulate splicing, translation, decay, and localization of a large set
      of RNAs. However, the mechanisms by which Quaking expression is controlled to
      ensure that appropriate amounts of each isoform are available for such disparate 
      gene expression processes are unknown. Here we explore how levels of two
      isoforms, nuclear Quaking-5 (Qk5) and cytoplasmic Qk6, are regulated in mouse
      myoblasts. We found that Qk5 and Qk6 proteins have distinct functions in splicing
      and translation, respectively, enforced through differential subcellular
      localization. We show that Qk5 and Qk6 regulate distinct target mRNAs in the cell
      and act in distinct ways on their own and each other's transcripts to create a
      network of autoregulatory and cross-regulatory feedback controls.
      Morpholino-mediated inhibition of Qk translation confirms that Qk5 controls Qk
      RNA levels by promoting accumulation and alternative splicing of Qk RNA, whereas 
      Qk6 promotes its own translation while repressing Qk5. This Qk isoform
      cross-regulatory network responds to additional cell type and developmental
      controls to generate a spectrum of Qk5/Qk6 ratios, where they likely contribute
      to the wide range of functions of Quaking in development and cancer.

TI  - Two distinct transcription termination modes dictated by promoters.
PG  - 1870-1879
LID - 10.1101/gad.301093.117 [doi]
AB  - Transcription termination determines the ends of transcriptional units and
      thereby ensures the integrity of the transcriptome and faithful gene regulation. 
      Studies in yeast and human cells have identified the exoribonuclease XRN2 as a
      key termination factor for protein-coding genes. Here we performed a genome-wide 
      investigation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription termination in
      XRN2-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans and observed two distinct modes of
      termination. Although a subset of genes requires XRN2, termination of other genes
      appears both independent of, and refractory to, XRN2. XRN2 independence is not
      merely a consequence of failure to recruit XRN2, since XRN2 is present on-and
      promotes Pol II accumulation near the polyadenylation sites of-both gene classes.
      Unexpectedly, promoters instruct the choice of termination mode, but
      XRN2-independent termination additionally requires a compatible region downstream
      from the 3' end cleavage site. Hence, different termination mechanisms may work
      with different configurations of Pol II complexes dictated by promoters.

TI  - Integrative genome analysis of somatic p53 mutant osteosarcomas identifies
      Ets2-dependent regulation of small nucleolar RNAs by mutant p53 protein.
PG  - 1847-1857
LID - 10.1101/gad.304972.117 [doi]
AB  - TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. Many mutant p53
      proteins exert oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) properties that contribute to
      metastasis, but the mechanisms mediating these functions remain poorly defined in
      vivo. To elucidate how mutant p53 GOF drives metastasis, we developed a traceable
      somatic osteosarcoma mouse model that is initiated with either a single p53
      mutation (p53R172H) or p53 loss in osteoblasts. Our study confirmed that p53
      mutant mice developed osteosarcomas with increased metastasis as compared with
      p53-null mice. Comprehensive transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of
      16 tumors identified a cluster of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are highly 
      up-regulated in p53 mutant tumors. Regulatory element analysis of these
      deregulated snoRNA genes identified strong enrichment of a common Ets2
      transcription factor-binding site. Homozygous deletion of Ets2 in p53 mutant mice
      resulted in strong down-regulation of snoRNAs and reversed the prometastatic
      phenotype of mutant p53 but had no effect on osteosarcoma development, which
      remained 100% penetrant. In summary, our studies identify Ets2 inhibition as a
      potential therapeutic vulnerability in p53 mutant osteosarcomas.

TI  - An RNA-binding protein, Qki5, regulates embryonic neural stem cells through
      pre-mRNA processing in cell adhesion signaling.
PG  - 1910-1925
LID - 10.1101/gad.300822.117 [doi]
AB  - Cell type-specific transcriptomes are enabled by the action of multiple
      regulators, which are frequently expressed within restricted tissue regions. In
      the present study, we identify one such regulator, Quaking 5 (Qki5), as an
      RNA-binding protein (RNABP) that is expressed in early embryonic neural stem
      cells and subsequently down-regulated during neurogenesis. mRNA sequencing
      analysis in neural stem cell culture indicates that Qki proteins play supporting 
      roles in the neural stem cell transcriptome and various forms of mRNA processing 
      that may result from regionally restricted expression and subcellular
      localization. Also, our in utero electroporation gain-of-function study suggests 
      that the nuclear-type Qki isoform Qki5 supports the neural stem cell state. We
      next performed in vivo transcriptome-wide protein-RNA interaction mapping to
      search for direct targets of Qki5 and elucidate how Qki5 regulates neural stem
      cell function. Combined with our transcriptome analysis, this mapping analysis
      yielded a bona fide map of Qki5-RNA interaction at single-nucleotide resolution, 
      the identification of 892 Qki5 direct target genes, and an accurate
      Qki5-dependent alternative splicing rule in the developing brain. Last, our
      target gene list provides the first compelling evidence that Qki5 is associated
      with specific biological events; namely, cell-cell adhesion. This prediction was 
      confirmed by histological analysis of mice in which Qki proteins were genetically
      ablated, which revealed disruption of the apical surface of the lateral wall in
      the developing brain. These data collectively indicate that Qki5 regulates
      communication between neural stem cells by mediating numerous RNA processing
      events and suggest new links between splicing regulation and neural stem cell
      states.

TI  - Asy2/Mer2: an evolutionarily conserved mediator of meiotic recombination,
      pairing, and global chromosome compaction.
PG  - 1880-1893
LID - 10.1101/gad.304543.117 [doi]
AB  - Meiosis is the cellular program by which a diploid cell gives rise to haploid
      gametes for sexual reproduction. Meiotic progression depends on tight physical
      and functional coupling of recombination steps at the DNA level with specific
      organizational features of meiotic-prophase chromosomes. The present study
      reveals that every step of this coupling is mediated by a single molecule:
      Asy2/Mer2. We show that Mer2, identified so far only in budding and fission
      yeasts, is in fact evolutionarily conserved from fungi (Mer2/Rec15/Asy2/Bad42) to
      plants (PRD3/PAIR1) and mammals (IHO1). In yeasts, Mer2 mediates assembly of
      recombination-initiation complexes and double-strand breaks (DSBs). This role is 
      conserved in the fungus Sordaria However, functional analysis of 13 mer2 mutants 
      and successive localization of Mer2 to axis, synaptonemal complex (SC), and
      chromatin revealed, in addition, three further important functions. First, after 
      DSB formation, Mer2 is required for pairing by mediating homolog spatial
      juxtaposition, with implications for crossover (CO) patterning/interference.
      Second, Mer2 participates in the transfer/maintenance and release of
      recombination complexes to/from the SC central region. Third, after completion of
      recombination, potentially dependent on SUMOylation, Mer2 mediates global
      chromosome compaction and post-recombination chiasma development. Thus, beyond
      its role as a recombinosome-axis/SC linker molecule, Mer2 has important functions
      in relation to basic chromosome structure.

TI  - Integrator orchestrates RAS/ERK1/2 signaling transcriptional programs.
PG  - 1809-1820
LID - 10.1101/gad.301697.117 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, also
      known as the RAS-MEK-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) pathway, are an
      underlying cause of >70% of human cancers. While great strides have been made
      toward elucidating the cytoplasmic components of MAPK signaling, the key
      downstream coactivators that coordinate the transcriptional response have not
      been fully illustrated. Here, we demonstrate that the MAPK transcriptional
      response in human cells is funneled through Integrator, an RNA polymerase
      II-associated complex. Integrator depletion diminishes ERK1/2 transcriptional
      responsiveness and cellular growth in human cancers harboring activating
      mutations in MAPK signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK pathway
      abrogates the stimulus-dependent recruitment of Integrator at immediate early
      genes and their enhancers. Following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation,
      activated ERK1/2 is recruited to immediate early genes and phosphorylates INTS11,
      the catalytic subunit of Integrator. Importantly, in contrast to the broad
      effects of Integrator knockdown on MAPK responsiveness, depletion of a number of 
      critical subunits of the coactivator complex Mediator alters only a few
      MAPK-responsive genes. Finally, human cancers with activating mutations in the
      MAPK cascade, rendered resistant to targeted therapies, display diminished growth
      following depletion of Integrator. We propose Integrator as a crucial
      transcriptional coactivator in MAPK signaling, which could serve as a downstream 
      therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

      pluripotency.
PG  - 1795-1808
LID - 10.1101/gad.303321.117 [doi]
AB  - Transcription factor (TF)-directed enhanceosome assembly constitutes a
      fundamental regulatory mechanism driving spatiotemporal gene expression programs 
      during animal development. Despite decades of study, we know little about the
      dynamics or order of events animating TF assembly at cis-regulatory elements in
      living cells and the long-range molecular "dialog" between enhancers and
      promoters. Here, combining genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches, we
      characterize a complex long-range enhancer cluster governing Kruppel-like factor 
      4 (Klf4) expression in naive pluripotency. Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed
      that OCT4 and SOX2 safeguard an accessible chromatin neighborhood to assist the
      binding of other TFs/cofactors to the enhancer. Single-molecule live-cell imaging
      uncovered that two naive pluripotency TFs, STAT3 and ESRRB, interrogate chromatin
      in a highly dynamic manner, in which SOX2 promotes ESRRB target search and
      chromatin-binding dynamics through a direct protein-tethering mechanism.
      Together, our results support a highly dynamic yet intrinsically ordered
      enhanceosome assembly to maintain the finely balanced transcription program
      underlying naive pluripotency.

AB  - Morphogen gradients direct the spatial patterning of developing embryos; however,
      the mechanisms by which these gradients are interpreted remain elusive. Here we
      used lattice light-sheet microscopy to perform in vivo single-molecule imaging in
      early Drosophila melanogaster embryos of the transcription factor Bicoid that
      forms a gradient and initiates patterning along the anteroposterior axis. In
      contrast to canonical models, we observed that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid
      off rate throughout the embryo such that its average occupancy at target loci is 
      on-rate-dependent. We further observed Bicoid forming transient "hubs" of locally
      high density that facilitate binding as factor levels drop, including in the
      posterior, where we observed Bicoid binding despite vanishingly low protein
      levels. We propose that localized modulation of transcription factor on rates via
      clustering provides a general mechanism to facilitate binding to low-affinity
      targets and that this may be a prevalent feature of other developmental
      transcription factors.

TI  - ZNF281 enhances cardiac reprogramming by modulating cardiac and inflammatory gene
      expression.
PG  - 1770-1783
LID - 10.1101/gad.305482.117 [doi]
AB  - Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes represents a potential
      means of restoring cardiac function following myocardial injury. AKT1 in the
      presence of four cardiogenic transcription factors, GATA4, HAND2, MEF2C, and TBX5
      (AGHMT), efficiently induces the cardiac gene program in mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts but not adult fibroblasts. To identify additional regulators of adult
      cardiac reprogramming, we performed an unbiased screen of transcription factors
      and cytokines for those that might enhance or suppress the cardiogenic activity
      of AGHMT in adult mouse fibroblasts. Among a collection of inducers and
      repressors of cardiac reprogramming, we discovered that the zinc finger
      transcription factor 281 (ZNF281) potently stimulates cardiac reprogramming by
      genome-wide association with GATA4 on cardiac enhancers. Concomitantly, ZNF281
      suppresses expression of genes associated with inflammatory signaling, suggesting
      the antagonistic convergence of cardiac and inflammatory transcriptional
      programs. Consistent with an inhibitory influence of inflammatory pathways on
      cardiac reprogramming, blockade of these pathways with anti-inflammatory drugs or
      components of the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which
      associate with ZNF281, stimulates cardiac gene expression. We conclude that
      ZNF281 acts at a nexus of cardiac and inflammatory gene programs, which exert
      opposing influences on fibroblast to cardiac reprogramming.

TI  - Dynein light chain 1 induces assembly of large Bim complexes on mitochondria that
      stabilize Mcl-1 and regulate apoptosis.
PG  - 1754-1769
LID - 10.1101/gad.302497.117 [doi]
AB  - The Bcl-2 family protein Bim triggers mitochondrial apoptosis. Bim is expressed
      in nonapoptotic cells at the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is activated 
      by largely unknown mechanisms. We found that Bim is regulated by formation of
      large protein complexes containing dynein light chain 1 (DLC1). Bim rapidly
      inserted into cardiolipin-containing membranes in vitro and recruited DLC1 to the
      membrane. Bim binding to DLC1 induced the formation of large Bim complexes on
      lipid vesicles, on isolated mitochondria, and in intact cells. Native gel
      electrophoresis and gel filtration showed Bim-containing mitochondrial complexes 
      of several hundred kilodaltons in all cells tested. Bim unable to form complexes 
      was consistently more active than complexed Bim, which correlated with its
      substantially reduced binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. At endogenous
      levels, Bim surprisingly bound only anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL,
      recruiting only Mcl-1 into large complexes. Targeting of DLC1 by RNAi in human
      cell lines induced disassembly of Bim-Mcl-1 complexes and the proteasomal
      degradation of Mcl-1 and sensitized the cells to the Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor
      ABT-737. Regulation of apoptosis at mitochondria thus extends beyond the
      interaction of monomers of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
      but involves more complex structures of proteins at the mitochondrial outer
      membrane, and targeting complexes may be a novel therapeutic strategy.

PG  - 1717-1731
LID - 10.1101/gad.305250.117 [doi]
AB  - Although it was long thought that eukaryotic translation almost always initiates 
      at an AUG start codon, recent advancements in ribosome footprint mapping have
      revealed that non-AUG start codons are used at an astonishing frequency. These
      non-AUG initiation events are not simply errors but instead are used to generate 
      or regulate proteins with key cellular functions; for example, during development
      or stress. Misregulation of non-AUG initiation events contributes to multiple
      human diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, and modulation of non-AUG
      usage may represent a novel therapeutic strategy. It is thus becoming
      increasingly clear that start codon selection is regulated by many trans-acting
      initiation factors as well as sequence/structural elements within messenger RNAs 
      and that non-AUG translation has a profound impact on cellular states.

AB  - Medulloblastomas are among the most common malignant brain cancers in the
      pediatric population and consist of at least four distinct subgroups with unique 
      molecular and genetic features and clinical outcomes. In this issue of Genes &
      Development, Niklison-Chirou and colleagues (pp. 1738-1753) identify the p53
      family member and p73 isoform TAp73 as a crucial factor causing glutamine
      addiction in aggressive medulloblastomas. Their findings pave the way for the use
      of glutamine restriction as an adjuvant treatment for TAp73-expressing
      medulloblastomas.

PG  - 1738-1753

AB  - Medulloblastoma is the most common solid primary brain tumor in children.
      Remarkable advancements in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis 
      of these tumors have informed their recent molecular classification. However, the
      genotype/phenotype correlation of the subgroups remains largely uncharacterized. 
      In particular, the metabolic phenotype is of great interest because of its
      druggability, which could lead to the development of novel and more tailored
      therapies for a subset of medulloblastoma. p73 plays a critical role in a range
      of cellular metabolic processes. We show overexpression of p73 in a proportion of
      non-WNT medulloblastoma. In these tumors, p73 sustains cell growth and
      proliferation via regulation of glutamine metabolism. We validated our results in
      a xenograft model in which we observed an increase in survival time in mice on a 
      glutamine restriction diet. Notably, glutamine starvation has a synergistic
      effect with cisplatin, a component of the current medulloblastoma chemotherapy.
      These findings raise the possibility that glutamine depletion can be used as an
      adjuvant treatment for p73-expressing medulloblastoma.

TI  - Histone H3K4 methylation-dependent and -independent functions of Set1A/COMPASS in
      embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.
PG  - 1732-1737
LID - 10.1101/gad.303768.117 [doi]
AB  - Of the six members of the COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1)
      family of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferases identified in mammals, Set1A 
      has been shown to be essential for early embryonic development and the
      maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Like its familial
      relatives, Set1A possesses a catalytic SET domain responsible for histone H3K4
      methylation. Whether H3K4 methylation by Set1A/COMPASS is required for ESC
      maintenance and during differentiation has not yet been addressed. Here, we
      generated ESCs harboring the deletion of the SET domain of Set1A
      (Set1A(DeltaSET)); surprisingly, the Set1A SET domain is dispensable for ESC
      proliferation and self-renewal. The removal of the Set1A SET domain does not
      diminish bulk H3K4 methylation in ESCs; instead, only a subset of genomic loci
      exhibited reduction in H3K4me3 in Set1A(DeltaSET) cells, suggesting a role for
      Set1A independent of its catalytic domain in ESC self-renewal. However,
      Set1A(DeltaSET) ESCs are unable to undergo normal differentiation, indicating the
      importance of Set1A-dependent H3K4 methylation during differentiation. Our data
      also indicate that during differentiation, Set1A but not Mll2 functions as the
      H3K4 methylase on bivalent genes and is required for their expression, supporting
      a model for transcriptional switch between Mll2 and Set1A during the
      self-renewing-to-differentiation transition. Together, our study implicates a
      critical role for Set1A catalytic methyltransferase activity in regulating ESC
      differentiation but not self-renewal and suggests the existence of
      context-specific H3K4 methylation that regulates transcriptional outputs during
      ESC pluripotency.

      promote tumor progression.
PG  - 1641-1654
LID - 10.1101/gad.301564.117 [doi]
AB  - Tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. Mutant p53 often
      promotes tumor progression through gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms. However,
      the mechanisms underlying mutant p53 GOF are not well understood. In this study, 
      we found that mutant p53 activates small GTPase Rac1 as a critical mechanism for 
      mutant p53 GOF to promote tumor progression. Mechanistically, mutant p53
      interacts with Rac1 and inhibits its interaction with SUMO-specific protease 1
      (SENP1), which in turn inhibits SENP1-mediated de-SUMOylation of Rac1 to activate
      Rac1. Targeting Rac1 signaling by RNAi, expression of the dominant-negative Rac1 
      (Rac1 DN), or the specific Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 greatly inhibits mutant p53
      GOF in promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, mutant p53 expression 
      is associated with enhanced Rac1 activity in clinical tumor samples. These
      results uncover a new mechanism for Rac1 activation in tumors and, most
      importantly, reveal that activation of Rac1 is an unidentified and critical
      mechanism for mutant p53 GOF in tumorigenesis, which could be targeted for
      therapy in tumors containing mutant p53.

AB  - Lymphatic vessels are important for tissue fluid homeostasis, lipid absorption,
      and immune cell trafficking and are involved in the pathogenesis of several human
      diseases. The mechanisms by which the lymphatic vasculature network is formed,
      remodeled, and adapted to physiological and pathological challenges are
      controlled by an intricate balance of growth factor and biomechanical cues. These
      transduce signals for the readjustment of gene expression and lymphatic
      endothelial migration, proliferation, and differentiation. In this review, we
      describe several of these cues and how they are integrated for the generation of 
      functional lymphatic vessel networks.

TI  - STAT1 modulates tissue wasting or overgrowth downstream from PDGFRbeta.
PG  - 1666-1678
LID - 10.1101/gad.300384.117 [doi]
AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) acts through two conserved receptor
      tyrosine kinases: PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta. Gain-of-function mutations in human
      PDGFRB have been linked recently to genetic diseases characterized by connective 
      tissue wasting (Penttinen syndrome) or overgrowth (Kosaki overgrowth syndrome),
      but it is unclear whether PDGFRB mutations alone are responsible. Mice with
      constitutive PDGFRbeta signaling caused by a kinase domain mutation (D849V)
      develop lethal autoinflammation. Here we used a genetic approach to investigate
      the mechanism of autoinflammation in Pdgfrb(+/D849V) mice and test the hypothesis
      that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mediates this
      phenotype. We show that Pdgfrb(+/D849V) mice with Stat1 knockout
      (Stat1(-/-)Pdgfrb(+/D849V) ) are rescued from autoinflammation and have improved 
      life span compared with Stat1(+/-)Pdgfrb(+/D849V) mice. Furthermore,
      PDGFRbeta-STAT1 signaling suppresses PDGFRbeta itself. Thus,
      Stat1(-/-)Pdgfrb(+/D849V) fibroblasts exhibit increased PDGFRbeta signaling, and 
      mice develop progressive overgrowth, a distinct phenotype from the wasting seen
      in Stat1(+/-)Pdgfrb(+/D849V) mice. Deletion of interferon receptors (Ifnar1 or
      Ifngr1) does not rescue wasting in Pdgfrb(+/D849V) mice, indicating that
      interferons are not required for autoinflammation. These results provide
      functional evidence that elevated PDGFRbeta signaling causes tissue wasting or
      overgrowth reminiscent of human genetic syndromes and that the STAT1 pathway is a
      crucial modulator of this phenotypic spectrum.

TI  - Polycomb directs timely activation of germline genes in spermatogenesis.
PG  - 1693-1703
LID - 10.1101/gad.302000.117 [doi]
AB  - During spermatogenesis, a large number of germline genes essential for male
      fertility are coordinately activated. However, it remains unknown how timely
      activation of this group of germline genes is accomplished. Here we show that
      Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) directs timely activation of germline genes 
      during spermatogenesis. Inactivation of PRC1 in male germ cells results in the
      gradual loss of a stem cell population and severe differentiation defects,
      leading to male infertility. In the stem cell population, RNF2, the dominant
      catalytic subunit of PRC1, activates transcription of Sall4, which codes for a
      transcription factor essential for subsequent spermatogenic differentiation.
      Furthermore, RNF2 and SALL4 together occupy transcription start sites of germline
      genes in the stem cell population. Once differentiation commences, these germline
      genes are activated to enable the progression of spermatogenesis. Our study
      identifies a novel mechanism by which Polycomb directs the developmental process 
      by activating a group of lineage-specific genes.

TI  - Comparative analysis of three-dimensional chromosomal architecture identifies a

PG  - 1704-1713
LID - 10.1101/gad.303461.117 [doi]
AB  - Chromatin structure is tightly intertwined with transcription regulation. Here we
      compared the chromosomal architectures of fetal and adult human erythroblasts and
      found that, globally, chromatin structures and compartments A/B are highly
      similar at both developmental stages. At a finer scale, we detected distinct
      folding patterns at the developmentally controlled beta-globin locus.
      Specifically, new fetal stage-specific contacts were uncovered between a region
      separating the fetal (gamma) and adult (delta and beta) globin genes
      (encompassing the HBBP1 and BGLT3 noncoding genes) and two distal chromosomal
      sites (HS5 and 3'HS1) that flank the locus. In contrast, in adult cells, the
      HBBP1-BGLT3 region contacts the embryonic epsilon-globin gene, physically
      separating the fetal globin genes from the enhancer (locus control region [LCR]).
      Deletion of the HBBP1 region in adult cells alters contact landscapes in ways
      more closely resembling those of fetal cells, including increased
      LCR-gamma-globin contacts. These changes are accompanied by strong increases in
      gamma-globin transcription. Notably, the effects of HBBP1 removal on chromatin
      architecture and gene expression closely mimic those of deleting the fetal globin
      repressor BCL11A, implicating BCL11A in the function of the HBBP1 region. Our
      results uncover a new critical regulatory region as a potential target for
      therapeutic genome editing for hemoglobinopathies and highlight the power of
      chromosome conformation analysis in discovering new cis control elements.

AB  - Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) regulates the activity of beta-catenin, an
      integral component of Wnt signaling. However, the selective role of the
      APC-beta-catenin pathway in cerebral cortical development is unknown. Here we
      genetically dissected the relative contributions of APC-regulated beta-catenin
      signaling in cortical progenitor development, a necessary early step in cerebral 
      cortical formation. Radial progenitor-specific inactivation of the
      APC-beta-catenin pathway indicates that the maintenance of appropriate
      beta-catenin-mediated Wnt tone is necessary for the orderly differentiation of
      cortical progenitors and the resultant formation of the cerebral cortex. APC
      deletion deregulates beta-catenin, leads to high Wnt tone, and disrupts Notch1
      signaling and primary cilium maintenance necessary for radial progenitor
      functions. beta-Catenin deregulation directly disrupts cilium maintenance and
      signaling via Tulp3, essential for intraflagellar transport of ciliary signaling 
      receptors. Surprisingly, deletion of beta-catenin or inhibition of beta-catenin
      activity in APC-null progenitors rescues the APC-null phenotype. These results
      reveal that APC-regulated beta-catenin activity in cortical progenitors sets the 
      appropriate Wnt tone necessary for normal cerebral cortical development.

AB  - Transcription is often stochastic. This is seemingly incompatible with the
      importance of gene expression during development. Here we show that during
      zebrafish embryogenesis, transcription activation is stochastic due to (1) genes 
      acquiring transcriptional competence at different times in different cells, (2)
      differences in cell cycle stage between cells, and (3) the stochastic nature of
      transcription. Initially, stochastic transcription causes large cell-to-cell
      differences in transcript levels. However, variability is reduced by lengthening 
      cell cycles and the accumulation of transcription events in each cell. Temporal
      averaging might provide a general context in which to understand how embryos deal
      with stochastic transcription.

      starvation.
PG  - 1655-1665
LID - 10.1101/gad.305441.117 [doi]
AB  - Starvation induces liver autophagy, which is thought to provide nutrients for use
      by other organs and thereby maintain whole-body homeostasis. Here we demonstrate 
      that O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) is required
      for glucagon-stimulated liver autophagy and metabolic adaptation to starvation.
      Genetic ablation of OGT in mouse livers reduces autophagic flux and the
      production of glucose and ketone bodies. Upon glucagon-induced calcium signaling,
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates OGT, which in turn
      promotes O-GlcNAc modification and activation of Ulk proteins by potentiating
      AMPK-dependent phosphorylation. These findings uncover a signaling cascade by
      which starvation promotes autophagy through OGT phosphorylation and establish the
      importance of O-GlcNAc signaling in coupling liver autophagy to nutrient
      homeostasis.

TI  - Hfq links translation repression to stress-induced mutagenesis in E. coli.
LID - 10.1101/gad.302547.117 [doi]
AB  - Mismatch repair (MMR) is a conserved mechanism exploited by cells to correct DNA 
      replication errors both in growing cells and under nongrowing conditions. Hfq
      (host factor for RNA bacteriophage Qbeta replication), a bacterial Lsm family
      RNA-binding protein, chaperones RNA-RNA interactions between regulatory small
      RNAs (sRNAs) and target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to alterations of mRNA
      translation and/or stability. Hfq has been reported to post-transcriptionally
      repress the DNA MMR gene mutS in stationary phase, possibly limiting MMR to allow
      increased mutagenesis. Here we report that Hfq deploys dual mechanisms to control
      mutS expression. First, Hfq binds directly to an (AAN)3 motif within the mutS 5' 
      untranslated region (UTR), repressing translation in the absence of sRNA partners
      both in vivo and in vitro. Second, Hfq acts in a canonical pathway, promoting
      base-pairing of ArcZ sRNA with the mutS leader to inhibit translation. Most
      importantly, using pathway-specific mutS chromosomal alleles that specifically
      abrogate either regulatory pathway or both, we demonstrate that tight control of 
      MutS levels in stationary phase contributes to stress-induced mutagenesis. By
      interacting with the mutS leader, Hfq serves as a critical switch that modulates 
      bacteria from high-fidelity DNA replication to stress-induced mutagenesis.

TI  - Id genes are essential for early heart formation.
LID - 10.1101/gad.300400.117 [doi]
AB  - Deciphering the fundamental mechanisms controlling cardiac specification is
      critical for our understanding of how heart formation is initiated during
      embryonic development and for applying stem cell biology to regenerative medicine
      and disease modeling. Using systematic and unbiased functional screening
      approaches, we discovered that the Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins is both
      necessary and sufficient to direct cardiac mesoderm formation in frog embryos and
      human embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, Id proteins specify cardiac cell
      fate by repressing two inhibitors of cardiogenic mesoderm formation-Tcf3 and
      Foxa2-and activating inducers Evx1, Grrp1, and Mesp1. Most importantly,
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of the entire Id (Id1-4) family in mouse embryos
      leads to failure of anterior cardiac progenitor specification and the development
      of heartless embryos. Thus, Id proteins play a central and evolutionarily
      conserved role during heart formation and provide a novel means to efficiently
      produce cardiovascular progenitors for regenerative medicine and drug discovery
      applications.

TI  - Post-transcriptional regulation of mouse neurogenesis by Pumilio proteins.
LID - 10.1101/gad.298752.117 [doi]
AB  - Despite extensive studies on mammalian neurogenesis, its post-transcriptional
      regulation remains under-explored. Here we report that neural-specific
      inactivation of two murine post-transcriptional regulators, Pumilio 1 (Pum1) and 
      Pum2, severely reduced the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the postnatal
      dentate gyrus (DG), drastically increased perinatal apoptosis, altered DG cell
      composition, and impaired learning and memory. Consistently, the mutant DG
      neurospheres generated fewer NSCs with defects in proliferation, survival, and
      differentiation, supporting a major role of Pum1 and Pum2 in hippocampal
      neurogenesis and function. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation revealed that Pum1
      and Pum2 bind to thousands of mRNAs, with at least 694 common targets in multiple
      neurogenic pathways. Depleting Pum1 and/or Pum2 did not change the abundance of
      most target mRNAs but up-regulated their proteins, indicating that Pum1 and Pum2 
      regulate the translation of their target mRNAs. Moreover, Pum1 and Pum2 display
      RNA-dependent interaction with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and
      bind to one another's mRNA. This indicates that Pum proteins might form
      collaborative networks with FMRP and possibly other post-transcriptional
      regulators to regulate neurogenesis.

TI  - Lung tumors with distinct p53 mutations respond similarly to p53 targeted therapy
      but exhibit genotype-specific statin sensitivity.
LID - 10.1101/gad.298463.117 [doi]
AB  - Lung adenocarcinoma accounts for approximately 40% of lung cancers, the leading
      cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and current therapies provide only
      limited survival benefit. Approximately half of lung adenocarcinomas harbor
      mutations in TP53 (p53), making these mutants appealing targets for lung cancer
      therapy. As mutant p53 remains untargetable, mutant p53-dependent phenotypes
      represent alternative targeting opportunities, but the prevalence and therapeutic
      relevance of such effects (gain of function and dominant-negative activity) in
      lung adenocarcinoma are unclear. Through transcriptional and functional analysis 
      of murine Kras(G12D) -p53(null) , -p53(R172H) (conformational), and -p53(R270H)
      (contact) mutant lung tumors, we identified genotype-independent and
      genotype-dependent therapeutic sensitivities. Unexpectedly, we found that
      wild-type p53 exerts a dominant tumor-suppressive effect on mutant tumors, as all
      genotypes were similarly sensitive to its restoration in vivo. These data show
      that the potential of p53 targeted therapies is comparable across all
      p53-deficient genotypes and may explain the high incidence of p53 loss of
      heterozygosity in mutant tumors. In contrast, mutant p53 gain of function and
      their associated vulnerabilities can vary according to mutation type. Notably, we
      identified a p53(R270H) -specific sensitivity to simvastatin in lung tumors, and 
      the transcriptional signature that underlies this sensitivity was also present in
      human lung tumors, indicating that this therapeutic approach may be clinically
      relevant.

TI  - SIRT7 and the DEAD-box helicase DDX21 cooperate to resolve genomic R loops and
      safeguard genome stability.
LID - 10.1101/gad.300624.117 [doi]
AB  - R loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of an RNA:DNA
      heteroduplex and a "looped-out" nontemplate strand. As aberrant formation and
      persistence of R loops block transcription elongation and cause DNA damage,
      mechanisms that resolve R loops are essential for genome stability. Here we show 
      that the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase DDX21 efficiently unwinds R
      loops and that depletion of DDX21 leads to accumulation of cellular R loops and
      DNA damage. Significantly, the activity of DDX21 is regulated by acetylation.
      Acetylation by CBP inhibits DDX21 activity, while deacetylation by SIRT7 augments
      helicase activity and overcomes R-loop-mediated stalling of RNA polymerases.
      Knockdown of SIRT7 leads to the same phenotype as depletion of DDX21 (i.e.,
      increased formation of R loops and DNA double-strand breaks), indicating that
      SIRT7 and DDX21 cooperate to prevent R-loop accumulation, thus safeguarding
      genome integrity. Moreover, DDX21 resolves estrogen-induced R loops on
      estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells, which prevents the blocking of 
      transcription elongation on these genes.

TI  - DACH1 stimulates shear stress-guided endothelial cell migration and coronary
      artery growth through the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis.
LID - 10.1101/gad.301549.117 [doi]
AB  - Sufficient blood flow to tissues relies on arterial blood vessels, but the
      mechanisms regulating their development are poorly understood. Many arteries,
      including coronary arteries of the heart, form through remodeling of an immature 
      vascular plexus in a process triggered and shaped by blood flow. However, little 
      is known about how cues from fluid shear stress are translated into responses
      that pattern artery development. Here, we show that mice lacking endothelial
      Dach1 had small coronary arteries, decreased endothelial cell polarization, and
      reduced expression of the chemokine Cxcl12 Under shear stress in culture, Dach1
      overexpression stimulated endothelial cell polarization and migration against
      flow, which was reversed upon CXCL12/CXCR4 inhibition. In vivo, DACH1 was
      expressed during early arteriogenesis but was down in mature arteries. Mature
      artery-type shear stress (high, uniform laminar) specifically down-regulated
      DACH1, while the remodeling artery-type flow (low, variable) maintained DACH1
      expression. Together, our data support a model in which DACH1 stimulates coronary
      artery growth by activating Cxcl12 expression and endothelial cell migration
      against blood flow into developing arteries. This activity is suppressed once
      arteries reach a mature morphology and acquire high, laminar flow that
      down-regulates DACH1. Thus, we identified a mechanism by which blood flow quality
      balances artery growth and maturation.

PG  - 1509-1528

AB  - Neurodegeneration is a leading cause of death in the developed world and a
      natural, albeit unfortunate, consequence of longer-lived populations. Despite
      great demand for therapeutic intervention, it is often the case that these
      diseases are insufficiently understood at the basic molecular level. What little 
      is known has prompted much hopeful speculation about a generalized mechanistic
      thread that ties these disparate conditions together at the subcellular level and
      can be exploited for broad curative benefit. In this review, we discuss a
      prominent theory supported by genetic and pathological changes in an array of
      neurodegenerative diseases: that neurons are particularly vulnerable to
      disruption of RNA-binding protein dosage and dynamics. Here we synthesize the
      progress made at the clinical, genetic, and biophysical levels and conclude that 
      this perspective offers the most parsimonious explanation for these mysterious
      diseases. Where appropriate, we highlight the reciprocal benefits of
      cross-disciplinary collaboration between disease specialists and RNA biologists
      as we envision a future in which neurodegeneration declines and our understanding
      of the broad importance of RNA processing deepens.

TI  - Progressive polarity loss and luminal collapse disrupt tissue organization in
      carcinoma.
PG  - 1573-1587
LID - 10.1101/gad.300566.117 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial cancers (carcinoma) account for 80%-90% of all cancers. The
      development of carcinoma is associated with disrupted epithelial organization and
      solid ductal structures. The mechanisms underlying the morphological development 
      of carcinoma are poorly understood, but it is thought that loss of cell polarity 
      is an early event. Here we report the characterization of the development of
      human breast lesions leading to carcinoma. We identified a unique mechanism that 
      generates solid ducts in carcinoma through progressive loss of polarity and
      collapse of the luminal architecture. This program initiates with asymmetric
      divisions of polarized cells that generate a stratified epithelium containing
      both polarized and depolarized cells. Stratified regions form cords that
      penetrate into the lumen, subdividing it into polarized secondary lumina. The
      secondary lumina then collapse with a concomitant decrease in RhoA and myosin II 
      activity at the apical membrane and ultimately lose apical-basal polarity. By
      restoring RhoA activity in mice, ducts maintained lumen and cell polarity.
      Notably, disrupted tissue architecture through luminal collapse was reversible,
      and ducts with a lumen were re-established after oncogene suppression in vivo.
      This reveals a novel and common mechanism that contributes to carcinoma
      development by progressively disrupting cell and tissue organization.

TI  - Dynamic assembly and activation of estrogen receptor alpha enhancers through
      coregulator switching.
PG  - 1535-1548
LID - 10.1101/gad.302182.117 [doi]
AB  - Although many features of active transcriptional enhancers have been defined by
      genomic assays, we lack a clear understanding of the order of events leading to
      enhancer formation and activation as well as the dynamics of coregulator
      interactions within the enhancer complex. Here, we used selective loss- or
      gain-of-function mutants of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) to define two
      distinct phases of ligand-dependent enhancer formation. In the first phase (0-20 
      min), p300 is recruited to ERalpha by Mediator as well as p300's
      acetylhistone-binding bromodomain to promote initial enhancer formation, which is
      not competent for sustained activation. In the second phase (20-45 min), p300 is 
      recruited to ERalpha by steroid receptor coregulators (SRCs) for enhancer
      maturation and maintenance. Successful transition between these two phases
      ("coregulator switching") is required for proper enhancer function. Failure to
      recruit p300 during either phase leads to abortive enhancer formation and a lack 
      of target gene expression. Our results reveal an ordered and cooperative assembly
      of ERalpha enhancers requiring functional interplay among p300, Mediator, and
      SRCs, which has implications for hormone-dependent gene regulation in breast
      cancers. More broadly, our results demonstrate the unexpectedly dynamic nature of
      coregulator interactions within enhancer complexes, which are likely to be a
      defining feature of all enhancers.

TI  - Enzymatic modules of the SAGA chromatin-modifying complex play distinct roles in 
      Drosophila gene expression and development.
PG  - 1588-1600
LID - 10.1101/gad.300988.117 [doi]
AB  - The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) chromatin-modifying complex is a
      transcriptional coactivator that contains four different modules of subunits. The
      intact SAGA complex has been well characterized for its function in transcription
      regulation and development. However, little is known about the roles of
      individual modules within SAGA and whether they have any SAGA-independent
      functions. Here we demonstrate that the two enzymatic modules of Drosophila SAGA 
      are differently required in oogenesis. Loss of the histone acetyltransferase
      (HAT) activity blocks oogenesis, while loss of the H2B deubiquitinase (DUB)
      activity does not. However, the DUB module regulates a subset of genes in early
      embryogenesis, and loss of the DUB subunits causes defects in embryogenesis.
      ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput
      sequencing) analysis revealed that both the DUB and HAT modules bind most SAGA
      target genes even though many of these targets do not require the DUB module for 
      expression. Furthermore, we found that the DUB module can bind to chromatin and
      regulate transcription independently of the HAT module. Our results suggest that 
      the DUB module has functions within SAGA and independent functions.

TI  - Mutation of Arabidopsis SMC4 identifies condensin as a corepressor of
      pericentromeric transposons and conditionally expressed genes.
PG  - 1601-1614
LID - 10.1101/gad.301499.117 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, transcriptionally inactive loci are enriched within highly
      condensed heterochromatin. In plants, as in mammals, the DNA of heterochromatin
      is densely methylated and wrapped by histones displaying a characteristic subset 
      of post-translational modifications. Growing evidence indicates that these
      chromatin modifications are not sufficient for silencing. Instead, they are
      prerequisites for further assembly of higher-order chromatin structures that are 
      refractory to transcription but not fully understood. We show that silencing of
      transposons in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of Arabidopsis thaliana
      requires SMC4, a core subunit of condensins I and II, acting in conjunction with 
      CG methylation by MET1 (DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1), CHG methylation by CMT3
      (CHROMOMETHYLASE 3), the chromatin remodeler DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION
      1), and histone modifications, including histone H3 Lys 27 monomethylation
      (H3K27me1), imparted by ATXR5 and ATXR6. SMC4/condensin also acts within the
      mostly euchromatic chromosome arms to suppress conditionally expressed genes
      involved in flowering or DNA repair, including the DNA glycosylase ROS1, which
      facilitates DNA demethylation. Collectively, our genome-wide analyses implicate
      condensin in the suppression of hundreds of loci, acting in both DNA
      methylation-dependent and methylation-independent pathways.

AB  - Autophagy is a ubiquitous catabolic process that causes cellular bulk degradation
      of cytoplasmic components and is generally associated with positive effects on
      health and longevity. Inactivation of autophagy has been linked with detrimental 
      effects on cells and organisms. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory postulates
      that some fitness-promoting genes during youth are harmful during aging. On this 
      basis, we examined genes mediating post-reproductive longevity using an RNAi
      screen. From this screen, we identified 30 novel regulators of post-reproductive 
      longevity, including pha-4 Through downstream analysis of pha-4, we identified
      that the inactivation of genes governing the early stages of autophagy up until
      the stage of vesicle nucleation, such as bec-1, strongly extend both life span
      and health span. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the improvements in
      health and longevity are mediated through the neurons, resulting in reduced
      neurodegeneration and sarcopenia. We propose that autophagy switches from
      advantageous to harmful in the context of an age-associated dysfunction.

PG  - 1529-1534
LID - 10.1101/gad.302570.117 [doi]
AB  - Senescent cell accumulation in aging tissues is linked to age-associated diseases
      and declining function, prompting efforts to eliminate them. Mass spectrometry
      analysis revealed that DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) was selectively expressed on
      the surface of senescent, but not proliferating, human diploid fibroblasts.
      Importantly, the differential presence of DPP4 allowed flow cytometry-mediated
      isolation of senescent cells using anti-DPP4 antibodies. Moreover,
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays revealed that the
      cell surface DPP4 preferentially sensitized senescent, but not dividing,
      fibroblasts to cytotoxicity by natural killer cells. In sum, the selective
      expression of DPP4 on the surface of senescent cells enables their preferential
      elimination.

TI  - Dissection of the molecular circuitry controlling virulence in Francisella
      tularensis.
PG  - 1549-1560
LID - 10.1101/gad.303701.117 [doi]
AB  - Francisella tularensis, the etiological agent of tularemia, is one of the most
      infectious bacteria known. Because of its extreme pathogenicity, F. tularensis is
      classified as a category A bioweapon by the US government. F. tularensis
      virulence stems from genes encoded on the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI).
      An unusual set of Francisella regulators-the heteromeric macrophage growth locus 
      protein A (MglA)-stringent starvation protein A (SspA) complex and the
      DNA-binding protein pathogenicity island gene regulator (PigR)-activates FPI
      transcription and thus is essential for virulence. Intriguingly, the second
      messenger, guanosine-tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which is produced during infection, 
      is also involved in coordinating Francisella virulence; however, its role has
      been unclear. Here we identify MglA-SspA as a novel ppGpp-binding complex and
      describe structures of apo- and ppGpp-bound MglA-SspA. We demonstrate that
      MglA-SspA, which binds RNA polymerase (RNAP), also interacts with the C-terminal 
      domain of PigR, thus anchoring the (MglA-SspA)-RNAP complex to the FPI promoter. 
      Furthermore, we show that MglA-SspA must be bound to ppGpp to mediate
      high-affinity interactions with PigR. Thus, these studies unveil a novel pathway 
      different from those described previously for regulation of transcription by
      ppGpp. The data also indicate that F. tularensis pathogenesis is controlled by a 
      highly interconnected molecular circuitry in which the virulence machinery
      directly senses infection via a small molecule stress signal.

TI  - Ferredoxin reductase is critical for p53-dependent tumor suppression via iron
      regulatory protein 2.
LID - 10.1101/gad.299388.117 [doi]
AB  - Ferredoxin reductase (FDXR), a target of p53, modulates p53-dependent apoptosis
      and is necessary for steroidogenesis and biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. To
      determine the biological function of FDXR, we generated a Fdxr-deficient mouse
      model and found that loss of Fdxr led to embryonic lethality potentially due to
      iron overload in developing embryos. Interestingly, mice heterozygous in Fdxr had
      a short life span and were prone to spontaneous tumors and liver abnormalities,
      including steatosis, hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We also found that 
      FDXR was necessary for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and proper expression of
      several master regulators of iron metabolism, including iron regulatory protein 2
      (IRP2). Surprisingly, we found that p53 mRNA translation was suppressed by FDXR
      deficiency via IRP2. Moreover, we found that the signal from FDXR to iron
      homeostasis and the p53 pathway was transduced by ferredoxin 2, a substrate of
      FDXR. Finally, we found that p53 played a role in iron homeostasis and was
      required for FDXR-mediated iron metabolism. Together, we conclude that FDXR and
      p53 are mutually regulated and that the FDXR-p53 loop is critical for tumor
      suppression via iron homeostasis.

TI  - The hepatic circadian clock fine-tunes the lipogenic response to feeding through 
      RORalpha/gamma.
LID - 10.1101/gad.302323.117 [doi]
AB  - Liver lipid metabolism is under intricate temporal control by both the circadian 
      clock and feeding. The interplay between these two mechanisms is not clear. Here 
      we show that liver-specific depletion of nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma,
      key components of the molecular circadian clock, up-regulate expression of
      lipogenic genes only under fed conditions at Zeitgeber time 22 (ZT22) but not
      under fasting conditions at ZT22 or ad libitum conditions at ZT10. RORalpha/gamma
      controls circadian expression of Insig2, which keeps feeding-induced SREBP1c
      activation under check. Loss of RORalpha/gamma causes overactivation of the
      SREBP-dependent lipogenic response to feeding, exacerbating diet-induced hepatic 
      steatosis. These findings thus establish ROR/INSIG2/SREBP as a molecular pathway 
      by which circadian clock components anticipatorily regulate lipogenic responses
      to feeding. This highlights the importance of time of day as a consideration in
      the treatment of liver metabolic disorders.

TI  - Ectopic application of the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 establishes
      post-zygotic reproductive isolation in Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 10.1101/gad.299347.117 [doi]
AB  - Hybrid seed lethality as a consequence of interspecies or interploidy
      hybridizations is a major mechanism of reproductive isolation in plants. This
      mechanism is manifested in the endosperm, a dosage-sensitive tissue supporting
      embryo growth. Deregulated expression of imprinted genes such as ADMETOS (ADM)
      underpin the interploidy hybridization barrier in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, 
      the mechanisms of their action remained unknown. In this study, we show that ADM 
      interacts with the AT hook domain protein AHL10 and the SET domain-containing
      SU(VAR)3-9 homolog SUVH9 and ectopically recruits the heterochromatic mark
      H3K9me2 to AT-rich transposable elements (TEs), causing deregulated expression of
      neighboring genes. Several hybrid incompatibility genes identified in Drosophila 
      encode for dosage-sensitive heterochromatin-interacting proteins, which has led
      to the suggestion that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as a consequence of
      interspecies divergence of selfish DNA elements and their regulation. Our data
      show that imbalance of dosage-sensitive chromatin regulators underpins the
      barrier to interploidy hybridization in Arabidopsis, suggesting that reproductive
      isolation as a consequence of epigenetic regulation of TEs is a conserved feature
      in animals and plants.

TI  - An Mtr4/ZFC3H1 complex facilitates turnover of unstable nuclear RNAs to prevent
      their cytoplasmic transport and global translational repression.
LID - 10.1101/gad.302604.117 [doi]
AB  - Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are unstable and rapidly degraded in the
      nucleus by the nuclear exosome. An exosome adaptor complex called NEXT (nuclear
      exosome targeting) functions to facilitate turnover of some of these lncRNAs.
      Here we show that knockdown of one NEXT subunit, Mtr4, but neither of the other
      two subunits, resulted in accumulation of two types of lncRNAs: prematurely
      terminated RNAs (ptRNAs) and upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs). This suggested a
      NEXT-independent Mtr4 function, and, consistent with this, we isolated a distinct
      complex containing Mtr4 and the zinc finger protein ZFC3H1. Strikingly, knockdown
      of either protein not only increased pt/uaRNA levels but also led to their
      accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, all pt/uaRNAs examined associated
      with active ribosomes, but, paradoxically, this correlated with a global
      reduction in heavy polysomes and overall repression of translation. Our findings 
      highlight a critical role for Mtr4/ZFC3H1 in nuclear surveillance of naturally
      unstable lncRNAs to prevent their accumulation, transport to the cytoplasm, and
      resultant disruption of protein synthesis.

TI  - Glioblastoma cellular cross-talk converges on NF-kappaB to attenuate EGFR
      inhibitor sensitivity.
LID - 10.1101/gad.300079.117 [doi]
AB  - In glioblastoma (GBM), heterogeneous expression of amplified and mutated
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) presents a substantial challenge for the 
      effective use of EGFR-directed therapeutics. Here we demonstrate that
      heterogeneous expression of the wild-type receptor and its constitutively active 
      mutant form, EGFRvIII, limits sensitivity to these therapies through an
      interclonal communication mechanism mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine
      secreted from EGFRvIII-positive tumor cells. IL-6 activates a NF-kappaB signaling
      axis in a paracrine and autocrine manner, leading to bromodomain protein 4
      (BRD4)-dependent expression of the prosurvival protein survivin (BIRC5) and
      attenuation of sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). NF-kappaB
      and survivin are coordinately up-regulated in GBM patient tumors, and functional 
      inhibition of either protein or BRD4 in in vitro and in vivo models restores
      sensitivity to EGFR TKIs. These results provide a rationale for improving
      anti-EGFR therapeutic efficacy through pharmacological uncoupling of a
      convergence point of NF-kappaB-mediated survival that is leveraged by an
      interclonal circuitry mechanism established by intratumoral mutational
      heterogeneity.

TI  - Nuclear mTOR acts as a transcriptional integrator of the androgen signaling
      pathway in prostate cancer.
LID - 10.1101/gad.299958.117 [doi]
AB  - Androgen receptor (AR) signaling reprograms cellular metabolism to support
      prostate cancer (PCa) growth and survival. Another key regulator of cellular
      metabolism is mTOR, a kinase found in diverse protein complexes and cellular
      localizations, including the nucleus. However, whether nuclear mTOR plays a role 
      in PCa progression and participates in direct transcriptional cross-talk with the
      AR is unknown. Here, via the intersection of gene expression, genomic, and
      metabolic studies, we reveal the existence of a nuclear mTOR-AR transcriptional
      axis integral to the metabolic rewiring of PCa cells. Androgens reprogram
      mTOR-chromatin associations in an AR-dependent manner in which activation of
      mTOR-dependent metabolic gene networks is essential for androgen-induced aerobic 
      glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. In models of castration-resistant PCa
      cells, mTOR was capable of transcriptionally regulating metabolic gene programs
      in the absence of androgens, highlighting a potential novel castration resistance
      mechanism to sustain cell metabolism even without a functional AR. Remarkably, we
      demonstrate that increased mTOR nuclear localization is indicative of poor
      prognosis in patients, with the highest levels detected in castration-resistant
      PCa tumors and metastases. Identification of a functional mTOR targeted multigene
      signature robustly discriminates between normal prostate tissues, primary tumors,
      and hormone refractory metastatic samples but is also predictive of cancer
      recurrence. This study thus underscores a paradigm shift from AR to nuclear mTOR 
      as being the master transcriptional regulator of metabolism in PCa.

LID - 10.1101/gad.299172.117 [doi]
AB  - Protection of the stalled replication fork is crucial for responding to
      replication stress and minimizing its impact on chromosome instability, thus
      preventing diseases, including cancer. We found a new component, Abro1, in the
      protection of stalled replication fork integrity. Abro1 deficiency results in
      increased chromosome instability, and Abro1-null mice are tumor-prone. We show
      that Abro1 protects stalled replication fork stability by inhibiting DNA2
      nuclease/WRN helicase-mediated degradation of stalled forks. Depletion of RAD51
      prevents the DNA2/WRN-dependent degradation of stalled forks in Abro1-deficient
      cells. This mechanism is distinct from the BRCA2-dependent fork protection
      pathway, in which stable RAD51 filament formation prevents MRE11-dependent
      degradation of the newly synthesized DNA at stalled forks. Thus, our data reveal 
      a new aspect of regulated protection of stalled replication forks that involves
      Abro1.

AB  - Numerous environmental, physiological, and pathological insults disrupt
      protein-folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), referred to as ER 
      stress. Eukaryotic cells evolved a set of intracellular signaling pathways,
      collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), to maintain a productive
      ER protein-folding environment through reprogramming gene transcription and mRNA 
      translation. The UPR is largely dependent on transcription factors (TFs) that
      modulate expression of genes involved in many physiological and pathological
      conditions, including development, metabolism, inflammation, neurodegenerative
      diseases, and cancer. Here we summarize the current knowledge about these
      mechanisms, their impact on physiological/pathological processes, and potential
      therapeutic applications.

AB  - Collinear regulation of Hox genes in space and time has been an outstanding
      question ever since the initial work of Ed Lewis in 1978. Here we discuss recent 
      advances in our understanding of this phenomenon in relation to novel concepts
      associated with large-scale regulation and chromatin structure during the
      development of both axial and limb patterns. We further discuss how this
      sequential transcriptional activation marks embryonic stem cell-like axial
      progenitors in mammals and, consequently, how a temporal genetic system is
      further translated into spatial coordinates via the fate of these progenitors. In
      this context, we argue the benefit and necessity of implementing this unique
      mechanism as well as the difficulty in evolving an alternative strategy to
      deliver this critical positional information.

AB  - Transcription regulators bind to cis-regulatory sequences and thereby control the
      expression of target genes. While transcription regulators and the target genes
      that they regulate are often deeply conserved across species, the connections
      between the two change extensively over evolutionary timescales. In this review, 
      we discuss case studies where, despite this extensive evolutionary rewiring, the 
      resulting patterns of gene expression are preserved. We also discuss in silico
      models that reach the same general conclusions and provide additional insights
      into how this process occurs. Together, these approaches make a strong case that 
      the preservation of gene expression patterns in the wake of extensive rewiring is
      a general feature of transcription circuit evolution.

PG  - 1494-1508
LID - 10.1101/gad.300855.117 [doi]
AB  - The conserved histone locus body (HLB) assembles prior to zygotic gene activation
      early during development and concentrates factors into a nuclear domain of
      coordinated histone gene regulation. Although HLBs form specifically at
      replication-dependent histone loci, the cis and trans factors that target HLB
      components to histone genes remained unknown. Here we report that conserved GA
      repeat cis elements within the bidirectional histone3-histone4 promoter direct
      HLB formation in Drosophila In addition, the CLAMP (chromatin-linked adaptor for 
      male-specific lethal [MSL] proteins) zinc finger protein binds these GA repeat
      motifs, increases chromatin accessibility, enhances histone gene transcription,
      and promotes HLB formation. We demonstrated previously that CLAMP also promotes
      the formation of another domain of coordinated gene regulation: the
      dosage-compensated male X chromosome. Therefore, CLAMP binding to GA repeat
      motifs promotes the formation of two distinct domains of coordinated gene
      activation located at different places in the genome.

PG  - 1456-1468
LID - 10.1101/gad.300244.117 [doi]
AB  - CIC (also known as Capicua) is a transcriptional repressor negatively regulated
      by RAS/MAPK signaling. Whereas the functions of Cic have been well characterized 
      in Drosophila, little is known about its role in mammals. CIC is inactivated in a
      variety of human tumors and has been implicated recently in the promotion of lung
      metastases. Here, we describe a mouse model in which we inactivated Cic by
      selectively disabling its DNA-binding activity, a mutation that causes
      derepression of its target genes. Germline Cic inactivation causes perinatal
      lethality due to lung differentiation defects. However, its systemic inactivation
      in adult mice induces T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL), a tumor type
      known to carry CIC mutations, albeit with low incidence. Cic inactivation in mice
      induces T-ALL by a mechanism involving derepression of its well-known target,
      Etv4 Importantly, human T-ALL also relies on ETV4 expression for maintaining its 
      oncogenic phenotype. Moreover, Cic inactivation renders T-ALL insensitive to MEK 
      inhibitors in both mouse and human cell lines. Finally, we show that Ras-induced 
      mouse T-ALL as well as human T-ALL carrying mutations in the RAS/MAPK pathway
      display a genetic signature indicative of Cic inactivation. These observations
      illustrate that CIC inactivation plays a key role in this human malignancy.

PG  - 1483-1493
LID - 10.1101/gad.303537.117 [doi]
AB  - While microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the vast majority of protein-encoding
      transcripts, little is known about how miRNAs themselves are degraded. We
      recently described Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated 
      miRNA decay (TumiD) as a cellular pathway in which the nuclease TSN promotes the 
      decay of miRNAs that contain CA and/or UA dinucleotides. While TSN-mediated
      degradation of either protein-free or AGO2-loaded miRNAs does not require the
      ATP-dependent RNA helicase UPF1 in vitro, we report here that cellular TumiD
      requires UPF1. Results from experiments using AGO2-loaded miRNAs in duplex with
      target mRNAs indicate that UPF1 can dissociate miRNAs from their mRNA targets,
      making the miRNAs susceptible to TumiD. miR-seq (deep sequencing of miRNAs) data 
      reveal that the degradation of approximately 50% of candidate TumiD targets in
      T24 human urinary bladder cancer cells is augmented by UPF1. We illustrate the
      physiological relevance by demonstrating that UPF1-augmented TumiD promotes the
      invasion of T24 cells in part by degrading anti-invasive miRNAs so as to
      up-regulate the expression of proinvasive proteins.

      analysis.
PG  - 1439-1455
LID - 10.1101/gad.301937.117 [doi]
AB  - Secreted proteins play crucial roles in mediating tumor-stroma interactions
      during metastasis of cancer to different target organs. To comprehensively
      profile secreted proteins involved in lung metastasis, we applied quantitative
      mass spectrometry-based proteomics and identified 392 breast cancer-derived and
      302 melanoma-derived proteins secreted from highly lung metastatic cells. The
      cancer-specific lung metastasis secretome signatures (LMSSs) displayed
      significant prognostic value in multiple cancer clinical data sets. Moreover, we 
      observed a significant overlap of enriched pathways between the LMSSs of breast
      cancer and melanoma despite an overall small overlap of specific proteins,
      suggesting that common biological processes are executed by different proteins to
      enable the two cancer types to metastasize to the lung. Among the novel candidate
      lung metastasis proteins, Nidogen 1 (NID1) was confirmed to promote lung
      metastasis of breast cancer and melanoma, and its expression is correlated with
      poor clinical outcomes. In vitro functional analysis further revealed multiple
      prometastatic functions of NID1, including enhancing cancer cell migration and
      invasion, promoting adhesion to the endothelium and disrupting its integrity, and
      improving vascular tube formation capacity. As a secreted prometastatic protein, 
      NID1 may be developed as a new biomarker for disease progression and therapeutic 
      target in breast cancer and melanoma.

AB  - The final stages of female gamete maturation occur in the virtual absence of
      transcription, with gene expression driven by a program of selective unmasking,
      translation, and degradation of maternal mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the
      timing of Ccnb1 mRNA translation in mouse oocytes is dependent on the presence of
      transcripts with different 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). This 3' UTR
      heterogeneity directs distinct temporal patterns of translational activation or
      repression. Inclusion or exclusion of cis-acting elements is responsible for
      these divergent regulations. Our findings reveal an additional layer of
      translation control through alternative polyadenylation usage required to
      fine-tune the timing of meiosis progression.

AB  - The signals that direct the initiation of transcription ultimately converge at
      the core promoter, which is the gateway to transcription. Here we provide an
      overview of the RNA polymerase II core promoter in bilateria (bilaterally
      symmetric animals). The core promoter is diverse in terms of its composition and 
      function yet is also punctilious, as it acts with strict rules and precision. We 
      additionally describe an expanded view of the core promoter that comprises the
      classical DNA sequence motifs, sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription
      factors, chromatin signals, and DNA structure. This model may eventually lead to 
      a more unified conceptual understanding of the core promoter.

PG  - 1195-1201
LID - 10.1101/gad.298984.117 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic programs regulate the development and maintenance of organisms over a 
      lifetime. These programs are carried out through chemical modifications of DNA
      and proteins such as histones and transcription factors. These epigenetic
      modifications are less stable than genetic alterations and even reversible under 
      a variety of circumstances, such as developmental changes, regeneration of
      tissues, cell divisions, aging, and pathological conditions observed in many
      cancers. The p53 protein not only enforces the stability of the genome by the
      prevention of genetic alterations in cells but also plays a role in regulating
      the epigenetic changes that can occur in cells. The full-length p53 protein is
      largely inactive in stem cells but, when activated, helps to commit these cells
      to developmental lineages through a series of epigenetic changes. Just as p53
      impacts epigenetic change, the enzyme activities that carry out epigenetic
      protein modifications act on the p53 protein and its splice variants in stem and 
      progenitor cells to silence or activate its transcriptional activities. Thus,
      there is a great deal of cross-talk between the p53 protein and epigenetic
      programs. This review collects the diverse experimental evidence that leads to
      these conclusions. This in turn permits new ideas and directions for the
      treatment of cancers, reactivating developmental pathways for tissue regeneration
      and responses to the impact of aging.

AB  - Multiple DNA repair pathways maintain genome stability and ensure that DNA
      remains essentially unchanged over the life of a cell. Various human diseases
      occur if DNA repair is compromised, and most of these impact the nervous system, 
      in some cases exclusively. However, it is often unclear what specific endogenous 
      damage underpins disease pathology. Generally, the types of causative DNA damage 
      are associated with replication, transcription, or oxidative metabolism; other
      direct sources of endogenous lesions may arise from aberrant topoisomerase
      activity or ribonucleotide incorporation into DNA. This review focuses on the
      etiology of DNA damage in the nervous system and the genome stability pathways
      that prevent human neurologic disease.

AB  - Converging evidence from numerous laboratories has revealed that malignant brain 
      cancers are complex ecological systems composed of distinct cellular and
      acellular elements that collectively dictate glioblastoma biology. Our
      understanding of the individual contributions of each of these components is
      vital to the design of effective therapies against these cancers. In this issue
      of Genes & Development, Zanca and colleagues (pp. 1212-1227) demonstrate that one
      subpopulation of glioblastoma cells expressing a mutant epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFRvIII) is responsible for the survival of non-EGFRvIII-expressing
      tumor cells as well as for evading molecularly targeted therapy.

AB  - DNA replication results in the doubling of the genome prior to cell division.
      This process requires the assembly of 50 or more protein factors into a
      replication fork. Here, we review recent structural and biochemical insights that
      start to explain how specific proteins recognize DNA replication origins, load
      the replicative helicase on DNA, unwind DNA, synthesize new DNA strands, and
      reassemble chromatin. We focus on the minichromosome maintenance (MCM2-7)
      proteins, which form the core of the eukaryotic replication fork, as this complex
      undergoes major structural rearrangements in order to engage with DNA, regulate
      its DNA-unwinding activity, and maintain genome stability.

AB  - Development requires the expression of master regulatory genes necessary to
      specify a cell lineage. Equally significant is the stable and heritable silencing
      of master regulators that would specify alternative lineages. This regulated gene
      silencing is carried out by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which must be
      correctly recruited only to the subset of their target loci that requires
      lineage-specific silencing. A recent study by Erceg and colleagues (pp. 590-602) 
      expands on a key aspect of that targeting: The same DNA elements that recruit PcG
      complexes to a repressed locus also encode transcriptional enhancers that
      function in different lineages where that locus must be expressed. Thus, PcG
      targeting elements overlap with enhancers.

TI  - SPATA2 regulates the activation of RIPK1 by modulating linear ubiquitination.
PG  - 1162-1176
LID - 10.1101/gad.299776.117 [doi]
AB  - Stimulation of cells with TNFalpha leads to the formation of the TNF-R1 signaling
      complex (TNF-RSC) to mediate downstream cellular fate decision. Activation of the
      TNF-RSC is modulated by different types of ubiquitination and may lead to cell
      death, including apoptosis and necroptosis, in both RIPK1-dependent and
      RIPK1-independent manners. Spata2 (spermatogenesis-associated 2) is an adaptor
      protein recruited into the TNF-RSC to modulate the interaction between the linear
      ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and the deubiquitinase CYLD
      (cylindromatosis). However, the mechanism by which Spata2 regulates the
      activation of RIPK1 is unclear. Here, we report that Spata2-deficient cells show 
      resistance to RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis and are also partially
      protected against RIPK1-independent apoptosis. Spata2 deficiency promotes M1
      ubiquitination of RIPK1 to inhibit RIPK1 kinase activity. Furthermore, we provide
      biochemical evidence for the USP domain of CYLD and the PUB domain of the SPATA2 
      complex preferentially deubiquitinating the M1 ubiquitin chain in vitro. Spata2
      deficiency also promotes the activation of MKK4 and JNK and cytokine production
      independently of RIPK1 kinase activity. Spata2 deficiency sensitizes mice to
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) induced by TNFalpha, which can be 
      suppressed by RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s. Thus, Spata2 can regulate inflammatory
      response and cell death in both RIPK1-dependent and RIPK1-independent manners.

      forebrain and their differentiation into ependymal cells.

LID - 10.1101/gad.291773.116 [doi]
AB  - We and others showed previously that PR domain-containing 16 (Prdm16) is a
      transcriptional regulator required for stem cell function in multiple fetal and
      neonatal tissues, including the nervous system. However, Prdm16 germline knockout
      mice died neonatally, preventing us from testing whether Prdm16 is also required 
      for adult stem cell function. Here we demonstrate that Prdm16 is required for
      neural stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis in the adult lateral ventricle
      subventricular zone and dentate gyrus. We also discovered that Prdm16 is required
      for the formation of ciliated ependymal cells in the lateral ventricle.
      Conditional Prdm16 deletion during fetal development using Nestin-Cre prevented
      the formation of ependymal cells, disrupting cerebrospinal fluid flow and causing
      hydrocephalus. Postnatal Prdm16 deletion using Nestin-CreER(T2) did not cause
      hydrocephalus or prevent the formation of ciliated ependymal cells but caused
      defects in their differentiation. Prdm16 was required in neural stem/progenitor
      cells for the expression of Foxj1, a transcription factor that promotes ependymal
      cell differentiation. These studies show that Prdm16 is required for adult neural
      stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis as well as the formation of ependymal
      cells.

      fates.
PG  - 1089-1094
LID - 10.1101/gad.302067.117 [doi]
AB  - Mitotic duration is determined by activation of the anaphase-promoting
      complex/cyclosome (APC/C) bound to its coactivator, Cdc20. Kinetochores, the
      microtubule-interacting machines on chromosomes, restrain mitotic exit when not
      attached to spindle microtubules by generating a Cdc20-containing complex that
      inhibits the APC/C. Here, we show that flux of Cdc20 through kinetochores also
      accelerates mitotic exit by promoting its dephosphorylation by
      kinetochore-localized protein phosphatase 1, which allows Cdc20 to activate the
      APC/C. Both APC/C activation and inhibition depend on Cdc20 fluxing through the
      same binding site at kinetochores. The microtubule attachment status of
      kinetochores therefore optimizes mitotic duration by controlling the balance
      between opposing Cdc20 fates.

TI  - Neat1 is a p53-inducible lincRNA essential for transformation suppression.
PG  - 1095-1108
LID - 10.1101/gad.284661.116 [doi]
AB  - The p53 gene is mutated in over half of all cancers, reflecting its critical role
      as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that induces
      myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor
      suppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq 
      (RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the
      noncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of
      paraspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in
      different cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived
      from Neat1(-/-) mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53
      pathway. We found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
      in response to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in
      suppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency
      enhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the
      development of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and
      cystic lesions in Kras(G12D)-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes 
      in gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes
      neoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large
      intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and
      cancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor
      suppression.

TI  - GIGYF1/2 proteins use auxiliary sequences to selectively bind to 4EHP and repress
      target mRNA expression.
PG  - 1147-1161
LID - 10.1101/gad.299420.117 [doi]
AB  - The eIF4E homologous protein (4EHP) is thought to repress translation by
      competing with eIF4E for binding to the 5' cap structure of specific mRNAs to
      which it is recruited through interactions with various proteins, including the
      GRB10-interacting GYF (glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine domain) proteins 1 and 2
      (GIGYF1/2). Despite its similarity to eIF4E, 4EHP does not interact with eIF4G
      and therefore fails to initiate translation. In contrast to eIF4G, GIGYF1/2 bind 
      selectively to 4EHP but not eIF4E. Here, we present crystal structures of the
      4EHP-binding regions of GIGYF1 and GIGYF2 in complex with 4EHP, which reveal the 
      molecular basis for the selectivity of the GIGYF1/2 proteins for 4EHP.
      Complementation assays in a GIGYF1/2-null cell line using structure-based mutants
      indicate that 4EHP requires interactions with GIGYF1/2 to down-regulate target
      mRNA expression. Our studies provide structural insights into the assembly of
      4EHP-GIGYF1/2 repressor complexes and reveal that rather than merely facilitating
      4EHP recruitment to transcripts, GIGYF1/2 proteins are required for repressive
      activity.

TI  - Disrupted prenatal RNA processing and myogenesis in congenital myotonic
      dystrophy.
PG  - 1122-1133
LID - 10.1101/gad.300590.117 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a CTG microsatellite expansion (CTG(exp))
      disorder caused by expression of CUG(exp) RNAs. These mutant RNAs alter the
      activities of RNA processing factors, including MBNL proteins, leading to
      re-expression of fetal isoforms in adult tissues and DM1 pathology. While this
      pathogenesis model accounts for adult-onset disease, the molecular basis of
      congenital DM (CDM) is unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that disruption of
      developmentally regulated RNA alternative processing pathways contributes to CDM 
      disease. We identify prominent alternative splicing and polyadenylation
      abnormalities in infant CDM muscle, and, although most are also misregulated in
      adult-onset DM1, dysregulation is significantly more severe in CDM. Furthermore, 
      analysis of alternative splicing during human myogenesis reveals that
      CDM-relevant exons undergo prenatal RNA isoform transitions and are predicted to 
      be disrupted by CUG(exp)-associated mechanisms in utero. To test this possibility
      and the contribution of MBNLs to CDM pathogenesis, we generated mouse Mbnl double
      (Mbnl1; Mbnl2) and triple (Mbnl1; Mbnl2; Mbnl3) muscle-specific knockout models
      that recapitulate the congenital myopathy, gene expression, and spliceopathy
      defects characteristic of CDM. This study demonstrates that RNA misprocessing is 
      a major pathogenic factor in CDM and provides novel mouse models to further
      examine roles for cotranscriptional/post-transcriptional gene regulation during
      development.

TI  - PRKCI promotes immune suppression in ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1109-1121
LID - 10.1101/gad.296640.117 [doi]
AB  - A key feature of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is frequent
      amplification of the 3q26 locus harboring PRKC-iota (PRKCI). Here, we show that
      PRKCI is also expressed in early fallopian tube lesions, called serous tubal
      intraepithelial carcinoma. Transgenic mouse studies establish PRKCI as an ovarian
      cancer-specific oncogene. Mechanistically, we show that the oncogenic activity of
      PRKCI relates in part to the up-regulation of TNFalpha to promote an
      immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by an abundance of
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells and inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell infiltration.
      Furthermore, system-level and functional analyses identify YAP1 as a downstream
      effector in tumor progression. In human ovarian cancers, high PRKCI expression
      also correlates with high expression of TNFalpha and YAP1 and low infiltration of
      cytotoxic T cells. The PRKCI-YAP1 regulation of the tumor immunity provides a
      therapeutic strategy for highly lethal ovarian cancer.

AB  - Proper function of the neural network results from the precise connections
      between axons and dendrites of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons,
      respectively. In the Drosophila olfactory system, the dendrites of projection
      neurons (PNs) stereotypically target one of approximately 50 glomeruli in the
      antennal lobe (AL), the primary olfactory center in the brain, and form synapses 
      with the axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Here, we show that Eph and
      Ephrin, the well-known axon guidance molecules, instruct the dendrodendritic
      segregation during the discrete olfactory map formation. The Eph receptor
      tyrosine kinase is highly expressed and localized in the glomeruli related to
      reproductive behavior in the developing AL. In one of the pheromone-sensing
      glomeruli (DA1), the Eph cell-autonomously regulates its dendrites to reside in a
      single glomerulus by interacting with Ephrins expressed in adjacent PN dendrites.
      Our data demonstrate that the trans interaction between dendritic Eph and Ephrin 
      is essential for the PN dendritic boundary formation in the DA1 olfactory
      circuit, potentially enabling strict segregation of odor detection between
      pheromones and the other odors.

      KIF1Bbeta-mediated transport of TRKA.
PG  - 1036-1053
LID - 10.1101/gad.297077.117 [doi]
AB  - We recently identified pathogenic KIF1Bbeta mutations in sympathetic nervous
      system malignancies that are defective in developmental apoptosis. Here we
      deleted KIF1Bbeta in the mouse sympathetic nervous system and observed impaired
      sympathetic nervous function and misexpression of genes required for
      sympathoadrenal lineage differentiation. We discovered that KIF1Bbeta is required
      for nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent neuronal differentiation through
      anterograde transport of the NGF receptor TRKA. Moreover, pathogenic KIF1Bbeta
      mutations identified in neuroblastoma impair TRKA transport. Expression of
      neuronal differentiation markers is ablated in both KIF1Bbeta-deficient mouse
      neuroblasts and human neuroblastomas that lack KIF1Bbeta. Transcriptomic analyses
      show that unfavorable neuroblastomas resemble mouse sympathetic neuroblasts
      lacking KIF1Bbeta independent of MYCN amplification and the loss of genes
      neighboring KIF1B on chromosome 1p36. Thus, defective precursor cell
      differentiation, a common trait of aggressive childhood malignancies, is a
      pathogenic effect of KIF1Bbeta loss in neuroblastomas. Furthermore,
      neuropathy-associated KIF1Bbeta mutations impede cargo transport, providing a
      direct link between neuroblastomas and neurodegeneration.

TI  - m(6)A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required
      for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover.
PG  - 990-1006
LID - 10.1101/gad.301036.117 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the biologic role of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modifications
      in mRNA requires an understanding of when and where in the life of a pre-mRNA
      transcript the modifications are made. We found that HeLa cell
      chromatin-associated nascent pre-mRNA (CA-RNA) contains many unspliced introns
      and m(6)A in exons but very rarely in introns. The m(6)A methylation is
      essentially completed upon the release of mRNA into the nucleoplasm. Furthermore,
      the content and location of each m(6)A modification in steady-state cytoplasmic
      mRNA are largely indistinguishable from those in the newly synthesized CA-RNA or 
      nucleoplasmic mRNA. This result suggests that quantitatively little methylation
      or demethylation occurs in cytoplasmic mRNA. In addition, only approximately 10% 
      of m(6)As in CA-RNA are within 50 nucleotides of 5' or 3' splice sites, and the
      vast majority of exons harboring m(6)A in wild-type mouse stem cells is spliced
      the same in cells lacking the major m(6)A methyltransferase Mettl3. Both HeLa and
      mouse embryonic stem cell mRNAs harboring m(6)As have shorter half-lives, and
      thousands of these mRNAs have increased half-lives (twofold or more) in Mettl3
      knockout cells compared with wild type. In summary, m(6)A is added to exons
      before or soon after exon definition in nascent pre-mRNA, and while m(6)A is not 
      required for most splicing, its addition in the nascent transcript is a
      determinant of cytoplasmic mRNA stability.

AB  - Post-transcriptional modification of RNA nucleosides has been implicated as a
      pivotal regulator of mRNA biology. In this issue of Genes & Development, Ke and
      colleagues (pp. 990-1006) provide insights into the temporal and spatial
      distribution of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in RNA transcripts by analyzing
      different subcellular fractions. Using a recently developed biochemical approach 
      for detecting m(6)A, the researchers show that m(6)A methylations are enriched in
      exons and are added to transcripts prior to splicing. Although m(6)A addition is 
      widely thought to be readily reversible, they demonstrate in HeLa cells that once
      RNA is released from chromatin, the modifications are surprisingly static. This
      study integrates data from previous publications to clarify conflicting
      conclusions regarding the role of m(6)A in mRNA biogenesis and function. Ke and
      colleagues found that m(6)A methylation levels negatively correlate with
      transcript half-life but are not required for most pre-mRNA splicing events.

AB  - Long understood as a bona fide tumor suppressor that safeguards the integrity of 
      the genome via regulating numerous cellular outcomes, p53 may also exert its
      decisive and versatile functions by controlling DNA methylation. In this issue of
      Genes & Development, Tovy and colleagues (pp. 959-972) report that, in naive
      mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), p53 controls DNA methylation homeostasis by
      regulating the expression of key counteracting components of the DNA methylation 
      machinery. Their findings indicate that p53 may exert its "guardian of genome"
      duties at least in part via safeguarding the epigenome of ESCs.

TI  - USP25 regulates Wnt signaling by controlling the stability of tankyrases.
PG  - 1024-1035
LID - 10.1101/gad.300889.117 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in human
      cancer development. Wnt signaling is negatively regulated by Axin, a scaffolding 
      protein that controls a rate-limiting step in the destruction of beta-catenin,
      the central activator of the Wnt pathway. In Wnt-stimulated cells, Axin is
      rapidly modified by tankyrase-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which promotes the
      proteolysis of Axin and consequent stabilization of beta-catenin. Thus,
      regulation of the levels and activity of tankyrases is mechanistically important 
      in controlling Wnt signaling. Here, we identify ubiquitin-specific protease 25
      (USP25) as a positive regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We found that
      USP25 directly interacted with tankyrases to promote their deubiquitination and
      stabilization. We demonstrated that USP25 deficiency could promote the
      degradation of tankyrases and consequent stabilization of Axin to antagonize Wnt 
      signaling. We further characterized the interaction between TNKS1 and USP25 by
      X-ray crystal structure determination. Our results provide important new insights
      into the molecular mechanism that regulates the turnover of tankyrases and the
      possibility of targeting the stability of tankyrases by antagonizing their
      interaction with USP25 to modulate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

TI  - CBL family E3 ubiquitin ligases control JAK2 ubiquitination and stability in
      hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid malignancies.
PG  - 1007-1023
LID - 10.1101/gad.297135.117 [doi]
AB  - Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a central kinase in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells 
      (HSPCs), and its uncontrolled activation is a prominent oncogenic driver of
      hematopoietic neoplasms. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation 
      of JAK2 have remained elusive. Here we report that the Casitas B-cell lymphoma
      (CBL) family E3 ubiquitin ligases down-regulate JAK2 stability and signaling via 
      the adaptor protein LNK/SH2B3. We demonstrated that depletion of CBL/CBL-B or LNK
      abrogated JAK2 ubiquitination, extended JAK2 half-life, and enhanced JAK2
      signaling and cell growth in human cell lines as well as primary murine HSPCs.
      Built on these findings, we showed that JAK inhibitor (JAKi) significantly
      reduced aberrant HSPCs and mitigated leukemia development in a mouse model of
      aggressive myeloid leukemia driven by loss of Cbl and Cbl-b Importantly, primary 
      human CBL mutated (CBL(mut) ) leukemias exhibited increased JAK2 protein levels
      and signaling and were hypersensitive to JAKi. Loss-of-function mutations in CBL 
      E3 ubiquitin ligases are found in a wide range of myeloid malignancies, which are
      diseases without effective treatment options. Hence, our studies reveal a novel
      signaling axis that regulates JAK2 in normal and malignant HSPCs and suggest new 
      therapeutic strategies for treating CBL(mut) myeloid malignancies.

AB  - DNA methylation is a key regulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology,
      dynamically changing between naive, primed, and differentiated states. The p53
      tumor suppressor is a pivotal guardian of genomic stability, but its
      contributions to epigenetic regulation and stem cell biology are less explored.
      We report that, in naive mouse ESCs (mESCs), p53 restricts the expression of the 
      de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b while up-regulating Tet1 and
      Tet2, which promote DNA demethylation. The DNA methylation imbalance in
      p53-deficient (p53(-/-)) mESCs is the result of augmented overall DNA methylation
      as well as increased methylation landscape heterogeneity. In differentiating
      p53(-/-) mESCs, elevated methylation persists, albeit more mildly. Importantly,
      concomitant with DNA methylation heterogeneity, p53(-/-) mESCs display increased 
      cellular heterogeneity both in the "naive" state and upon induced
      differentiation. This impact of p53 loss on 5-methylcytosine (5mC) heterogeneity 
      was also evident in human ESCs and mouse embryos in vivo. Hence, p53 helps
      maintain DNA methylation homeostasis and clonal homogeneity, a function that may 
      contribute to its tumor suppressor activity.

TI  - PHF6 regulates phenotypic plasticity through chromatin organization within
      lineage-specific genes.
PG  - 973-989
LID - 10.1101/gad.295857.117 [doi]
AB  - Developmental and lineage plasticity have been observed in numerous malignancies 
      and have been correlated with tumor progression and drug resistance. However,
      little is known about the molecular mechanisms that enable such plasticity to
      occur. Here, we describe the function of the plant homeodomain finger protein 6
      (PHF6) in leukemia and define its role in regulating chromatin accessibility to
      lineage-specific transcription factors. We show that loss of Phf6 in B-cell
      leukemia results in systematic changes in gene expression via alteration of the
      chromatin landscape at the transcriptional start sites of B-cell- and
      T-cell-specific factors. Additionally, Phf6(KO) cells show significant
      down-regulation of genes involved in the development and function of normal B
      cells, show up-regulation of genes involved in T-cell signaling, and give rise to
      mixed-lineage lymphoma in vivo. Engagement of divergent transcriptional programs 
      results in phenotypic plasticity that leads to altered disease presentation in
      vivo, tolerance of aberrant oncogenic signaling, and differential sensitivity to 
      frontline and targeted therapies. These findings suggest that active maintenance 
      of a precise chromatin landscape is essential for sustaining proper leukemia cell
      identity and that loss of a single factor (PHF6) can cause focal changes in
      chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning that render cells susceptible 
      to lineage transition.

AB  - The re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted 
      flavivirus circulating in >70 countries and territories, poses a significant
      global threat to public health due to its ability to cause severe developmental
      defects in the human brain, such as microcephaly. Since the World Health
      Organization declared the ZIKV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of
      International Concern, remarkable progress has been made to gain insight into
      cellular targets, pathogenesis, and underlying biological mechanisms of ZIKV
      infection. Here we review the current knowledge and progress in understanding the
      impact of ZIKV exposure on the mammalian brain development and discuss potential 
      underlying mechanisms.

LID - 10.1101/gad.295907.117 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear matrix protein Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) promotes
      DNA replication in association with cyclins and has been linked to adult and
      pediatric cancers. Here we show that CIZ1 is highly enriched on the inactive X
      chromosome (Xi) in mouse and human female cells and is retained by interaction
      with the RNA-dependent nuclear matrix. CIZ1 is recruited to Xi in response to
      expression of X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) RNA during the earliest
      stages of X inactivation in embryonic stem cells and is dependent on the
      C-terminal nuclear matrix anchor domain of CIZ1 and the E repeats of Xist
      CIZ1-null mice, although viable, display fully penetrant female-specific
      lymphoproliferative disorder. Interestingly, in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells 
      derived from CIZ1-null embryos, Xist RNA localization is disrupted, being highly 
      dispersed through the nucleoplasm rather than focal. Focal localization is
      reinstated following re-expression of CIZ1. Focal localization of Xist RNA is
      also disrupted in activated B and T cells isolated from CIZ1-null animals,
      suggesting a possible explanation for female-specific lymphoproliferative
      disorder. Together, these findings suggest that CIZ1 has an essential role in
      anchoring Xist to the nuclear matrix in specific somatic lineages.

AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in embryonic
      development and adult tissue homeostasis. Axin is a concentration-limiting factor
      responsible for the formation of the beta-catenin destruction complex. Wnt
      signaling itself promotes the degradation of Axin. However, the underlying
      molecular mechanism and biological relevance of this targeting of Axin have not
      been elucidated. Here, we identify SIAH1/2 (SIAH) as the E3 ligase mediating
      Wnt-induced Axin degradation. SIAH proteins promote the ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation of Axin through interacting with a VxP motif in the
      GSK3-binding domain of Axin, and this function of SIAH is counteracted by GSK3
      binding to Axin. Structural analysis reveals that the Axin segment responsible
      for SIAH binding is also involved in GSK3 binding but adopts distinct
      conformations in Axin/SIAH and Axin/GSK3 complexes. Knockout of SIAH1 blocks
      Wnt-induced Axin ubiquitination and attenuates Wnt-induced beta-catenin
      stabilization. Our data suggest that Wnt-induced dissociation of the Axin/GSK3
      complex allows SIAH to interact with Axin not associated with GSK3 and promote
      its degradation and that SIAH-mediated Axin degradation represents an important
      feed-forward mechanism to achieve sustained Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

TI  - Wnt5a promotes Frizzled-4 signalosome assembly by stabilizing cysteine-rich
      domain dimerization.
PG  - 916-926
LID - 10.1101/gad.298331.117 [doi]
AB  - Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is activated when extracellular Wnt ligands bind
      Frizzled (FZD) receptors at the cell membrane. Wnts bind FZD cysteine-rich
      domains (CRDs) with high affinity through a palmitoylated N-terminal "thumb" and 
      a disulfide-stabilized C-terminal "index finger," yet how these binding events
      trigger receptor activation and intracellular signaling remains unclear. Here we 
      report the crystal structure of the Frizzled-4 (FZD4) CRD in complex with
      palmitoleic acid, which reveals a CRD tetramer consisting of two cross-braced CRD
      dimers. Each dimer is stabilized by interactions of one hydrophobic palmitoleic
      acid tail with two CRD palmitoleoyl-binding grooves oriented end to end,
      suggesting that the Wnt palmitoleoyl group stimulates CRD-CRD interaction. Using 
      bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in live cells, we show that
      WNT5A stimulates dimerization of membrane-anchored FZD4 CRDs and oligomerization 
      of full-length FZD4, which requires the integrity of CRD palmitoleoyl-binding
      residues. These results suggest that FZD receptors may form signalosomes in
      response to Wnt binding through the CRDs and that the Wnt palmitoleoyl group is
      important in promoting these interactions. These results complement our
      understanding of lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6),
      Dishevelled, and Axin signalosome assembly and provide a more complete model for 
      Wnt signalosome assembly both intracellularly and at the membrane.

      development and homeostasis.
PG  - 889-903
LID - 10.1101/gad.298018.117 [doi]
AB  - A subset of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is spatially correlated with
      transcription factors (TFs) across the genome, but how these lncRNA-TF gene
      duplexes regulate tissue development and homeostasis is unclear. We identified a 
      feedback loop within the NANCI (Nkx2.1-associated noncoding intergenic
      RNA)-Nkx2.1 gene duplex that is essential for buffering Nkx2.1 expression, lung
      epithelial cell identity, and tissue homeostasis. Within this locus, Nkx2.1
      directly inhibits NANCI, while NANCI acts in cis to promote Nkx2.1 transcription.
      Although loss of NANCI alone does not adversely affect lung development,
      concurrent heterozygous mutations in both NANCI and Nkx2.1 leads to persistent
      Nkx2.1 deficiency and reprogramming of lung epithelial cells to a posterior
      endoderm fate. This disruption in the NANCI-Nkx2.1 gene duplex results in a
      defective perinatal innate immune response, tissue damage, and progressive
      degeneration of the adult lung. These data point to a mechanism in which lncRNAs 
      act as rheostats within lncRNA-TF gene duplex loci that buffer TF expression,
      thereby maintaining tissue-specific cellular identity during development and
      postnatal homeostasis.

TI  - The LOTUS domain is a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase regulator essential for the
      recruitment of Vasa to the germ plasm and nuage.

AB  - DEAD-box RNA helicases play important roles in a wide range of metabolic
      processes. Regulatory proteins can stimulate or block the activity of DEAD-box
      helicases. Here, we show that LOTUS (Limkain, Oskar, and Tudor containing
      proteins 5 and 7) domains present in the germline proteins Oskar, TDRD5 (Tudor
      domain-containing 5), and TDRD7 bind and stimulate the germline-specific DEAD-box
      RNA helicase Vasa. Our crystal structure of the LOTUS domain of Oskar in complex 
      with the C-terminal RecA-like domain of Vasa reveals that the LOTUS domain
      occupies a surface on a DEAD-box helicase not implicated previously in the
      regulation of the enzyme's activity. We show that, in vivo, the localization of
      Drosophila Vasa to the nuage and germ plasm depends on its interaction with LOTUS
      domain proteins. The binding and stimulation of Vasa DEAD-box helicases by LOTUS 
      domains are widely conserved.

TI  - Hormone-dependent control of developmental timing through regulation of chromatin
      accessibility.
PG  - 862-875
LID - 10.1101/gad.298182.117 [doi]
AB  - Specification of tissue identity during development requires precise coordination
      of gene expression in both space and time. Spatially, master regulatory
      transcription factors are required to control tissue-specific gene expression
      programs. However, the mechanisms controlling how tissue-specific gene expression
      changes over time are less well understood. Here, we show that hormone-induced
      transcription factors control temporal gene expression by regulating the
      accessibility of DNA regulatory elements. Using the Drosophila wing, we
      demonstrate that temporal changes in gene expression are accompanied by
      genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility at temporal-specific enhancers. We
      also uncover a temporal cascade of transcription factors following a pulse of the
      steroid hormone ecdysone such that different times in wing development can be
      defined by distinct combinations of hormone-induced transcription factors.
      Finally, we show that the ecdysone-induced transcription factor E93 controls
      temporal identity by directly regulating chromatin accessibility across the
      genome. Notably, we found that E93 controls enhancer activity through three
      different modalities, including promoting accessibility of late-acting enhancers 
      and decreasing accessibility of early-acting enhancers. Together, this work
      supports a model in which an extrinsic signal triggers an intrinsic transcription
      factor cascade that drives development forward in time through regulation of
      chromatin accessibility.

TI  - A receptor-like protein acts as a specificity switch for the regulation of
      stomatal development.
PG  - 927-938
LID - 10.1101/gad.297580.117 [doi]
AB  - Stomata are microscopic openings that allow for the exchange of gases between
      plants and the environment. In Arabidopsis, stomatal patterning is specified by
      the ERECTA family (ERf) receptor kinases (RKs), the receptor-like protein (RLP)
      TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM), and EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) peptides. Here we
      show that TMM and ER or ER-LIKE1 (ERL1) form constitutive complexes, which
      recognize EPF1 and EPF2, but the single ERfs do not. TMM interaction with ERL1
      creates a binding pocket for recognition of EPF1 and EPF2, indicating that the
      constitutive TMM-ERf complexes function as the receptors of EPF1 and EPF2. EPFL9 
      competes with EPF1 and EPF2 for binding to the ERf-TMM complex. EPFL4 and EPFL6, 
      however, are recognized by the single ERfs without the requirement of TMM. In
      contrast to EPF1,2, the interaction of EPFL4,6 with an ERf is greatly reduced in 
      the presence of TMM. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TMM dictates the
      specificity of ERfs for the perception of different EPFs, thus functioning as a
      specificity switch for the regulation of the activities of ERfs.

TI  - Regulation of DNA demethylation by the XPC DNA repair complex in somatic and
      pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 830-844
LID - 10.1101/gad.295741.116 [doi]
AB  - Faithful resetting of the epigenetic memory of a somatic cell to a pluripotent
      state during cellular reprogramming requires DNA methylation to silence somatic
      gene expression and dynamic DNA demethylation to activate pluripotency gene
      transcription. The removal of methylated cytosines requires the base excision
      repair enzyme TDG, but the mechanism by which TDG-dependent DNA demethylation
      occurs in a rapid and site-specific manner remains unclear. Here we show that the
      XPC DNA repair complex is a potent accelerator of global and locus-specific DNA
      demethylation in somatic and pluripotent stem cells. XPC cooperates with TDG
      genome-wide to stimulate the turnover of essential intermediates by overcoming
      slow TDG-abasic product dissociation during active DNA demethylation. We further 
      establish that DNA demethylation induced by XPC expression in somatic cells
      overcomes an early epigenetic barrier in cellular reprogramming and facilitates
      the generation of more robust induced pluripotent stem cells, characterized by
      enhanced pluripotency-associated gene expression and self-renewal capacity. Taken
      together with our previous studies establishing the XPC complex as a
      transcriptional coactivator, our findings underscore two distinct but
      complementary mechanisms by which XPC influences gene regulation by coordinating 
      efficient TDG-mediated DNA demethylation along with active transcription during
      somatic cell reprogramming.

AB  - Cutaneous melanoma (CM) and uveal melanoma (UM) derive from cutaneous and uveal
      melanocytes that share the same embryonic origin and display the same cellular
      function. However, the etiopathogenesis and biological behaviors of these
      melanomas are very different. CM and UM display distinct landscapes of genetic
      alterations and show different metastatic routes and tropisms. Hence, therapeutic
      improvements achieved in the last few years for the treatment of CM have failed
      to ameliorate the clinical outcomes of patients with UM. The scope of this review
      is to discuss the differences in tumorigenic processes (etiologic factors and
      genetic alterations) and tumor biology (gene expression and signaling pathways)
      between CM and UM. We develop hypotheses to explain these differences, which
      might provide important clues for research avenues and the identification of
      actionable vulnerabilities suitable for the development of new therapeutic
      strategies for metastatic UM.

AB  - Melanocytes present in hair follicles are responsible for their pigmentation.
      Melanocyte differentiation and hair pigmentation depend on the stem cell factor
      (SCF)/c-Kit signaling pathway, but the niche that regulates melanocyte
      differentiation is not well characterized. In this issue of Genes & Development, 
      Liao and colleagues (pp. 744-756) identify Krox20(+)-derived cells of the hair
      shaft as the niche and the essential source of SCF required for melanocyte
      maturation. This study delineates the niche factors regulating melanocyte
      differentiation and hair pigmentation and opens up new avenues to further
      characterize the cross-talk between the hair follicle and melanocytes that
      controls melanocyte maintenance and differentiation.

TI  - Recruitment of a SUMO isopeptidase to rDNA stabilizes silencing complexes by
      opposing SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligase activity.
PG  - 802-815
LID - 10.1101/gad.296145.117 [doi]
AB  - Post-translational modification by SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) plays
      important but still poorly understood regulatory roles in eukaryotic cells,
      including as a signal for ubiquitination by SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligases
      (STUbLs). Here, we delineate the molecular mechanisms for SUMO-dependent control 
      of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) silencing through the opposing actions of a STUbL
      (Slx5:Slx8) and a SUMO isopeptidase (Ulp2). We identify a conserved region in the
      Ulp2 C terminus that mediates its specificity for rDNA-associated proteins and
      show that this region binds directly to the rDNA-associated protein Csm1. Two
      crystal structures show that Csm1 interacts with Ulp2 and one of its substrates, 
      the rDNA silencing protein Tof2, through adjacent conserved interfaces in its
      C-terminal domain. Disrupting Csm1's interaction with either Ulp2 or Tof2
      dramatically reduces rDNA silencing and causes a marked drop in Tof2 abundance,
      suggesting that Ulp2 promotes rDNA silencing by opposing STUbL-mediated
      degradation of silencing proteins. Tof2 abundance is rescued by deletion of the
      STUbL SLX5 or disruption of its SUMO-interacting motifs, confirming that Tof2 is 
      targeted for degradation in a SUMO- and STUbL-dependent manner. Overall, our
      results demonstrate how the opposing actions of a localized SUMO isopeptidase and
      a STUbL regulate rDNA silencing by controlling the abundance of a key rDNA
      silencing protein, Tof2.

AB  - DNA replication fork progression can be disrupted at difficult to replicate loci 
      in the human genome, which has the potential to challenge chromosome integrity.
      This replication fork disruption can lead to the dissociation of the replisome
      and the formation of DNA damage. To model the events stemming from replisome
      dissociation during DNA replication perturbation, we used a degron-based system
      for inducible proteolysis of a subunit of the replicative helicase. We show that 
      MCM2-depleted cells activate a DNA damage response pathway and generate
      replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Remarkably, these cells
      maintain some DNA synthesis in the absence of MCM2, and this requires the MCM8-9 
      complex, a paralog of the MCM2-7 replicative helicase. We show that MCM8-9
      functions in a homologous recombination-based pathway downstream from RAD51,
      which is promoted by DSB induction. This RAD51/MCM8-9 axis is distinct from the
      recently described RAD52-dependent DNA synthesis pathway that operates in early
      mitosis at common fragile sites. We propose that stalled replication forks can be
      restarted in S phase via homologous recombination using MCM8-9 as an alternative 
      replicative helicase.

TI  - SET1A/COMPASS and shadow enhancers in the regulation of homeotic gene expression.
PG  - 787-801
LID - 10.1101/gad.294744.116 [doi]
AB  - The homeotic (Hox) genes are highly conserved in metazoans, where they are
      required for various processes in development, and misregulation of their
      expression is associated with human cancer. In the developing embryo, Hox genes
      are activated sequentially in time and space according to their genomic position 
      within Hox gene clusters. Accumulating evidence implicates both enhancer elements
      and noncoding RNAs in controlling this spatiotemporal expression of Hox genes,
      but disentangling their relative contributions is challenging. Here, we identify 
      two cis-regulatory elements (E1 and E2) functioning as shadow enhancers to
      regulate the early expression of the HoxA genes. Simultaneous deletion of these
      shadow enhancers in embryonic stem cells leads to impaired activation of HoxA
      genes upon differentiation, while knockdown of a long noncoding RNA overlapping
      E1 has no detectable effect on their expression. Although MLL/COMPASS (complex of
      proteins associated with Set1) family of histone methyltransferases is known to
      activate transcription of Hox genes in other contexts, we found that individual
      inactivation of the MLL1-4/COMPASS family members has little effect on early Hox 
      gene activation. Instead, we demonstrate that SET1A/COMPASS is required for full 
      transcriptional activation of multiple Hox genes but functions independently of
      the E1 and E2 cis-regulatory elements. Our results reveal multiple regulatory
      layers for Hox genes to fine-tune transcriptional programs essential for
      development.

TI  - Elevated FOXG1 and SOX2 in glioblastoma enforces neural stem cell identity
      through transcriptional control of cell cycle and epigenetic regulators.
PG  - 757-773
LID - 10.1101/gad.293027.116 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor driven by cells with
      hallmarks of neural stem (NS) cells. GBM stem cells frequently express high
      levels of the transcription factors FOXG1 and SOX2. Here we show that increased
      expression of these factors restricts astrocyte differentiation and can trigger
      dedifferentiation to a proliferative NS cell state. Transcriptional targets
      include cell cycle and epigenetic regulators (e.g., Foxo3, Plk1, Mycn, Dnmt1,
      Dnmt3b, and Tet3). Foxo3 is a critical repressed downstream effector that is
      controlled via a conserved FOXG1/SOX2-bound cis-regulatory element. Foxo3 loss,
      combined with exposure to the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine, enforces
      astrocyte dedifferentiation. DNA methylation profiling in differentiating
      astrocytes identifies changes at multiple polycomb targets, including the
      promoter of Foxo3 In patient-derived GBM stem cells, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of
      FOXG1 does not impact proliferation in vitro; however, upon transplantation in
      vivo, FOXG1-null cells display increased astrocyte differentiation and
      up-regulate FOXO3. In contrast, SOX2 ablation attenuates proliferation, and
      mutant cells cannot be expanded in vitro. Thus, FOXG1 and SOX2 operate in
      complementary but distinct roles to fuel unconstrained self-renewal in GBM stem
      cells via transcriptional control of core cell cycle and epigenetic regulators.

TI  - Mutant IDH1 regulates the tumor-associated immune system in gliomas.
PG  - 774-786
LID - 10.1101/gad.294991.116 [doi]
AB  - Gliomas harboring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have the CpG
      island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and significantly longer patient survival time
      than wild-type IDH1/2 (wtIDH1/2) tumors. Although there are many factors
      underlying the differences in survival between these two tumor types,
      immune-related differences in cell content are potentially important
      contributors. In order to investigate the role of IDH mutations in immune
      response, we created a syngeneic pair mouse model for mutant IDH1 (muIDH1) and
      wtIDH1 gliomas and demonstrated that muIDH1 mice showed many molecular and
      clinical similarities to muIDH1 human gliomas, including a 100-fold higher
      concentration of 2-hydroxygluratate (2-HG), longer survival time, and higher CpG 
      methylation compared with wtIDH1. Also, we showed that IDH1 mutations caused
      down-regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, resulting in repression of the
      tumor-associated immune system. Given that significant infiltration of immune
      cells such as macrophages, microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils is linked to
      poor prognosis in many cancer types, these reduced immune infiltrates in muIDH1
      glioma tumors may contribute in part to the differences in aggressiveness of the 
      two glioma types.

AB  - Hair differentiates from follicle stem cells through progenitor cells in the
      matrix. In contrast to stem cells in the bulge, the identities of the progenitors
      and the mechanisms by which they regulate hair shaft components are poorly
      understood. Hair is also pigmented by melanocytes in the follicle. However, the
      niche that regulates follicular melanocytes is not well characterized. Here, we
      report the identification of hair shaft progenitors in the matrix that are
      differentiated from follicular epithelial cells expressing transcription factor
      KROX20. Depletion of Krox20 lineage cells results in arrest of hair growth,
      confirming the critical role of KROX20(+) cells as antecedents of structural
      cells found in hair. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) by these cells is
      necessary for the maintenance of differentiated melanocytes and for hair
      pigmentation. Our findings reveal the identities of hair matrix progenitors that 
      regulate hair growth and pigmentation, partly by creating an SCF-dependent niche 
      for follicular melanocytes.

AB  - In eukaryotes, a dynamic ribonucleic protein machine known as the spliceosome
      catalyzes the removal of introns from premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Recent studies
      show the processes of RNA synthesis and RNA processing to be spatio-temporally
      coordinated, indicating that RNA splicing takes place in the context of
      chromatin. H2A.Z is a highly conserved histone variant of the canonical histone
      H2A. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2A.Z is deposited into chromatin by the SWR-C 
      complex, is found near the 5' ends of protein-coding genes, and has been
      implicated in transcription regulation. Here we show that splicing of
      intron-containing genes in cells lacking H2A.Z is impaired, particularly under
      suboptimal splicing conditions. Cells lacking H2A.Z are especially dependent on a
      functional U2 snRNP (small nuclear RNA [snRNA] plus associated proteins), as
      H2A.Z shows extensive genetic interactions with U2 snRNP-associated proteins, and
      RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals that introns with nonconsensus branch points are
      particularly sensitive to H2A.Z loss. Consistently, H2A.Z promotes efficient
      spliceosomal rearrangements involving the U2 snRNP, as H2A.Z loss results in
      persistent U2 snRNP association and decreased recruitment of downstream snRNPs to
      nascent RNA. H2A.Z impairs transcription elongation, suggesting that spliceosome 
      rearrangements are tied to H2A.Z's role in elongation. Depletion of disassembly
      factor Prp43 suppresses H2A.Z-mediated splice defects, indicating that, in the
      absence of H2A.Z, stalled spliceosomes are disassembled, and unspliced RNAs are
      released. Together, these data demonstrate that H2A.Z is required for efficient
      pre-mRNA splicing and indicate a role for H2A.Z in coordinating the kinetics of
      transcription elongation and splicing.

AB  - Multiple lines of evidence implicate chromatin in the regulation of premessenger 
      RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. However, the influence of chromatin factors on
      cotranscriptional splice site usage remains unclear. Here we investigated the
      function of the highly conserved histone variant H2A.Z in pre-mRNA splicing using
      the intron-rich model yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe Using epistatic miniarray
      profiles (EMAPs) to survey the genetic interaction landscape of the Swr1
      nucleosome remodeling complex, which deposits H2A.Z, we uncovered evidence for
      functional interactions with components of the spliceosome. In support of these
      genetic connections, splicing-specific microarrays show that H2A.Z and the Swr1
      ATPase are required during temperature stress for the efficient splicing of a
      subset of introns. Notably, affected introns are enriched for H2A.Z occupancy and
      more likely to contain nonconsensus splice sites. To test the significance of the
      latter correlation, we mutated the splice sites in an affected intron to
      consensus and found that this suppressed the requirement for H2A.Z in splicing of
      that intron. These data suggest that H2A.Z occupancy promotes cotranscriptional
      splicing of suboptimal introns that may otherwise be discarded via proofreading
      ATPases. Consistent with this model, we show that overexpression of splicing
      ATPase Prp16 suppresses both the growth and splicing defects seen in the absence 
      of H2A.Z.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression
      critical for organismal viability. Changes in miRNA activity are common in
      cancer, but how these changes relate to subsequent alterations in transcription
      and the process of tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here, we report a deep
      transcriptional, oncogenic network regulated by miRNAs. We present analysis of
      the gene expression and phenotypic changes associated with global miRNA
      restoration in miRNA-deficient fibroblasts. This analysis uncovers a
      miRNA-repressed network containing oncofetal genes Imp1, Imp2, and Imp3 (Imp1-3) 
      that is up-regulated primarily transcriptionally >100-fold upon Dicer loss and is
      resistant to resilencing by complete restoration of miRNA activity. This
      Dicer-resistant epigenetic switch confers tumorigenicity to these cells. Let-7
      targets Imp1-3 are required for this tumorigenicity and feed back to reinforce
      and sustain expression of the oncogenic network. Together, these Dicer-resistant 
      genes constitute an mRNA expression signature that is present in numerous human
      cancers and is associated with poor survival.

TI  - DNA damage signaling mediates the functional antagonism between replicative
      senescence and terminal muscle differentiation.
PG  - 648-659
LID - 10.1101/gad.293266.116 [doi]
AB  - The molecular determinants of muscle progenitor impairment to regenerate aged
      muscles are currently unclear. We show that, in a mouse model of replicative
      senescence, decline in muscle satellite cell-mediated regeneration coincides with
      activation of DNA damage response (DDR) and impaired ability to differentiate
      into myotubes. Inhibition of DDR restored satellite cell differentiation ability.
      Moreover, in replicative human senescent fibroblasts, DDR precluded MYOD-mediated
      activation of the myogenic program. A DDR-resistant MYOD mutant could overcome
      this barrier by resuming cell cycle progression. Likewise, DDR inhibition could
      also restore MYOD's ability to activate the myogenic program in human senescent
      fibroblasts. Of note, we found that cell cycle progression is necessary for the
      DDR-resistant MYOD mutant to reverse senescence-mediated inhibition of the
      myogenic program. These data provide the first evidence of DDR-mediated
      functional antagonism between senescence and MYOD-activated gene expression and
      indicate a previously unrecognized requirement of cell cycle progression for the 
      activation of the myogenic program.

      outline mechanisms by which the brown fat transcription factor early B-cell
      factor 2 (EBF2) selectively activates brown lineage-specific gene expression. The
      investigators show that EBF2 interacts with and recruits a tissue-specific BAF
      chromatin remodeling complex to brown fat gene enhancers, thereby regulating
      chromatin accessibility. Their findings provide important insight into epigenetic
      regulation of adipocyte fate and thermogenic gene expression.

TI  - Creating cell type-specific mutants by enhancer mutagenesis.
PG  - 629-631
LID - 10.1101/gad.299586.117 [doi]
AB  - Cell signaling plays an essential role in development, and knowledge of the
      identities of the cells sending the signal is critical. This can be a challenge, 
      since signaling pathways and ligands are commonly used at multiple times and in
      multiple cell types during development. One solution to this problem is to create
      cell type-specific mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate enhancers that control
      different patterns of expression. In this issue of Genes & Development, Rogers
      and colleagues (pp. 634-638) provide the first use of this method in Drosophila
      to solve a long-standing issue in patterning of the embryonic central nervous
      system.

      terminally differentiated neurons.
PG  - 639-647
LID - 10.1101/gad.295402.116 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres have been studied extensively in peripheral tissues, but their
      relevance in the nervous system remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the
      roles of telomeres at distinct stages of murine brain development by using
      lineage-specific genetic ablation of TRF2, an essential component of the
      shelterin complex that protects chromosome ends from the DNA damage response
      machinery. We found that functional telomeres are required for embryonic and
      adult neurogenesis, but their uncapping has surprisingly no detectable
      consequences on terminally differentiated neurons. Conditional knockout of TRF2
      in post-mitotic immature neurons had virtually no detectable effect on circuit
      assembly, neuronal gene expression, and the behavior of adult animals despite
      triggering massive end-to-end chromosome fusions across the brain. These results 
      suggest that telomeres are dispensable in terminally differentiated neurons and
      provide mechanistic insight into cognitive abnormalities associated with aberrant
      telomere length in humans.

LID - 10.1101/gad.297150.117 [doi]
AB  - The EGF signaling pathway specifies neuronal identities in the Drosophila embryo 
      by regulating developmental patterning genes such as intermediate neuroblasts
      defective (ind). EGFR is activated in the ventral midline and neurogenic ectoderm
      by the Spitz ligand, which is processed by the Rhomboid protease. CRISPR/Cas9 was
      used to delete defined rhomboid enhancers mediating expression at each site of
      Spitz processing. Surprisingly, the neurogenic ectoderm, not the ventral midline,
      was found to be the dominant source of EGF patterning activity. We suggest that
      Drosophila is undergoing an evolutionary transition in central nervous system
      (CNS)-organizing activity from the ventral midline to the neurogenic ectoderm.

TI  - EBF2 transcriptionally regulates brown adipogenesis via the histone reader DPF3
      and the BAF chromatin remodeling complex.
PG  - 660-673
LID - 10.1101/gad.294405.116 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor early B-cell factor 2 (EBF2) is an essential mediator of
      brown adipocyte commitment and terminal differentiation. However, the mechanisms 
      by which EBF2 regulates chromatin to activate brown fat-specific genes in
      adipocytes were unknown. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] followed 
      by deep sequencing) analyses in brown adipose tissue showed that EBF2 binds and
      regulates the activity of lineage-specific enhancers. Mechanistically, EBF2
      physically interacts with the chromatin remodeler BRG1 and the BAF chromatin
      remodeling complex in brown adipocytes. We identified the histone reader protein 
      DPF3 as a brown fat-selective component of the BAF complex that was required for 
      brown fat gene programming and mitochondrial function. Loss of DPF3 in brown
      adipocytes reduced chromatin accessibility at EBF2-bound enhancers and led to a
      decrease in basal and catecholamine-stimulated expression of brown fat-selective 
      genes. Notably, Dpf3 is a direct transcriptional target of EBF2 in brown
      adipocytes, thereby establishing a regulatory module through which EBF2 activates
      and also recruits DPF3-anchored BAF complexes to chromatin. Together, these
      results reveal a novel mechanism by which EBF2 cooperates with a tissue-specific 
      chromatin remodeling complex to activate brown fat identity genes.

AB  - In many plants, the asymmetric division of the zygote sets up the apical-basal
      axis of the embryo. Unlike animals, plant zygotes are transcriptionally active,
      implying that plants have evolved specific mechanisms to control transcriptional 
      activation of patterning genes in the zygote. In Arabidopsis, two pathways have
      been found to regulate zygote asymmetry: YODA (YDA) mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) signaling, which is potentiated by sperm-delivered mRNA of the
      SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) membrane protein, and up-regulation of the patterning gene 
      WOX8 by the WRKY2 transcription factor. How SSP/YDA signaling is transduced into 
      the nucleus and how these pathways are integrated have remained elusive. Here we 
      show that paternal SSP/YDA signaling directly phosphorylates WRKY2, which in turn
      leads to the up-regulation of WOX8 transcription in the zygote. We further
      discovered the transcription factors HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11/12 (HDG11/12) as
      maternal regulators of zygote asymmetry that also directly regulate WOX8
      transcription. Our results reveal a framework of how maternal and paternal
      factors are integrated in the zygote to regulate embryo patterning.

      endoreplication in Drosophila.

LID - 10.1101/gad.295717.116 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic DNA replicates asynchronously, with discrete genomic loci replicating 
      during different stages of S phase. Drosophila larval tissues undergo
      endoreplication without cell division, and the latest replicating regions
      occasionally fail to complete endoreplication, resulting in underreplicated
      domains of polytene chromosomes. Here we show that linker histone H1 is required 
      for the underreplication (UR) phenomenon in Drosophila salivary glands. H1
      directly interacts with the Suppressor of UR (SUUR) protein and is required for
      SUUR binding to chromatin in vivo. These observations implicate H1 as a critical 
      factor in the formation of underreplicated regions and an upstream effector of
      SUUR. We also demonstrate that the localization of H1 in chromatin changes
      profoundly during the endocycle. At the onset of endocycle S (endo-S) phase, H1
      is heavily and specifically loaded into late replicating genomic regions and is
      then redistributed during the course of endoreplication. Our data suggest that
      cell cycle-dependent chromosome occupancy of H1 is governed by several
      independent processes. In addition to the ubiquitous replication-related
      disassembly and reassembly of chromatin, H1 is deposited into chromatin through a
      novel pathway that is replication-independent, rapid, and locus-specific. This
      cell cycle-directed dynamic localization of H1 in chromatin may play an important
      role in the regulation of DNA replication timing.

TI  - miR-424(322)/503 is a breast cancer tumor suppressor whose loss promotes
      resistance to chemotherapy.

AB  - The female mammary gland is a very dynamic organ that undergoes continuous tissue
      remodeling during adulthood. Although it is well established that the number of
      menstrual cycles and pregnancy (in this case transiently) increase the risk of
      breast cancer, the reasons are unclear. Growing clinical and experimental
      evidence indicates that improper involution plays a role in the development of
      this malignancy. Recently, we described the miR-424(322)/503 cluster as an
      important regulator of mammary epithelial involution after pregnancy. Here,
      through the analysis of approximately 3000 primary tumors, we show that
      miR-424(322)/503 is commonly lost in a subset of aggressive breast cancers and
      describe the genetic aberrations that inactivate its expression. Furthermore,
      through the use of a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate for the first time that
      loss of miR-424(322)/503 promotes breast tumorigenesis in vivo. Remarkably, we
      found that loss of miR-424(322)/503 promotes chemoresistance due to the
      up-regulation of two of its targets: BCL-2 and insulin-like growth factor-1
      receptor (IGF1R). Importantly, targeted therapies blocking the aberrant activity 
      of these targets restore sensitivity to chemotherapy. Overall, our studies reveal
      miR-424(322)/503 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and provide a link
      between mammary epithelial involution, tumorigenesis, and the phenomenon of
      chemoresistance.

AB  - Rapid advances in genetics are linking mutations on genes to diseases at an
      exponential rate, yet characterizing the gene-mutation-cell-behavior
      relationships essential for precision medicine remains a daunting task. More than
      350 mutations on small GTPase BRaf are associated with various tumors, and
      approximately 40 mutations are associated with the neurodevelopmental disorder
      cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC). We developed a fast cost-effective
      lentivirus-based rapid gene replacement method to interrogate the physiopathology
      of BRaf and approximately 50 disease-linked BRaf mutants, including all
      CFC-linked mutants. Analysis of simultaneous multiple patch-clamp recordings from
      6068 pairs of rat neurons with validation in additional mouse and human neurons
      and multiple learning tests from 1486 rats identified BRaf as the key missing
      signaling effector in the common synaptic NMDA-R-CaMKII-SynGap-Ras-BRaf-MEK-ERK
      transduction cascade. Moreover, the analysis creates the original big data
      unveiling three general features of BRaf signaling. This study establishes the
      first efficient procedure that permits large-scale functional analysis of human
      disease-linked mutations essential for precision medicine.

      chromatin decompaction.
PG  - 578-589
LID - 10.1101/gad.294108.116 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres are protected by shelterin, a six-subunit protein complex that
      represses the DNA damage response (DDR) at chromosome ends. Extensive data
      suggest that TRF2 in shelterin remodels telomeres into the t-loop structure,
      thereby hiding telomere ends from double-stranded break repair and ATM signaling,
      whereas POT1 represses ATR signaling by excluding RPA. An alternative protection 
      mechanism was suggested recently by which shelterin subunits TRF1, TRF2, and TIN2
      mediate telomeric chromatin compaction, which was proposed to minimize access of 
      DDR factors. We performed superresolution imaging of telomeres in mouse cells
      after conditional deletion of TRF1, TRF2, or both, the latter of which results in
      the complete loss of shelterin. Upon removal of TRF1 or TRF2, we observed only
      minor changes in the telomere volume in most of our experiments. Upon codeletion 
      of TRF1 and TRF2, the telomere volume increased by varying amounts, but even
      those samples exhibiting small changes in telomere volume showed DDR at nearly
      all telomeres. Upon shelterin removal, telomeres underwent 53BP1-dependent
      clustering, potentially explaining at least in part the apparent increase in
      telomere volume. Furthermore, chromatin accessibility, as determined by ATAC-seq 
      (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin [ATAC] with high-throughput
      sequencing), was not substantially altered by shelterin removal. These results
      suggest that the DDR induced by shelterin removal does not require substantial
      telomere decompaction.

TI  - Dual functionality of cis-regulatory elements as developmental enhancers and
      Polycomb response elements.
PG  - 590-602
LID - 10.1101/gad.292870.116 [doi]
AB  - Developmental gene expression is tightly regulated through enhancer elements,
      which initiate dynamic spatio-temporal expression, and Polycomb response elements
      (PREs), which maintain stable gene silencing. These two cis-regulatory functions 
      are thought to operate through distinct dedicated elements. By examining the
      occupancy of the Drosophila pleiohomeotic repressive complex (PhoRC) during
      embryogenesis, we revealed extensive co-occupancy at developmental enhancers.
      Using an established in vivo assay for PRE activity, we demonstrated that a
      subset of characterized developmental enhancers can function as PREs, silencing
      transcription in a Polycomb-dependent manner. Conversely, some classic Drosophila
      PREs can function as developmental enhancers in vivo, activating spatio-temporal 
      expression. This study therefore uncovers elements with dual function: activating
      transcription in some cells (enhancers) while stably maintaining transcriptional 
      silencing in others (PREs). Given that enhancers initiate spatio-temporal gene
      expression, reuse of the same elements by the Polycomb group (PcG) system may
      help fine-tune gene expression and ensure the timely maintenance of cell
      identities.

      decompaction.
PG  - 567-577
LID - 10.1101/gad.294082.116 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that protect chromosome ends
      from DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA rearrangements. The telomeric shelterin
      protein TRF2 suppresses the DDR, and this function has been attributed to its
      abilities to trigger t-loop formation or prevent massive decompaction and loss of
      density of telomeric chromatin. Here, we applied stochastic optical
      reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to measure the sizes and shapes of functional
      human telomeres of different lengths and dysfunctional telomeres that elicit a
      DDR. Telomeres have an ovoid appearance with considerable plasticity in shape.
      Examination of many telomeres demonstrated that depletion of TRF2, TRF1, or both 
      affected the sizes of only a small subset of telomeres. Costaining of telomeres
      with DDR markers further revealed that the majority of DDR signaling telomeres
      retained a normal size. Thus, DDR signaling at telomeres does not require
      decompaction. We propose that telomeres are monitored by the DDR machinery in the
      absence of telomere expansion and that the DDR is triggered by changes at the
      molecular level in structure and protein composition.

AB  - Lymphocyte differentiation is set to produce myriad immune effector cells with
      the ability to respond to multitudinous foreign substances. The uniqueness of
      this developmental system lies in not only the great diversity of cellular
      functions that it can generate but also the ability of its differentiation
      intermediates and mature effector cells to expand upon demand, thereby providing 
      lifelong immunity. Surprisingly, the goals of this developmental system are met
      by a relatively small group of DNA-binding transcription factors that work in
      concert to control the timing and magnitude of gene expression and fulfill the
      demands for cellular specialization, expansion, and maintenance. The cellular and
      molecular mechanisms through which these lineage-promoting transcription factors 
      operate have been a focus of basic research in immunology. The mechanisms of
      development discerned in this effort are guiding clinical research on disorders
      with an immune cell base. Here, I focus on IKAROS, one of the earliest regulators
      of lymphoid lineage identity and a guardian of lymphocyte homeostasis.

AB  - Cells communicate with each other to coordinate their gene activities at the
      population level through signaling pathways. It has been shown that many gene
      activities are oscillatory and that the frequency and phase of oscillatory gene
      expression encode various types of information. However, whether or how such
      oscillatory information is transmitted from cell to cell remains unknown. Here,
      we developed an integrated approach that combines optogenetic perturbations and
      single-cell bioluminescence imaging to visualize and reconstitute synchronized
      oscillatory gene expression in signal-sending and signal-receiving processes. We 
      found that intracellular and intercellular periodic inputs of Notch signaling
      entrain intrinsic oscillations by frequency tuning and phase shifting at the
      single-cell level. In this way, the oscillation dynamics are transmitted through 
      Notch signaling, thereby synchronizing the population of oscillators. Thus, this 
      approach enabled us to control and monitor dynamic cell-to-cell transfer of
      oscillatory information to coordinate gene expression patterns at the population 
      level.

TI  - Structures of partition protein ParA with nonspecific DNA and ParB effector
      reveal molecular insights into principles governing Walker-box DNA segregation.
PG  - 481-492
LID - 10.1101/gad.296319.117 [doi]
AB  - Walker-box partition systems are ubiquitous in nature and mediate the segregation
      of bacterial and archaeal DNA. Well-studied plasmid Walker-box partition modules 
      require ParA, centromere-DNA, and a centromere-binding protein, ParB. In these
      systems, ParA-ATP binds nucleoid DNA and uses it as a substratum to deliver
      ParB-attached cargo DNA, and ParB drives ParA dynamics, allowing ParA progression
      along the nucleoid. How ParA-ATP binds nonspecific DNA and is regulated by ParB
      is unclear. Also under debate is whether ParA polymerizes on DNA to mediate
      segregation. Here we describe structures of key ParA segregation complexes. The
      ParA-beta,gamma-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMPPNP)-DNA structure revealed no
      polymers. Instead, ParA-AMPPNP dimerization creates a multifaceted DNA-binding
      surface, allowing it to preferentially bind high-density DNA regions (HDRs).
      DNA-bound ParA-AMPPNP adopts a dimer conformation distinct from the ATP sandwich 
      dimer, optimized for DNA association. Our ParA-AMPPNP-ParB structure reveals that
      ParB binds at the ParA dimer interface, stabilizing the ATPase-competent ATP
      sandwich dimer, ultimately driving ParA DNA dissociation. Thus, the data indicate
      how harnessing a conformationally adaptive dimer can drive large-scale cargo
      movement without the requirement for polymers and suggest a segregation mechanism
      by which ParA-ATP dimers equilibrate to HDRs shown to be localized near cell
      poles of dividing chromosomes, thus mediating equipartition of attached ParB-DNA 
      substrates.

      single cells.
PG  - 511-523
LID - 10.1101/gad.294843.116 [doi]
AB  - To understand mammalian active DNA demethylation, various methods have been
      developed to map the genomic distribution of the demethylation intermediates
      5-formylcysotine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). However, the majority of
      these methods requires a large number of cells to begin with. In this study, we
      describe low-input methylase-assisted bisulfite sequencing (liMAB-seq ) and
      single-cell MAB-seq (scMAB-seq), capable of profiling 5fC and 5caC at genome
      scale using approximately 100 cells and single cells, respectively. liMAB-seq
      analysis of preimplantation embryos reveals the oxidation of 5mC to 5fC/5caC and 
      the positive correlation between chromatin accessibility and processivity of
      ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. scMAB-seq captures the cell-to-cell
      heterogeneity of 5fC and 5caC and reveals the strand-biased distribution of 5fC
      and 5caC. scMAB-seq also allows the simultaneous high-resolution mapping of
      sister chromatid exchange (SCE), facilitating the study of this type of genomic
      rearrangement. Therefore, our study not only establishes new methods for the
      genomic mapping of active DNA demethylation using limited numbers of cells or
      single cells but also demonstrates the utilities of the methods in different
      biological contexts.

LID - 10.1101/gad.293118.116 [doi]
AB  - Activation of transcription requires alteration of chromatin by complexes that
      increase the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Removing nucleosomes from
      regulatory sequences has been proposed to play a significant role in activation. 
      We tested whether changes in nucleosome occupancy occurred on the set of genes
      that is activated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). We observed no decrease
      in occupancy on most promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Instead, there was an
      increase in the accessibility of nucleosomes, as measured by micrococcal nuclease
      (MNase) digestion and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin [ATAC]
      using sequencing), that did not result from removal of the nucleosome. Thus,
      changes in nucleosome accessibility predominate over changes in nucleosome
      occupancy during rapid transcriptional induction during the UPR.

TI  - Essential role for centromeric factors following p53 loss and oncogenic
      transformation.
PG  - 463-480
LID - 10.1101/gad.290924.116 [doi]
AB  - In mammals, centromere definition involves the histone variant CENP-A (centromere
      protein A), deposited by its chaperone, HJURP (Holliday junction recognition
      protein). Alterations in this process impair chromosome segregation and genome
      stability, which are also compromised by p53 inactivation in cancer. Here we
      found that CENP-A and HJURP are transcriptionally up-regulated in p53-null human 
      tumors. Using an established mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model combining p53
      inactivation with E1A or HRas-V12 oncogene expression, we reproduced a similar
      up-regulation of HJURP and CENP-A. We delineate functional CDE/CHR motifs within 
      the Hjurp and Cenpa promoters and demonstrate their roles in p53-mediated
      repression. To assess the importance of HJURP up-regulation in transformed murine
      and human cells, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach. Remarkably, depletion of HJURP
      leads to distinct outcomes depending on their p53 status. Functional p53 elicits 
      a cell cycle arrest response, whereas, in p53-null transformed cells, the absence
      of arrest enables the loss of HJURP to induce severe aneuploidy and, ultimately, 
      apoptotic cell death. We thus tested the impact of HJURP depletion in
      pre-established allograft tumors in mice and revealed a major block of tumor
      progression in vivo. We discuss a model in which an "epigenetic addiction" to the
      HJURP chaperone represents an Achilles' heel in p53-deficient transformed cells.

TI  - A novel role of the Dna2 translocase function in DNA break resection.
PG  - 503-510
LID - 10.1101/gad.295659.116 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination entails nucleolytic
      resection of the 5' strand at break ends. Dna2, a flap endonuclease with 5'-3'
      helicase activity, is involved in the resection process. The Dna2 helicase
      activity has been implicated in Okazaki fragment processing during DNA
      replication but is thought to be dispensable for DNA end resection. Unexpectedly,
      we found a requirement for the helicase function of Dna2 in end resection in
      budding yeast cells lacking exonuclease 1. Biochemical analysis reveals that ATP 
      hydrolysis-fueled translocation of Dna2 on ssDNA facilitates 5' flap cleavage
      near a single-strand-double strand junction while attenuating 3' flap incision.
      Accordingly, the ATP hydrolysis-defective dna2-K1080E mutant is less able to
      generate long products in a reconstituted resection system. Our study thus
      reveals a previously unrecognized role of the Dna2 translocase activity in DNA
      break end resection and in the imposition of the 5' strand specificity of end
      resection.

LID - 10.1101/gad.295196.116 [doi]
AB  - DNA2 nuclease-helicase functions in DNA replication and recombination. This
      requires the nuclease of DNA2, while, in contrast, the role of the helicase
      activity has been unclear. We now show that the motor activity of both
      recombinant yeast and human DNA2 promotes efficient degradation of long stretches
      of ssDNA, particularly in the presence of the replication protein A. This
      degradation is further stimulated by a direct interaction with a cognate RecQ
      family helicase, which functions with DNA2 in DNA end resection to initiate
      homologous recombination. Consequently, helicase-deficient yeast dna2 K1080E
      cells display reduced resection speed of HO-induced DNA double-strand breaks.
      These results support a model of DNA2 and the RecQ family helicase partner
      forming a bidirectional motor machine, where the RecQ family helicase is the lead
      helicase, and the motor of DNA2 functions as a ssDNA translocase to promote
      degradation of 5'-terminated DNA.

LID - 10.1101/gad.293167.116 [doi]
AB  - Advances in metabolomics have deepened our understanding of the roles that
      specific modes of metabolism play in programming stem cell fates. Here, we review
      recent metabolomic studies of stem cell metabolism that have revealed how
      metabolic pathways can convey changes in the extrinsic environment or their niche
      to program stem cell fates. The metabolic programming of stem cells represents a 
      fine balance between the intrinsic needs of a cellular state and the constraints 
      imposed by extrinsic conditions. A more complete understanding of these needs and
      constraints will afford us greater mastery over our control of stem cell fates.

AB  - KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer and plays a central,
      although poorly understood, role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. In this 
      issue of Genes & Development, Boutin and colleagues (pp. 370-382) present a new
      mouse model of CRC in which the expression of oncogenic K-RAS is regulated by
      doxycycline. Using this model, they demonstrate that continued expression of
      oncogenic K-RAS is required for the survival of primary and metastatic colon
      cancers and that oncogenic K-RAS activates TGF-beta signaling to promote tumor
      invasion and metastasis.

PG  - 347-352
LID - 10.1101/gad.291500.116 [doi]
AB  - Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is essential for the development and homeostasis of multiple
      mesodermal tissues. Despite evidence for post-transcriptional roles, no
      endogenous WT1 target RNAs exist. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and UV
      cross-linking, we show that WT1 binds preferentially to 3' untranslated regions
      (UTRs) of developmental targets. These target mRNAs are down-regulated upon WT1
      depletion in cell culture and developing kidney mesenchyme. Wt1 deletion leads to
      rapid turnover of specific mRNAs. WT1 regulates reporter gene expression through 
      interaction with 3' UTR-binding sites. Combining experimental and computational
      analyses, we propose that WT1 influences key developmental and disease processes 
      in part through regulating mRNA turnover.

      Polr3e gene.
PG  - 413-421
LID - 10.1101/gad.293324.116 [doi]
AB  - Overlapping gene arrangements can potentially contribute to gene expression
      regulation. A mammalian interspersed repeat (MIR) nested in antisense orientation
      within the first intron of the Polr3e gene, encoding an RNA polymerase III (Pol
      III) subunit, is conserved in mammals and highly occupied by Pol III. Using a
      fluorescence assay, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the MIR in mouse embryonic
      stem cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that the MIR

AB  - Human colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality and frequently
      harbors activating mutations in the KRAS gene. To understand the role of
      oncogenic KRAS in CRC, we engineered a mouse model of metastatic CRC that harbors
      an inducible oncogenic Kras allele (Kras(mut) ) and conditional null alleles of
      Apc and Trp53 (iKAP). The iKAP model recapitulates tumor progression from adenoma
      through metastases. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the Kras(mut) allele was
      heterogenous in primary tumors yet homogenous in metastases, a pattern consistent
      with activated Kras(mut) signaling being a driver of progression to metastasis.
      System-level and functional analyses revealed the TGF-beta pathway as a key
      mediator of Kras(mut) -driven invasiveness. Genetic extinction of Kras(mut)
      resulted in specific elimination of the Kras(mut) subpopulation in primary and
      metastatic tumors, leading to apoptotic elimination of advanced invasive and
      metastatic disease. This faithful CRC model provides genetic evidence that
      Kras(mut) drives CRC invasion and maintenance of metastases.

TI  - A microRNA family exerts maternal control on sex determination in C. elegans.
PG  - 422-437
LID - 10.1101/gad.290155.116 [doi]
AB  - Gene expression in early animal embryogenesis is in large part controlled
      post-transcriptionally. Maternally contributed microRNAs may therefore play
      important roles in early development. We elucidated a major biological role of
      the nematode mir-35 family of maternally contributed essential microRNAs. We show
      that this microRNA family regulates the sex determination pathway at multiple
      levels, acting both upstream of and downstream from her-1 to prevent aberrantly
      activated male developmental programs in hermaphrodite embryos. Both of the
      predicted target genes that act downstream from the mir-35 family in this
      process, suppressor-26 (sup-26) and NHL (NCL-1, HT2A, and LIN-41 repeat)
      domain-containing-2 (nhl-2), encode RNA-binding proteins, thus delineating a
      previously unknown post-transcriptional regulatory subnetwork within the
      well-studied sex determination pathway of Caenorhabditis elegans Repression of
      nhl-2 by the mir-35 family is required for not only proper sex determination but 
      also viability, showing that a single microRNA target site can be essential.
      Since sex determination in C. elegans requires zygotic gene expression to read
      the sex chromosome karyotype, early embryos must remain gender-naive; our
      findings show that the mir-35 family microRNAs act in the early embryo to
      function as a developmental timer that preserves naivete and prevents premature
      deleterious developmental decisions.

TI  - A prosurvival DNA damage-induced cytoplasmic interferon response is mediated by
      end resection factors and is limited by Trex1.
PG  - 353-369
LID - 10.1101/gad.289769.116 [doi]
AB  - Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are effective treatment methods for many types of
      cancer, but resistance is common. Recent findings indicate that antiviral type I 
      interferon (IFN) signaling is induced by these treatments. However, the
      underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. Expression of a set of
      IFN-stimulated genes comprises an IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature
      (IRDS), which correlates strongly with resistance to radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy across different tumors. Classically, during viral infection, the
      presence of foreign DNA in the cytoplasm of host cells can initiate type I IFN
      signaling. Here, we demonstrate that DNA-damaging modalities used during cancer
      therapy lead to the release of ssDNA fragments from the cell nucleus into the
      cytosol, engaging this innate immune response. We found that the factors that
      control DNA end resection during double-strand break repair, including the Bloom 
      syndrome (BLM) helicase and exonuclease 1 (EXO1), play a major role in generating
      these DNA fragments and that the cytoplasmic 3'-5' exonuclease Trex1 is required 
      for their degradation. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles in breast tumors
      demonstrates that those with lower Trex1 and higher BLM and EXO1 expression
      levels are associated with poor prognosis. Targeting BLM and EXO1 could therefore
      represent a novel approach for circumventing the IRDS produced in response to
      cancer therapeutics.

TI  - High constitutive activity of a broad panel of housekeeping and tissue-specific
      cis-regulatory elements depends on a subset of ETS proteins.
PG  - 399-412
LID - 10.1101/gad.293134.116 [doi]
AB  - Enhancers and promoters that control the transcriptional output of terminally
      differentiated cells include cell type-specific and broadly active housekeeping
      elements. Whether the high constitutive activity of these two groups of
      cis-regulatory elements relies on entirely distinct or instead also on shared
      regulators is unknown. By dissecting the cis-regulatory repertoire of
      macrophages, we found that the ELF subfamily of ETS proteins selectively bound
      within 60 base pairs (bp) from the transcription start sites of highly active
      housekeeping genes. ELFs also bound constitutively active, but not poised,
      macrophage-specific enhancers and promoters. The role of ELFs in promoting
      high-level constitutive transcription was suggested by multiple evidence: ELF
      sites enabled robust transcriptional activation by endogenous and minimal
      synthetic promoters, ELF recruitment was stabilized by the transcriptional
      machinery, and ELF proteins mediated recruitment of transcriptional and chromatin
      regulators to core promoters. These data suggest that the co-optation of a
      limited number of highly active transcription factors represents a broadly
      adopted strategy to equip both cell type-specific and housekeeping cis-regulatory
      elements with the ability to efficiently promote transcription.

TI  - Pancreatic alpha- and beta-cellular clocks have distinct molecular properties and
      impact on islet hormone secretion and gene expression.

AB  - A critical role of circadian oscillators in orchestrating insulin secretion and
      islet gene transcription has been demonstrated recently. However, these studies
      focused on whole islets and did not explore the interplay between alpha-cell and 
      beta-cell clocks. We performed a parallel analysis of the molecular properties of
      alpha-cell and beta-cell oscillators using a mouse model expressing three
      reporter genes: one labeling alpha cells, one specific for beta cells, and a
      third monitoring circadian gene expression. Thus, phase entrainment properties,
      gene expression, and functional outputs of the alpha-cell and beta-cell
      clockworks could be assessed in vivo and in vitro at the population and
      single-cell level. These experiments showed that alpha-cellular and beta-cellular
      clocks are oscillating with distinct phases in vivo and in vitro. Diurnal
      transcriptome analysis in separated alpha and beta cells revealed that a high
      number of genes with key roles in islet physiology, including regulators of
      glucose sensing and hormone secretion, are differentially expressed in these cell
      types. Moreover, temporal insulin and glucagon secretion exhibited distinct
      oscillatory profiles both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data indicate
      that differential entrainment characteristics of circadian alpha-cell and
      beta-cell clocks are an important feature in the temporal coordination of
      endocrine function and gene expression.

TI  - Mcm10 regulates DNA replication elongation by stimulating the CMG replicative
      helicase.
PG  - 291-305
LID - 10.1101/gad.291336.116 [doi]
AB  - Activation of the Mcm2-7 replicative DNA helicase is the committed step in
      eukaryotic DNA replication initiation. Although Mcm2-7 activation requires
      binding of the helicase-activating proteins Cdc45 and GINS (forming the CMG
      complex), an additional protein, Mcm10, drives initial origin DNA unwinding by an
      unknown mechanism. We show that Mcm10 binds a conserved motif located between the
      oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide fold (OB-fold) and A subdomain of Mcm2. Although 
      buried in the interface between these domains in Mcm2-7 structures, mutations
      predicted to separate the domains and expose this motif restore growth to
      conditional-lethal MCM10 mutant cells. We found that, in addition to stimulating 
      initial DNA unwinding, Mcm10 stabilizes Cdc45 and GINS association with Mcm2-7
      and stimulates replication elongation in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we
      identified a lethal allele of MCM10 that stimulates initial DNA unwinding but is 
      defective in replication elongation and CMG binding. Our findings expand the
      roles of Mcm10 during DNA replication and suggest a new model for Mcm10 function 
      as an activator of the CMG complex throughout DNA replication.

TI  - Cbx3 maintains lineage specificity during neural differentiation.
PG  - 241-246
LID - 10.1101/gad.292169.116 [doi]
AB  - Chromobox homolog 3 (Cbx3/heterochromatin protein 1gamma [HP1gamma]) stimulates
      cell differentiation, but its mechanism is unknown. We found that Cbx3 binds to
      gene promoters upon differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to
      neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and recruits the Mediator subunit Med26. RNAi
      knockdown of either Cbx3 or Med26 inhibits neural differentiation while
      up-regulating genes involved in mesodermal lineage decisions. Thus, Cbx3 and
      Med26 together ensure the fidelity of lineage specification by enhancing the
      expression of neural genes and down-regulating genes specific to alternative
      fates.

LID - 10.1101/gad.294389.116 [doi]
AB  - Following differentiation during fetal development, beta cells further adapt to
      their postnatal role through functional maturation. While adult islets are
      thought to contain functionally mature beta cells, recent analyses of transgenic 
      rodent and human pancreata reveal a number of novel heterogeneity markers in
      mammalian beta cells. The marked heterogeneity long after maturation raises the
      prospect that diverse populations harbor distinct roles aside from
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In this review, we outline our current
      understanding of the beta-cell maturation process, emphasize recent literature on
      novel heterogeneity markers, and offer perspectives on reconciling the findings
      from these two areas.

AB  - Anomalies in dismantling the machinery of DNA replication can compromise genome
      integrity and contribute to tumorigenesis and aging. In this issue of Genes &
      Development, Dewar and colleagues (pp. 275-290) identified an E3 ubiquitin
      ligase, CUL2(LRR2), that modifies a subunit of the replicative CMG (Cdc45,
      minichromosome maintenance [MCM] subunits 2-7, and the GINS complex) helicase and
      triggers disassembly of the replication machinery. Their study offers critical
      insight into the mechanism of DNA replication termination while at the same time 
      raising important questions for future research.

AB  - Macrophages play an important role in tumor promotion, usually acting as
      facilitators of cancer initiation and progression. However, it is not clear how
      macrophages impact early phases of tumorigenesis. Using genetically modified
      mouse models, Guo et al. (pp. 247-259) demonstrated that tumor-initiating cells
      with an activated Hippo pathway are able to recruit macrophages starting from the
      very early phases of cancer development, mainly through direct activation of
      genes encoding macrophage chemoattractants and survival factors. The recruited
      macrophages were of vital importance for protection of tumor-initiating cells
      against eradication by lymphocyte-mediated immune surveillance. Such a tight link
      between macrophages and a pathway controlling organ development and size may
      reflect the normal role of these cells in tissue morphogenesis.

TI  - ATR inhibition disrupts rewired homologous recombination and fork protection
      pathways in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA-deficient cancer cells.
PG  - 318-332
LID - 10.1101/gad.290957.116 [doi]
AB  - Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) selectively kill
      BRCA1/2-deficient cells, but their efficacy in BRCA-deficient patients is limited
      by drug resistance. Here, we used derived cell lines and cells from patients to
      investigate how to overcome PARPi resistance. We found that the functions of
      BRCA1 in homologous recombination (HR) and replication fork protection are
      sequentially bypassed during the acquisition of PARPi resistance. Despite the
      lack of BRCA1, PARPi-resistant cells regain RAD51 loading to DNA double-stranded 
      breaks (DSBs) and stalled replication forks, enabling two distinct mechanisms of 
      PARPi resistance. Compared with BRCA1-proficient cells, PARPi-resistant
      BRCA1-deficient cells are increasingly dependent on ATR for survival. ATR
      inhibitors (ATRis) disrupt BRCA1-independent RAD51 loading to DSBs and stalled
      forks in PARPi-resistant BRCA1-deficient cells, overcoming both resistance
      mechanisms. In tumor cells derived from patients, ATRis also overcome the bypass 
      of BRCA1/2 in fork protection. Thus, ATR inhibition is a unique strategy to
      overcome the PARPi resistance of BRCA-deficient cancers.

TI  - ZMYM3 regulates BRCA1 localization at damaged chromatin to promote DNA repair.
PG  - 260-274
LID - 10.1101/gad.292516.116 [doi]
AB  - Chromatin connects DNA damage response factors to sites of damaged DNA to promote
      the signaling and repair of DNA lesions. The histone H2A variants H2AX, H2AZ, and
      macroH2A represent key chromatin constituents that facilitate DNA repair. Through
      proteomic screening of these variants, we identified ZMYM3 (zinc finger,
      myeloproliferative, and mental retardation-type 3) as a chromatin-interacting
      protein that promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). ZMYM3 is
      recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through bivalent interactions with both
      histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. We show that ZMYM3 links the HR
      factor BRCA1 to damaged chromatin through specific interactions with components
      of the BRCA1-A subcomplex, including ABRA1 and RAP80. By regulating ABRA1
      recruitment to damaged chromatin, ZMYM3 facilitates the fine-tuning of BRCA1
      interactions with DNA damage sites and chromatin. Consistent with a role in
      regulating BRCA1 function, ZMYM3 deficiency results in impaired HR repair and
      genome instability. Thus, our work identifies a critical chromatin-binding DNA
      damage response factor, ZMYM3, which modulates BRCA1 functions within chromatin
      to ensure the maintenance of genome integrity.

TI  - CRL2(Lrr1) promotes unloading of the vertebrate replisome from chromatin during
      replication termination.
PG  - 275-290
LID - 10.1101/gad.291799.116 [doi]
AB  - A key event during eukaryotic replication termination is the removal of the CMG
      helicase from chromatin. CMG unloading involves ubiquitylation of its Mcm7
      subunit and the action of the p97 ATPase. Using a proteomic screen in Xenopus egg
      extracts, we identified factors that are enriched on chromatin when CMG unloading
      is blocked. This approach identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL2(Lrr1), a
      specific p97 complex, other potential regulators of termination, and many
      replisome components. We show that Mcm7 ubiquitylation and CRL2(Lrr1) binding to 
      chromatin are temporally linked and occur only during replication termination. In
      the absence of CRL2(Lrr1), Mcm7 is not ubiquitylated, CMG unloading is inhibited,
      and a large subcomplex of the vertebrate replisome that includes DNA Pol epsilon 
      is retained on DNA. Our data identify CRL2(Lrr1) as a master regulator of
      replisome disassembly during vertebrate DNA replication termination.

TI  - Natural variation and dosage of the HEI10 meiotic E3 ligase control Arabidopsis
      crossover recombination.

AB  - During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo crossover recombination, which
      creates genetic diversity and balances homolog segregation. Despite these
      critical functions, crossover frequency varies extensively within and between
      species. Although natural crossover recombination modifier loci have been
      detected in plants, causal genes have remained elusive. Using natural Arabidopsis
      thaliana accessions, we identified two major recombination quantitative trait
      loci (rQTLs) that explain 56.9% of crossover variation in ColxLer F2 populations.
      We mapped rQTL1 to semidominant polymorphisms in HEI10, which encodes a conserved
      ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates crossovers. Null hei10 mutants are
      haploinsufficient, and, using genome-wide mapping and immunocytology, we show
      that transformation of additional HEI10 copies is sufficient to more than double 
      euchromatic crossovers. However, heterochromatic centromeres remained
      recombination-suppressed. The strongest HEI10-mediated crossover increases occur 
      in subtelomeric euchromatin, which is reminiscent of sex differences in
      Arabidopsis recombination. Our work reveals that HEI10 naturally limits
      Arabidopsis crossovers and has the potential to influence the response to
      selection.

      macrophages.
PG  - 247-259
LID - 10.1101/gad.294348.116 [doi]
AB  - Tumor infiltrated type II (M2) macrophages promote tumorigenesis by suppressing
      immune clearance, promoting proliferation, and stimulating angiogenesis.
      Interestingly, macrophages were also found to enrich in small foci of altered
      hepatocytes containing liver tumor-initiating cells (TICs). However, whether and 
      how TICs specifically recruit macrophages and the function of these macrophages
      in tumor initiation remain unknown due to technical difficulties. In this study, 
      by generating genetically defined liver TICs, we demonstrate that TICs actively
      recruit M2 macrophages from as early as the single-cell stage. Elimination of
      TIC-associated macrophages (TICAMs) abolishes tumorigenesis in a manner dependent
      on the immune system. Mechanistically, activation of the Hippo pathway effector
      Yes-associated protein (YAP) underlies macrophage recruitment by TICs. These
      results demonstrate for the first time that macrophages play a decisive role in
      the survival of single TICs in vivo and provide a proof of principle for TIC
      elimination by targeting YAP or M2 macrophages.

AB  - The ability to maintain and expand the pool of adipocytes in adults is integral
      to the regulation of energy balance, tissue/stem cell homeostasis, and disease
      pathogenesis. For decades, our knowledge of adipocyte precursors has relied on
      cellular models. The identity of native adipocyte precursors has remained
      unclear. Recent studies have identified distinct adipocyte precursor populations 
      that are physiologically regulated and contribute to the development,
      maintenance, and expansion of adipocyte pools in mice. With new tools available, 
      the properties of adipocyte precursors can now be defined, and the regulation and
      function of adipose plasticity in development and physiology can be explored.

      biological outcomes.
PG  - 101-126
LID - 10.1101/gad.291518.116 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of poly(ADP-ribose) >50 years ago opened a new field, leading the
      way for the discovery of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes
      and the ADP-ribosylation reactions that they catalyze. Although the field was
      initially focused primarily on the biochemistry and molecular biology of PARP-1
      in DNA damage detection and repair, the mechanistic and functional understanding 
      of the role of PARPs in different biological processes has grown considerably of 
      late. This has been accompanied by a shift of focus from enzymology to a search
      for substrates as well as the first attempts to determine the functional
      consequences of site-specific ADP-ribosylation on those substrates. Supporting
      these advances is a host of methodological approaches from chemical biology,
      proteomics, genomics, cell biology, and genetics that have propelled new
      discoveries in the field. New findings on the diverse roles of PARPs in chromatin
      regulation, transcription, RNA biology, and DNA repair have been complemented by 
      recent advances that link ADP-ribosylation to stress responses, metabolism, viral
      infections, and cancer. These studies have begun to reveal the promising ways in 
      which PARPs may be targeted therapeutically for the treatment of disease. In this
      review, we discuss these topics and relate them to the future directions of the
      field.

AB  - The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential and conserved protein complex that can
      degrade or process RNA substrates in the 3'-to-5' direction. Since its discovery 
      nearly two decades ago, studies have focused on determining how the exosome,
      along with associated cofactors, achieves the demanding task of targeting
      particular RNAs for degradation and/or processing in both the nucleus and
      cytoplasm. In this review, we highlight recent advances that have illuminated
      roles for the RNA exosome and its cofactors in specific biological pathways,
      alongside studies that attempted to dissect these activities through structural
      and biochemical characterization of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA exosome
      complexes.

AB  - The organization of the genome within the confines of the nuclear compartment is 
      considered a key contributor to transcription and DNA replication, repair, and
      recombination. A typical higher eukaryotic cell has a spherical nucleus that is
      approximately 10 microm in diameter. This is not the case for a neutrophil, a
      short-lived innate immune cell with an unusual multilobular nuclear structure
      that may serve purposes outside nuclear functions. In this issue of Genes &
      Development, Zhu and colleagues (pp. 141-153) investigate the neutrophil's genome
      organization and the mechanisms that contribute to its unique nuclear shape.

TI  - A single transcription factor is sufficient to induce and maintain secretory cell
      architecture.
PG  - 154-171
LID - 10.1101/gad.285684.116 [doi]
AB  - We hypothesized that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) MIST1 (BHLHA15) is a "scaling 
      factor" that universally establishes secretory morphology in cells that perform
      regulated secretion. Here, we show that targeted deletion of MIST1 caused
      dismantling of the secretory apparatus of diverse exocrine cells. Parietal cells 
      (PCs), whose function is to pump acid into the stomach, normally lack MIST1 and
      do not perform regulated secretion. Forced expression of MIST1 in PCs caused them
      to expand their apical cytoplasm, rearrange mitochondrial/lysosome trafficking,
      and generate large secretory granules. Mist1 induced a cohort of genes regulated 
      by MIST1 in multiple organs but did not affect PC function. MIST1 bound
      CATATG/CAGCTG E boxes in the first intron of genes that regulate
      autophagosome/lysosomal degradation, mitochondrial trafficking, and amino acid
      metabolism. Similar alterations in cell architecture and gene expression were
      also caused by ectopically inducing MIST1 in vivo in hepatocytes. Thus, MIST1 is 
      a scaling factor necessary and sufficient by itself to induce and maintain
      secretory cell architecture. Our results indicate that, whereas mature cell types
      in each organ may have unique developmental origins, cells performing similar
      physiological functions throughout the body share similar transcription
      factor-mediated architectural "blueprints."

TI  - Ubiquitylation activates a peptidase that promotes cleavage and destabilization

      proliferation in Arabidopsis.

LID - 10.1101/gad.292235.116 [doi]
AB  - The characteristic shapes and sizes of organs are established by cell
      proliferation patterns and final cell sizes, but the underlying molecular
      mechanisms coordinating these are poorly understood. Here we characterize a
      ubiquitin-activated peptidase called DA1 that limits the duration of cell
      proliferation during organ growth in Arabidopsis thaliana The peptidase is
      activated by two RING E3 ligases, Big Brother (BB) and DA2, which are
      subsequently cleaved by the activated peptidase and destabilized. In the case of 
      BB, cleavage leads to destabilization by the RING E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS 1 (PRT1) 
      of the N-end rule pathway. DA1 peptidase activity also cleaves the deubiquitylase
      UBP15, which promotes cell proliferation, and the transcription factors TEOSINTE 
      BRANCED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF 15 (TCP15) and TCP22, which promote cell proliferation
      and repress endoreduplication. We propose that DA1 peptidase activity regulates
      the duration of cell proliferation and the transition to endoreduplication and
      differentiation during organ formation in plants by coordinating the
      destabilization of regulatory proteins.

TI  - A genetic interaction analysis identifies cancer drivers that modify EGFR
      dependency.
PG  - 184-196
LID - 10.1101/gad.291948.116 [doi]
AB  - A large number of cancer drivers have been identified through tumor sequencing
      efforts, but how they interact and the degree to which they can substitute for
      each other have not been systematically explored. To comprehensively investigate 
      how cancer drivers genetically interact, we searched for modifiers of epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) dependency by performing CRISPR, shRNA, and
      expression screens in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model. We elucidated a
      broad spectrum of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes (OGs) that can
      genetically modify proliferation and survival of cancer cells when EGFR signaling
      is altered. These include genes already known to mediate EGFR inhibitor
      resistance as well as many TSGs not previously connected to EGFR and whose
      biological functions in tumorigenesis are not well understood. We show that
      mutation of PBRM1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, attenuates the effects of
      EGFR inhibition in part by sustaining AKT signaling. We also show that mutation
      of Capicua (CIC), a transcriptional repressor, suppresses the effects of EGFR
      inhibition by partially restoring the EGFR-promoted gene expression program,
      including the sustained expression of Ets transcription factors such as ETV1
      Together, our data provide strong support for the hypothesis that many cancer
      drivers can substitute for each other in certain contexts and broaden our
      understanding of EGFR regulation.

AB  - Neutrophils are responsible for the first line of defense against invading
      pathogens. Their nuclei are uniquely structured as multiple lobes that establish 
      a highly constrained nuclear environment. Here we found that neutrophil
      differentiation was not associated with large-scale changes in the number and
      sizes of topologically associating domains (TADs). However, neutrophil genomes
      were enriched for long-range genomic interactions that spanned multiple TADs.
      Population-based simulation of spherical and toroid genomes revealed declining
      radii of gyration for neutrophil chromosomes. We found that neutrophil genomes
      were highly enriched for heterochromatic genomic interactions across vast genomic
      distances, a process named supercontraction. Supercontraction involved genomic
      regions located in the heterochromatic compartment in both progenitors and
      neutrophils or genomic regions that switched from the euchromatic to the
      heterochromatic compartment during neutrophil differentiation. Supercontraction
      was accompanied by the repositioning of centromeres, pericentromeres, and long
      interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) to the neutrophil nuclear lamina. We found 
      that Lamin B receptor expression was required to attach centromeric and
      pericentromeric repeats but not LINE-1 elements to the lamina. Differentiating
      neutrophils also repositioned ribosomal DNA and mininucleoli to the lamina-a
      process that was closely associated with sharply reduced ribosomal RNA
      expression. We propose that large-scale chromatin reorganization involving
      supercontraction and recruitment of heterochromatin and nucleoli to the nuclear
      lamina facilitates the folding of the neutrophil genome into a confined geometry 
      imposed by a multilobed nuclear architecture.

TI  - miRNAs cooperate in apoptosis regulation during C. elegans development.
PG  - 209-222
LID - 10.1101/gad.288555.116 [doi]
AB  - Programmed cell death occurs in a highly reproducible manner during
      Caenorhabditis elegans development. We demonstrate that, during embryogenesis,
      miR-35 and miR-58 bantam family microRNAs (miRNAs) cooperate to prevent the
      precocious death of mothers of cells programmed to die by repressing the gene
      egl-1, which encodes a proapoptotic BH3-only protein. In addition, we present
      evidence that repression of egl-1 is dependent on binding sites for miR-35 and
      miR-58 family miRNAs within the egl-1 3' untranslated region (UTR), which affect 
      both mRNA copy number and translation. Furthermore, using single-molecule RNA
      fluorescent in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH), we show that egl-1 is transcribed
      in the mother of a cell programmed to die and that miR-35 and miR-58 family
      miRNAs prevent this mother from dying by keeping the copy number of egl-1 mRNA
      below a critical threshold. Finally, miR-35 and miR-58 family miRNAs can also
      dampen the transcriptional boost of egl-1 that occurs specifically in a daughter 
      cell that is programmed to die. We propose that miRNAs compensate for
      lineage-specific differences in egl-1 transcriptional activation, thus ensuring
      that EGL-1 activity reaches the threshold necessary to trigger death only in
      daughter cells that are programmed to die.

TI  - The senescence-associated secretory phenotype induces cellular plasticity and
      tissue regeneration.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1101/gad.290635.116 [doi]
AB  - Senescence is a form of cell cycle arrest induced by stress such as DNA damage
      and oncogenes. However, while arrested, senescent cells secrete a variety of
      proteins collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
      (SASP), which can reinforce the arrest and induce senescence in a paracrine
      manner. However, the SASP has also been shown to favor embryonic development,
      wound healing, and even tumor growth, suggesting more complex physiological roles
      than currently understood. Here we uncover timely new functions of the SASP in
      promoting a proregenerative response through the induction of cell plasticity and
      stemness. We show that primary mouse keratinocytes transiently exposed to the
      SASP exhibit increased expression of stem cell markers and regenerative capacity 
      in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to the SASP causes a subsequent
      cell-intrinsic senescence arrest to counter the continued regenerative stimuli.
      Finally, by inducing senescence in single cells in vivo in the liver, we
      demonstrate that this activates tissue-specific expression of stem cell markers. 
      Together, this work uncovers a primary and beneficial role for the SASP in
      promoting cell plasticity and tissue regeneration and introduces the concept that
      transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be harnessed to drive
      tissue regeneration.

TI  - The PIDDosome activates p53 in response to supernumerary centrosomes.
PG  - 34-45
LID - 10.1101/gad.289728.116 [doi]
AB  - Centrosomes, the main microtubule-organizing centers in animal cells, are
      replicated exactly once during the cell division cycle to form the poles of the
      mitotic spindle. Supernumerary centrosomes can lead to aberrant cell division and
      have been causally linked to chromosomal instability and cancer. Here, we report 
      that an increase in the number of mature centrosomes, generated by disrupting
      cytokinesis or forcing centrosome overduplication, triggers the activation of the
      PIDDosome multiprotein complex, leading to Caspase-2-mediated MDM2 cleavage, p53 
      stabilization, and p21-dependent cell cycle arrest. This pathway also restrains
      the extent of developmentally scheduled polyploidization by regulating p53 levels
      in hepatocytes during liver organogenesis. Taken together, the PIDDosome acts as 
      a first barrier, engaging p53 to halt the proliferation of cells carrying more
      than one mature centrosome to maintain genome integrity.

      repair.
PG  - 3-5
LID - 10.1101/gad.295923.117 [doi]
AB  - In this issue of Genes & Development, Gong and colleagues (pp. 46-58) bring to
      light a functional role for plant homeodomain finger 11 (PHF11) in 5' end
      resection at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Using the proteomics of isolated
      chromatin segments (PICh) technique to purify deprotected telomeres, PHF11 was
      enriched as cells mounted a DNA damage response (DDR) against exposed chromosome 
      ends. The study reveals interactions between PHF11 and multiple DNA repair
      proteins and suggests that PHF11 mediates 5' end resection by negotiating
      RPA-coated DNA repair intermediates. This finding provides a novel context for
      mediator-catalyzed RPA exchanges during the multistep process of homologous
      recombination (HR).

AB  - Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is dictated in part by core promoter 
      elements, which are DNA sequences flanking the transcription start site (TSS)
      that help direct the proper initiation of transcription. Taking advantage of
      recent advances in genome-wide sequencing approaches, Vo ngoc and colleagues (pp.
      6-11) identified transcripts with focused sites of initiation and found that many
      were transcribed from promoters containing a new consensus sequence for the human
      initiator (Inr) core promoter element.

TI  - Live-cell analysis of DNA methylation during sexual reproduction in Arabidopsis
      reveals context and sex-specific dynamics controlled by noncanonical RdDM.
PG  - 72-83
LID - 10.1101/gad.289397.116 [doi]
AB  - Cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic mark in many organisms, important for
      both transcriptional control and genome integrity. While relatively stable during
      somatic growth, DNA methylation is reprogrammed genome-wide during mammalian
      reproduction. Reprogramming is essential for zygotic totipotency and to prevent
      transgenerational inheritance of epimutations. However, the extent of DNA
      methylation reprogramming in plants remains unclear. Here, we developed sensors
      reporting with single-cell resolution CG and non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis.
      Live imaging during reproduction revealed distinct and sex-specific dynamics for 
      both contexts. We found that CHH methylation in the egg cell depends on DOMAINS
      REARRANGED METHYLASE 2 (DRM2) and RNA polymerase V (Pol V), two main actors of
      RNA-directed DNA methylation, but does not depend on Pol IV. Our sensors provide 
      insight into global DNA methylation dynamics at the single-cell level with high
      temporal resolution and offer a powerful tool to track CG and non-CG methylation 
      both during development and in response to environmental cues in all organisms
      with methylated DNA, as we illustrate in mouse embryonic stem cells.

TI  - PHF11 promotes DSB resection, ATR signaling, and HR.
PG  - 46-58
LID - 10.1101/gad.291807.116 [doi]
AB  - Resection of double-strand breaks (DSBs) plays a critical role in their detection
      and appropriate repair. The 3' ssDNA protrusion formed through resection
      activates the ATR-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) and is required for DSB
      repair by homologous recombination (HR). Here we report that PHF11 (plant
      homeodomain finger 11) encodes a previously unknown DDR factor involved in 5' end
      resection, ATR signaling, and HR. PHF11 was identified based on its association
      with deprotected telomeres and localized to sites of DNA damage in S phase.
      Depletion of PHF11 diminished the ATR signaling response to telomere dysfunction 
      and genome-wide DNA damage, reduced end resection at sites of DNA damage,
      resulted in compromised HR and misrejoining of S-phase DSBs, and increased the
      sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. PHF11 interacted with the ssDNA-binding
      protein RPA and was found in a complex with several nucleases, including the 5'
      dsDNA exonuclease EXO1. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that PHF11
      stimulates EXO1 by overcoming its inhibition by RPA, suggesting that PHF11 acts
      (in part) by promoting 5' end resection at RPA-bound sites of DNA damage. These
      findings reveal a role for PHF11 in DSB resection, DNA damage signaling, and DSB 
      repair.

PG  - 12-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.291195.116 [doi]
AB  - Global DNA demethylation is a hallmark of embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.
      However, embryos engage noncanonical DNA methylation maintenance mechanisms to
      ensure inheritance of exceptional epigenetic germline features to the soma.
      Besides the paradigmatic genomic imprints, these exceptions remain ill-defined,
      and the mechanisms ensuring demethylation resistance in the light of global
      reprogramming remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Y-linked gene
      Rbmy1a1 is highly methylated in mature sperm and resists DNA demethylation
      post-fertilization. Aberrant hypomethylation of the Rbmy1a1 promoter results in
      its ectopic activation, causing male-specific peri-implantation lethality.
      Rbmy1a1 is a novel target of the TRIM28 complex, which is required to protect its
      repressive epigenetic state during embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.

TI  - Targeted CRISPR disruption reveals a role for RNase MRP RNA in human preribosomal
      RNA processing.
PG  - 59-71
LID - 10.1101/gad.286963.116 [doi]
AB  - MRP RNA is an abundant, essential noncoding RNA whose functions have been
      proposed in yeast but are incompletely understood in humans. Mutations in the
      genomic locus for MRP RNA cause pleiotropic human diseases, including cartilage
      hair hypoplasia (CHH). Here we applied CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to disrupt the 
      endogenous human MRP RNA locus, thereby attaining what has eluded RNAi and RNase 
      H experiments: elimination of MRP RNA in the majority of cells. The resulting
      accumulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor-analyzed by RNA fluorescent in
      situ hybridization (FISH), Northern blots, and RNA sequencing-implicates MRP RNA 
      in pre-rRNA processing. Amelioration of pre-rRNA imbalance is achieved through
      rescue of MRP RNA levels by ectopic expression. Furthermore, affinity-purified
      MRP ribonucleoprotein (RNP) from HeLa cells cleaves the human pre-rRNA in vitro
      at at least one site used in cells, while RNP isolated from cells with
      CRISPR-edited MRP loci loses this activity, and ectopic MRP RNA expression
      restores cleavage activity. Thus, a role for RNase MRP in human pre-rRNA
      processing is established. As demonstrated here, targeted CRISPR disruption is a 
      valuable tool for functional studies of essential noncoding RNAs that are
      resistant to RNAi and RNase H-based degradation.

AB  - DNA sequence signals in the core promoter, such as the initiator (Inr), direct
      transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Here we show that the human Inr
      has the consensus of BBCA+1BW at focused promoters in which transcription
      initiates at a single site or a narrow cluster of sites. The analysis of 7678
      focused transcription start sites revealed 40% with a perfect match to the Inr
      and 16% with a single mismatch outside of the CA+1 core. TATA-like sequences are 
      underrepresented in Inr promoters. This consensus is a key component of the DNA
      sequence rules that specify transcription initiation in humans.

TI  - Translation reprogramming is an evolutionarily conserved driver of phenotypic
      plasticity and therapeutic resistance in melanoma.
PG  - 18-33
LID - 10.1101/gad.290940.116 [doi]
AB  - The intratumor microenvironment generates phenotypically distinct but
      interconvertible malignant cell subpopulations that fuel metastatic spread and
      therapeutic resistance. Whether different microenvironmental cues impose invasive
      or therapy-resistant phenotypes via a common mechanism is unknown. In melanoma,
      low expression of the lineage survival oncogene microphthalmia-associated
      transcription factor (MITF) correlates with invasion, senescence, and drug
      resistance. However, how MITF is suppressed in vivo and how MITF-low cells in
      tumors escape senescence are poorly understood. Here we show that
      microenvironmental cues, including inflammation-mediated resistance to adoptive
      T-cell immunotherapy, transcriptionally repress MITF via ATF4 in response to
      inhibition of translation initiation factor eIF2B. ATF4, a key transcription
      mediator of the integrated stress response, also activates AXL and suppresses
      senescence to impose the MITF-low/AXL-high drug-resistant phenotype observed in
      human tumors. However, unexpectedly, without translation reprogramming an
      ATF4-high/MITF-low state is insufficient to drive invasion. Importantly,
      translation reprogramming dramatically enhances tumorigenesis and is linked to a 
      previously unexplained gene expression program associated with anti-PD-1
      immunotherapy resistance. Since we show that inhibition of eIF2B also drives
      neural crest migration and yeast invasiveness, our results suggest that
      translation reprogramming, an evolutionarily conserved starvation response, has
      been hijacked by microenvironmental stress signals in melanoma to drive
      phenotypic plasticity and invasion and determine therapeutic outcome.

TI  - The piggyBac transposon-derived genes TPB1 and TPB6 mediate essential
      transposon-like excision during the developmental rearrangement of key genes in
      Tetrahymena thermophila.
PG  - 2724-2736
LID - 10.1101/gad.290460.116 [doi]
AB  - Ciliated protozoans perform extreme forms of programmed somatic DNA rearrangement
      during development. The model ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila removes 34% of its 
      germline micronuclear genome from somatic macronuclei by excising thousands of
      internal eliminated sequences (IESs), a process that shares features with
      transposon excision. Indeed, piggyBac transposon-derived genes are necessary for 
      genome-wide IES excision in both Tetrahymena (TPB2 [Tetrahymena piggyBac-like 2] 
      and LIA5) and Paramecium tetraurelia (PiggyMac). T. thermophila has at least
      three other piggyBac-derived genes: TPB1, TPB6, and TPB7 Here, we show that TPB1 
      and TPB6 excise a small, distinct set of 12 unusual IESs that disrupt exons.
      TPB1-deficient cells complete mating, but their progeny exhibit slow growth,
      giant vacuoles, and osmotic shock sensitivity due to retention of an IES in the
      vacuolar gene DOP1 (Dopey domain-containing protein). Unlike most IESs,
      TPB1-dependent IESs have piggyBac-like terminal inverted motifs that are
      necessary for excision. Transposon-like excision mediated by TPB1 and TPB6
      provides direct evidence for a transposon origin of not only IES excision
      machinery but also IESs themselves. Our study highlights a division of labor
      among ciliate piggyBac-derived genes, which carry out mutually exclusive
      categories of excision events mediated by either transposon-like features or
      RNA-directed heterochromatin.

TI  - SF3B1/Hsh155 HEAT motif mutations affect interaction with the spliceosomal ATPase
      Prp5, resulting in altered branch site selectivity in pre-mRNA splicing.
PG  - 2710-2723
LID - 10.1101/gad.291872.116 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the U2 snRNP component SF3B1 are prominent in myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDSs) and other cancers and have been shown recently to alter branch
      site (BS) or 3' splice site selection in splicing. However, the molecular
      mechanism of altered splicing is not known. We show here that hsh155 mutant
      alleles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, counterparts of SF3B1 mutations frequently
      found in cancers, specifically change splicing of suboptimal BS pre-mRNA
      substrates. We found that Hsh155p interacts directly with Prp5p, the first ATPase
      that acts during spliceosome assembly, and localized the interacting regions to
      HEAT (Huntingtin, EF3, PP2A, and TOR1) motifs in SF3B1 associated with disease
      mutations. Furthermore, we show that mutations in these motifs from both human
      disease and yeast genetic screens alter the physical interaction with Prp5p,
      alter branch region specification, and phenocopy mutations in Prp5p. These and
      other data demonstrate that mutations in Hsh155p and Prp5p alter splicing because
      they change the direct physical interaction between Hsh155p and Prp5p. This
      altered physical interaction results in altered loading (i.e., "fidelity") of the
      BS-U2 duplex into the SF3B complex during prespliceosome formation. These results
      provide a mechanistic framework to explain the consequences of intron recognition
      and splicing of SF3B1 mutations found in disease.

AB  - Disruption of apical-basal polarity is implicated in developmental disorders and 
      cancer; however, the mechanisms connecting cell polarity proteins with
      intracellular signaling pathways are largely unknown. We determined previously
      that membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein discs large homolog 5
      (DLG5) functions in cell polarity and regulates cellular proliferation and
      differentiation via undefined mechanisms. We report here that DLG5 functions as
      an evolutionarily conserved scaffold and negative regulator of Hippo signaling,
      which controls organ size through the modulation of cell proliferation and
      differentiation. Affinity purification/mass spectrometry revealed a critical role
      of DLG5 in the formation of protein assemblies containing core Hippo kinases
      mammalian ste20 homologs 1/2 (MST1/2) and Par-1 polarity proteins microtubule
      affinity-regulating kinases 1/2/3 (MARK1/2/3). Consistent with this finding,
      Hippo signaling is markedly hyperactive in mammalian Dlg5(-/-) tissues and cells 
      in vivo and ex vivo and in Drosophila upon dlg5 knockdown. Conditional deletion
      of Mst1/2 fully rescued the phenotypes of brain-specific Dlg5 knockout mice. Dlg5
      also interacts genetically with Hippo effectors Yap1/Taz Mechanistically, we show
      that DLG5 inhibits the association between MST1/2 and large tumor suppressor
      homologs 1/2 (LATS1/2), uses its scaffolding function to link MST1/2 with MARK3, 
      and inhibits MST1/2 kinase activity. These data reveal a direct connection
      between cell polarity proteins and Hippo, which is essential for proper
      development of multicellular organisms.

LID - 10.1101/gad.290122.116 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway
      are frequently identified in cancer. To identify pathways that support PI3K
      oncogenesis, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in isogenic cell lines
      harboring wild-type or mutant PIK3CA to search for PI3K synthetic-lethal (SL)
      genes. A combined analysis of these results with a meta-analysis of two other
      large-scale RNAi screening data sets in PI3K mutant cancer cell lines converged
      on ribosomal protein translation and proteasomal protein degradation as critical 
      nononcogene dependencies for PI3K-driven tumors. Genetic or pharmacologic
      inhibition of either pathway alone, but not together, selectively killed PI3K
      mutant tumor cells in an mTOR-dependent manner. The expression of ribosomal and
      proteasomal components was significantly up-regulated in primary human colorectal
      tumors harboring PI3K pathway activation. Importantly, a PI3K SL gene signature
      containing the top hits of the SL genes identified in our meta-analysis robustly 
      predicted overall patient survival in colorectal cancer, especially among
      patients with tumors with an activated PI3K pathway. These results suggest that
      disruption of protein turnover homeostasis via ribosome or proteasome inhibition 
      may be a novel treatment strategy for PI3K mutant human tumors.

PG  - 2669-2683
LID - 10.1101/gad.291021.116 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant activation of embryonic signaling pathways is frequent in pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), making developmental regulators therapeutically
      attractive. Here we demonstrate diverse functions for pancreatic and duodenal
      homeobox 1 (PDX1), a transcription factor indispensable for pancreas development,
      in the progression from normal exocrine cells to metastatic PDA. We identify a
      critical role for PDX1 in maintaining acinar cell identity, thus resisting the
      formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)-derived PDA. Upon
      neoplastic transformation, the role of PDX1 changes from tumor-suppressive to
      oncogenic. Interestingly, subsets of malignant cells lose PDX1 expression while
      undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and PDX1 loss is
      associated with poor outcome. This stage-specific functionality arises from
      profound shifts in PDX1 chromatin occupancy from acinar cells to PDA. In summary,
      we report distinct roles of PDX1 at different stages of PDA, suggesting that
      therapeutic approaches against this potential target need to account for its
      changing functions at different stages of carcinogenesis. These findings provide 
      insight into the complexity of PDA pathogenesis and advocate a rigorous
      investigation of therapeutically tractable targets at distinct phases of PDA
      development and progression.

LID - 10.1101/gad.288324.116 [doi]
AB  - The genome is organized into repeating topologically associated domains (TADs),
      each of which is spatially isolated from its neighbor by poorly understood
      boundary elements thought to be conserved across cell types. Here, we show that
      deletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor)-binding sites at TAD and sub-TAD
      topological boundaries that form within the HoxA and HoxC clusters during
      differentiation not only disturbs local chromatin domain organization and
      regulatory interactions but also results in homeotic transformations typical of
      Hox gene misregulation. Moreover, our data suggest that CTCF-dependent boundary
      function can be modulated by competing forces, such as the self-assembly of
      polycomb domains within the nucleus. Therefore, CTCF boundaries are not merely
      static structural components of the genome but instead are locally dynamic
      regulatory structures that control gene expression during development.

AB  - In many eukaryotes, siRNAs bound to Argonaute proteins guide chromatin-modifying 
      enzymes to complementary loci, resulting in transcriptional gene silencing.
      Multiple lines of evidence indicate that siRNAs base-pair with longer RNAs
      produced at target loci, but the possibility that siRNAs base-pair directly with 
      DNA remains an attractive hypothesis. In a recent study, Shimada et al. (pp.
      2571-2580) conducted experiments that address these alternative hypotheses,
      yielding additional evidence that fission yeast siRNA-Argonaute silencing
      complexes are recruited to target loci exclusively via interactions with nascent 
      transcripts.

TI  - Protein splicing of a recombinase intein induced by ssDNA and DNA damage.
PG  - 2663-2668
LID - 10.1101/gad.289280.116 [doi]
AB  - Inteins (or protein introns) autocatalytically excise themselves through protein 
      splicing. We challenge the long-considered notion that inteins are merely
      molecular parasites and posit that some inteins evolved to regulate host protein 
      function. Here we show substrate-induced and DNA damage-induced splicing, in
      which an archaeal recombinase RadA intein splices dramatically faster and more
      accurately when provided with ssDNA. This unprecedented example of intein
      splicing stimulation by the substrate of the invaded host protein provides
      compelling support in favor of inteins acting as pause buttons to arrest protein 
      function until needed; then, an immediate activity switch is triggered,
      representing a new form of post-translational control.

      from sperm chromatin.
PG  - 2651-2656
LID - 10.1101/gad.290916.116 [doi]
AB  - Cysteine oxidation in protamines leads to their oligomerization and contributes
      to sperm chromatin compaction. Here we identify the Drosophila thioredoxin
      Deadhead (DHD) as the factor responsible for the reduction of intermolecular
      disulfide bonds in protamines and their eviction from sperm during fertilization.
      Protamine chaperone TAP/p32 dissociates DNA-protamine complexes in vitro only
      when protamine oligomers are first converted to monomers by DHD. dhd-null embryos
      cannot decondense sperm chromatin and terminate development after the first
      pronuclear division. Therefore, the thioredoxin DHD plays a critical role in
      early development to facilitate the switch from protamine-based sperm chromatin
      structures to the somatic nucleosomal chromatin.

TI  - Myc/Mycn-mediated glycolysis enhances mouse spermatogonial stem cell
      self-renewal.
PG  - 2637-2648
LID - 10.1101/gad.287045.116 [doi]
AB  - Myc plays critical roles in the self-renewal division of various stem cell types.
      In spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), Myc controls SSC fate decisions because Myc 
      overexpression induces enhanced self-renewal division, while depletion of Max, a 
      Myc-binding partner, leads to meiotic induction. However, the mechanism by which 
      Myc acts on SSC fate is unclear. Here we demonstrate a critical link between
      Myc/Mycn gene activity and glycolysis in SSC self-renewal. In SSCs, Myc/Mycn are 
      regulated by Foxo1, whose deficiency impairs SSC self-renewal. Myc/Mycn-deficient
      SSCs not only undergo limited self-renewal division but also display diminished
      glycolytic activity. While inhibition of glycolysis decreased SSC activity,
      chemical stimulation of glycolysis or transfection of active Akt1 or Pdpk1
      (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 ) augmented self-renewal division,
      and long-term SSC cultures were derived from a nonpermissive strain that showed
      limited self-renewal division. These results suggested that Myc-mediated
      glycolysis is an important factor that increases the frequency of SSC
      self-renewal division.

TI  - p38MAPK builds a hyaluronan cancer niche to drive lung tumorigenesis.
PG  - 2623-2636
LID - 10.1101/gad.290346.116 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of neoplastic lesions generates the initial signal that instigates the 
      creation of a tumor niche. Nontransformed cell types within the microenvironment 
      continuously coevolve with tumor cells to promote tumorigenesis. Here, we
      identify p38MAPK as a key component of human lung cancer, and specifically
      stromal interactomes, which provides an early, protumorigenic signal in the
      tissue microenvironment. We found that lung cancer growth depends on
      short-distance cues produced by the cancer niche in a p38-dependent manner. We
      identified fibroblast-specific hyaluronan synthesis at the center of p38-driven
      tumorigenesis, which regulates early stromal fibroblast activation, the
      conversion to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and cancer cell
      proliferation. Systemic down-regulation of p38MAPK signaling in a knock-in model 
      with substitution of activating Tyr182 to phenylalanine or conditional ablation
      of p38 in fibroblasts has a significant tumor-suppressive effect on K-ras lung
      tumorigenesis. Furthermore, both Kras-driven mouse lung tumors and orthotopically
      grown primary human lung cancers show a significant sensitivity to both a
      chemical p38 inhibitor and an over-the-counter inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis.
      We propose that p38MAPK-hyaluronan-dependent reprogramming of the tumor
      microenvironment plays a critical role in driving lung tumorigenesis, while
      blocking this process could have far-reaching therapeutic implications.

TI  - An ensemble of regulatory elements controls Runx3 spatiotemporal expression in

AB  - The Runx3 transcription factor is essential for development and diversification
      of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) TrkC sensory neurons. In Runx3-deficient mice, 
      developing TrkC neurons fail to extend central and peripheral afferents, leading 
      to cell death and disruption of the stretch reflex circuit, resulting in severe
      limb ataxia. Despite its central role, the mechanisms underlying the
      spatiotemporal expression specificities of Runx3 in TrkC neurons were largely
      unknown. Here we first defined the genomic transcription unit encompassing
      regulatory elements (REs) that mediate the tissue-specific expression of Runx3.
      Using transgenic mice expressing BAC reporters spanning the Runx3 locus, we
      discovered three REs-dubbed R1, R2, and R3-that cross-talk with promoter-2 (P2)
      to drive TrkC neuron-specific Runx3 transcription. Deletion of single or multiple
      elements either in the BAC transgenics or by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated endogenous
      ablation established the REs' ability to promote and/or repress Runx3 expression 
      in developing sensory neurons. Our analysis reveals that an intricate
      combinatorial interplay among the three REs governs Runx3 expression in distinct 
      subtypes of TrkC neurons while concomitantly extinguishing its expression in
      non-TrkC neurons. These findings provide insights into the mechanism regulating
      cell type-specific expression and subtype diversification of TrkC neurons in
      developing DRGs.

AB  - RNA polymerase V (Pol V) long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to
      guide ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) to chromatin in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in
      plants. Here, we provide evidence, based on laser UV-assisted zero-length
      cross-linking, for functionally relevant AGO4-DNA interaction at RdDM targets. We
      further demonstrate that Pol V lncRNAs or the act of their transcription are
      required to lock Pol V holoenzyme into a stable DNA-bound state that allows AGO4 
      recruitment via redundant glycine-tryptophan/tryptophan-glycine AGO hook motifs
      present on both Pol V and its associated factor, SPT5L. We propose a model in
      which AGO4-DNA interaction could be responsible for the unique specificities of
      RdDM.

      insulin-producing cells.
PG  - 2596-2606
LID - 10.1101/gad.288258.116 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clocks regulate much of behavior and physiology, but the mechanisms by 
      which they do so remain poorly understood. While cyclic gene expression is
      thought to underlie metabolic rhythms, little is known about cycles in cellular
      physiology. We found that Drosophila insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which are
      located in the pars intercerebralis and lack an autonomous circadian clock, are
      functionally connected to the central circadian clock circuit via DN1 neurons.
      Insulin mediates circadian output by regulating the rhythmic expression of a
      metabolic gene (sxe2) in the fat body. Patch clamp electrophysiology reveals that
      IPCs display circadian clock-regulated daily rhythms in firing event frequency
      and bursting proportion under light:dark conditions. The activity of IPCs and the
      rhythmic expression of sxe2 are additionally regulated by feeding, as
      demonstrated by night feeding-induced changes in IPC firing characteristics and
      sxe2 levels in the fat body. These findings indicate circuit-level regulation of 
      metabolism by clock cells in Drosophila and support a role for the pars
      intercerebralis in integrating circadian control of behavior and physiology.

TI  - A phosphorylation-deubiquitination cascade regulates the BRCA2-RAD51 axis in
      homologous recombination.
PG  - 2581-2595
LID - 10.1101/gad.289439.116 [doi]
AB  - Homologous recombination (HR) is one of the major DNA double-strand break (DSB)
      repair pathways in mammalian cells. Defects in HR trigger genomic instability and
      result in cancer predisposition. The defining step of HR is homologous strand
      exchange directed by the protein RAD51, which is recruited to DSBs by BRCA2.
      However, the regulation of the BRCA2-RAD51 axis remains unclear. Here we report
      that ubiquitination of RAD51 hinders RAD51-BRCA2 interaction, while
      deubiquitination of RAD51 facilitates RAD51-BRCA2 binding and RAD51 recruitment
      and thus is critical for proper HR. Mechanistically, in response to DNA damage,
      the deubiquitinase UCHL3 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM. UCHL3, in turn, 
      deubiquitinates RAD51 and promotes the binding between RAD51 and BRCA2.
      Overexpression of UCHL3 renders breast cancer cells resistant to radiation and
      chemotherapy, while depletion of UCHL3 sensitizes cells to these treatments,
      suggesting a determinant role of UCHL3 in cancer therapy. Overall, we identify
      UCHL3 as a novel regulator of DNA repair and reveal a model in which a
      phosphorylation-deubiquitination cascade dynamically regulates the BRCA2-RAD51
      pathway.

AB  - Small RNAs regulate chromatin modification and transcriptional gene silencing
      across the eukaryotic kingdom. Although these processes have been well studied,
      fundamental mechanistic aspects remain obscure. Specifically, it is unclear
      exactly how small RNA-loaded Argonaute protein complexes target chromatin to
      mediate silencing. Here, using fission yeast, we demonstrate that transcription
      of the target locus is essential for RNA-directed formation of heterochromatin.
      However, high transcriptional activity is inhibitory; thus, a transcriptional
      window exists that is optimal for silencing. We further found that pre-mRNA
      splicing is compatible with RNA-directed heterochromatin formation. However, the 
      kinetics of pre-mRNA processing is critical. Introns close to the 5' end of a
      transcript that are rapidly spliced result in a bistable response whereby the
      target either remains euchromatic or becomes fully silenced. Together, our
      results discount siRNA-DNA base pairing in RNA-mediated heterochromatin
      formation, and the mechanistic insights further reveal guiding paradigms for the 
      design of small RNA-directed chromatin silencing studies in multicellular
      organisms.

TI  - RB localizes to DNA double-strand breaks and promotes DNA end resection and
      homologous recombination through the recruitment of BRG1.
PG  - 2500-2512
AB  - The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is recognized as a master regulator that
      controls entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Its loss leads to uncontrolled
      cell proliferation and is a hallmark of cancer. RB works by binding to members of
      the E2F family of transcription factors and recruiting chromatin modifiers to the
      promoters of E2F target genes. Here we show that RB also localizes to DNA
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on E2F1 and ATM kinase activity and
      promotes DSB repair through homologous recombination (HR), and its loss results
      in genome instability. RB is necessary for the recruitment of the BRG1 ATPase to 
      DSBs, which stimulates DNA end resection and HR. A knock-in mutation of the ATM
      phosphorylation site on E2F1 (S29A) prevents the interaction between E2F1 and
      TopBP1 and recruitment of RB, E2F1, and BRG1 to DSBs. This knock-in mutation also
      impairs DNA repair, increases genomic instability, and renders mice
      hypersensitive to IR. Importantly, depletion of RB in osteosarcoma and breast
      cancer cell lines results in sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs, which is further 
      exacerbated by poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We uncovered a
      novel, nontranscriptional function for RB in HR, which could contribute to genome
      instability associated with RB loss.

TI  - IMPs: an RNA-binding protein family that provides a link between stem cell
      maintenance in normal development and cancer.
PG  - 2459-2474
AB  - IMPs, also known as insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) messenger RNA
      (mRNA)-binding proteins (IGF2BPs), are highly conserved oncofetal RNA-binding
      proteins (RBPs) that regulate RNA processing at several levels, including
      localization, translation, and stability. Three mammalian IMP paralogs (IMP1-3)
      have been identified that are expressed in most organs during embryogenesis,
      where they are believed to play an important role in cell migration, metabolism, 
      and stem cell renewal. Whereas some IMP2 expression is retained in several adult 
      mouse organs, IMP1 and IMP3 are either absent or expressed at very low levels in 
      most tissues after birth. However, all three paralogs can be re-expressed upon
      malignant transformation and are found in a broad range of cancer types where
      their expression often correlates with poor prognosis. IMPs appear to resume
      their physiological functions in malignant cells, which not only contribute to
      tumor progression but participate in the establishment and maintenance of tumor
      cell hierarchies. This review summarizes our current understanding of the
      functions of IMPs during normal development and focuses on a series of recent
      observations that have provided new insight into how their physiological
      functions enable IMPs to play a potentially key role in cancer stem cell
      maintenance and tumor growth.

TI  - SUV4-20 activity in the preimplantation mouse embryo controls timely replication.
PG  - 2513-2526
AB  - Extensive chromatin remodeling after fertilization is thought to take place to
      allow a new developmental program to start. This includes dynamic changes in
      histone methylation and, in particular, the remodeling of constitutive
      heterochromatic marks such as histone H4 Lys20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). While
      the essential function of H4K20me1 in preimplantation mouse embryos is well
      established, the role of the additional H4K20 methylation states through the
      action of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases has not been addressed. Here we show
      that Suv4-20h1/h2 are mostly absent in mouse embryos before implantation,
      underscoring a rapid decrease of H4K20me3 from the two-cell stage onward. We
      addressed the functional significance of this remodeling by introducing Suv4-20h1
      and Suv4-20h2 in early embryos. Ectopic expression of Suv4-20h2 leads to
      sustained levels of H4K20me3, developmental arrest, and defects in S-phase
      progression. The developmental phenotype can be partially overcome through
      inhibition of the ATR pathway, suggesting that the main function for the
      remodeling of H4K20me3 after fertilization is to allow the timely and coordinated
      progression of replication. This is in contrast to the replication program in
      somatic cells, where H4K20me3 has been shown to promote replication origin
      licensing, and anticipates a different regulation of replication during this
      early developmental time window.

TI  - Structural visualization of the p53/RNA polymerase II assembly.
PG  - 2527-2537
AB  - The master tumor suppressor p53 activates transcription in response to various
      cellular stresses in part by facilitating recruitment of the transcription
      machinery to DNA. Recent studies have documented a direct yet poorly
      characterized interaction between p53 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Therefore, 
      we dissected the human p53/Pol II interaction via single-particle cryo-electron
      microscopy, structural docking, and biochemical analyses. This study reveals that
      p53 binds Pol II via the Rpb1 and Rpb2 subunits, bridging the DNA-binding cleft
      of Pol II proximal to the upstream DNA entry site. In addition, the key
      DNA-binding surface of p53, frequently disrupted in various cancers, remains
      exposed within the assembly. Furthermore, the p53/Pol II cocomplex displays a
      closed conformation as defined by the position of the Pol II clamp domain.
      Notably, the interaction of p53 and Pol II leads to increased Pol II elongation
      activity. These findings indicate that p53 may structurally regulate DNA-binding 
      functions of Pol II via the clamp domain, thereby providing insights into
      p53-regulated Pol II transcription.

TI  - A role for mitotic bookmarking of SOX2 in pluripotency and differentiation.
PG  - 2538-2550
AB  - Mitotic bookmarking transcription factors remain bound to chromosomes during
      mitosis and were proposed to regulate phenotypic maintenance of stem and
      progenitor cells at the mitosis-to-G1 (M-G1) transition. However, mitotic
      bookmarking remains largely unexplored in most stem cell types, and its
      functional relevance for cell fate decisions remains unclear. Here we screened
      for mitotic chromosome binding within the pluripotency network of embryonic stem 
      (ES) cells and show that SOX2 and OCT4 remain bound to mitotic chromatin through 
      their respective DNA-binding domains. Dynamic characterization using
      photobleaching-based methods and single-molecule imaging revealed quantitatively 
      similar specific DNA interactions, but different nonspecific DNA interactions, of
      SOX2 and OCT4 with mitotic chromatin. Using ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) to assess
      the genome-wide distribution of SOX2 on mitotic chromatin, we demonstrate the
      bookmarking activity of SOX2 on a small set of genes. Finally, we investigated
      the function of SOX2 mitotic bookmarking in cell fate decisions and show that its
      absence at the M-G1 transition impairs pluripotency maintenance and abrogates its
      ability to induce neuroectodermal differentiation but does not affect
      reprogramming efficiency toward induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study
      demonstrates the mitotic bookmarking property of SOX2 and reveals its functional 
      importance in pluripotency maintenance and ES cell differentiation.

TI  - Conversion of T cells to B cells by inactivation of polycomb-mediated epigenetic 
      suppression of the B-lineage program.
PG  - 2475-2485
AB  - In general, cell fate is determined primarily by transcription factors, followed 
      by epigenetic mechanisms fixing the status. While the importance of transcription
      factors controlling cell fate has been well characterized, epigenetic regulation 
      of cell fate maintenance remains to be elucidated. Here we provide an obvious
      fate conversion case, in which the inactivation of polycomb-medicated epigenetic 
      regulation results in conversion of T-lineage progenitors to the B-cell fate. In 
      T-cell-specific Ring1A/B-deficient mice, T-cell development was severely blocked 
      at an immature stage. We found that these developmentally arrested T-cell
      precursors gave rise to functional B cells upon transfer to immunodeficient mice.
      We further demonstrated that the arrest was almost completely canceled by
      additional deletion of Pax5 These results indicate that the maintenance of T-cell
      fate critically requires epigenetic suppression of the B-lineage gene program.

TI  - The tumor suppressor FLCN mediates an alternate mTOR pathway to regulate browning
      of adipose tissue.
PG  - 2551-2564
AB  - Noncanonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways remain poorly
      understood. Mutations in the tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) cause
      Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, a hamartomatous disease marked by mitochondria-rich
      kidney tumors. FLCN functionally interacts with mTOR and is expressed in most
      tissues, but its role in fat has not been explored. We show here that FLCN
      regulates adipose tissue browning via mTOR and the transcription factor TFE3.
      Adipose-specific deletion of FLCN relieves mTOR-dependent cytoplasmic retention
      of TFE3, leading to direct induction of the PGC-1 transcriptional coactivators,
      drivers of mitochondrial biogenesis and the browning program. Cytoplasmic
      retention of TFE3 by mTOR is sensitive to ambient amino acids, is independent of 
      growth factor and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) signaling, is driven by
      RagC/D, and is separable from canonical mTOR signaling to S6K. Codeletion of TFE3
      in adipose-specific FLCN knockout animals rescues adipose tissue browning, as
      does codeletion of PGC-1beta. Conversely, inducible expression of PGC-1beta in
      white adipose tissue is sufficient to induce beige fat gene expression in vivo.
      These data thus unveil a novel FLCN-mTOR-TFE3-PGC-1beta pathway-separate from the
      canonical TSC-mTOR-S6K pathway-that regulates browning of adipose tissue.

TI  - Clonal conversion of B lymphoid leukemia reveals cross-lineage transfer of
      malignant states.
PG  - 2486-2499
AB  - Even though leukemia is considered to be confined to one specific hematopoietic
      cell type, cases of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and patients relapsing in
      phenotypically altered disease suggest that a malignant state may be transferred 
      between lineages. Because B-cell leukemia is associated with mutations in
      transcription factors of importance for stable preservation of lineage identity, 
      we here investigated the potential lineage plasticity of leukemic cells. We
      report that primary pro-B leukemia cells from mice carrying heterozygous
      mutations in either or both the Pax5 and Ebf1 genes, commonly mutated in human
      leukemia, can be converted into T lineage leukemia cells. Even though the
      conversion process involved global changes in gene expression and
      lineage-restricted epigenetic reconfiguration, the malignant phenotype of the
      cells was preserved, enabling them to expand as T lineage leukemia cells in vivo.
      Furthermore, while the transformed pro-B cells displayed plasticity toward
      myeloid lineages, the converted cells failed to cause myeloid leukemia after
      transplantation. These data provide evidence that a malignant phenotype can be
      transferred between hematopoietic lineages. This has important implications for
      modern cancer medicine because lineage targeted treatment of leukemia patients
      can be predicted to provoke the emergence of phenotypically altered subclones,
      causing clinical relapse.

TI  - N-terminal acetylation promotes synaptonemal complex assembly in C. elegans.
PG  - 2404-2416
AB  - N-terminal acetylation of the first two amino acids on proteins is a prevalent
      cotranslational modification. Despite its abundance, the biological processes
      associated with this modification are not well understood. Here, we mapped the
      pattern of protein N-terminal acetylation in Caenorhabditis elegans, uncovering a
      conserved set of rules for this protein modification and identifying substrates
      for the N-terminal acetyltransferase B (NatB) complex. We observed an enrichment 
      for global protein N-terminal acetylation and also specifically for NatB
      substrates in the nucleus, supporting the importance of this modification for
      regulating biological functions within this cellular compartment. Peptide
      profiling analysis provides evidence of cross-talk between N-terminal acetylation
      and internal modifications in a NAT substrate-specific manner. In vivo studies
      indicate that N-terminal acetylation is critical for meiosis, as it regulates the
      assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure ubiquitously
      present during meiosis from yeast to humans. Specifically, N-terminal acetylation
      of NatB substrate SYP-1, an SC structural component, is critical for SC assembly.
      These findings provide novel insights into the biological functions of N-terminal
      acetylation and its essential role during meiosis.

TI  - Structural basis for snRNA recognition by the double-WD40 repeat domain of
      Gemin5.
PG  - 2391-2403
AB  - Assembly of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoparticle (snRNP) core
      requires the participation of the multisubunit SMN (survival of motor neuron)
      complex, which contains SMN and several Gemin proteins. The SMN and Gemin2
      subunits directly bind Sm proteins, and Gemin5 is required for snRNP biogenesis
      and has been implicated in snRNA recognition. The RNA sequence required for snRNP
      assembly includes the Sm site and an adjacent 3' stem-loop, but a precise
      understanding of Gemin5's RNA-binding specificity is lacking. Here we show that
      the N-terminal half of Gemin5, which is composed of two juxtaposed seven-bladed
      WD40 repeat domains, recognizes the Sm site. The tandem WD40 repeat domains are
      rigidly held together to form a contiguous RNA-binding surface. RNA-contacting
      residues are located mostly on loops between beta strands on the apical surface
      of the WD40 domains. Structural and biochemical analyses show that base-stacking 
      interactions involving four aromatic residues and hydrogen bonding by a pair of
      arginines are crucial for specific recognition of the Sm sequence. We also show
      that an adenine immediately 5' to the Sm site is required for efficient binding
      and that Gemin5 can bind short RNA oligos in an alternative mode. Our results
      provide mechanistic understandings of Gemin5's snRNA-binding specificity as well 
      as valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of RNA binding by WD40 repeat
      proteins in general.

TI  - Structural insights into Gemin5-guided selection of pre-snRNAs for snRNP
      assembly.
PG  - 2376-2390
AB  - In cytoplasm, the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex delivers pre-small
      nuclear RNAs (pre-snRNAs) to the heptameric Sm ring for the assembly of the ring 
      complex on pre-snRNAs at the conserved Sm site [A(U)4-6G]. Gemin5, a WD40 protein
      component of the SMN complex, is responsible for recognizing pre-snRNAs. In
      addition, Gemin5 has been reported to specifically bind to the m(7)G cap. In this
      study, we show that the WD40 domain of Gemin5 is both necessary and sufficient
      for binding the Sm site of pre-snRNAs by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
      and mutagenesis assays. We further determined the crystal structures of the WD40 
      domain of Gemin5 in complex with the Sm site or m(7)G cap of pre-snRNA, which
      reveal that the WD40 domain of Gemin5 recognizes the Sm site and m(7)G cap of
      pre-snRNAs via two distinct binding sites by respective base-specific
      interactions. In addition, we also uncovered a novel role of Gemin5 in escorting 
      the truncated forms of U1 pre-snRNAs for proper disposal. Overall, the elucidated
      Gemin5 structures will contribute to a better understanding of Gemin5 in small
      nuclear ribonucleic protein (snRNP) biogenesis as well as, potentially, other
      cellular activities.

TI  - Undercover: gene control by metabolites and metabolic enzymes.
PG  - 2345-2369
AB  - To make the appropriate developmental decisions or maintain homeostasis, cells
      and organisms must coordinate the expression of their genome and metabolic state.
      However, the molecular mechanisms that relay environmental cues such as nutrient 
      availability to the appropriate gene expression response remain poorly
      understood. There is a growing awareness that central components of intermediary 
      metabolism are cofactors or cosubstrates of chromatin-modifying enzymes. As such,
      their concentrations constitute a potential regulatory interface between the
      metabolic and chromatin states. In addition, there is increasing evidence for a
      direct involvement of classic metabolic enzymes in gene expression control. These
      dual-function proteins may provide a direct link between metabolic programing and
      the control of gene expression. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms connecting metabolism to gene expression and their
      implications for development and disease.

TI  - The right pick: structural basis of snRNA selection by Gemin5.
PG  - 2341-2344
AB  - Macromolecular complexes, rather than individual biopolymers, perform many
      cellular activities. Faithful assembly of these complexes in vivo is therefore a 
      vital challenge of all cells, and its failure can have fatal consequences. To
      form functional complexes, cells use elaborate measures to select the "right"
      components and combine them into working entities. How assembly is achieved at
      the molecular level is unclear in many cases. Three groups (Jin and colleagues,
      pp. 2391-2403; Xu and colleagues, pp. 2376-2390; and Tang and colleagues in Cell 
      Research) have now provided insights into how an assembly factor specifically
      recognizes substrate RNA molecules and enables their usage for assembly of
      Sm-class uridine-rich small nuclear RNA-protein complexes.

TI  - PDGFRbeta regulates craniofacial development through homodimers and functional
      heterodimers with PDGFRalpha.
PG  - 2443-2458
AB  - Craniofacial development is a complex morphogenetic process, disruptions in which
      result in highly prevalent human birth defects. While platelet-derived growth
      factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) has well-documented functions in this
      process, the role of PDGFRbeta in murine craniofacial development is not well
      established. We demonstrate that PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta are coexpressed in the 
      craniofacial mesenchyme of mid-gestation mouse embryos and that ablation of
      Pdgfrb in the neural crest lineage results in increased nasal septum width,
      delayed palatal shelf development, and subepidermal blebbing. Furthermore, we
      show that the two receptors genetically interact in this lineage, as
      double-homozygous mutant embryos exhibit an overt facial clefting phenotype more 
      severe than that observed in either single-mutant embryo. We reveal a physical
      interaction between PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta in the craniofacial mesenchyme and
      demonstrate that the receptors form functional heterodimers with distinct
      signaling properties. Our studies thus uncover a novel mode of signaling for the 
      PDGF family during vertebrate development.

TI  - Antisense transcription licenses nascent transcripts to mediate transcriptional
      gene silencing.
PG  - 2417-2432
AB  - In eukaryotes, antisense transcription can regulate sense transcription by
      induction of epigenetic modifications. We showed previously that antisense
      transcription triggers Dicer-independent siRNA (disiRNA) production and disiRNA
      locus DNA methylation (DLDM) in Neurospora crassa Here we show that the conserved
      exonuclease ERI-1 (enhanced RNAi-1) is a critical component in this process.
      Antisense transcription and ERI-1 binding to target RNAs are necessary and
      sufficient to trigger DLDM. Convergent transcription causes stalling of RNA
      polymerase II during transcription, which permits ERI-1 to bind nascent RNAs in
      the nucleus and recruit a histone methyltransferase complex that catalyzes
      chromatin modifications. Furthermore, we show that, in the cytoplasm, ERI-1
      targets hundreds of transcripts from loci without antisense transcription to
      regulate RNA stability. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role for
      transcription kinetics in long noncoding RNA-mediated epigenetic modifications
      and identify ERI-1 as an important regulator of cotranscriptional gene silencing 
      and post-transcriptional RNA metabolism.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of intestinal stem cells by Tet1-mediated DNA
      hydroxymethylation.
PG  - 2433-2442
AB  - Methylated cytosines are associated with gene silencing. The ten-eleven
      translocation (TET) hydroxylases, which oxidize methylated cytosines to
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are essential for cytosine demethylation. Gene
      silencing and activation are critical for intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance 
      and differentiation, but the potential role of TET hydroxylases in these
      processes has not yet been examined. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of the
      5hmC mark in ISCs and their differentiated progeny. Genes with high levels of
      hydroxymethylation in ISCs are strongly associated with Wnt signaling and
      developmental processes. We found Tet1 to be the most abundantly expressed Tet
      gene in ISCs; therefore, we analyzed intestinal development in Tet1-deficient
      mice and determined that these mice are growth-retarded, exhibit partial
      postnatal lethality, and have significantly reduced numbers of proliferative
      cells in the intestinal epithelium. In addition, the Tet1-deficient intestine
      displays reduced organoid-forming capacity. In the Tet1-deficient crypt,
      decreased expression of Wnt target genes such as Axin2 and Lgr5 correlates with
      lower 5hmC levels at their promoters. These data demonstrate that Tet1-mediated
      DNA hydroxymethylation plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of the 
      Wnt pathway in intestinal stem and progenitor cells and consequently in the
      self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium.

TI  - Coupled enhancer and coding sequence evolution of a homeobox gene shaped leaf
      diversity.
PG  - 2370-2375
AB  - Here we investigate mechanisms underlying the diversification of biological forms
      using crucifer leaf shape as an example. We show that evolution of an enhancer
      element in the homeobox gene REDUCED COMPLEXITY (RCO) altered leaf shape by
      changing gene expression from the distal leaf blade to its base. A single amino
      acid substitution evolved together with this regulatory change, which reduced RCO
      protein stability, preventing pleiotropic effects caused by its altered gene
      expression. We detected hallmarks of positive selection in these evolved
      regulatory and coding sequence variants and showed that modulating RCO activity
      can improve plant physiological performance. Therefore, interplay between
      enhancer and coding sequence evolution created a potentially adaptive path for
      morphological evolution.

TI  - MEF2 transcription factors are key regulators of sprouting angiogenesis.
PG  - 2297-2309
AB  - Angiogenesis, the fundamental process by which new blood vessels form from
      existing ones, depends on precise spatial and temporal gene expression within
      specific compartments of the endothelium. However, the molecular links between
      proangiogenic signals and downstream gene expression remain unclear. During
      sprouting angiogenesis, the specification of endothelial cells into the tip cells
      that lead new blood vessel sprouts is coordinated by vascular endothelial growth 
      factor A (VEGFA) and Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4)/Notch signaling and requires high
      levels of Notch ligand DLL4. Here, we identify MEF2 transcription factors as
      crucial regulators of sprouting angiogenesis directly downstream from VEGFA.
      Through the characterization of a Dll4 enhancer directing expression to
      endothelial cells at the angiogenic front, we found that MEF2 factors directly
      transcriptionally activate the expression of Dll4 and many other key genes
      up-regulated during sprouting angiogenesis in both physiological and tumor
      vascularization. Unlike ETS-mediated regulation, MEF2-binding motifs are not
      ubiquitous to all endothelial gene enhancers and promoters but are instead
      overrepresented around genes associated with sprouting angiogenesis. MEF2 target 
      gene activation is directly linked to VEGFA-induced release of repressive histone
      deacetylases and concurrent recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 to
      MEF2 target gene regulatory elements, thus establishing MEF2 factors as the
      transcriptional effectors of VEGFA signaling during angiogenesis.

TI  - A noncanonical auxin-sensing mechanism is required for organ morphogenesis in
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2286-2296
AB  - Tissue patterning in multicellular organisms is the output of precise
      spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression coupled with changes in hormone
      dynamics. In plants, the hormone auxin regulates growth and development at every 
      stage of a plant's life cycle. Auxin signaling occurs through binding of the
      auxin molecule to a TIR1/AFB F-box ubiquitin ligase, allowing interaction with
      Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins. These are subsequently ubiquitinated 
      and degraded via the 26S proteasome, leading to derepression of auxin response
      factors (ARFs). How auxin is able to elicit such a diverse range of developmental
      responses through a single signaling module has not yet been resolved. Here we
      present an alternative auxin-sensing mechanism in which the ARF ARF3/ETTIN
      controls gene expression through interactions with process-specific transcription
      factors. This noncanonical hormone-sensing mechanism exhibits strong preference
      for the naturally occurring auxin indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and is important for
      coordinating growth and patterning in diverse developmental contexts such as
      gynoecium morphogenesis, lateral root emergence, ovule development, and primary
      branch formation. Disrupting this IAA-sensing ability induces morphological
      aberrations with consequences for plant fitness. Therefore, our findings
      introduce a novel transcription factor-based mechanism of hormone perception in
      plants.

TI  - Colocalization of distant chromosomal loci in space in E. coli: a bacterial
      nucleolus.
PG  - 2272-2285
AB  - The spatial organization of DNA within the bacterial nucleoid remains unclear. To
      investigate chromosome organization in Escherichia coli, we examined the relative
      positions of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons in space. The seven rRNA operons
      are nearly identical and separated from each other by as much as 180 degrees on
      the circular genetic map, a distance of >/=2 million base pairs. By inserting
      binding sites for fluorescent proteins adjacent to the rRNA operons and then
      examining their positions pairwise in live cells by epifluorescence microscopy,
      we found that all but rrnC are in close proximity. Colocalization of the rRNA
      operons required the rrn P1 promoter region but not the rrn P2 promoter or the
      rRNA structural genes and occurred with and without active transcription.
      Non-rRNA operon pairs did not colocalize, and the magnitude of their physical
      separation generally correlated with that of their genetic separation. Our
      results show that E. coli bacterial chromosome folding in three dimensions is not
      dictated entirely by genetic position but rather includes functionally related,
      genetically distant loci that come into close proximity, with rRNA operons
      forming a structure reminiscent of the eukaryotic nucleolus.

TI  - Replication fork instability and the consequences of fork collisions from
      rereplication.
PG  - 2241-2252
AB  - Replication forks encounter obstacles that must be repaired or bypassed to
      complete chromosome duplication before cell division. Proteomic analysis of
      replication forks suggests that the checkpoint and repair machinery travels with 
      unperturbed forks, implying that they are poised to respond to stalling and
      collapse. However, impaired fork progression still generates aberrations,
      including repeat copy number instability and chromosome rearrangements.
      Deregulated origin firing also causes fork instability if a newer fork collides
      with an older one, generating double-strand breaks (DSBs) and partially
      rereplicated DNA. Current evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms are used to 
      repair rereplication damage, yet these can have deleterious consequences for
      genome integrity.

TI  - The pleiotropic deubiquitinase Ubp3 confers aneuploidy tolerance.
PG  - 2259-2271
AB  - Aneuploidy-or an unbalanced karyotype in which whole chromosomes are gained or
      lost-causes reduced fitness at both the cellular and organismal levels but is
      also a hallmark of human cancers. Aneuploidy causes a variety of cellular
      stresses, including genomic instability, proteotoxic and oxidative stresses, and 
      impaired protein trafficking. The deubiquitinase Ubp3, which was identified by a 
      genome-wide screen for gene deletions that impair the fitness of aneuploid yeast,
      is a key regulator of aneuploid cell homeostasis. We show that deletion of UBP3
      exacerbates both karyotype-specific phenotypes and global stresses of aneuploid
      cells, including oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Indeed, Ubp3 is essential for 
      proper proteasome function in euploid cells, and deletion of this deubiquitinase 
      leads to further proteasome-mediated proteotoxicity in aneuploid yeast. Notably, 
      the importance of UBP3 in aneuploid cells is conserved. Depletion of the human
      homolog of UBP3, USP10, is detrimental to the fitness of human cells upon
      chromosome missegregation, and this fitness defect is accompanied by autophagy
      inhibition. We thus used a genome-wide screen in yeast to identify a guardian of 
      aneuploid cell fitness conserved across species. We propose that interfering with
      Ubp3/USP10 function could be a productive avenue in the development of novel
      cancer therapeutics.

TI  - Nucleoporin-mediated regulation of cell identity genes.
PG  - 2253-2258
AB  - The organization of the genome in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus is
      coupled with cell type-specific gene expression. However, how nuclear
      architecture influences transcription that governs cell identity remains unknown.
      Here, we show that nuclear pore complex (NPC) components Nup93 and Nup153 bind
      superenhancers (SE), regulatory structures that drive the expression of key genes
      that specify cell identity. We found that nucleoporin-associated SEs localize
      preferentially to the nuclear periphery, and absence of Nup153 and Nup93 results 
      in dramatic transcriptional changes of SE-associated genes. Our results reveal a 
      crucial role of NPC components in the regulation of cell type-specifying genes
      and highlight nuclear architecture as a regulatory layer of genome functions in
      cell fate.

TI  - Interaction of CCR4-NOT with EBF1 regulates gene-specific transcription and mRNA 
      stability in B lymphopoiesis.
PG  - 2310-2324
AB  - Transcription factor EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1) regulates early B-cell
      differentiation by poising or activating lineage-specific genes and repressing
      genes associated with alternative cell fates. To identify proteins that regulate 
      the diverse functions of EBF1, we used SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino
      acids in cell culture)-based mass spectrometry of proteins associated with
      endogenous EBF1 in pro-B cells. This analysis identified most components of the
      multifunctional CCR4-NOT complex, which regulates transcription and mRNA
      degradation. CNOT3 interacts with EBF1, and we identified histidine 240 in EBF1
      as a critical residue for this interaction. Complementation of Ebf1(-/-)
      progenitors with EBF1H240A revealed a partial block of pro-B-cell differentiation
      and altered expression of specific EBF1 target genes that show either reduced
      transcription or increased mRNA stability. Most deregulated EBF1 target genes
      show normal occupancy by EBF1H240A, but we also detected genes with altered
      occupancy, suggesting that the CCR4-NOT complex affects multiple activities of
      EBF1. Mice with conditional Cnot3 inactivation recapitulate the block of early
      B-cell differentiation, which we found to be associated with an impaired
      autoregulation of Ebf1 and reduced expression of pre-B-cell receptor components. 
      Thus, the interaction of the CCR4-NOT complex with EBF1 diversifies the function 
      of EBF1 in a context-dependent manner and may coordinate transcriptional and
      post-transcriptional gene regulation.

TI  - Hair follicles' transit-amplifying cells govern concurrent dermal adipocyte
      production through Sonic Hedgehog.
PG  - 2325-2338
AB  - Growth and regeneration of one tissue within an organ compels accommodative
      changes in the surrounding tissues. However, the molecular nature and operating
      logic governing these concurrent changes remain poorly defined. The dermal
      adipose layer expands concomitantly with hair follicle downgrowth, providing a
      paradigm for studying coordinated changes of surrounding lineages with a
      regenerating tissue. Here, we discover that hair follicle transit-amplifying
      cells (HF-TACs) play an essential role in orchestrating dermal adipogenesis
      through secreting Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). Depletion of Shh from HF-TACs abrogates
      both dermal adipogenesis and hair follicle growth. Using cell type-specific
      deletion of Smo, a gene required in SHH-receiving cells, we found that SHH does
      not act on hair follicles, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells
      for adipogenesis. Instead, SHH acts directly on adipocyte precursors, promoting
      their proliferation and their expression of a key adipogenic gene, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), to induce dermal adipogenesis. Our
      study therefore uncovers a critical role for TACs in orchestrating the generation
      of both their own progeny and a neighboring lineage to achieve concomitant tissue
      production across lineages.

TI  - Spatial focalization of pheromone/MAPK signaling triggers commitment to cell-cell
      fusion.
PG  - 2226-2239
AB  - Cell fusion is universal in eukaryotes for fertilization and development, but
      what signals this process is unknown. Here, we show in Schizosaccharomyces pombe 
      that fusion does not require a dedicated signal but is triggered by spatial
      focalization of the same pheromone-GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor)-MAPK
      signaling cascade that drives earlier mating events. Autocrine cells expressing
      the receptor for their own pheromone trigger fusion attempts independently of
      cell-cell contact by concentrating pheromone release at the fusion focus, a
      dynamic actin aster underlying the secretion of cell wall hydrolases. Pheromone
      receptor and MAPK cascade are similarly enriched at the fusion focus, concomitant
      with fusion commitment in wild-type mating pairs. This focalization promotes cell
      fusion by immobilizing the fusion focus, thus driving local cell wall
      dissolution. We propose that fusion commitment is imposed by a local increase in 
      MAPK concentration at the fusion focus, driven by a positive feedback between
      fusion focus formation and focalization of pheromone release and perception.

TI  - Post-transcriptional control of executioner caspases by RNA-binding proteins.
PG  - 2213-2225
AB  - Caspases are key components of apoptotic pathways. Regulation of caspases occurs 
      at several levels, including transcription, proteolytic processing, inhibition of
      enzymatic function, and protein degradation. In contrast, little is known about
      the extent of post-transcriptional control of caspases. Here, we describe four
      conserved RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)-PUF-8, MEX-3, GLD-1, and CGH-1-that
      sequentially repress the CED-3 caspase in distinct regions of the Caenorhabditis 
      elegans germline. We demonstrate that GLD-1 represses ced-3 mRNA translation via 
      two binding sites in its 3' untranslated region (UTR), thereby ensuring a dual
      control of unwanted cell death: at the level of p53/CEP-1 and at the executioner 
      caspase level. Moreover, we identified seven RBPs that regulate human caspase-3
      expression and/or activation, including human PUF-8, GLD-1, and CGH-1 homologs
      PUM1, QKI, and DDX6. Given the presence of unusually long executioner caspase 3' 
      UTRs in many metazoans, translational control of executioner caspases by RBPs
      might be a strategy used widely across the animal kingdom to control apoptosis.

TI  - Loss of Uhrf1 in neural stem cells leads to activation of retroviral elements and
      delayed neurodegeneration.
PG  - 2199-2212
AB  - In order to understand whether early epigenetic mechanisms instruct the long-term
      behavior of neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny, we examined Uhrf1
      (ubiquitin-like PHD ring finger-1; also known as Np95), as it is highly expressed
      in NSCs of the developing brain and rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation. 
      Conditional deletion of Uhrf1 in the developing cerebral cortex resulted in
      rather normal proliferation and neurogenesis but severe postnatal
      neurodegeneration. During development, deletion of Uhrf1 lead to global DNA
      hypomethylation with a strong activation of the intracisternal A particle (IAP)
      family of endogenous retroviral elements, accompanied by an increase in
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Down-regulation of Tet enzymes rescued the IAP
      activation in Uhrf1 conditional knockout (cKO) cells, suggesting an antagonistic 
      interplay between Uhrf1 and Tet on IAP regulation. As IAP up-regulation persists 
      into postnatal stages in the Uhrf1 cKO mice, our data show the lack of means to
      repress IAPs in differentiating neurons that normally never express Uhrf1 The
      high load of viral proteins and other transcriptional deregulation ultimately led
      to postnatal neurodegeneration. Taken together, these data show that early
      developmental NSC factors can have long-term effects in neuronal differentiation 
      and survival. Moreover, they highlight how specific the consequences of
      widespread changes in DNA methylation are for certain classes of retroviral
      elements.

TI  - Synthetic lethality between PAXX and XLF in mammalian development.
PG  - 2152-2157
AB  - PAXX was identified recently as a novel nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair
      factor in human cells. To characterize its physiological roles, we generated
      Paxx-deficient mice. Like Xlf(-/-) mice, Paxx(-/-) mice are viable, grow
      normally, and are fertile but show mild radiosensitivity. Strikingly, while Paxx 
      loss is epistatic with Ku80, Lig4, and Atm deficiency, Paxx/Xlf double-knockout
      mice display embryonic lethality associated with genomic instability, cell death 
      in the central nervous system, and an almost complete block in lymphogenesis,
      phenotypes that closely resemble those of Xrcc4(-/-) and Lig4(-/-) mice. Thus,
      combined loss of Paxx and Xlf is synthetic-lethal in mammals.

TI  - Interrogating the relevance of mitochondrial apoptosis for vertebrate development
      and postnatal tissue homeostasis.
PG  - 2133-2151
AB  - "Programmed cell death or 'apoptosis' is critical for organogenesis during
      embryonic development and tissue homeostasis in the adult. Its deregulation can
      contribute to a broad range of human pathologies, including neurodegeneration,
      cancer, or autoimmunity..." These or similar phrases have become generic opening 
      statements in many reviews and textbooks describing the physiological relevance
      of apoptotic cell death. However, while the role in disease has been documented
      beyond doubt, facilitating innovative drug discovery, we wonder whether the
      former is really true. What goes wrong in vertebrate development or in adult
      tissue when the main route to apoptotic cell death, controlled by the BCL2
      family, is impaired? Such scenarios have been mimicked by deletion of one or more
      prodeath genes within the BCL2 family, and gene targeting studies in mice
      exploring the consequences have been manifold. Many of these studies were geared 
      toward understanding the role of BCL2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptosis
      in disease, whereas fewer focused in detail on their role during normal
      development or tissue homeostasis, perhaps also due to an irritating lack of
      phenotype. Looking at these studies, the relevance of classical programmed cell
      death by apoptosis for development appears rather limited. Together, these many
      studies suggest either highly selective and context-dependent contributions of
      mitochondrial apoptosis or significant redundancy with alternative cell death
      mechanisms, as summarized and discussed here.

TI  - Condensin II mutation causes T-cell lymphoma through tissue-specific genome
      instability.
PG  - 2173-2186
AB  - Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer, but mitotic regulators are
      rarely mutated in tumors. Mutations in the condensin complexes, which restructure
      chromosomes to facilitate segregation during mitosis, are significantly enriched 
      in cancer genomes, but experimental evidence implicating condensin dysfunction in
      tumorigenesis is lacking. We report that mice inheriting missense mutations in a 
      condensin II subunit (Caph2(nes)) develop T-cell lymphoma. Before tumors develop,
      we found that the same Caph2 mutation impairs ploidy maintenance to a different
      extent in different hematopoietic cell types, with ploidy most severely perturbed
      at the CD4(+)CD8(+) T-cell stage from which tumors initiate. Premalignant
      CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells show persistent catenations during chromosome segregation,
      triggering DNA damage in diploid daughter cells and elevated ploidy. Genome
      sequencing revealed that Caph2 single-mutant tumors are near diploid but carry
      deletions spanning tumor suppressor genes, whereas P53 inactivation allowed Caph2
      mutant cells with whole-chromosome gains and structural rearrangements to form
      highly aggressive disease. Together, our data challenge the view that mitotic
      chromosome formation is an invariant process during development and provide
      evidence that defective mitotic chromosome structure can promote tumorigenesis.

TI  - SWI/SNF regulates a transcriptional program that induces senescence to prevent
      liver cancer.
PG  - 2187-2198
AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism. To
      identify senescence regulators relevant to cancer, we screened an shRNA library
      targeting genes deleted in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe how 
      knockdown of the SWI/SNF component ARID1B prevents OIS and cooperates with RAS to
      induce liver tumors. ARID1B controls p16(INK4a) and p21(CIP1a) transcription but 
      also regulates DNA damage, oxidative stress, and p53 induction, suggesting that
      SWI/SNF uses additional mechanisms to regulate senescence. To systematically
      identify SWI/SNF targets regulating senescence, we carried out a focused shRNA
      screen. We discovered several new senescence regulators, including ENTPD7, an
      enzyme that hydrolyses nucleotides. ENTPD7 affects oxidative stress, DNA damage, 
      and senescence. Importantly, expression of ENTPD7 or inhibition of nucleotide
      synthesis in ARID1B-depleted cells results in re-establishment of senescence. Our
      results identify novel mechanisms by which epigenetic regulators can affect tumor
      progression and suggest that prosenescence therapies could be employed against
      SWI/SNF-mutated cancers.

TI  - Mutations in genes encoding condensin complex proteins cause microcephaly through
      decatenation failure at mitosis.
PG  - 2158-2172
AB  - Compaction of chromosomes is essential for accurate segregation of the genome
      during mitosis. In vertebrates, two condensin complexes ensure timely chromosome 
      condensation, sister chromatid disentanglement, and maintenance of mitotic
      chromosome structure. Here, we report that biallelic mutations in NCAPD2, NCAPH, 
      or NCAPD3, encoding subunits of these complexes, cause microcephaly. In addition,
      hypomorphic Ncaph2 mice have significantly reduced brain size, with frequent
      anaphase chromatin bridge formation observed in apical neural progenitors during 
      neurogenesis. Such DNA bridges also arise in condensin-deficient patient cells,
      where they are the consequence of failed sister chromatid disentanglement during 
      chromosome compaction. This results in chromosome segregation errors, leading to 
      micronucleus formation and increased aneuploidy in daughter cells. These findings
      establish "condensinopathies" as microcephalic disorders, with decatenation
      failure as an additional disease mechanism for microcephaly, implicating mitotic 
      chromosome condensation as a key process ensuring mammalian cerebral cortex size.

TI  - Rapid dynamics of general transcription factor TFIIB binding during preinitiation
      complex assembly revealed by single-molecule analysis.
PG  - 2106-2118
AB  - Transcription of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotic cells requires the
      coordinated action of multiple general transcription factors (GTFs) and RNA
      polymerase II (Pol II). A "step-wise" preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly model 
      has been suggested based on conventional ensemble biochemical measurements, in
      which protein factors bind stably to the promoter DNA sequentially to build a
      functional PIC. However, recent dynamic measurements in live cells suggest that
      transcription factors mostly interact with chromatin DNA rather transiently. To
      gain a clearer dynamic picture of PIC assembly, we established an integrated in
      vitro single-molecule transcription platform reconstituted from highly purified
      human transcription factors and complemented it by live-cell imaging. Here we
      performed real-time measurements of the hierarchal promoter-specific binding of
      TFIID, TFIIA, and TFIIB. Surprisingly, we found that while promoter binding of
      TFIID and TFIIA is stable, promoter binding by TFIIB is highly transient and
      dynamic (with an average residence time of 1.5 sec). Stable TFIIB-promoter
      association and progression beyond this apparent PIC assembly checkpoint control 
      occurs only in the presence of Pol II-TFIIF. This transient-to-stable transition 
      of TFIIB-binding dynamics has gone undetected previously and underscores the
      advantages of single-molecule assays for revealing the dynamic nature of complex 
      biological reactions.

TI  - Identification and molecular characterization of cellular factors required for
      glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mRNA decay.
PG  - 2093-2105
AB  - Glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) has been shown recently to bind a subset of
      mRNAs and elicit rapid mRNA degradation. However, the molecular details of
      GR-mediated mRNA decay (GMD) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GMD
      triggers rapid degradation of target mRNAs in a translation-independent and exon 
      junction complex-independent manner, confirming that GMD is mechanistically
      distinct from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Efficient GMD requires PNRC2
      (proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein 2) binding, helicase ability,
      and ATM-mediated phosphorylation of UPF1 (upstream frameshift 1). We also
      identify two GMD-specific factors: an RNA-binding protein, YBX1 (Y-box-binding
      protein 1), and an endoribonuclease, HRSP12 (heat-responsive protein 12). In
      particular, using HRSP12 variants, which are known to disrupt trimerization of
      HRSP12, we show that HRSP12 plays an essential role in the formation of a
      functionally active GMD complex. Moreover, we determine the hierarchical
      recruitment of GMD factors to target mRNAs. Finally, our genome-wide analysis
      shows that GMD targets a variety of transcripts, implicating roles in a wide
      range of cellular processes, including immune responses.

TI  - DUSP11 activity on triphosphorylated transcripts promotes Argonaute association
      with noncanonical viral microRNAs and regulates steady-state levels of cellular
      noncoding RNAs.
PG  - 2076-2092
AB  - RNA silencing is a conserved eukaryotic gene expression regulatory mechanism
      mediated by small RNAs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the accumulation of a distinct
      class of siRNAs synthesized by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) requires
      the PIR-1 phosphatase. However, the function of PIR-1 in RNAi has remained
      unclear. Since mammals lack an analogous siRNA biogenesis pathway, an RNA
      silencing role for the mammalian PIR-1 homolog (dual specificity phosphatase 11
      [DUSP11]) was unexpected. Here, we show that the RNA triphosphatase activity of
      DUSP11 promotes the RNA silencing activity of viral microRNAs (miRNAs) derived
      from RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcribed precursors. Our results
      demonstrate that DUSP11 converts the 5' triphosphate of miRNA precursors to a 5' 
      monophosphate, promoting loading of derivative 5p miRNAs into Argonaute proteins 
      via a Dicer-coupled 5' monophosphate-dependent strand selection mechanism. This
      mechanistic insight supports a likely shared function for PIR-1 in C. elegans
      Furthermore, we show that DUSP11 modulates the 5' end phosphate group and/or
      steady-state level of several host RNAP III transcripts, including vault RNAs and
      Alu transcripts. This study shows that steady-state levels of select noncoding
      RNAs are regulated by DUSP11 and defines a previously unknown portal for small
      RNA-mediated silencing in mammals, revealing that DUSP11-dependent RNA silencing 
      activities are shared among diverse metazoans.

TI  - Control of inflorescence architecture in tomato by BTB/POZ transcriptional
      regulators.
PG  - 2048-2061
AB  - Plant productivity depends on inflorescences, flower-bearing shoots that
      originate from the stem cell populations of shoot meristems. Inflorescence
      architecture determines flower production, which can vary dramatically both
      between and within species. In tomato plants, formation of multiflowered
      inflorescences depends on a precisely timed process of meristem maturation
      mediated by the transcription factor gene TERMINATING FLOWER (TMF), but the
      underlying mechanism is unknown. We show that TMF protein acts together with
      homologs of the Arabidopsis BLADE-ON-PETIOLE (BOP) transcriptional cofactors,
      defined by the conserved BTB (Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac)/POZ (POX
      virus and zinc finger) domain. TMF and three tomato BOPs (SlBOPs) interact with
      themselves and each other, and TMF recruits SlBOPs to the nucleus, suggesting
      formation of a transcriptional complex. Like TMF, SlBOP gene expression is
      highest during vegetative and transitional stages of meristem maturation, and
      CRISPR/Cas9 elimination of SlBOP function causes pleiotropic defects, most
      notably simplification of inflorescences into single flowers, resembling tmf
      mutants. Flowering defects are enhanced in higher-order slbop tmf mutants,
      suggesting that SlBOPs function with additional factors. In support of this,
      SlBOPs interact with TMF homologs, mutations in which cause phenotypes like slbop
      mutants. Our findings reveal a new flowering module defined by SlBOP-TMF family
      interactions that ensures a progressive meristem maturation to promote
      inflorescence complexity.

TI  - Epigenetics of hematopoiesis and hematological malignancies.
PG  - 2021-2041
AB  - Hematological malignancies comprise a diverse set of lymphoid and myeloid
      neoplasms in which normal hematopoiesis has gone awry and together account for
      approximately 10% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States in 2016.
      Recent intensive genomic sequencing of hematopoietic malignancies has identified 
      recurrent mutations in genes that encode regulators of chromatin structure and
      function, highlighting the central role that aberrant epigenetic regulation plays
      in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms for 
      how alterations in epigenetic modifiers, specifically histone and DNA methylases 
      and demethylases, drive hematopoietic cancer could provide new avenues for
      developing novel targeted epigenetic therapies for treating hematological
      malignancies. Just as past studies of blood cancers led to pioneering discoveries
      relevant to other cancers, determining the contribution of epigenetic modifiers
      in hematologic cancers could also have a broader impact on our understanding of
      the pathogenesis of solid tumors in which these factors are mutated.

PG  - 2019-2020
AB  - In this issue of Genes & Development, Drexel and colleagues (pp. 2042-2047)
      present a beautiful example of how microRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate
      tissue-specific gene expression in a biologically relevant setting. They found
      that miR-791 is expressed in only three types of carbon dioxide (CO2)-sensing
      neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans, and its primary function there seems to be
      repression of two target genes that interfere with the behavioral response to CO2
      Interestingly, these two targets are broadly expressed across other tissues.
      Thus, restricted miRNA expression can lead to target repression in select tissues
      to promote distinct cellular physiologies.

TI  - E2F coregulates an essential HSF developmental program that is distinct from the 
      heat-shock response.
PG  - 2062-2075
AB  - Heat-shock factor (HSF) is the master transcriptional regulator of the heat-shock
      response (HSR) and is essential for stress resilience. HSF is also required for
      metazoan development; however, its function and regulation in this process are
      poorly understood. Here, we characterize the genomic distribution and
      transcriptional activity of Caenorhabditis elegans HSF-1 during larval
      development and show that the developmental HSF-1 transcriptional program is
      distinct from the HSR. HSF-1 developmental activation requires binding of E2F/DP 
      to a GC-rich motif that facilitates HSF-1 binding to a heat-shock element (HSE)
      that is degenerate from the consensus HSE sequence and adjacent to the
      E2F-binding site at promoters. In contrast, induction of the HSR is independent
      of these promoter elements or E2F/DP and instead requires a distinct set of
      tandem canonical HSEs. Together, E2F and HSF-1 directly regulate a gene network, 
      including a specific subset of chaperones, to promote protein biogenesis and
      anabolic metabolism, which are essential in development.

TI  - Functional interplay between Mediator and TFIIB in preinitiation complex assembly
      in relation to promoter architecture.
PG  - 2119-2132
AB  - Mediator is a large coregulator complex conserved from yeast to humans and
      involved in many human diseases, including cancers. Together with general
      transcription factors, it stimulates preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and
      activates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. In this study, we analyzed
      how Mediator acts in PIC assembly using in vivo, in vitro, and in silico
      approaches. We revealed an essential function of the Mediator middle module
      exerted through its Med10 subunit, implicating a key interaction between Mediator
      and TFIIB. We showed that this Mediator-TFIIB link has a global role on PIC
      assembly genome-wide. Moreover, the amplitude of Mediator's effect on PIC
      formation is gene-dependent and is related to the promoter architecture in terms 
      of TATA elements, nucleosome occupancy, and dynamics. This study thus provides
      mechanistic insights into the coordinated function of Mediator and TFIIB in PIC
      assembly in different chromatin contexts.

TI  - Neuron type-specific miRNA represses two broadly expressed genes to modulate an
      avoidance behavior in C. elegans.
PG  - 2042-2047
AB  - Two broad gene classes are distinguished within multicellular organisms: cell
      type-specific genes, which confer particular cellular properties, and ubiquitous 
      genes that support general cellular functions. However, certain so-called
      ubiquitous genes show functionally relevant cell type-specific repression. How
      such repression is achieved is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are
      repressors, many of which are expressed with high cell type specificity. Here we 
      show that mir-791, expressed exclusively in the CO2-sensing neurons in
      Caenorhabditis elegans, represses two otherwise broadly expressed genes. This
      repression is necessary for normal neuronal function and behavior of the animals 
      toward CO2 miRNA-mediated repression of broadly transcribed genes is a previously
      unappreciated strategy for cellular specialization.

LID - 10.1101/gad.285239.116 [doi]
AB  - Multiple transcriptional and epigenetic changes drive differentiation of
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This study unveils an additional level of gene
      expression regulation involving noncanonical, cap-independent translation of a
      select group of mRNAs. This is driven by death-associated protein 5
      (DAP5/eIF4G2/NAT1), a translation initiation factor mediating IRES-dependent
      translation. We found that the DAP5 knockdown from human ESCs (hESCs) resulted in
      persistence of pluripotent gene expression, delayed induction of
      differentiation-associated genes in different cell lineages, and defective
      embryoid body formation. The latter involved improper cellular organization, lack
      of cavitation, and enhanced mislocalized apoptosis. RNA sequencing of
      polysome-associated mRNAs identified candidates with reduced translation
      efficiency in DAP5-depleted hESCs. These were enriched in mitochondrial proteins 
      involved in oxidative respiration, a pathway essential for differentiation, the
      significance of which was confirmed by the aberrant mitochondrial morphology and 
      decreased oxidative respiratory activity in DAP5 knockdown cells. Further
      analysis identified the chromatin modifier HMGN3 as a cap-independent DAP5
      translation target whose knockdown resulted in defective differentiation. Thus,
      DAP5-mediated translation of a specific set of proteins is critical for the
      transition from pluripotency to differentiation, highlighting the importance of
      cap-independent translation in stem cell fate decisions.

TI  - Superenhancer reprogramming drives a B-cell-epithelial transition and high-risk
      leukemia.
PG  - 1971-90
LID - 10.1101/gad.283762.116 [doi]
AB  - IKAROS is required for the differentiation of highly proliferative pre-B-cell
      precursors, and loss of IKAROS function indicates poor prognosis in precursor
      B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here we show that IKAROS regulates
      this developmental stage by positive and negative regulation of superenhancers
      with distinct lineage affiliations. IKAROS defines superenhancers at pre-B-cell
      differentiation genes together with B-cell master regulators such as PAX5, EBF1, 
      and IRF4 but is required for a highly permissive chromatin environment, a
      function that cannot be compensated for by the other transcription factors.
      IKAROS is also highly enriched at inactive enhancers of genes normally expressed 
      in stem-epithelial cells. Upon IKAROS loss, expression of pre-B-cell
      differentiation genes is attenuated, while a group of extralineage transcription 
      factors that are directly repressed by IKAROS and depend on EBF1 relocalization
      at their enhancers for expression is induced. LHX2, LMO2, and TEAD-YAP1, normally
      kept separate from native B-cell transcription regulators by IKAROS, now
      cooperate directly with them in a de novo superenhancer network with its own
      feed-forward transcriptional reinforcement. Induction of de novo superenhancers
      antagonizes Polycomb repression and superimposes aberrant stem-epithelial cell
      properties in a B-cell precursor. This dual mechanism of IKAROS regulation
      promotes differentiation while safeguarding against a hybrid
      stem-epithelial-B-cell phenotype that underlies high-risk B-ALL.

TI  - Cullin3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase targets ACLY for degradation to inhibit lipid
      synthesis and tumor progression.
PG  - 1956-70
LID - 10.1101/gad.283283.116 [doi]
AB  - Increased lipid synthesis is a key characteristic of many cancers that is
      critical for cancer progression. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme for lipid
      synthesis, is frequently overexpressed or activated in cancer to promote lipid
      synthesis and tumor progression. Cullin3 (CUL3), a core protein for the CUL3-RING
      ubiquitin ligase complex, has been reported to be a tumor suppressor and
      frequently down-regulated in lung cancer. Here, we found that CUL3 interacts with
      ACLY through its adaptor protein, KLHL25 (Kelch-like family member 25), to
      ubiquitinate and degrade ACLY in cells. Through negative regulation of ACLY, CUL3
      inhibits lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, and xenograft tumor growth of lung 
      cancer cells. Furthermore, ACLY inhibitor SB-204990 greatly abolishes the
      promoting effect of CUL3 down-regulation on lipid synthesis, cell proliferation, 
      and tumor growth. Importantly, low CUL3 expression is associated with high ACLY
      expression and poor prognosis in human lung cancer. In summary, our results
      identify CUL3-KLHL25 ubiquitin ligase as a novel negative regulator for ACLY and 
      lipid synthesis and demonstrate that decreased CUL3 expression is an important
      mechanism for increased ACLY expression and lipid synthesis in lung cancer. These
      results also reveal that negative regulation of ACLY and lipid synthesis is a
      novel and critical mechanism for CUL3 in tumor suppression.

TI  - Recent insights into the function of autophagy in cancer.
PG  - 1913-30
LID - 10.1101/gad.287524.116 [doi]
AB  - Macroautophagy (referred to here as autophagy) is induced by starvation to
      capture and degrade intracellular proteins and organelles in lysosomes, which
      recycles intracellular components to sustain metabolism and survival. Autophagy
      also plays a major homeostatic role in controlling protein and organelle quality 
      and quantity. Dysfunctional autophagy contributes to many diseases. In cancer,
      autophagy can be neutral, tumor-suppressive, or tumor-promoting in different
      contexts. Large-scale genomic analysis of human cancers indicates that the loss
      or mutation of core autophagy genes is uncommon, whereas oncogenic events that
      activate autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis have been identified. Autophagic
      flux, however, is difficult to measure in human tumor samples, making functional 
      assessment of autophagy problematic in a clinical setting. Autophagy impacts
      cellular metabolism, the proteome, and organelle numbers and quality, which alter
      cell functions in diverse ways. Moreover, autophagy influences the interaction
      between the tumor and the host by promoting stress adaptation and suppressing
      activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, autophagy can
      promote a cross-talk between the tumor and the stroma, which can support tumor
      growth, particularly in a nutrient-limited microenvironment. Thus, the role of
      autophagy in cancer is determined by nutrient availability, microenvironment
      stress, and the presence of an immune system. Here we discuss recent developments
      in the role of autophagy in cancer, in particular how autophagy can promote
      cancer through suppressing p53 and preventing energy crisis, cell death,
      senescence, and an anti-tumor immune response.

      Liu and colleagues (pp. 1943-1955) unravel the finding that depletion of
      Smoothened (Smo) in pancreatic stromal fibroblasts results in AKT activation and 
      noncanonical GLI2 activation with subsequent TGFalpha secretion, activation of
      EGFR in pancreatic epithelial cells, and augmentation of acinar-ductal
      metaplasia. Additionally, Smo-mediated signaling has proproliferative effects on

AB  - In mammals, rhythms in body temperature help to entrain and synchronize circadian
      rhythms throughout the organism, and the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
      (CIRBP) is one of the mediators of these daily temperature changes. Cirbp mRNA
      expression is regulated by the daily subtle rhythms in body temperature, and a
      new study by Gotic and colleagues (pp. 2005-2017) reveals a surprising and novel 
      mechanism that involves temperature-dependent enhancement of splicing efficiency.

TI  - Temperature regulates splicing efficiency of the cold-inducible RNA-binding
      protein gene Cirbp.
PG  - 2005-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.287094.116 [doi]
AB  - In mammals, body temperature fluctuates diurnally around a mean value of 36
      degrees C-37 degrees C. Despite the small differences between minimal and maximal
      values, body temperature rhythms can drive robust cycles in gene expression in
      cultured cells and, likely, animals. Here we studied the mechanisms responsible
      for the temperature-dependent expression of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
      (CIRBP). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts exposed to simulated mouse body temperature
      cycles, Cirbp mRNA oscillates about threefold in abundance, as it does in mouse
      livers. This daily mRNA accumulation cycle is directly controlled by temperature 
      oscillations and does not depend on the cells' circadian clocks. Here we show
      that the temperature-dependent accumulation of Cirbp mRNA is controlled primarily
      by the regulation of splicing efficiency, defined as the fraction of Cirbp
      pre-mRNA processed into mature mRNA. As revealed by genome-wide "approach to
      steady-state" kinetics, this post-transcriptional mechanism is widespread in the 
      temperature-dependent control of gene expression.

TI  - Condensin I-mediated mitotic chromosome assembly requires association with
      chromokinesin KIF4A.
PG  - 1931-6
LID - 10.1101/gad.282855.116 [doi]
AB  - The chromokinesin KIF4A has been implicated in shaping mitotic chromosomes, but
      its functional relationship to condensin complexes remains controversial. Here,
      we found that, in mitosis, KIF4A associates with condensin I but not with
      condensin II. Mutational analyses indicated that the enrichment of condensin I to
      chromosomal axes depends on its association with KIF4A in a way that likely
      involves its motor activity. Remarkably, this interaction is required for
      condensin I to confer physiological properties to chromosomes. These observations
      provide an insight into how condensin I is enriched at chromosomal axes and
      underscore the significance of axial structure in organizing mitotic chromosomes.

TI  - Genetic ablation of Smoothened in pancreatic fibroblasts increases acinar-ductal 
      metaplasia.
PG  - 1943-55
LID - 10.1101/gad.283499.116 [doi]
AB  - The contribution of the microenvironment to pancreatic acinar-to-ductal
      metaplasia (ADM), a preneoplastic transition in oncogenic Kras-driven pancreatic 
      cancer progression, is currently unclear. Here we show that disruption of
      paracrine Hedgehog signaling via genetic ablation of Smoothened (Smo) in stromal 
      fibroblasts in a Kras(G12D) mouse model increased ADM. Smo-deleted fibroblasts
      had higher expression of transforming growth factor-alpha (Tgfa) mRNA and
      secreted higher levels of TGFalpha, leading to activation of EGFR signaling in
      acinar cells and increased ADM. The mechanism involved activation of AKT and
      noncanonical activation of the GLI family transcription factor GLI2. GLI2 was
      phosphorylated at Ser230 in an AKT-dependent fashion and directly regulated Tgfa 
      expression in fibroblasts lacking Smo Additionally, Smo-deleted fibroblasts
      stimulated the growth of Kras(G12D)/Tp53(R172H) pancreatic tumor cells in vivo
      and in vitro. These results define a non-cell-autonomous mechanism modulating
      Kras(G12D)-driven ADM that is balanced by cross-talk between Hedgehog/SMO and
      AKT/GLI2 pathways in stromal fibroblasts.

      embryos.
PG  - 1937-42
LID - 10.1101/gad.285767.116 [doi]
AB  - Sequential 3'-to-5' activation of the Hox gene clusters in early embryos is a
      most fascinating issue in developmental biology. Neither the trigger nor the
      regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional initiation of the 3'-most Hox
      genes have been unraveled in any organism. We demonstrate that a series of
      enhancers, some of which are Wnt-dependent, is located within a HoxA 3'
      subtopologically associated domain (subTAD). This subTAD forms the structural
      basis for multiple layers of 3'-polarized features, including DNA accessibility
      and enhancer activation. Deletion of the cassette of Wnt-dependent enhancers
      proves its crucial role in initial transcription of HoxA at the 3' side of the
      cluster.

TI  - Unbiased identification of signal-activated transcription factors by barcoded
      synthetic tandem repeat promoter screening (BC-STAR-PROM).
PG  - 1895-907
LID - 10.1101/gad.284828.116 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of transcription factors (TFs) controlling pathways in health and
      disease is of paramount interest. We designed a widely applicable method, dubbed 
      barcorded synthetic tandem repeat promoter screening (BC-STAR-PROM), to identify 
      signal-activated TFs without any a priori knowledge about their properties. The
      BC-STAR-PROM library consists of approximately 3000 luciferase expression
      vectors, each harboring a promoter (composed of six tandem repeats of synthetic
      random DNA) and an associated barcode of 20 base pairs (bp) within the 3'
      untranslated mRNA region. Together, the promoter sequences encompass >400,000 bp 
      of random DNA, a sequence complexity sufficient to capture most TFs. Cells
      transfected with the library are exposed to a signal, and the mRNAs that it
      encodes are counted by next-generation sequencing of the barcodes. This allows
      the simultaneous activity tracking of each of the approximately 3000 synthetic
      promoters in a single experiment. Here we establish proof of concept for
      BC-STAR-PROM by applying it to the identification of TFs induced by drugs
      affecting actin and tubulin cytoskeleton dynamics. BC-STAR-PROM revealed that
      serum response factor (SRF) is the only immediate early TF induced by both actin 
      polymerization and microtubule depolymerization. Such changes in cytoskeleton
      dynamics are known to occur during the cell division cycle, and real-time
      bioluminescence microscopy indeed revealed cell-autonomous SRF-myocardin-related 
      TF (MRTF) activity bouts in proliferating cells.

AB  - The production of a single mRNA is the result of many sequential steps, from
      docking of transcription factors to polymerase initiation, elongation, splicing, 
      and, finally, termination. Much of our knowledge about the fundamentals of RNA
      synthesis and processing come from ensemble in vitro biochemical measurements.
      Single-molecule approaches are very much in this same reductionist tradition but 
      offer exquisite sensitivity in space and time along with the ability to observe
      heterogeneous behavior and actually manipulate macromolecules. These techniques
      can also be applied in vivo, allowing one to address questions in living cells
      that were previously restricted to reconstituted systems. In this review, we
      examine the unique insights that single-molecule techniques have yielded on the
      mechanisms of gene expression.

AB  - In this issue of Genes & Development, Zeng and colleagues (pp. 1822-1836)
      identify lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) as a pivotal regulator of
      whole-body energy expenditure by controlling the oxidative and thermogenic
      activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT). They show that LSD1 interacts with PRDM16
      to repress select white adipose tissue (WAT) genes but also represses
      hydroxysteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1) independently of PRDM16 to
      prevent production of glucocorticoids that impair BAT functions. Their study
      provides important insight into epigenetic mechanisms regulating the function of 
      BAT.

AB  - The tumor microenvironment influences cancer progression and therapy outcome by
      mechanisms not yet fully understood. In this issue of Genes & Development, Bent
      and colleagues (pp. 1811-1821) show how chemotherapy causes endothelial
      senescence. Interestingly, senescent endothelial cells do not mount a typical
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype but instead acutely secrete IL-6,
      promoting chemoresistance. This study unveils a physiological switch involving
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling that restrains the senescence secretory responses to
      limit the detrimental consequences of persistent inflammation.

TI  - Loss of the SUMO protease Ulp2 triggers a specific multichromosome aneuploidy.
PG  - 1881-94
LID - 10.1101/gad.282194.116 [doi]
AB  - Post-translational protein modification by the small ubiquitin-related modifier
      (SUMO) regulates numerous cellular pathways, including transcription, cell
      division, and genome maintenance. The SUMO protease Ulp2 modulates many of these 
      SUMO-dependent processes in budding yeast. From whole-genome RNA sequencing
      (RNA-seq), we unexpectedly discovered that cells lacking Ulp2 display a twofold
      increase in transcript levels across two particular chromosomes: chromosome I
      (ChrI) and ChrXII. This is due to the two chromosomes being present at twice
      their normal copy number. An abnormal number of chromosomes, termed aneuploidy,
      is usually deleterious. However, development of specific aneuploidies allows
      rapid adaptation to cellular stresses, and aneuploidy characterizes most human
      tumors. Extra copies of ChrI and ChrXII appear quickly following loss of active
      Ulp2 and can be eliminated following reintroduction of ULP2, suggesting that
      aneuploidy is a reversible adaptive mechanism to counteract loss of the SUMO
      protease. Importantly, increased dosage of two genes on ChrI-CLN3 and CCR4,
      encoding a G1-phase cyclin and a subunit of the Ccr4-Not deadenylase complex,
      respectively-suppresses ulp2Delta aneuploidy, suggesting that increased levels of
      these genes underlie the aneuploidy induced by Ulp2 loss. Our results reveal a
      complex aneuploidy mechanism that adapts cells to loss of the SUMO protease Ulp2.

TI  - IKKbeta promotes metabolic adaptation to glutamine deprivation via
      phosphorylation and inhibition of PFKFB3.
PG  - 1837-51
LID - 10.1101/gad.287235.116 [doi]
AB  - Glutamine is an essential nutrient for cancer cell survival and proliferation.
      Enhanced utilization of glutamine often depletes its local supply, yet how cancer
      cells adapt to low glutamine conditions is largely unknown. Here, we report that 
      IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) is activated upon glutamine deprivation and is
      required for cell survival independently of NF-kappaB transcription. We
      demonstrate that IKKbeta directly interacts with and phosphorylates
      6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), a major
      driver of aerobic glycolysis, at Ser269 upon glutamine deprivation to inhibit its
      activity, thereby down-regulating aerobic glycolysis when glutamine levels are
      low. Thus, due to lack of inhibition of PFKFB3, IKKbeta-deficient cells exhibit
      elevated aerobic glycolysis and lactate production, leading to less glucose
      carbons contributing to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and the
      pentose phosphate pathway, which results in increased glutamine dependence for
      both TCA cycle intermediates and reactive oxygen species suppression. Therefore, 
      coinhibition of IKKbeta and glutamine metabolism results in dramatic synergistic 
      killing of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In all, our results uncover a 
      previously unidentified role of IKKbeta in regulating glycolysis, sensing
      low-glutamine-induced metabolic stress, and promoting cellular adaptation to
      nutrient availability.

TI  - Precommitment low-level Neurog3 expression defines a long-lived mitotic
      endocrine-biased progenitor pool that drives production of endocrine-committed
      cells.
PG  - 1852-65
LID - 10.1101/gad.284729.116 [doi]
AB  - The current model for endocrine cell specification in the pancreas invokes
      high-level production of the transcription factor Neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) in
      Sox9(+) bipotent epithelial cells as the trigger for endocrine commitment, cell
      cycle exit, and rapid delamination toward proto-islet clusters. This model posits
      a transient Neurog3 expression state and short epithelial residence period. We
      show, however, that a Neurog3(TA.LO) cell population, defined as Neurog3
      transcriptionally active and Sox9(+) and often containing nonimmunodetectable
      Neurog3 protein, has a relatively high mitotic index and prolonged epithelial
      residency. We propose that this endocrine-biased mitotic progenitor state is
      functionally separated from a pro-ductal pool and endows them with long-term
      capacity to make endocrine fate-directed progeny. A novel BAC transgenic Neurog3 
      reporter detected two types of mitotic behavior in Sox9(+) Neurog3(TA.LO)
      progenitors, associated with progenitor pool maintenance or derivation of
      endocrine-committed Neurog3(HI) cells, respectively. Moreover, limiting Neurog3
      expression dramatically increased the proportional representation of Sox9(+)
      Neurog3(TA.LO) progenitors, with a doubling of its mitotic index relative to
      normal Neurog3 expression, suggesting that low Neurog3 expression is a defining
      feature of this cycling endocrine-biased state. We propose that Sox9(+)
      Neurog3(TA.LO) endocrine-biased progenitors feed production of Neurog3(HI)
      endocrine-committed cells during pancreas organogenesis.

AB  - Cancer therapy targets malignant cells that are surrounded by a diverse
      complement of nonmalignant stromal cells. Therapy-induced damage of normal cells 
      can alter the tumor microenvironment, causing cellular senescence and activating 
      cancer-promoting inflammation. However, how these damage responses are regulated 
      (both induced and resolved) to preserve tissue homeostasis and prevent chronic
      inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we detail an acute chemotherapy-induced 
      secretory response that is self-limiting in vitro and in vivo despite the
      induction of cellular senescence. We used tissue-specific knockout mice to
      demonstrate that endothelial production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6
      promotes chemoresistance and show that the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin induces
      acute IL-6 release through reactive oxygen species-mediated p38 activation in
      vitro. Doxorubicin causes endothelial senescence but, surprisingly, without a
      typical senescence secretory response. We found that endothelial cells repress
      senescence-associated inflammation through the down-regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
      signaling and that reactivation of this pathway restores senescence-associated
      inflammation. Thus, we describe a mechanism by which damage-associated paracrine 
      secretory responses are restrained to preserve tissue homeostasis and prevent
      chronic inflammation.

TI  - Direct interrogation of the role of H3K9 in metazoan heterochromatin function.
PG  - 1866-80
LID - 10.1101/gad.286278.116 [doi]
AB  - A defining feature of heterochromatin is methylation of Lys9 of histone H3
      (H3K9me), a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Although H3K9
      methyltransferases and HP1 are necessary for proper heterochromatin structure,
      the specific contribution of H3K9 to heterochromatin function and animal
      development is unknown. Using our recently developed platform to engineer histone
      genes in Drosophila, we generated H3K9R mutant flies, separating the functions of
      H3K9 and nonhistone substrates of H3K9 methyltransferases. Nucleosome occupancy
      and HP1a binding at pericentromeric heterochromatin are markedly decreased in
      H3K9R mutants. Despite these changes in chromosome architecture, a small
      percentage of H3K9R mutants complete development. Consistent with this result,
      expression of most protein-coding genes, including those within heterochromatin, 
      is similar between H3K9R and controls. In contrast, H3K9R mutants exhibit
      increased open chromatin and transcription from piRNA clusters and transposons,
      resulting in transposon mobilization. Hence, transposon silencing is a major
      developmental function of H3K9.

TI  - Lysine-specific demethylase 1 promotes brown adipose tissue thermogenesis via
      repressing glucocorticoid activation.
PG  - 1822-36
LID - 10.1101/gad.285312.116 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipocytes display phenotypic plasticity, as they can switch between the
      active states of fatty acid oxidation and energy dissipation versus a more
      dormant state. Cold exposure or beta-adrenergic stimulation favors the active
      thermogenic state, whereas sympathetic denervation or glucocorticoid
      administration promotes more lipid accumulation. Our understanding of the
      molecular mechanisms underlying these switches is incomplete. Here we found that 
      LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1), a histone demethylase, regulates brown
      adipocyte metabolism in two ways. On the one hand, LSD1 associates with PRDM16 to
      repress expression of white fat-selective genes. On the other hand, LSD1
      represses HSD11B1 (hydroxysteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 1), a key
      glucocorticoid-activating enzyme, independently from PRDM16. Adipose-specific
      ablation of LSD1 impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation capacity of the
      brown adipose tissue, reduced whole-body energy expenditure, and increased fat
      deposition, which can be significantly alleviated by simultaneously deleting
      HSD11B1. These findings establish a novel regulatory pathway connecting histone
      modification and hormone activation with mitochondrial oxidative capacity and
      whole-body energy homeostasis.

TI  - In vivo dendrite regeneration after injury is different from dendrite
      development.
PG  - 1776-89
LID - 10.1101/gad.282848.116 [doi]
AB  - Neurons receive information along dendrites and send signals along axons to
      synaptic contacts. The factors that control axon regeneration have been examined 
      in many systems, but dendrite regeneration has been largely unexplored. Here we
      report that, in intact Drosophila larvae, a discrete injury that removes all
      dendrites induces robust dendritic growth that recreates many features of
      uninjured dendrites, including the number of dendrite branches that regenerate
      and responsiveness to sensory stimuli. However, the growth and patterning of
      injury-induced dendrites is significantly different from uninjured dendrites. We 
      found that regenerated arbors cover much less territory than uninjured neurons,
      fail to avoid crossing over other branches from the same neuron, respond less
      strongly to mechanical stimuli, and are pruned precociously. Finally, silencing
      the electrical activity of the neurons specifically blocks injury-induced, but
      not developmental, dendrite growth. By elucidating the essential features of
      dendrites grown in response to acute injury, our work builds a framework for
      exploring dendrite regeneration in physiological and pathological conditions.

AB  - Codon usage bias is a universal feature of all genomes, but its in vivo
      biological functions in animal systems are not clear. To investigate the in vivo 
      role of codon usage in animals, we took advantage of the sensitivity and
      robustness of the Drosophila circadian system. By codon-optimizing parts of
      Drosophila period (dper), a core clock gene that encodes a critical component of 
      the circadian oscillator, we showed that dper codon usage is important for
      circadian clock function. Codon optimization of dper resulted in conformational
      changes of the dPER protein, altered dPER phosphorylation profile and stability, 
      and impaired dPER function in the circadian negative feedback loop, which
      manifests into changes in molecular rhythmicity and abnormal circadian behavioral
      output. This study provides an in vivo example that demonstrates the role of
      codon usage in determining protein structure and function in an animal system.
      These results suggest a universal mechanism in eukaryotes that uses a codon usage
      "code" within genetic codons to regulate cotranslational protein folding.

TI  - Female mice lacking Xist RNA show partial dosage compensation and survive to
      term.
PG  - 1747-60
LID - 10.1101/gad.281162.116 [doi]
AB  - X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) compensates for differences in X-chromosome
      number between male and female mammals. XCI is orchestrated by Xist RNA, whose
      expression in early development leads to transcriptional silencing of one X
      chromosome in the female. Knockout studies have established a requirement for
      Xist with inviability of female embryos that inherit an Xist deletion from the
      father. Here, we report that female mice lacking Xist RNA can, surprisingly,
      develop and survive to term. Xist-null females are born at lower frequency and
      are smaller at birth, but organogenesis is mostly normal. Transcriptomic analysis
      indicates significant overexpression of hundreds of X-linked genes across
      multiple tissues. Therefore, Xist-null mice can develop to term in spite of a
      deficiency of dosage compensation. However, the degree of X-autosomal dosage
      imbalance was less than anticipated (1.14-fold to 1.36-fold). Thus, partial
      dosage compensation can be achieved without Xist, supporting the idea of inherent
      genome balance. Nevertheless, to date, none of the mutant mice has survived
      beyond weaning stage. Sudden death is associated with failure of postnatal organ 
      maturation. Our data suggest Xist-independent mechanisms of dosage compensation
      and demonstrate that small deviations from X-autosomal balance can have profound 
      effects on overall fitness.

TI  - USP14 regulates autophagy by suppressing K63 ubiquitination of Beclin 1.
PG  - 1718-30
LID - 10.1101/gad.285122.116 [doi]
AB  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are two major intracellular
      degradative mechanisms that mediate the turnover of complementary repertoires of 
      intracellular proteomes. Simultaneously activating both UPS and autophagy might
      provide a powerful strategy for the clearance of misfolded proteins. However, it 
      is not clear whether UPS and autophagy can be controlled by a common regulatory
      mechanism. K48 deubiquitination by USP14 is known to inhibit UPS. Here we show
      that USP14 regulates autophagy by negatively controlling K63 ubiquitination of
      Beclin 1. Furthermore, we show that activation of USP14 by Akt-mediated
      phosphorylation provides a mechanism for Akt to negatively regulate autophagy by 
      promoting K63 deubiquitination. Our study suggests that Akt-regulated USP14
      activity modulates both proteasomal degradation and autophagy through controlling
      K48 and K63 ubiquitination, respectively. Therefore, regulation of USP14 provides
      a mechanism for Akt to control both proteasomal and autophagic degradation. We
      propose that inhibition of USP14 may provide a strategy to promote both UPS and
      autophagy for developing novel therapeutics targeting neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - DNA replication origins-where do we begin?
PG  - 1683-97
LID - 10.1101/gad.285114.116 [doi]
AB  - For more than three decades, investigators have sought to identify the precise
      locations where DNA replication initiates in mammalian genomes. The development
      of molecular and biochemical approaches to identify start sites of DNA
      replication (origins) based on the presence of defining and characteristic
      replication intermediates at specific loci led to the identification of only a
      handful of mammalian replication origins. The limited number of identified
      origins prevented a comprehensive and exhaustive search for conserved genomic
      features that were capable of specifying origins of DNA replication. More
      recently, the adaptation of origin-mapping assays to genome-wide approaches has
      led to the identification of tens of thousands of replication origins throughout 
      mammalian genomes, providing an unprecedented opportunity to identify both
      genetic and epigenetic features that define and regulate their distribution and
      utilization. Here we summarize recent advances in our understanding of how
      primary sequence, chromatin environment, and nuclear architecture contribute to
      the dynamic selection and activation of replication origins across diverse cell
      types and developmental stages.

TI  - Autophagy provides metabolic substrates to maintain energy charge and nucleotide 
      pools in Ras-driven lung cancer cells.
PG  - 1704-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.283416.116 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy degrades and is thought to recycle proteins, other macromolecules, and 
      organelles. In genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for Kras-driven lung
      cancer, autophagy prevents the accumulation of defective mitochondria and
      promotes malignancy. Autophagy-deficient tumor-derived cell lines are
      respiration-impaired and starvation-sensitive. However, to what extent their
      sensitivity to starvation arises from defective mitochondria or an impaired
      supply of metabolic substrates remains unclear. Here, we sequenced the
      mitochondrial genomes of wild-type or autophagy-deficient (Atg7(-/-)) Kras-driven
      lung tumors. Although Atg7 deletion resulted in increased mitochondrial
      mutations, there were too few nonsynonymous mutations to cause generalized
      mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast, pulse-chase studies with isotope-labeled 
      nutrients revealed impaired mitochondrial substrate supply during starvation of
      the autophagy-deficient cells. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen
      species (ROS), lower energy charge, and a dramatic drop in total nucleotide
      pools. While starvation survival of the autophagy-deficient cells was not rescued
      by the general antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, it was fully rescued by glutamine
      or glutamate (both amino acids that feed the TCA cycle and nucleotide synthesis) 
      or nucleosides. Thus, maintenance of nucleotide pools is a critical challenge for
      starving Kras-driven tumor cells. By providing bioenergetic and biosynthetic
      substrates, autophagy supports nucleotide pools and thereby starvation survival.

AB  - The coordinated regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level is
      fundamental to development and homeostasis. Inducible systems are invaluable when
      studying transcription because the regulatory process can be triggered
      instantaneously, allowing the tracking of ordered mechanistic events. Here, we
      use precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) to examine the genome-wide heat shock
      (HS) response in Drosophila and the function of two key transcription factors on 
      the immediate transcription activation or repression of all genes regulated by
      HS. We identify the primary HS response genes and the rate-limiting steps in the 
      transcription cycle that GAGA-associated factor (GAF) and HS factor (HSF)
      regulate. We demonstrate that GAF acts upstream of promoter-proximally paused RNA
      polymerase II (Pol II) formation (likely at the step of chromatin opening) and
      that GAF-facilitated Pol II pausing is critical for HS activation. In contrast,
      HSF is dispensable for establishing or maintaining Pol II pausing but is critical
      for the release of paused Pol II into the gene body at a subset of highly
      activated genes. Additionally, HSF has no detectable role in the rapid HS
      repression of thousands of genes.

LID - 10.1101/gad.282756.116 [doi]
AB  - Adult stem cells must limit their rate of protein synthesis, but the underlying
      mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Differences in protein synthesis among
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells did not correlate with
      differences in proteasome activity, total RNA content, mRNA content, or cell
      division rate. However, adult HSCs had more hypophosphorylated eukaryotic
      initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and 4E-BP2 as compared with most 
      other hematopoietic progenitors. Deficiency for 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 significantly
      increased global protein synthesis in HSCs, but not in other hematopoietic
      progenitors, and impaired their reconstituting activity, identifying a mechanism 
      that promotes HSC maintenance by attenuating protein synthesis.

TI  - A conserved virus-induced cytoplasmic TRAMP-like complex recruits the exosome to 
      target viral RNA for degradation.
PG  - 1658-70
LID - 10.1101/gad.284604.116 [doi]
AB  - RNA degradation is tightly regulated to selectively target aberrant RNAs,
      including viral RNA, but this regulation is incompletely understood. Through RNAi
      screening in Drosophila cells, we identified the 3'-to-5' RNA exosome and two
      components of the exosome cofactor TRAMP (Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation)
      complex, dMtr4 and dZcchc7, as antiviral against a panel of RNA viruses. We
      extended our studies to human orthologs and found that the exosome as well as
      TRAMP components hMTR4 and hZCCHC7 are antiviral. While hMTR4 and hZCCHC7 are
      normally nuclear, infection by cytoplasmic RNA viruses induces their export,
      forming a cytoplasmic complex that specifically recognizes and induces
      degradation of viral mRNAs. Furthermore, the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of
      bunyaviral mRNA is sufficient to confer virus-induced exosomal degradation.
      Altogether, our results reveal that signals from viral infection repurpose TRAMP 
      components to a cytoplasmic surveillance role where they selectively engage viral
      RNAs for degradation to restrict a broad range of viruses.

TI  - A single double-strand break system reveals repair dynamics and mechanisms in
      heterochromatin and euchromatin.
PG  - 1645-57
LID - 10.1101/gad.283028.116 [doi]
AB  - Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) must be properly orchestrated in
      diverse chromatin regions to maintain genome stability. The choice between two
      main DSB repair pathways, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous
      recombination (HR), is regulated by the cell cycle as well as chromatin
      context.Pericentromeric heterochromatin forms a distinct nuclear domain that is
      enriched for repetitive DNA sequences that pose significant challenges for genome
      stability. Heterochromatic DSBs display specialized temporal and spatial dynamics
      that differ from euchromatic DSBs. Although HR is thought to be the main pathway 
      used to repair heterochromatic DSBs, direct tests of this hypothesis are lacking.
      Here, we developed an in vivo single DSB system for both heterochromatic and
      euchromatic loci in Drosophila melanogaster Live imaging of single DSBs in larval
      imaginal discs recapitulates the spatio-temporal dynamics observed for
      irradiation (IR)-induced breaks in cell culture. Importantly, live imaging and
      sequence analysis of repair products reveal that DSBs in euchromatin and
      heterochromatin are repaired with similar kinetics, employ both NHEJ and HR, and 
      can use homologous chromosomes as an HR template. This direct analysis reveals
      important insights into heterochromatin DSB repair in animal tissues and provides
      a foundation for further explorations of repair mechanisms in different chromatin
      domains.

TI  - Oncogenic transformation of Drosophila somatic cells induces a functional piRNA
      pathway.

AB  - Germline genes often become re-expressed in soma-derived human cancers as
      "cancer/testis antigens" (CTAs), and piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway
      proteins are found among CTAs. However, whether and how the piRNA pathway
      contributes to oncogenesis in human neoplasms remain poorly understood. We found 
      that oncogenic Ras combined with loss of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway
      reactivates a primary piRNA pathway in Drosophila somatic cells coincident with
      oncogenic transformation. In these cells, Piwi becomes loaded with piRNAs derived
      from annotated generative loci, which are normally restricted to either the
      germline or the somatic follicle cells. Negating the pathway leads to increases
      in the expression of a wide variety of transposons and also altered expression of
      some protein-coding genes. This correlates with a reduction in the proliferation 
      of the transformed cells in culture, suggesting that, at least in this context,
      the piRNA pathway may play a functional role in cancer.

PG  - 1617-22

AB  - In Drosophila germ cells, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are amplified through a 
      PIWI slicer-dependent feed-forward loop termed the ping-pong cycle, yielding
      secondary piRNAs. However, the detailed mechanism remains poorly understood,
      largely because an ex vivo model system amenable to biochemical analyses has not 
      been available. Here, we show that CRISPR-mediated loss of function of lethal (3)
      malignant brain tumor [l(3)mbt] leads to ectopic activation of the germ-specific 
      ping-pong cycle in ovarian somatic cells. Perinuclear foci resembling nuage, the 
      ping-pong center, appeared following l(3)mbt mutation. This activation of the
      ping-pong machinery in cultured cells will greatly facilitate elucidation of the 
      mechanism underlying secondary piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila.

AB  - High-frequency point mutations of genes encoding histones have been identified
      recently as novel drivers in a number of tumors. Specifically, the H3K36M/I
      mutations were shown to be oncogenic in chondroblastomas and undifferentiated
      sarcomas by inhibiting H3K36 methyltransferases, including SETD2. Here we report 
      the crystal structures of the SETD2 catalytic domain bound to H3K36M or H3K36I
      peptides with SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine). In the complex structure, the
      catalytic domain adopts an open conformation, with the K36M/I peptide snuggly
      positioned in a newly formed substrate channel. Our structural and biochemical
      data reveal the molecular basis underying oncohistone recognition by and
      inhibition of SETD2.

PG  - 1598-610
LID - 10.1101/gad.283838.116 [doi]
AB  - Nucleoli form around tandem arrays of a ribosomal gene repeat, termed nucleolar
      organizer regions (NORs). During metaphase, active NORs adopt a characteristic
      undercondensed morphology. Recent evidence indicates that the HMG-box-containing 
      DNA-binding protein UBF (upstream binding factor) is directly responsible for
      this morphology and provides a mitotic bookmark to ensure rapid nucleolar
      formation beginning in telophase in human cells. This is likely to be a widely
      employed strategy, as UBF is present throughout metazoans. In higher eukaryotes, 
      NORs are typically located within regions of chromosomes that form perinucleolar 
      heterochromatin during interphase. Typically, the genomic architecture of NORs
      and the chromosomal regions within which they lie is very poorly described, yet
      recent evidence points to a role for context in their function. In Arabidopsis,
      NOR silencing appears to be controlled by sequences outside the rDNA (ribosomal
      DNA) array. Translocations reveal a role for context in the expression of the NOR
      on the X chromosome in Drosophila Recent work has begun on characterizing the
      genomic architecture of human NORs. A role for distal sequences located in
      perinucleolar heterochromatin has been inferred, as they exhibit a complex
      transcriptionally active chromatin structure. Links between rDNA genomic
      stability and aging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are now well established, and
      indications are emerging that this is important in aging and replicative
      senescence in higher eukaryotes. This, combined with the fact that rDNA arrays
      are recombinational hot spots in cancer cells, has focused attention on DNA
      damage responses in NORs. The introduction of DNA double-strand breaks into rDNA 
      arrays leads to a dramatic reorganization of nucleolar structure. Damaged rDNA
      repeats move from the nucleolar interior to form caps at the nucleolar periphery,
      presumably to facilitate repair, suggesting that the chromosomal context of human
      NORs contributes to their genomic stability. The inclusion of NORs and their
      surrounding chromosomal environments in future genome drafts now becomes a
      priority.

AB  - The mammalian intestine harbors one of the largest microbial densities on Earth, 
      necessitating the implementation of control mechanisms by which the host
      evaluates the state of microbial colonization and reacts to deviations from
      homeostasis. While microbial recognition by the innate immune system has been
      firmly established as an efficient means by which the host evaluates microbial
      presence, recent work has uncovered a central role for bacterial metabolites in
      the orchestration of the host immune response. In this review, we highlight
      examples of how microbiota-modulated metabolites control the development,
      differentiation, and activity of the immune system and classify them into
      functional categories that illustrate the spectrum of ways by which microbial
      metabolites influence host physiology. A comprehensive understanding of how
      microbiota-derived metabolites shape the human immune system is critical for the 
      rational design of therapies for microbiota-driven diseases.

      development.
PG  - 1671-82
LID - 10.1101/gad.284802.116 [doi]
AB  - Eukaryotic mRNAs are subject to multiple types of tailing that critically
      influence mRNA stability and translatability. To investigate RNA tails at the
      genomic scale, we previously developed TAIL-seq, but its low sensitivity
      precluded its application to biological materials of minute quantity. In this
      study, we report a new version of TAIL-seq (mRNA TAIL-seq [mTAIL-seq]) with
      enhanced sequencing depth for mRNAs (by approximately 1000-fold compared with the
      previous version). The improved method allows us to investigate the regulation of
      poly(A) tails in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. We found that maternal mRNAs are
      polyadenylated mainly during late oogenesis, prior to fertilization, and that
      further modulation occurs upon egg activation. Wispy, a noncanonical poly(A)
      polymerase, adenylates the vast majority of maternal mRNAs, with a few intriguing
      exceptions such as ribosomal protein transcripts. By comparing mTAIL-seq data
      with ribosome profiling data, we found a strong coupling between poly(A) tail
      length and translational efficiency during egg activation. Our data suggest that 
      regulation of poly(A) tails in oocytes shapes the translatomic landscape of
      embryos, thereby directing the onset of animal development. By virtue of the high
      sensitivity, low cost, technical robustness, and broad accessibility, mTAIL-seq
      will be a potent tool to improve our understanding of mRNA tailing in diverse
      biological systems.

TI  - HNF6 and Rev-erbalpha integrate hepatic lipid metabolism by overlapping and

AB  - Hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) is required for liver development, but its
      role in adult liver metabolism is not known. Here we show that deletion of HNF6
      in livers of adult C57Bl/6 mice leads to hepatic steatosis in mice fed normal
      laboratory chow. Although HNF6 is known mainly as a transcriptional activator,
      hepatic loss of HNF6 up-regulated many lipogenic genes bound directly by HNF6.
      Many of these genes are targets of the circadian nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha,
      and binding of Rev-erbalpha at these sites was lost when HNF6 was ablated in the 
      liver. While HNF6 and Rev-erbalpha coordinately regulate hepatic lipid
      metabolism, each factor also affects additional gene sets independently. These
      findings highlight a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by HNF6 and
      demonstrate how overlapping and distinct mechanisms of transcription factor
      function contribute to the integrated physiology of the liver.

TI  - Toward the mechanism of eIF4F-mediated ribosomal attachment to mammalian capped
      mRNAs.
PG  - 1573-88
LID - 10.1101/gad.282418.116 [doi]
AB  - Ribosomal attachment to mammalian capped mRNAs is achieved through the
      cap-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-eIF4G-eIF3-40S chain of interactions,
      but the mechanism by which mRNA enters the mRNA-binding channel of the 40S
      subunit remains unknown. To investigate this process, we recapitulated initiation
      on capped mRNAs in vitro using a reconstituted translation system. Formation of
      initiation complexes at 5'-terminal AUGs was stimulated by the eIF4E-cap
      interaction and followed "the first AUG" rule, indicating that it did not occur
      by backward scanning. Initiation complexes formed even at the very 5' end of
      mRNA, implying that Met-tRNAi (Met) inspects mRNA from the first nucleotide and
      that initiation does not have a "blind spot." In assembled initiation complexes, 
      the cap was no longer associated with eIF4E. Omission of eIF4A or disruption of
      eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF3 interactions converted eIF4E into a specific inhibitor of
      initiation on capped mRNAs. Taken together, these results are consistent with the
      model in which eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF3-40S interactions place eIF4E at the leading edge 
      of the 40S subunit, and mRNA is threaded into the mRNA-binding channel such that 
      Met-tRNAi (Met) can inspect it from the first nucleotide. Before entering, eIF4E 
      likely dissociates from the cap to overcome steric hindrance. We also found that 
      the m(7)G cap specifically interacts with eIF3l.

PG  - 1558-72
LID - 10.1101/gad.280222.116 [doi]
AB  - Termination of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription is associated with RNA 3'
      end formation. For coding genes, termination is initiated by the
      cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. In contrast, a majority of noncoding
      transcription events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not rely on RNA cleavage
      for termination but instead terminates via a pathway that requires the
      Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex. Here we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe
      ortholog of Nrd1, Seb1, does not function in NNS-like termination but promotes
      polyadenylation site selection of coding and noncoding genes. We found that Seb1 
      associates with 3' end processing factors, is enriched at the 3' end of genes,
      and binds RNA motifs downstream from cleavage sites. Importantly, a deficiency in
      Seb1 resulted in widespread changes in 3' untranslated region (UTR) length as a
      consequence of increased alternative polyadenylation. Given that Seb1 levels
      affected the recruitment of conserved 3' end processing factors, our findings
      indicate that the conserved RNA-binding protein Seb1 cotranscriptionally controls
      alternative polyadenylation.

TI  - HGF-independent regulation of MET and GAB1 by nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FER
      potentiates metastasis in ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1542-57
LID - 10.1101/gad.284166.116 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian cancer cells disseminate readily within the peritoneal cavity, which
      promotes metastasis, and are often resistant to chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer
      patients tend to present with advanced disease, which also limits treatment
      options; consequently, new therapies are required. The oncoprotein tyrosine
      kinase MET, which is the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been
      implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis and has been the subject of extensive drug
      development efforts. Here, we report a novel ligand- and
      autophosphorylation-independent activation of MET through the nonreceptor
      tyrosine kinase feline sarcoma-related (FER). We demonstrated that the levels of 
      FER were elevated in ovarian cancer cell lines relative to those in immortalized 
      normal surface epithelial cells and that suppression of FER attenuated the
      motility and invasive properties of these cancer cells. Furthermore, loss of FER 
      impaired the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, we
      demonstrated that FER phosphorylated a signaling site in MET: Tyr1349. This
      enhanced activation of RAC1/PAK1 and promoted a kinase-independent scaffolding
      function that led to recruitment and phosphorylation of GAB1 and the specific
      activation of the SHP2-ERK signaling pathway. Overall, this analysis provides new
      insights into signaling events that underlie metastasis in ovarian cancer cells, 
      consistent with a prometastatic role of FER and highlighting its potential as a
      novel therapeutic target for metastatic ovarian cancer.

AB  - Growth of a complex multicellular organism requires coordinated changes in
      diverse cell types. These cellular changes generate organs of the correct size,
      shape, and functionality. In plants, the growth hormone auxin induces stem
      elongation in response to shade; however, which cell types of the stem perceive
      the auxin signal and contribute to organ growth is poorly understood. Here, we
      blocked the transcriptional response to auxin within specific tissues to show
      that auxin signaling is required in many cell types for correct hypocotyl growth 
      in shade, with a key role for the epidermis. Combining genetic manipulations in
      Arabidopsis thaliana with transcriptional profiling of the hypocotyl epidermis
      from Brassica rapa, we show that auxin acts in the epidermis in part by inducing 
      activity of the locally acting, growth-promoting brassinosteroid pathway. Our
      findings clarify cell-specific auxin function in the hypocotyl and highlight the 
      complexity of cell type interactions within a growing organ.

TI  - A microRNA program in the C. elegans hypodermis couples to intestinal
      mTORC2/PQM-1 signaling to modulate fat transport.
PG  - 1515-28
LID - 10.1101/gad.283895.116 [doi]
AB  - Animals integrate metabolic, developmental, and environmental information before 
      committing key resources to reproduction. In Caenorhabditis elegans, adult
      animals transport fat from intestinal cells to the germline to promote
      reproduction. We identified a microRNA (miRNA)-regulated developmental timing
      pathway that functions in the hypodermis to nonautonomously coordinate the
      mobilization of intestinal fat stores to the germline upon initiation of
      adulthood. This developmental timing pathway, which is controlled by the lin-4
      and let-7 miRNAs, engages mTOR signaling in the intestine. The intestinal
      signaling component is specific to mTORC2 and functions in parallel to the
      insulin pathway to modulate the activity of the serum/glucocorticoid-regulated
      kinase (SGK-1). Surprisingly, SGK-1 functions independently of DAF-16/FoxO;
      instead, SGK-1 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of the PQM-1 transcription
      factor, which antagonizes intestinal fat mobilization at the transcriptional
      level when localized to the nucleus. These results revealed that a
      non-cell-autonomous developmental input regulates intestinal fat metabolism by
      engaging mTORC2 signaling to promote the intertissue transport of fat reserves
      from the soma to the germline.

AB  - The complexities of DNA recognition by transcription factors (TFs) with multiple 
      Cys2-His2 zinc fingers (C2H2-ZFs) remain poorly studied. We previously reported a
      mutation (R1092W) in the C2H2-ZF TF Zfp335 that led to selective loss of binding 
      at a subset of targets, although the basis for this effect was unclear. We show
      that Zfp335 binds DNA and drives transcription via recognition of two distinct
      consensus motifs by separate ZF clusters and identify the specific motif
      interaction disrupted by R1092W. Our work presents Zfp335 as a model for
      understanding how C2H2-ZF TFs may use multiple recognition motifs to control gene
      expression.

LID - 10.1101/gad.281188.116 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptional repression is a pervasive feature of animal development. Here, we
      employ live-imaging methods to visualize the Snail repressor, which establishes
      the boundary between the presumptive mesoderm and neurogenic ectoderm of early
      Drosophila embryos. Snail target enhancers were attached to an MS2 reporter gene,
      permitting detection of nascent transcripts in living embryos. The transgenes
      exhibit initially broad patterns of transcription but are refined by repression
      in the mesoderm following mitosis. These observations reveal a correlation
      between mitotic silencing and Snail repression. We propose that mitosis and other
      inherent discontinuities in transcription boost the activities of
      sequence-specific repressors, such as Snail.

PG  - 1492-502
LID - 10.1101/gad.282145.116 [doi]
AB  - The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene 
      to be molecularly defined. RB1 mutations occur in almost all familial and
      sporadic forms of retinoblastoma, and this gene is mutated at variable
      frequencies in a variety of other human cancers. Because of its early discovery, 
      the recessive nature of RB1 mutations, and its frequency of inactivation, RB1 is 
      often described as a prototype for the class of tumor suppressor genes. Its gene 
      product (pRB) regulates transcription and is a negative regulator of cell
      proliferation. Although these general features are well established, a precise
      description of pRB's mechanism of action has remained elusive. Indeed, in many
      regards, pRB remains an enigma. This review summarizes some recent developments
      in pRB research and focuses on progress toward answers for the three fundamental 
      questions that sit at the heart of the pRB literature: What does pRB do? How does
      the inactivation of RB change the cell? How can our knowledge of RB function be
      exploited to provide better treatment for cancer patients?

TI  - Regulating telomere length from the inside out: the replication fork model.
PG  - 1483-91
LID - 10.1101/gad.280578.116 [doi]
AB  - Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten
      during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length
      equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms 
      that regulate length at the molecular level. The prevailing protein-counting
      model for regulating telomerase access to elongate the telomere does not explain 
      accumulating evidence of a role of DNA replication in telomere length regulation.
      Here I present an alternative model: the replication fork model that can explain 
      how passage of a replication fork and regulation of origin firing affect telomere

AB  - In this issue of Genes & Development, Dowen and colleagues (pp. 1515-1528)
      elegantly unify two previously unconnected aspects of physiology. The
      investigators provide significant genetic evidence to support a critical link
      between developmental timing decisions and the regulation of lipid mobilization
      at the transition to adulthood in Caenorhabditis elegans This novel connection
      involves cross-tissue signaling from the hypodermis (epidermis) to the intestine 
      to promote reproductive success in the germline.

TI  - Modeling invasive lobular breast carcinoma by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic genome
      editing of the mammary gland.

LID - 10.1101/gad.279190.116 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale sequencing studies are rapidly identifying putative oncogenic
      mutations in human tumors. However, discrimination between passenger and driver
      events in tumorigenesis remains challenging and requires in vivo validation
      studies in reliable animal models of human cancer. In this study, we describe a
      novel strategy for in vivo validation of candidate tumor suppressors implicated
      in invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC), which is hallmarked by loss of the
      cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. We describe an approach to model ILC by
      intraductal injection of lentiviral vectors encoding Cre recombinase, the
      CRISPR/Cas9 system, or both in female mice carrying conditional alleles of the
      Cdh1 gene, encoding for E-cadherin. Using this approach, we were able to target
      ILC-initiating cells and induce specific gene disruption of Pten by
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic gene editing. Whereas intraductal injection of
      Cas9-encoding lentiviruses induced Cas9-specific immune responses and development
      of tumors that did not resemble ILC, lentiviral delivery of a Pten targeting
      single-guide RNA (sgRNA) in mice with mammary gland-specific loss of E-cadherin
      and expression of Cas9 efficiently induced ILC development. This versatile
      platform can be used for rapid in vivo testing of putative tumor suppressor genes
      implicated in ILC, providing new opportunities for modeling invasive lobular
      breast carcinoma in mice.

TI  - INO80 governs superenhancer-mediated oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in 
      melanoma.
PG  - 1440-53
LID - 10.1101/gad.277178.115 [doi]
AB  - Superenhancers (SEs) are large genomic regions with a high density of enhancer
      marks. In cancer, SEs are found near oncogenes and dictate cancer gene
      expression. However, how oncogenic SEs are regulated remains poorly understood.
      Here, we show that INO80, a chromatin remodeling complex, is required for
      SE-mediated oncogenic transcription and tumor growth in melanoma. The expression 
      of Ino80, the SWI/SNF ATPase, is elevated in melanoma cells and patient melanomas
      compared with normal melanocytes and benign nevi. Furthermore, Ino80 silencing
      selectively inhibits melanoma cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth,
      tumorigenesis, and tumor maintenance in mouse xenografts. Mechanistically, Ino80 
      occupies >90% of SEs, and its occupancy is dependent on transcription factors
      such as MITF and Sox9. Ino80 binding reduces nucleosome occupancy and facilitates
      Mediator recruitment, thus promoting oncogenic transcription. Consistently, genes
      co-occupied by Ino80 and Med1 are selectively expressed in melanomas compared
      with melanocytes. Together, our results reveal an essential role of
      INO80-dependent chromatin remodeling in SE function and suggest a novel strategy 
      for disrupting SEs in cancer treatment.

      transition.
PG  - 1423-39
LID - 10.1101/gad.280859.116 [doi]
AB  - During mitosis, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and many transcription factors
      dissociate from chromatin, and transcription ceases globally. Transcription is
      known to restart in bulk by telophase, but whether de novo transcription at the
      mitosis-G1 transition is in any way distinct from later in interphase remains
      unknown. We tracked Pol II occupancy genome-wide in mammalian cells progressing
      from mitosis through late G1. Unexpectedly, during the earliest rounds of
      transcription at the mitosis-G1 transition, approximately 50% of active genes and
      distal enhancers exhibit a spike in transcription, exceeding levels observed
      later in G1 phase. Enhancer-promoter chromatin contacts are depleted during
      mitosis and restored rapidly upon G1 entry but do not spike. Of the
      chromatin-associated features examined, histone H3 Lys27 acetylation levels at
      individual loci in mitosis best predict the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike.
      Single-molecule RNA imaging supports that the mitosis-G1 transcriptional spike
      can constitute the maximum transcriptional activity per DNA copy throughout the
      cell division cycle. The transcriptional spike occurs heterogeneously and
      propagates to cell-to-cell differences in mature mRNA expression. Our results
      raise the possibility that passage through the mitosis-G1 transition might
      predispose cells to diverge in gene expression states.

AB  - As a critical regulator of cell growth, the mechanistic target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) protein operates as part of two molecularly and functionally distinct
      complexes. Herein, we demonstrate that mTOR complex molecular composition varies 
      in different somatic tissues. In astrocytes and neural stem cells, we identified 
      G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) as a novel
      mTOR-binding protein, creating a unique mTOR complex lacking Raptor and Rictor.
      Moreover, GIT1 binding to mTOR is regulated by AKT activation and is essential
      for mTOR-mediated astrocyte survival. Together, these data reveal that mTOR
      complex function is partly dictated by its molecuflar composition in different
      cell types.

      organization.
PG  - 1357-82

AB  - The relevance of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization for transcriptional
      regulation and thereby for cellular fate at large is now widely accepted. Our
      understanding of the fascinating architecture underlying this function is based
      on microscopy studies as well as the chromosome conformation capture (3C)
      methods, which entered the stage at the beginning of the millennium. The first
      decade of 3C methods rendered unprecedented insights into genome topology. Here, 
      we provide an update of developments and discoveries made over the more recent
      years. As we discuss, established and newly developed experimental and
      computational methods enabled identification of novel, functionally important
      chromosome structures. Regulatory and architectural chromatin loops throughout
      the genome are being cataloged and compared between cell types, revealing tissue 
      invariant and developmentally dynamic loops. Architectural proteins shaping the
      genome were disclosed, and their mode of action is being uncovered. We explain
      how more detailed insights into the 3D genome increase our understanding of
      transcriptional regulation in development and misregulation in disease. Finally, 
      to help researchers in choosing the approach best tailored for their specific
      research question, we explain the differences and commonalities between the
      various 3C-derived methods.

TI  - The adrenal capsule is a signaling center controlling cell renewal and zonation
      through Rspo3.
PG  - 1389-94
LID - 10.1101/gad.277756.116 [doi]
AB  - Adrenal glands are zonated endocrine organs that are essential in controlling
      body homeostasis. How zonation is induced and maintained and how renewal of the
      adrenal cortex is ensured remain a mystery. Here we show that capsular RSPO3
      signals to the underlying steroidogenic compartment to induce beta-catenin
      signaling and imprint glomerulosa cell fate. Deletion of RSPO3 leads to loss of
      SHH signaling and impaired organ growth. Importantly, Rspo3 function remains
      essential in adult life to ensure replenishment of lost cells and maintain the
      properties of the zona glomerulosa. Thus, the adrenal capsule acts as a central
      signaling center that ensures replacement of damaged cells and is required to
      maintain zonation throughout life.

TI  - Mechanotransduction activates canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to promote
      lymphatic vascular patterning and the development of lymphatic and lymphovenous
      valves.

LID - 10.1101/gad.282400.116 [doi]
AB  - Lymphatic vasculature regulates fluid homeostasis by returning interstitial fluid
      to blood circulation. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are the building blocks 
      of the entire lymphatic vasculature. LECs originate as a homogeneous population
      of cells predominantly from the embryonic veins and undergo stepwise
      morphogenesis to become the lymphatic capillaries, collecting vessels or valves. 
      The molecular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis of the lymphatic
      vasculature remain to be fully understood. Here we show that canonical
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is necessary for lymphatic vascular morphogenesis.
      Lymphatic vascular-specific ablation of beta-catenin in mice prevents the
      formation of lymphatic and lymphovenous valves. Additionally, lymphatic vessel
      patterning is defective in these mice, with abnormal recruitment of mural cells. 
      We found that oscillatory shear stress (OSS), which promotes lymphatic vessel
      maturation, triggers Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in LECs. In turn,
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls the expression of several molecules,
      including the lymphedema-associated transcription factor FOXC2. Importantly,
      FOXC2 completely rescues the lymphatic vessel patterning defects in mice lacking 
      beta-catenin. Thus, our work reveals that mechanical stimulation is a critical
      regulator of lymphatic vascular development via activation of Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling and, in turn, FOXC2.

AB  - Aneuploidy, an imbalanced karyotype, is a widely observed feature of cancer cells
      that has long been hypothesized to promote tumorigenesis. Here we evaluate the
      fitness of cells with constitutional trisomy or chromosomal instability (CIN) in 
      vivo using hematopoietic reconstitution experiments. We did not observe cancer
      but instead found that aneuploid hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibit
      decreased fitness. This reduced fitness is due at least in part to the decreased 
      proliferative potential of aneuploid hematopoietic cells. Analyses of mice with
      CIN caused by a hypomorphic mutation in the gene Bub1b further support the
      finding that aneuploidy impairs cell proliferation in vivo. Whereas
      nonregenerating adult tissues are highly aneuploid in these mice, HSCs and other 
      regenerative adult tissues are largely euploid. These findings indicate that, in 
      vivo, mechanisms exist to select against aneuploid cells.

TI  - Tissue-specific down-regulation of S-adenosyl-homocysteine via suppression of
      dAhcyL1/dAhcyL2 extends health span and life span in Drosophila.
PG  - 1409-22
LID - 10.1101/gad.282277.116 [doi]
AB  - Aging is a risk factor for many human pathologies and is characterized by
      extensive metabolic changes. Using targeted high-throughput metabolite profiling 
      in Drosophila melanogaster at different ages, we demonstrate that methionine
      metabolism changes strikingly during aging. Methionine generates the methyl donor
      S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), which is converted via methylation to
      S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), which accumulates during aging. A targeted RNAi
      screen against methionine pathway components revealed significant life span
      extension in response to down-regulation of two noncanonical Drosophila homologs 
      of the SAH hydrolase Ahcy (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase [SAHH[),
      CG9977/dAhcyL1 and Ahcy89E/CG8956/dAhcyL2, which act as dominant-negative
      regulators of canonical AHCY. Importantly, tissue-specific down-regulation of
      dAhcyL1/L2 in the brain and intestine extends health and life span. Furthermore, 
      metabolomic analysis of dAhcyL1-deficient flies revealed its effect on
      age-dependent metabolic reprogramming and H3K4 methylation. Altogether,
      reprogramming of methionine metabolism in young flies and suppression of
      age-dependent SAH accumulation lead to increased life span. These studies
      highlight the role of noncanonical Ahcy enzymes as determinants of healthy aging 
      and longevity.

TI  - Sgs1's roles in DNA end resection, HJ dissolution, and crossover suppression
      require a two-step SUMO regulation dependent on Smc5/6.
PG  - 1339-56
LID - 10.1101/gad.278275.116 [doi]
AB  - The RecQ helicase Sgs1 plays critical roles during DNA repair by homologous
      recombination, from end resection to Holliday junction (HJ) dissolution. Sgs1 has
      both pro- and anti-recombinogenic roles, and therefore its activity must be
      tightly regulated. However, the controls involved in recruitment and activation
      of Sgs1 at damaged sites are unknown. Here we show a two-step role for Smc5/6 in 
      recruiting and activating Sgs1 through SUMOylation. First, auto-SUMOylation of
      Smc5/6 subunits leads to recruitment of Sgs1 as part of the STR (Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1) 
      complex, mediated by two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) on Sgs1 that specifically
      recognize SUMOylated Smc5/6. Second, Smc5/6-dependent SUMOylation of Sgs1 and
      Top3 is required for the efficient function of STR. Sgs1 mutants impaired in
      recognition of SUMOylated Smc5/6 (sgs1-SIMDelta) or SUMO-dead alleles (sgs1-KR)
      exhibit unprocessed HJs at damaged replication forks, increased crossover
      frequencies during double-strand break repair, and severe impairment in DNA end
      resection. Smc5/6 is a key regulator of Sgs1's recombination functions.

TI  - S1-DRIP-seq identifies high expression and polyA tracts as major contributors to 
      R-loop formation.
PG  - 1327-38
LID - 10.1101/gad.280834.116 [doi]
AB  - R loops form when transcripts hybridize to homologous DNA on chromosomes,
      yielding a DNA:RNA hybrid and a displaced DNA single strand. R loops impact the
      genome of many organisms, regulating chromosome stability, gene expression, and
      DNA repair. Understanding the parameters dictating R-loop formation in vivo has
      been hampered by the limited quantitative and spatial resolution of current
      genomic strategies for mapping R loops. We report a novel whole-genome method,
      S1-DRIP-seq (S1 nuclease DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing), for
      mapping hybrid-prone regions in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Using this
      methodology, we identified approximately 800 hybrid-prone regions covering 8% of 
      the genome. Given the pervasive transcription of the yeast genome, this result
      suggests that R-loop formation is dictated by characteristics of the DNA, RNA,
      and/or chromatin. We successfully identified two features highly predictive of
      hybrid formation: high transcription and long homopolymeric dA:dT tracts. These
      accounted for >60% of the hybrid regions found in the genome. We demonstrated
      that these two factors play a causal role in hybrid formation by genetic
      manipulation. Thus, the hybrid map generated by S1-DRIP-seq led to the
      identification of the first global genomic features causal for R-loop formation
      in yeast.

LID - 10.1101/gad.279307.116 [doi]
AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a devastating neuroendocrine carcinoma. MYCL
      (L-Myc) is frequently amplified in human SCLC, but its roles in SCLC progression 
      are poorly understood. We isolated preneoplastic neuroendocrine cells from a
      mouse model of SCLC and found that ectopic expression of L-Myc, c-Myc, or N-Myc
      conferred tumor-forming capacity. We focused on L-Myc, which promoted pre-rRNA
      synthesis and transcriptional programs associated with ribosomal biogenesis.
      Deletion of Mycl in two genetically engineered models of SCLC resulted in strong 
      suppression of SCLC. The high degree of suppression suggested that L-Myc may
      constitute a therapeutic target for a broad subset of SCLC. We then used an RNA
      polymerase I inhibitor to target rRNA synthesis in an autochthonous
      Rb/p53-deleted mouse SCLC model and found significant tumor inhibition. These
      data reveal that activation of RNA polymerase I by L-Myc and other MYC family
      proteins provides an axis of vulnerability for this recalcitrant cancer.

AB  - Various tumors develop addiction to glutamine to support uncontrolled cell
      proliferation. Here we identify the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1
      (LRH-1) as a key regulator in the process of hepatic tumorigenesis through the
      coordination of a noncanonical glutamine pathway that is reliant on the
      mitochondrial and cytosolic transaminases glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2
      (GPT2) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), which fuel anabolic
      metabolism. In particular, we show that gain and loss of function of hepatic
      LRH-1 modulate the expression and activity of mitochondrial glutaminase 2 (GLS2),
      the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway. Acute and chronic deletion of
      hepatic LRH-1 blunts the deamination of glutamine and reduces glutamine-dependent
      anaplerosis. The robust reduction in glutaminolysis and the limiting availability
      of alpha-ketoglutarate in turn inhibit mTORC1 signaling to eventually block cell 
      growth and proliferation. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of
      LRH-1 in coordinating glutamine-induced metabolism and signaling to promote
      hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

AB  - Multiciliogenesis is essential for the function of different epithelia, and its
      failure results in brain defects, respiratory diseases, and infertility. In this 
      issue of Genes & Development, Nemajerova and colleagues (pp. 1300-1312) reveal
      the p53 family member and p73 isoform TAp73 as a transcription factor dictating
      the differentiation of multiciliated cells. Their findings provide the

TI  - The CENP-T/-W complex is a binding partner of the histone chaperone FACT.
PG  - 1313-26
LID - 10.1101/gad.275073.115 [doi]
AB  - The CENP-T/-W histone fold complex, as an integral part of the inner kinetochore,
      is essential for building a proper kinetochore at the centromere in order to
      direct chromosome segregation during mitosis. Notably, CENP-T/-W is not inherited
      at centromeres, and new deposition is absolutely required at each cell cycle for 
      kinetochore function. However, the mechanisms underlying this new deposition of
      CENP-T/-W at centromeres are unclear. Here, we found that CENP-T deposition at
      centromeres is uncoupled from DNA synthesis. We identified Spt16 and SSRP1,
      subunits of the H2A-H2B histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription
      (FACT), as CENP-W binding partners through a proteomic screen. We found that the 
      C-terminal region of Spt16 binds specifically to the histone fold region of
      CENP-T/-W. Furthermore, depletion of Spt16 impairs CENP-T and CENP-W deposition
      at endogenous centromeres, and site-directed targeting of Spt16 alone is
      sufficient to ensure local de novo CENP-T accumulation. We propose a model in
      which the FACT chaperone stabilizes the soluble CENP-T/-W complex in the cell and
      promotes dynamics of exchange, enabling CENP-T/-W deposition at centromeres.

PG  - 1261-77
LID - 10.1101/gad.280057.116 [doi]
AB  - Lineage tracing has become the method of choice to study the fate and dynamics of
      stem cells (SCs) during development, homeostasis, and regeneration. However,
      transgenic and knock-in Cre drivers used to perform lineage tracing experiments
      are often dynamically, temporally, and heterogeneously expressed, leading to the 
      initial labeling of different cell types and thereby complicating their
      interpretation. Here, we developed two methods: the first one based on
      statistical analysis of multicolor lineage tracing, allowing the definition of
      multipotency potential to be achieved with high confidence, and the second one
      based on lineage tracing at saturation to assess the fate of all SCs within a
      given lineage and the "flux" of cells between different lineages. Our analysis
      clearly shows that, whereas the prostate develops from multipotent SCs, only
      unipotent SCs mediate mammary gland (MG) development and adult tissue remodeling.
      These methods offer a rigorous framework to assess the lineage relationship and
      SC fate in different organs and tissues.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with a rearrangement of the mixed-linage leukemia 
      (MLL) gene are aggressive hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we explored the
      feasibility of using the H3K9- and H3K36-specific demethylases Jmjd2/Kdm4 as
      putative drug targets in MLL-AF9 translocated leukemia. Using Jmjd2a, Jmjd2b, and
      Jmjd2c conditional triple-knockout mice, we show that Jmjd2/Kdm4 activities are
      required for MLL-AF9 translocated AML in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that
      expression of the interleukin 3 receptor alpha (Il3ra also known as Cd123)
      subunit is dependent on Jmjd2/Kdm4 through a mechanism involving removal of
      H3K9me3 from the promoter of the Il3ra gene. Importantly, ectopic expression of
      Il3ra in Jmjd2/Kdm4 knockout cells alleviates the requirement of Jmjd2/Kdm4 for
      the survival of AML cells, showing that Il3ra is a critical downstream target of 
      Jmjd2/Kdm4 in leukemia. These results suggest that the JMJD2/KDM4 proteins are
      promising drug targets for the treatment of AML.

TI  - TAp73 is a central transcriptional regulator of airway multiciliogenesis.
PG  - 1300-12
LID - 10.1101/gad.279836.116 [doi]
AB  - Motile multiciliated cells (MCCs) have critical roles in respiratory health and
      disease and are essential for cleaning inhaled pollutants and pathogens from
      airways. Despite their significance for human disease, the transcriptional
      control that governs multiciliogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we
      identify TP73, a p53 homolog, as governing the program for airway
      multiciliogenesis. Mice with TP73 deficiency suffer from chronic respiratory
      tract infections due to profound defects in ciliogenesis and complete loss of
      mucociliary clearance. Organotypic airway cultures pinpoint TAp73 as necessary
      and sufficient for basal body docking, axonemal extension, and motility during
      the differentiation of MCC progenitors. Mechanistically, cross-species genomic
      analyses and complete ciliary rescue of knockout MCCs identify TAp73 as the
      conserved central transcriptional integrator of multiciliogenesis. TAp73 directly
      activates the key regulators FoxJ1, Rfx2, Rfx3, and miR34bc plus nearly 50
      structural and functional ciliary genes, some of which are associated with human 
      ciliopathies. Our results position TAp73 as a novel central regulator of MCC
      differentiation.

TI  - Asf1 facilitates dephosphorylation of Rad53 after DNA double-strand break repair.
PG  - 1211-24
LID - 10.1101/gad.280685.116 [doi]
AB  - To allow for sufficient time to repair DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs),
      eukaryotic cells activate the DNA damage checkpoint. In budding yeast, Rad53
      (mammalian Chk2) phosphorylation parallels the persistence of the unrepaired DSB 
      and is extinguished when repair is complete in a process termed recovery or when 
      the cells adapt to the DNA damage checkpoint. A strain containing a slowly
      repaired DSB does not require the histone chaperone Asf1 to resume cell cycle
      progression after DSB repair. When a second, rapidly repairable DSB is added to
      this strain, Asf1 becomes required for recovery. Recovery from two repairable
      DSBs also depends on the histone acetyltransferase Rtt109 and the cullin subunit 
      Rtt101, both of which modify histone H3 that is associated with Asf1. We show
      that dissociation of histone H3 from Asf1 is required for efficient recovery and 
      that Asf1 is required for complete dephosphorylation of Rad53 when the upstream
      DNA damage checkpoint signaling is turned off. Our data suggest that the
      requirements for recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint become more stringent
      with increased levels of damage and that Asf1 plays a histone
      chaperone-independent role in facilitating complete Rad53 dephosphorylation
      following repair.

LID - 10.1101/gad.280545.116 [doi]
AB  - DNA repair is essential to maintain genomic integrity and initiate genetic
      diversity. While gene conversion and classical nonhomologous end-joining are the 
      most physiologically predominant forms of DNA repair mechanisms, emerging lines
      of evidence suggest the usage of several noncanonical homology-directed repair
      (HDR) pathways in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes in different contexts. Here we 
      review how these alternative HDR pathways are executed, specifically focusing on 
      the determinants that dictate competition between them and their relevance to
      cancers that display complex genomic rearrangements or maintain their telomeres
      by homology-directed DNA synthesis.

TI  - HOX13 proteins: the molecular switcher in Hoxd bimodal regulation.
PG  - 1135-7
LID - 10.1101/gad.283598.116 [doi]
AB  - The striking correlation between the genomic arrangement of Hox genes and their
      temporal and spatial pattern of expression during embryonic development has been 
      a source of fascination since its discovery. This correspondence has been used as
      a privileged example in the investigation of the connection between genomic
      architecture and function. In this issue of Genes & Development, Beccari and
      colleagues (pp. 1172-1186) make a big step forward in understanding Hox gene
      regulation during limb development by showing the pivotal role of HOXA13 and
      HOXD13 proteins in the transition from a proximal to a distal type of Hoxd
      transcriptional regulation.

TI  - Evolution of a transcriptional regulator from a transmembrane nucleoporin.
PG  - 1155-71
LID - 10.1101/gad.280941.116 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) emerged as nuclear transport channels in eukaryotic
      cells approximately 1.5 billion years ago. While the primary role of NPCs is to
      regulate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, recent research suggests that certain NPC 
      proteins have additionally acquired the role of affecting gene expression at the 
      nuclear periphery and in the nucleoplasm in metazoans. Here we identify a widely 
      expressed variant of the transmembrane nucleoporin (Nup) Pom121 (named sPom121,
      for "soluble Pom121") that arose by genomic rearrangement before the divergence
      of hominoids. sPom121 lacks the nuclear membrane-anchoring domain and thus does
      not localize to the NPC. Instead, sPom121 colocalizes and interacts with
      nucleoplasmic Nup98, a previously identified transcriptional regulator, at gene
      promoters to control transcription of its target genes in human cells.
      Interestingly, sPom121 transcripts appear independently in several mammalian
      species, suggesting convergent innovation of Nup-mediated transcription
      regulation during mammalian evolution. Our findings implicate alternate
      transcription initiation as a mechanism to increase the functional diversity of
      NPC components.

TI  - The Enok acetyltransferase complex interacts with Elg1 and negatively regulates
      PCNA unloading to promote the G1/S transition.
PG  - 1198-210
LID - 10.1101/gad.271429.115 [doi]
AB  - KAT6 histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are
      involved in cell cycle regulation. However, information regarding their roles in 
      regulating cell cycle progression is limited. Here, we report the identification 
      of subunits of the Drosophila Enok complex and demonstrate that all subunits are 
      important for its HAT activity. We further report a novel interaction between the
      Enok complex and the Elg1 proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-unloader
      complex. Depletion of Enok in S2 cells resulted in a G1/S cell cycle block, and
      this block can be partially relieved by depleting Elg1. Furthermore, depletion of
      Enok reduced the chromatin-bound levels of PCNA in both S2 cells and early
      embryos, suggesting that the Enok complex may interact with the Elg1 complex and 
      down-regulate its PCNA-unloading function to promote the G1/S transition.
      Supporting this hypothesis, depletion of Enok also partially rescued the
      endoreplication defects in Elg1-depleted nurse cells. Taken together, our study
      provides novel insights into the roles of KAT6 HATs in cell cycle regulation
      through modulating PCNA levels on chromatin.

TI  - Histone H3K4 methylation regulates deactivation of the spindle assembly
      checkpoint through direct binding of Mad2.
PG  - 1187-97
LID - 10.1101/gad.278887.116 [doi]
AB  - Histone H3 methylation on Lys4 (H3K4me) is associated with active gene
      transcription in all eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Set1 is the sole
      lysine methyltransferase required for mono-, di-, and trimethylation of this
      site. Although H3K4me3 is linked to gene expression, whether H3K4 methylation
      regulates other cellular processes, such as mitosis, is less clear. Here we show 
      that both Set1 and H3K4 mutants display a benomyl resistance phenotype that
      requires components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), including Bub3 and 
      Mad2. These proteins inhibit Cdc20, an activator of the anaphase-promoting
      complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Mutations in Cdc20 that block Mad2 interactions
      suppress the benomyl resistance of both set1 and H3K4 mutant cells. Furthermore, 
      the HORMA domain in Mad2 directly binds H3, identifying a new histone H3 "reader"
      motif. Mad2 undergoes a conformational change important for execution of the SAC.
      We found that the closed (active) conformation of both yeast and human Mad2 is
      capable of binding methylated H3K4, but, in contrast, the open (inactive) Mad2
      conformation limits interaction with methylated H3. Collectively, our data
      indicate that interactions between Mad2 and H3K4 regulate resolution of the SAC
      by limiting closed Mad2 availability for Cdc20 inhibition.

AB  - Some mitochondrial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are encoded by nuclear DNA, but 
      the mechanisms that mediate their transport to mitochondria are poorly
      characterized. Using affinity RNA pull-down followed by mass spectrometry
      analysis, we found two RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), HuR (human antigen R) and
      GRSF1 (G-rich RNA sequence-binding factor 1), that associated with the nuclear
      DNA-encoded lncRNA RMRP and mobilized it to mitochondria. In cultured human
      cells, HuR bound RMRP in the nucleus and mediated its CRM1 (chromosome region
      maintenance 1)-dependent export to the cytosol. After RMRP was imported into
      mitochondria, GRSF1 bound RMRP and increased its abundance in the matrix. Loss of
      GRSF1 lowered the mitochondrial levels of RMRP, in turn suppressing oxygen
      consumption rates and modestly reducing mitochondrial DNA replication priming.
      Our findings indicate that RBPs HuR and GRSF1 govern the cytoplasmic and
      mitochondrial localization of the lncRNA RMRP, which is encoded by nuclear DNA
      but has key functions in mitochondria.

TI  - A role for HOX13 proteins in the regulatory switch between TADs at the HoxD
      locus.
PG  - 1172-86
LID - 10.1101/gad.281055.116 [doi]
AB  - During vertebrate limb development, Hoxd genes are regulated following a bimodal 
      strategy involving two topologically associating domains (TADs) located on either
      side of the gene cluster. These regulatory landscapes alternatively control
      different subsets of Hoxd targets, first into the arm and subsequently into the
      digits. We studied the transition between these two global regulations, a switch 
      that correlates with the positioning of the wrist, which articulates these two
      main limb segments. We show that the HOX13 proteins themselves help switch off
      the telomeric TAD, likely through a global repressive mechanism. At the same
      time, they directly interact with distal enhancers to sustain the activity of the
      centromeric TAD, thus explaining both the sequential and exclusive operating
      processes of these two regulatory domains. We propose a model in which the
      activation of Hox13 gene expression in distal limb cells both interrupts the
      proximal Hox gene regulation and re-enforces the distal regulation. In the
      absence of HOX13 proteins, a proximal limb structure grows without any sign of
      wrist articulation, likely related to an ancestral fish-like condition.

TI  - Physiological restraint of Bak by Bcl-xL is essential for cell survival.
PG  - 1240-50
LID - 10.1101/gad.279414.116 [doi]
AB  - Due to the myriad interactions between prosurvival and proapoptotic members of
      the Bcl-2 family of proteins, establishing the mechanisms that regulate the
      intrinsic apoptotic pathway has proven challenging. Mechanistic insights have
      primarily been gleaned from in vitro studies because genetic approaches in
      mammals that produce unambiguous data are difficult to design. Here we describe a
      mutation in mouse and human Bak that specifically disrupts its interaction with
      the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL Substitution of Glu75 in mBak (hBAK Q77) for
      leucine does not affect the three-dimensional structure of Bak or killing
      activity but reduces its affinity for Bcl-xL via loss of a single hydrogen bond. 
      Using this mutant, we investigated the requirement for physical restraint of Bak 
      by Bcl-xL in apoptotic regulation. In vitro, Bak(Q75L) cells were significantly
      more sensitive to various apoptotic stimuli. In vivo, loss of Bcl-xL binding to
      Bak led to significant defects in T-cell and blood platelet survival. Thus, we
      provide the first definitive in vivo evidence that prosurvival proteins maintain 
      cellular viability by interacting with and inhibiting Bak.

TI  - Molecular basis of PRC1 targeting to Polycomb response elements by PhoRC.
PG  - 1116-27
LID - 10.1101/gad.279141.116 [doi]
AB  - Polycomb group (PcG) protein complexes repress transcription by modifying target 
      gene chromatin. In Drosophila, this repression requires association of PcG
      protein complexes with cis-regulatory Polycomb response elements (PREs), but the 
      interactions permitting formation of these assemblies are poorly understood. We
      show that the Sfmbt subunit of the DNA-binding Pho-repressive complex (PhoRC) and
      the Scm subunit of the canonical Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) directly
      bind each other through their SAM domains. The 1.9 A crystal structure of the
      Scm-SAM:Sfmbt-SAM complex reveals the recognition mechanism and shows that
      Sfmbt-SAM lacks the polymerization capacity of the SAM domains of Scm and its
      PRC1 partner subunit, Ph. Functional analyses in Drosophila demonstrate that
      Sfmbt-SAM and Scm-SAM are essential for repression and that PhoRC DNA binding is 
      critical to initiate PRC1 association with PREs. Together, this suggests that
      PRE-tethered Sfmbt-SAM nucleates PRC1 recruitment and that
      Scm-SAM/Ph-SAM-mediated polymerization then results in the formation of
      PRC1-compacted chromatin.

AB  - 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) specify post-transcriptional fates of mammalian
      messenger RNAs (mRNAs), yet knowledge of the underlying sequences and mechanisms 
      is largely incomplete. Here, we identify two related novel 3' UTR motifs in
      mammals that specify transcript degradation. These motifs are interchangeable and
      active only within 3' UTRs, where they are often preferentially conserved;
      furthermore, they are found in hundreds of transcripts, many encoding regulatory 
      proteins. We found that degradation occurs via mRNA deadenylation, mediated by
      the CCR4-NOT complex. We purified trans factors that recognize the motifs and
      identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A1 and A2/B1, which 
      are required for transcript degradation, acting in a previously unknown manner.
      We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to confirm hnRNP A1 and A2/B1 motif-dependent
      roles genome-wide, profiling cells depleted of these factors singly and in
      combination. Interestingly, the motifs are most active within the distal portion 
      of 3' UTRs, suggesting that their role in gene regulation can be modulated by
      alternative processing, resulting in shorter 3' UTRs.

AB  - Motor axons approach muscles that are prepatterned in the prospective synaptic
      region. In mice, prepatterning of acetylcholine receptors requires Lrp4, a LDLR
      family member, and MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Lrp4 can bind and stimulate 
      MuSK, strongly suggesting that association between Lrp4 and MuSK, independent of 
      additional ligands, initiates prepatterning in mice. In zebrafish, Wnts, which
      bind the Frizzled (Fz)-like domain in MuSK, are required for prepatterning,
      suggesting that Wnts may contribute to prepatterning and neuromuscular
      development in mammals. We show that prepatterning in mice requires Lrp4 but not 
      the MuSK Fz-like domain. In contrast, prepatterning in zebrafish requires the
      MuSK Fz-like domain but not Lrp4. Despite these differences, neuromuscular
      synapse formation in zebrafish and mice share similar mechanisms, requiring Lrp4,
      MuSK, and neuronal Agrin but not the MuSK Fz-like domain or Wnt production from
      muscle. Our findings demonstrate that evolutionary divergent mechanisms establish
      muscle prepatterning in zebrafish and mice.

TI  - Chronic AMPK activation via loss of FLCN induces functional beige adipose tissue 
      through PGC-1alpha/ERRalpha.
PG  - 1034-46
LID - 10.1101/gad.281410.116 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) forms a repressor complex with
      AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Given that AMPK is a master regulator of
      cellular energy homeostasis, we generated an adipose-specific Flcn (Adipoq-FLCN) 
      knockout mouse model to investigate the role of FLCN in energy metabolism. We
      show that loss of FLCN results in a complete metabolic reprogramming of adipose
      tissues, resulting in enhanced oxidative metabolism. Adipoq-FLCN knockout mice
      exhibit increased energy expenditure and are protected from high-fat diet
      (HFD)-induced obesity. Importantly, FLCN ablation leads to chronic
      hyperactivation of AMPK, which in turns induces and activates two key
      transcriptional regulators of cellular metabolism, proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and estrogen-related
      receptor alpha (ERRalpha). Together, the AMPK/PGC-1alpha/ERRalpha molecular axis 
      positively modulates the expression of metabolic genes to promote mitochondrial
      biogenesis and activity. In addition, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins as well
      as other markers of brown fat are up-regulated in both white and brown FLCN-null 
      adipose tissues, underlying the increased resistance of Adipoq-FLCN knockout mice
      to cold exposure. These findings identify a key role of FLCN as a negative
      regulator of mitochondrial function and identify a novel molecular pathway
      involved in the browning of white adipocytes and the activity of brown fat.

AB  - The tumor stroma is no longer seen solely as physical support for mutated
      epithelial cells but as an important modulator and even a driver of
      tumorigenicity. Within the tumor stromal milieu, heterogeneous populations of
      fibroblast-like cells, collectively termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts
      (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stromal-dependent alterations that 
      contribute to malignant initiation and progression. This review focuses on novel 
      insights into the contributions of CAFs to disease progression, emergent events
      leading to the generation of CAFs, identification of CAF-specific biomarkers
      predictive of disease outcome, and recent therapeutic approaches aimed at
      blunting or reverting detrimental protumorigenic phenotypes associated with CAFs.

TI  - Spliceosomal gene mutations in myelodysplasia: molecular links to clonal
      abnormalities of hematopoiesis.
PG  - 989-1001
LID - 10.1101/gad.278424.116 [doi]
AB  - Genomic analyses of the myeloid malignancies and clonal disorders of
      hematopoiesis that may give rise to these disorders have identified that
      mutations in genes encoding core spliceosomal proteins and accessory regulatory
      splicing factors are among the most common targets of somatic mutations. These
      spliceosomal mutations often occur in a mutually exclusive manner with one
      another and, in aggregate, account for the most frequent class of mutations in
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in particular. Although
      substantial progress has been made in understanding the effects of several of
      these mutations on splicing and splice site recognition, functional connections
      linking the mechanistic changes in splicing induced by these mutations to the
      phenotypic consequences of clonal and aberrant hematopoiesis are not yet well
      defined. This review describes our current understanding of the mechanistic and
      biological effects of spliceosomal gene mutations in MDSs as well as the
      regulation of splicing throughout normal hematopoiesis.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations influence organismal aging by affecting various
      regulatory systems. One such system involves sensory neurons, which affect life
      span in many species. However, how sensory neurons coordinate organismal aging in
      response to changes in environmental signals remains elusive. Here, we found that
      a subset of sensory neurons shortens Caenorhabditis elegans' life span by
      differentially regulating the expression of a specific insulin-like peptide
      (ILP), INS-6. Notably, treatment with food-derived cues or optogenetic activation
      of sensory neurons significantly increases ins-6 expression and decreases life
      span. INS-6 in turn relays the longevity signals to nonneuronal tissues by
      decreasing the activity of the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Together, our
      study delineates a mechanism through which environmental sensory cues regulate
      aging rates by modulating the activities of specific sensory neurons and ILPs.

TI  - Germline loss of PKM2 promotes metabolic distress and hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1020-33
LID - 10.1101/gad.278549.116 [doi]
AB  - Alternative splicing of the Pkm gene product generates the PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms
      of pyruvate kinase (PK), and PKM2 expression is closely linked to embryogenesis, 
      tissue regeneration, and cancer. To interrogate the functional requirement for
      PKM2 during development and tissue homeostasis, we generated germline PKM2-null
      mice (Pkm2(-/-)). Unexpectedly, despite being the primary isoform expressed in
      most wild-type adult tissues, we found that Pkm2(-/-) mice are viable and
      fertile. Thus, PKM2 is not required for embryonic or postnatal development. Loss 
      of PKM2 leads to compensatory expression of PKM1 in the tissues that normally
      express PKM2. Strikingly, PKM2 loss leads to spontaneous development of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with high penetrance that is accompanied by
      progressive changes in systemic metabolism characterized by altered systemic
      glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis. Therefore, in addition 
      to its role in cancer metabolism, PKM2 plays a role in controlling systemic
      metabolic homeostasis and inflammation, thereby preventing HCC by a
      non-cell-autonomous mechanism.

TI  - The pluripotency factor Nanog regulates pericentromeric heterochromatin
      organization in mouse embryonic stem cells.
PG  - 1101-15
LID - 10.1101/gad.275685.115 [doi]
AB  - An open and decondensed chromatin organization is a defining property of
      pluripotency. Several epigenetic regulators have been implicated in maintaining
      an open chromatin organization, but how these processes are connected to the
      pluripotency network is unknown. Here, we identified a new role for the
      transcription factor NANOG as a key regulator connecting the pluripotency network
      with constitutive heterochromatin organization in mouse embryonic stem cells.
      Deletion of Nanog leads to chromatin compaction and the remodeling of
      heterochromatin domains. Forced expression of NANOG in epiblast stem cells is
      sufficient to decompact chromatin. NANOG associates with satellite repeats within
      heterochromatin domains, contributing to an architecture characterized by highly 
      dispersed chromatin fibers, low levels of H3K9me3, and high major satellite
      transcription, and the strong transactivation domain of NANOG is required for
      this organization. The heterochromatin-associated protein SALL1 is a direct
      cofactor for NANOG, and loss of Sall1 recapitulates the Nanog-null phenotype, but
      the loss of Sall1 can be circumvented through direct recruitment of the NANOG
      transactivation domain to major satellites. These results establish a direct
      connection between the pluripotency network and chromatin organization and
      emphasize that maintaining an open heterochromatin architecture is a highly
      regulated process in embryonic stem cells.

TI  - Mst1 shuts off cytosolic antiviral defense through IRF3 phosphorylation.
PG  - 1086-100
LID - 10.1101/gad.277533.116 [doi]
AB  - Cytosolic RNA/DNA sensing elicits primary defense against viral pathogens.
      Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key signal mediator/transcriptional
      factor of the antiviral-sensing pathway, is indispensible for interferon
      production and antiviral defense. However, how the status of IRF3 activation is
      controlled remains elusive. Through a functional screen of the human kinome, we
      found that mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), but not Mst2, profoundly
      inhibited cytosolic nucleic acid sensing. Mst1 associated with IRF3 and directly 
      phosphorylated IRF3 at Thr75 and Thr253. This Mst1-mediated phosphorylation
      abolished activated IRF3 homodimerization, its occupancy on chromatin, and
      subsequent IRF3-mediated transcriptional responses. In addition, Mst1 also
      impeded virus-induced activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), further
      attenuating IRF3 activation. As a result, Mst1 depletion or ablation enabled an
      enhanced antiviral response and defense in cells and mice. Therefore, the
      identification of Mst1 as a novel physiological negative regulator of IRF3
      activation provides mechanistic insights into innate antiviral defense and
      potential antiviral prevention strategies.

AB  - Dynamic regulation of RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation of histone H2A Lys13,15
      (H2AK13,15ub) at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for preventing
      aberrant DNA repair and maintaining genome stability. However, it remains unclear
      which deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) removes H2AK13,15ub. Here we show that USP51,
      a previously uncharacterized DUB, deubiquitylates H2AK13,15ub and regulates DNA
      damage response. USP51 depletion results in increased spontaneous DNA damage foci
      and elevated levels of H2AK15ub and impairs DNA damage response. USP51
      overexpression suppresses the formation of ionizing radiation-induced 53BP1 and
      BRCA1 but not RNF168 foci, suggesting that USP51 functions downstream from RNF168
      in DNA damage response. In vitro, USP51 binds to H2A-H2B directly and
      deubiquitylates H2AK13,15ub. In cells, USP51 is recruited to chromatin after DNA 
      damage and regulates the dynamic assembly/disassembly of 53BP1 and BRCA1 foci.
      These results show that USP51 is the DUB for H2AK13,15ub and regulates DNA damage
      response.

AB  - Primary tumors are known to constantly shed a large number of cancer cells into
      systemic dissemination, yet only a tiny fraction of these cells is capable of
      forming overt metastases. The tremendous rate of attrition during the process of 
      metastasis implicates the existence of a rare and unique population of
      metastasis-initiating cells (MICs). MICs possess advantageous traits that may
      originate in the primary tumor but continue to evolve during dissemination and
      colonization, including cellular plasticity, metabolic reprogramming, the ability
      to enter and exit dormancy, resistance to apoptosis, immune evasion, and
      co-option of other tumor and stromal cells. Better understanding of the molecular
      and cellular hallmarks of MICs will facilitate the development and deployment of 
      novel therapeutic strategies.

TI  - CTCF: making the right connections.
PG  - 881-91
LID - 10.1101/gad.277863.116 [doi]
AB  - The role of the zinc finger protein CTCF in organizing the genome within the
      nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both 
      CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop
      domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also
      mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different
      domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the
      questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting
      them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears
      that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions
      have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the
      existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that
      invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes
      in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What 
      remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for re-establishing
      loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis. As recently
      published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with noncoding RNAs
      as well as protein cofactors. Many CTCF sites are also involved in other
      functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of gene
      expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop formation is
      another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied for some
      time.

AB  - The minimum requirement for mitochondrial apoptosis has been controversial ever
      since the discovery of BCL-2 as a cell death regulator. In this issue
      ofGenes&Development, O'Neill and colleagues (pp. 973-988) end a long-standing
      debate by creating a cellular system free of BCL-2 family proteins, thereby
      identifying the outer mitochondrial membrane rather than BH3-only proteins as the
      only requirement for BAX/BAK activation and mitochondrial outer membrane
      permeabilization (MOMP).

PG  - 876-7
LID - 10.1101/gad.281733.116 [doi]
AB  - Somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 occur in more than half of all
      human cancers. Rare germline mutations result in the Li-Fraumeni cancer family
      syndrome. In this issue ofGenes&Development, Jennis and colleagues (pp. 918-930) 
      use an elegant mouse model to examine the affect of a polymorphism, P47S
      (rs1800371), in the N terminus of p53 that is found in Africans as well as more
      than a million African Americans. Remarkably, the single nucleotide change causes
      the mice to be substantially tumor-prone compared with littermates, suggesting
      that this allele causes an increased risk of developing cancer. The defect in p53
      function is traced to a restriction in downstream gene regulation that reduces
      cell death in response to stress.

LID - 10.1101/gad.278432.116 [doi]
AB  - The recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 proteins initiate V(D)J
      recombination, the process that assembles the B- and T-lymphocyte antigen
      receptor genes of jawed vertebrates. RAG1 and RAG2 are thought to have arisen
      from a transposable element, but the origins of this element are not understood. 
      We show that two ancestral RAG1 proteins, Transib transposase and purple sea
      urchin RAG1-like, have a latent ability to initiate V(D)J recombination when
      coexpressed with RAG2 and that in vitro transposition by Transib transposase is
      stimulated by RAG2. Conversely, we report low levels of V(D)J recombination by
      RAG1 in the absence of RAG2. Recombination by RAG1 alone differs from canonical
      V(D)J recombination in having lost the requirement for asymmetric DNA substrates,
      implicating RAG2 in the origins of the "12/23 rule," a fundamental regulatory
      feature of the reaction. We propose that evolution of RAG1/RAG2 began with a
      Transib transposon whose intrinsic recombination activity was enhanced by capture
      of an ancestral RAG2, allowing for the development of adaptive immunity.

TI  - Inactivation of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins activates Bax/Bak through the outer
      mitochondrial membrane.
PG  - 973-88
LID - 10.1101/gad.276725.115 [doi]
AB  - The mechanism of Bax/Bak activation remains a central question in
      mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling. While it is established that all
      proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins bind and neutralize the
      anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, how this neutralization leads to Bax/Bak
      activation has been actively debated. Here, genome editing was used to generate
      cells deficient for all eight proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (OctaKO) and those
      that lack the entire Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2 allKO). Although the OctaKO cells were
      resistant to most apoptotic stimuli tested, they underwent Bax/Bak-dependent and 
      p53/Rb-independent apoptosis efficiently when both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, two
      anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, were inactivated or eliminated. Strikingly, when
      expressed in the Bcl-2 allKO cells, both Bax and Bak spontaneously associated
      with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) through their respective helix 9, and
      this association triggered their homo-oligomerization/activation. Together, these
      results strongly suggest that the OMM, not BH3-only proteins or p53/Rb, is the
      long-sought-after direct activator of Bax/Bak following BH3-only-mediated
      neutralization of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.

      pores through the Slx5/Slx8 STUbL.
PG  - 931-45
LID - 10.1101/gad.277665.116 [doi]
AB  - High-resolution imaging shows that persistent DNA damage in budding yeast
      localizes in distinct perinuclear foci for repair. The signals that trigger DNA
      double-strand break (DSB) relocation or determine their destination are unknown. 
      We show here that DSB relocation to the nuclear envelope depends on SUMOylation
      mediated by the E3 ligases Siz2 and Mms21. In G1, a polySUMOylation signal
      deposited coordinately by Mms21 and Siz2 recruits the SUMO targeted ubiquitin
      ligase Slx5/Slx8 to persistent breaks. Both Slx5 and Slx8 are necessary for
      damage relocation to nuclear pores. When targeted to an undamaged locus, however,
      Slx5 alone can mediate relocation in G1-phase cells, bypassing the requirement
      for polySUMOylation. In contrast, in S-phase cells, monoSUMOylation mediated by
      the Rtt107-stabilized SMC5/6-Mms21 E3 complex drives DSBs to the SUN domain
      protein Mps3 in a manner independent of Slx5. Slx5/Slx8 and binding to pores
      favor repair by ectopic break-induced replication and imprecise end-joining.

TI  - Proteolysis of HCF-1 by Ser/Thr glycosylation-incompetent O-GlcNAc
      transferase:UDP-GlcNAc complexes.
PG  - 960-72
LID - 10.1101/gad.275925.115 [doi]
AB  - In complex with the cosubstrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
      (UDP-GlcNAc),O-linked-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes Ser/ThrO-GlcNAcylation
      of many cellular proteins and proteolysis of the transcriptional coregulator
      HCF-1. Such a dual glycosyltransferase-protease activity, which occurs in the
      same active site, is unprecedented and integrates both reversible and
      irreversible forms of protein post-translational modification within one enzyme. 
      Although occurring within the same active site, we show here that glycosylation
      and proteolysis occur through separable mechanisms. OGT consists of
      tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and catalytic domains, which, together with
      UDP-GlcNAc, are required for both glycosylation and proteolysis. Nevertheless, a 
      specific TPR domain contact with the HCF-1 substrate is critical for proteolysis 
      but not Ser/Thr glycosylation. In contrast, key catalytic domain residues and
      even a UDP-GlcNAc oxygen important for Ser/Thr glycosylation are irrelevant for
      proteolysis. Thus, from a dual glycosyltransferase-protease, essentially
      single-activity enzymes can be engineered both in vitro and in vivo. Curiously,
      whereas OGT-mediated HCF-1 proteolysis is limited to vertebrate species,
      invertebrate OGTs can cleave human HCF-1. We present a model for the evolution of
      HCF-1 proteolysis by OGT.

TI  - An African-specific polymorphism in the TP53 gene impairs p53 tumor suppressor
      function in a mouse model.

AB  - A nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism at codon 47 in TP53 exists in
      African-descent populations (P47S, rs1800371; referred to here as S47). Here we
      report that, in human cell lines and a mouse model, the S47 variant exhibits a
      modest decrease in apoptosis in response to most genotoxic stresses compared with
      wild-type p53 but exhibits a significant defect in cell death induced by
      cisplatin. We show that, compared with wild-type p53, S47 has nearly
      indistinguishable transcriptional function but shows impaired ability to
      transactivate a subset of p53 target genes, including two involved in
      metabolism:Gls2(glutaminase 2) and Sco2 We also show that human and mouse cells
      expressing the S47 variant are markedly resistant to cell death by agents that
      induce ferroptosis (iron-mediated nonapoptotic cell death). We show that mice
      expressing S47 in homozygous or heterozygous form are susceptible to spontaneous 
      cancers of diverse histological types. Our data suggest that the S47 variant may 
      contribute to increased cancer risk in individuals of African descent, and our
      findings highlight the need to assess the contribution of this variant to cancer 
      risk in these populations. These data also confirm the potential relevance of
      metabolism and ferroptosis to tumor suppression by p53.

TI  - Splicing-independent loading of TREX on nascent RNA is required for efficient
      expression of dual-strand piRNA clusters in Drosophila.
PG  - 840-55
LID - 10.1101/gad.276030.115 [doi]
AB  - The conserved THO/TREX (transcription/export) complex is critical for pre-mRNA
      processing and mRNA nuclear export. In metazoa, TREX is loaded on nascent RNA
      transcribed by RNA polymerase II in a splicing-dependent fashion; however, how
      TREX functions is poorly understood. Here we show that Thoc5 and other TREX
      components are essential for the biogenesis of piRNA, a distinct class of small
      noncoding RNAs that control expression of transposable elements (TEs) in the
      Drosophila germline. Mutations in TREX lead to defects in piRNA biogenesis,
      resulting in derepression of multiple TE families, gametogenesis defects, and
      sterility. TREX components are enriched on piRNA precursors transcribed from
      dual-strand piRNA clusters and colocalize in distinct nuclear foci that overlap
      with sites of piRNA transcription. The localization of TREX in nuclear foci and
      its loading on piRNA precursor transcripts depend on Cutoff, a protein associated
      with chromatin of piRNA clusters. Finally, we show that TREX is required for
      accumulation of nascent piRNA precursors. Our study reveals a novel
      splicing-independent mechanism for TREX loading on nascent RNA and its importance
      in piRNA biogenesis.

TI  - Genetic insights into the mechanisms of Fgf signaling.
PG  - 751-71
LID - 10.1101/gad.277137.115 [doi]
AB  - The fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) family of ligands and receptor tyrosine
      kinases is required throughout embryonic and postnatal development and also
      regulates multiple homeostatic functions in the adult. Aberrant Fgf signaling
      causes many congenital disorders and underlies multiple forms of cancer.
      Understanding the mechanisms that govern Fgf signaling is therefore important to 
      appreciate many aspects of Fgf biology and disease. Here we review the mechanisms
      of Fgf signaling by focusing on genetic strategies that enable in vivo analysis. 
      These studies support an important role for Erk1/2 as a mediator of Fgf signaling
      in many biological processes but have also provided strong evidence for
      additional signaling pathways in transmitting Fgf signaling in vivo.

TI  - Role of TET enzymes in DNA methylation, development, and cancer.
PG  - 733-50
LID - 10.1101/gad.276568.115 [doi]
AB  - The pattern of DNA methylation at cytosine bases in the genome is tightly linked 
      to gene expression, and DNA methylation abnormalities are often observed in
      diseases. The ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosines
      (5mCs) and promote locus-specific reversal of DNA methylation. TET genes, and
      especially TET2, are frequently mutated in various cancers, but how the TET
      proteins contribute to prevent the onset and maintenance of these malignancies is
      largely unknown. Here, we highlight recent advances in understanding the
      physiological function of the TET proteins and their role in regulating DNA
      methylation and transcription. In addition, we discuss some of the key
      outstanding questions in the field.

TI  - A POT1 mutation implicates defective telomere end fill-in and telomere
      truncations in Coats plus.
PG  - 812-26
LID - 10.1101/gad.276873.115 [doi]
AB  - Coats plus (CP) can be caused by mutations in the CTC1 component of CST, which
      promotes polymerase alpha (polalpha)/primase-dependent fill-in throughout the
      genome and at telomeres. The cellular pathology relating to CP has not been
      established. We identified a homozygous POT1 S322L substitution (POT1(CP)) in two
      siblings with CP. POT1(CP)induced a proliferative arrest that could be bypassed
      by telomerase. POT1(CP)was expressed at normal levels, bound TPP1 and telomeres, 
      and blocked ATR signaling. POT1(CP)was defective in regulating telomerase,
      leading to telomere elongation rather than the telomere shortening observed in
      other telomeropathies. POT1(CP)was also defective in the maintenance of the
      telomeric C strand, causing extended 3' overhangs and stochastic telomere
      truncations that could be healed by telomerase. Consistent with shortening of the
      telomeric C strand, metaphase chromosomes showed loss of telomeres synthesized by
      leading strand DNA synthesis. We propose that CP is caused by a defect in
      POT1/CST-dependent telomere fill-in. We further propose that deficiency in the
      fill-in step generates truncated telomeres that halt proliferation in cells
      lacking telomerase, whereas, in tissues expressing telomerase (e.g., bone
      marrow), the truncations are healed. The proposed etiology can explain why CP
      presents with features distinct from those associated with telomerase defects
      (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita).

TI  - The LATS2 tumor suppressor inhibits SREBP and suppresses hepatic cholesterol
      accumulation.
PG  - 786-97
LID - 10.1101/gad.274167.115 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway is a major regulator of organ size. In the liver,
      Hippo pathway deregulation promotes hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma
      primarily through hyperactivation of its downstream effector, YAP. The LATS2
      tumor suppressor is a core member of the Hippo pathway. A screen for
      LATS2-interacting proteins in liver-derived cells identified the transcription
      factor SREBP2, master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. LATS2 down-regulation
      caused SREBP activation and accumulation of excessive cholesterol. Likewise, mice
      harboring liver-specific Lats2 conditional knockout (Lats2-CKO) displayed
      constitutive SREBP activation and overexpressed SREBP target genes and developed 
      spontaneous fatty liver disease. Interestingly, the impact of LATS2 depletion on 
      SREBP-mediated transcription was clearly distinct from that of YAP
      overexpression. When challenged with excess dietary cholesterol, Lats2-CKO mice
      manifested more severe liver damage than wild-type mice. Surprisingly, apoptosis,
      inflammation, and fibrosis were actually attenuated relative to wild-type mice,
      in association with impaired p53 activation. Subsequently, Lats2-CKO mice failed 
      to recover effectively from cholesterol-induced damage upon return to a normal
      diet. Additionally, decreased LATS2 mRNA in association with increased SREBP
      target gene expression was observed in a subset of human nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease cases. Together, these findings further highlight the tight links between
      tumor suppressors and metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Cell-cell adhesion protein alphaE-catenin inhibits skin squamous cell carcinoma
      (SCC) development; however, the mechanisms responsible for this function are not 
      completely understood. We report here that alphaE-catenin inhibits beta4
      integrin-mediated activation of SRC tyrosine kinase.SRCis the first discovered
      oncogene, but the protein substrate critical for SRC-mediated transformation has 
      not been identified. We found that YAP1, the pivotal effector of the Hippo
      signaling pathway, is a direct SRC phosphorylation target, and YAP1
      phosphorylation at three sites in its transcription activation domain is
      necessary for SRC-YAP1-mediated transformation. We uncovered a marked increase in
      this YAP1 phosphorylation in human and mouse SCC tumors with low/negative
      expression of alphaE-catenin. We demonstrate that the tumor suppressor function
      of alphaE-catenin involves negative regulation of the beta4 integrin-SRC
      signaling pathway and that SRC-mediated phosphorylation and activation of YAP1
      are an alternative to the canonical Hippo signaling pathway that directly connect
      oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling with YAP1.

TI  - Distinct roles of autophagy-dependent and -independent functions of FIP200
      revealed by generation and analysis of a mutant knock-in mouse model.
PG  - 856-69
LID - 10.1101/gad.276428.115 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process controlled through a
      set of essential autophagy genes (Atgs). However, there is increasing evidence
      that most, if not all, Atgs also possess functions independent of their
      requirement in canonical autophagy, making it difficult to distinguish the
      contributions of autophagy-dependent or -independent functions of a particular
      Atg to various biological processes. To distinguish these functions for FIP200
      (FAK family-interacting protein of 200 kDa), an Atg in autophagy induction, we
      examined FIP200 interaction with its autophagy partner, Atg13. We found that
      residues 582-585 (LQFL) in FIP200 are required for interaction with Atg13, and
      mutation of these residues to AAAA (designated the FIP200-4A mutant) abolished
      its canonical autophagy function in vitro. Furthermore, we created a FIP200-4A
      mutant knock-in mouse model and found that specifically blocking FIP200
      interaction with Atg13 abolishes autophagy in vivo, providing direct support for 
      the essential role of the ULK1/Atg13/FIP200/Atg101 complex in the process beyond 
      previous studies relying on the complete knockout of individual components.
      Analysis of the new mouse model showed that nonautophagic functions of FIP200 are
      sufficient to fully support embryogenesis by maintaining a protective role in
      TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. However, FIP200-mediated canonical autophagy is
      required to support neonatal survival and tumor cell growth. These studies
      provide the first genetic evidence linking an Atg's autophagy and nonautophagic
      functions to different biological processes in vivo.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal form of cancer with few
      therapeutic options. We found that levels of the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2
      (SET and MYND domain 2) are elevated in PDAC and that genetic and pharmacological
      inhibition of SMYD2 restricts PDAC growth. We further identified the stress
      response kinase MAPKAPK3 (MK3) as a new physiologic substrate of SMYD2 in PDAC
      cells. Inhibition of MAPKAPK3 impedes PDAC growth, identifying a potential new
      kinase target in PDAC. Finally, we show that inhibition of SMYD2 cooperates with 
      standard chemotherapy to treat PDAC cells and tumors. These findings uncover a
      pivotal role for SMYD2 in promoting pancreatic cancer.

TI  - The proper connection between shelterin components is required for telomeric
      heterochromatin assembly.
PG  - 827-39
LID - 10.1101/gad.266718.115 [doi]
AB  - Telomeric regions contain prominent sites of heterochromatin, which is associated
      with unique histone modification profiles such as the methylation of histone H3
      at Lys9 (H3K9me). In fission yeast, the conserved telomeric shelterin complex
      recruits the histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC to establish
      subtelomeric heterochromatin. Although many shelterin mutations affect
      subtelomeric heterochromatin assembly, the mechanism remains elusive due to the
      diverse functions of shelterin. Through affinity purification, we found that
      shelterin directly associates with CLRC through the Ccq1 subunit. Surprisingly,
      mutations that disrupt interactions between shelterin subunits compromise
      subtelomeric heterochromatin without affecting CLRC interaction with shelterin
      component Pot1, located at chromosome ends. We further discovered that telomeric 
      repeats are refractory to heterochromatin spreading and that artificial
      restoration of shelterin connections or increased heterochromatin spreading
      rescued heterochromatin defects in these shelterin mutants. Thus, subtelomeric
      heterochromatin assembly requires both the recruitment of CLRC by shelterin to
      chromosome ends and the proper connection of shelterin components, which allows
      CLRC to skip telomeric repeats to internal regions.

TI  - Stepwise and dynamic assembly of the earliest precursors of small ribosomal
      subunits in yeast.
PG  - 718-32
LID - 10.1101/gad.274688.115 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is associated cotranscriptionally with
      numerous factors into an enormous 90S preribosomal particle that conducts early
      processing of small ribosomal subunits. The assembly pathway and structure of the
      90S particle is poorly understood. Here, we affinity-purified and analyzed the
      constituents of yeast 90S particles that were assembled on a series of
      plasmid-encoded 3'-truncated pre-18S RNAs. We determined the assembly point of 65
      proteins and the U3, U14, and snR30 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), revealing a
      stepwise and dynamic assembly map. The 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) alone
      can nucleate a large complex. When the 18S rRNA is nearly complete, the 90S
      structure undergoes a dramatic reorganization, releasing U14, snR30, and 14
      protein factors that bind earlier. We also identified a reference state of 90S
      that is fully assembled yet has not undergone 5'ETS processing. The assembly map 
      present here provides a new framework to understand small subunit biogenesis.

TI  - Fan1 deficiency results in DNA interstrand cross-link repair defects, enhanced
      tissue karyomegaly, and organ dysfunction.
PG  - 645-59
LID - 10.1101/gad.276261.115 [doi]
AB  - Deficiency of FANCD2/FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) in humans leads to
      karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), a rare hereditary kidney disease
      characterized by chronic renal fibrosis, tubular degeneration, and characteristic
      polyploid nuclei in multiple tissues. The mechanism of how FAN1 protects cells is
      largely unknown but is thought to involve FAN1's function in DNA interstrand
      cross-link (ICL) repair. Here, we describe a Fan1-deficient mouse and show that
      FAN1 is required for cellular and organismal resistance to ICLs. We show that the
      ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain of FAN1, which is needed for
      interaction with FANCD2, is not required for the initial rapid recruitment of
      FAN1 to ICLs or for its role in DNA ICL resistance. Epistasis analyses reveal
      that FAN1 has cross-link repair activities that are independent of the Fanconi
      anemia proteins and that this activity is redundant with the 5'-3' exonuclease
      SNM1A. Karyomegaly becomes prominent in kidneys and livers of Fan1-deficient mice
      with age, and mice develop liver dysfunction. Treatment of Fan1-deficient mice
      with ICL-inducing agents results in pronounced thymic and bone marrow
      hypocellularity and the disappearance of c-kit(+) cells. Our results provide
      insight into the mechanism of FAN1 in ICL repair and demonstrate that the Fan1
      mouse model effectively recapitulates the pathological features of human FAN1
      deficiency.

LID - 10.1101/gad.276287.115 [doi]
AB  - The Fan1 endonuclease is required for repair of DNA interstrand cross-links
      (ICLs). Mutations in human Fan1 cause karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), 
      but it is unclear whether defective ICL repair is responsible or whether Fan1
      nuclease activity is relevant. We show that Fan1 nuclease-defective (Fan1(nd/nd))
      mice develop a mild form of KIN. The karyomegalic nuclei from Fan1(nd/nd) kidneys
      are polyploid, and fibroblasts from Fan1(nd/nd) mice become polyploid upon ICL
      induction, suggesting that defective ICL repair causes karyomegaly. Thus, Fan1
      nuclease activity promotes ICL repair in a manner that controls ploidy, a role
      that we show is not shared by the Fanconi anemia pathway or the Slx4-Slx1
      nuclease also involved in ICL repair.

AB  - Control of protein abundance by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for 
      normal brain development and function. Just over a decade ago, the first
      post-mitotic function of the anaphase-promoting complex, a major cell
      cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase, was discovered in the control of axon growth
      and patterning in the mammalian brain. Since then, a large number of studies have
      identified additional novel roles for the anaphase-promoting complex in diverse
      aspects of neuronal connectivity and plasticity in the developing and mature
      nervous system. In this review, we discuss the functions and mechanisms of the
      anaphase-promoting complex in neurogenesis, glial differentiation and migration, 
      neuronal survival and metabolism, neuronal morphogenesis, synapse formation and
      plasticity, and learning and memory. We also provide a perspective on future
      investigations of the anaphase-promoting complex in neurobiology.

TI  - Building up the nucleus: nuclear organization in the establishment of totipotency
      and pluripotency during mammalian development.
PG  - 611-21
LID - 10.1101/gad.273805.115 [doi]
AB  - In mammals, epigenetic reprogramming, the acquisition and loss of totipotency,
      and the first cell fate decision all occur within a 3-d window after
      fertilization from the one-cell zygote to the formation of the blastocyst. These 
      processes are poorly understood in molecular detail, yet this is an essential
      prerequisite to uncover principles of stem cells, chromatin biology, and thus
      regenerative medicine. A unique feature of preimplantation development is the
      drastic genome-wide changes occurring to nuclear architecture. From studying
      somatic and in vitro cultured embryonic stem cells (ESCs) it is becoming
      increasingly established that the three-dimensional (3D) positions of genomic
      loci relative to each other and to specific compartments of the nucleus can act
      on the regulation of gene expression, potentially driving cell fate. However, the
      functionality, mechanisms, and molecular characteristics of the changes in
      nuclear organization during preimplantation development are only now beginning to
      be unraveled. Here, we discuss the peculiarities of nuclear compartments and
      chromatin organization during mammalian preimplantation development in the
      context of the transition from totipotency to pluripotency.

TI  - Mte1 interacts with Mph1 and promotes crossover recombination and telomere
      maintenance.
PG  - 700-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.276204.115 [doi]
AB  - Mph1 is a member of the conserved FANCM family of DNA motor proteins that play
      key roles in genome maintenance processes underlying Fanconi anemia, a cancer
      predisposition syndrome in humans. Here, we identify Mte1 as a novel interactor
      of the Mph1 helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro, Mte1 (Mph1-associated
      telomere maintenance protein 1) binds directly to DNA with a preference for
      branched molecules such as D loops and fork structures. In addition, Mte1
      stimulates the helicase and fork regression activities of Mph1 while inhibiting
      the ability of Mph1 to dissociate recombination intermediates. Deletion of MTE1
      reduces crossover recombination and suppresses the sensitivity of mph1Delta
      mutant cells to replication stress. Mph1 and Mte1 interdependently colocalize at 
      DNA damage-induced foci and dysfunctional telomeres, and MTE1 deletion results in
      elongated telomeres. Taken together, our data indicate that Mte1 plays a role in 
      regulation of crossover recombination, response to replication stress, and
      telomere maintenance.

LID - 10.1101/gad.274183.115 [doi]
AB  - Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) plays essential roles in chromatin
      remodeling during DNA transcription, replication, and repair. Our structural and 
      biochemical studies of human FACT-histone interactions present precise views of
      nucleosome reorganization, conducted by the FACT-SPT16 (suppressor of Ty 16) Mid 
      domain and its adjacent acidic AID segment. AID accesses the H2B N-terminal basic
      region exposed by partial unwrapping of the nucleosomal DNA, thereby triggering
      the invasion of FACT into the nucleosome. The crystal structure of the Mid domain
      complexed with an H3-H4 tetramer exhibits two separate contact sites; the Mid
      domain forms a novel intermolecular beta structure with H4. At the other site,
      the Mid-H2A steric collision on the H2A-docking surface of the H3-H4 tetramer
      within the nucleosome induces H2A-H2B displacement. This integrated mechanism
      results in disrupting the H3 alphaN helix, which is essential for retaining the
      nucleosomal DNA ends, and hence facilitates DNA stripping from histone.

AB  - We identified Mte1 (Mph1-associated telomere maintenance protein 1) as a

      family of DNA motor proteins important for DNA replication fork repair and

      interacts with Mph1 and DNA species that resemble a DNA replication fork and the 
      D loop formed during recombination. Biochemically, Mte1 stimulates Mph1-mediated 
      DNA replication fork regression and branch migration in a model substrate.
      Consistent with this activity, genetic analysis reveals that Mte1 functions with 
      Mph1 and the associated MHF complex in replication fork repair. Surprisingly,
      Mte1 antagonizes the D-loop-dissociative activity of Mph1-MHF and exerts a
      procrossover role in mitotic recombination. We further show that the influence of
      Mte1 on Mph1 activities requires its binding to Mph1 and DNA. Thus, Mte1
      differentially regulates Mph1 activities to achieve distinct outcomes in
      recombination and replication fork repair.

AB  - Nucleosome repositioning at gene promoters is a fundamental aspect of the
      regulation of gene expression. However, the extent to which nucleosome
      repositioning is used within eukaryotic genomes is poorly understood. Here we
      report a comprehensive analysis of nucleosome positions as budding yeast transit 
      through an ultradian cycle in which expression of >50% of all genes is highly
      synchronized. We present evidence of extensive nucleosome repositioning at
      thousands of gene promoters as genes are activated and repressed. During
      activation, nucleosomes are relocated to allow sites of general transcription
      factor binding and transcription initiation to become accessible. The extent of
      nucleosome shifting is closely related to the dynamic range of gene transcription
      and generally related to DNA sequence properties and use of the coactivators
      TFIID or SAGA. However, dynamic gene expression is not limited to SAGA-regulated 
      promoters and is an inherent feature of most genes. While nucleosome
      repositioning occurs pervasively, we found that a class of genes required for
      growth experience acute nucleosome shifting as cells enter the cell cycle.
      Significantly, our data identify that the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling
      enzyme Snf2 plays a fundamental role in nucleosome repositioning and the
      expression of growth genes. We also reveal that nucleosome organization changes
      extensively in concert with phases of the cell cycle, with large, regularly
      spaced nucleosome arrays being established in mitosis. Collectively, our data and
      analysis provide a framework for understanding nucleosome dynamics in relation to
      fundamental DNA-dependent transactions.

AB  - In a previous analysis of 2300 mRNAs via whole-mount fluorescent in situ
      hybridization in cellularizing Drosophila embryos, we found that 70% of the
      transcripts exhibited some form of subcellular localization. To see whether this 
      prevalence is unique to early Drosophila embryos, we examined approximately 8000 
      transcripts over the full course of embryogenesis and approximately 800
      transcripts in late third instar larval tissues. The numbers and varieties of new
      subcellular localization patterns are both striking and revealing. In the much
      larger cells of the third instar larva, virtually all transcripts observed showed
      subcellular localization in at least one tissue. We also examined the prevalence 
      and variety of localization mechanisms for >100 long noncoding RNAs. All of these
      were also found to be expressed and subcellularly localized. Thus, subcellular
      RNA localization appears to be the norm rather than the exception for both coding
      and noncoding RNAs. These results, which have been annotated and made available
      on a recompiled database, provide a rich and unique resource for functional gene 
      analyses, some examples of which are provided.

TI  - Visualizing allele-specific expression in single cells reveals epigenetic
      mosaicism in an H19 loss-of-imprinting mutant.
PG  - 567-78
LID - 10.1101/gad.275958.115 [doi]
AB  - Imprinting is a classic mammalian epigenetic phenomenon that results in
      expression from a single parental allele. Imprinting defects can lead to
      inappropriate expression from the normally silenced allele, but it remains
      unclear whether every cell in a mutant organism follows the population average,
      which would have profound implications for human imprinting disorders. Here, we
      apply a new fluorescence in situ hybridization method that measures
      allele-specific expression in single cells to address this question in mutants
      exhibiting aberrant H19/Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) imprinting. We show
      that mutant primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts are comprised of two
      subpopulations: one expressing both H19 alleles and another expressing only the
      maternal copy. Only in the latter cell population is Igf2 expression detected.
      Furthermore, the two subpopulations are stable in that cells do not interconvert 
      between the two expression patterns. Combined small input methylation analysis
      and transcriptional imaging revealed that these two mutant subpopulations exhibit
      distinct methylation patterns at their imprinting control regions. Consistently, 
      pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation reduced the proportion of
      monoallelic cells. Importantly, we observed that the same two subpopulations are 
      also present in vivo within murine cardiac tissue. Our results establish that
      imprinting disorders can display striking single-cell heterogeneity in their
      molecular phenotypes and suggest that such heterogeneity may underlie epigenetic 
      mosaicism in human imprinting disorders.

TI  - SR proteins are NXF1 adaptors that link alternative RNA processing to mRNA
      export.
PG  - 553-66
LID - 10.1101/gad.276477.115 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear export factor 1 (NXF1) exports mRNA to the cytoplasm after recruitment to
      mRNA by specific adaptor proteins. How and why cells use numerous different
      export adaptors is poorly understood. Here we critically evaluate members of the 
      SR protein family (SRSF1-7) for their potential to act as NXF1 adaptors that
      couple pre-mRNA processing to mRNA export. Consistent with this proposal, >1000
      endogenous mRNAs required individual SR proteins for nuclear export in vivo. To
      address the mechanism, transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of NXF1 and
      SRSF1-7 were determined in parallel by individual-nucleotide-resolution UV
      cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). Quantitative comparisons of
      RNA-binding sites showed that NXF1 and SR proteins bind mRNA targets at adjacent 
      sites, indicative of cobinding. SRSF3 emerged as the most potent NXF1 adaptor,
      conferring sequence specificity to RNA binding by NXF1 in last exons.
      Interestingly, SRSF3 and SRSF7 were shown to bind different sites in last exons
      and regulate 3' untranslated region length in an opposing manner. Both SRSF3 and 
      SRSF7 promoted NXF1 recruitment to mRNA. Thus, SRSF3 and SRSF7 couple alternative
      splicing and polyadenylation to NXF1-mediated mRNA export, thereby controlling
      the cytoplasmic abundance of transcripts with alternative 3' ends.

TI  - AMPK governs lineage specification through Tfeb-dependent regulation of
      lysosomes.
PG  - 535-52
LID - 10.1101/gad.274142.115 [doi]
AB  - Faithful execution of developmental programs relies on the acquisition of unique 
      cell identities from pluripotent progenitors, a process governed by combinatorial
      inputs from numerous signaling cascades that ultimately dictate lineage-specific 
      transcriptional outputs. Despite growing evidence that metabolism is integrated
      with many molecular networks, how pathways that control energy homeostasis may
      affect cell fate decisions is largely unknown. Here, we show that AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK), a central metabolic regulator, plays critical roles in
      lineage specification. Although AMPK-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were
      normal in the pluripotent state, these cells displayed profound defects upon
      differentiation, failing to generate chimeric embryos and preferentially adopting
      an ectodermal fate at the expense of the endoderm during embryoid body (EB)
      formation. AMPK(-/-) EBs exhibited reduced levels of Tfeb, a master
      transcriptional regulator of lysosomes, leading to diminished endolysosomal
      function. Remarkably, genetic loss of Tfeb also yielded endodermal defects, while
      AMPK-null ESCs overexpressing this transcription factor normalized their
      differential potential, revealing an intimate connection between Tfeb/lysosomes
      and germ layer specification. The compromised endolysosomal system resulting from
      AMPK or Tfeb inactivation blunted Wnt signaling, while up-regulating this pathway
      restored expression of endodermal markers. Collectively, these results uncover
      the AMPK pathway as a novel regulator of cell fate determination during
      differentiation.

TI  - UTX inhibition as selective epigenetic therapy against TAL1-driven T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 508-21
LID - 10.1101/gad.276790.115 [doi]
AB  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a heterogeneous group of
      hematological tumors composed of distinct subtypes that vary in their genetic
      abnormalities, gene expression signatures, and prognoses. However, it remains
      unclear whether T-ALL subtypes differ at the functional level, and, as such,
      T-ALL treatments are uniformly applied across subtypes, leading to variable
      responses between patients. Here we reveal the existence of a subtype-specific
      epigenetic vulnerability in T-ALL by which a particular subgroup of T-ALL
      characterized by expression of the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 is
      uniquely sensitive to variations in the dosage and activity of the histone 3
      Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase UTX/KDM6A. Specifically, we identify UTX as a
      coactivator of TAL1 and show that it acts as a major regulator of the TAL1
      leukemic gene expression program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UTX,
      previously described as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL, is in fact a pro-oncogenic
      cofactor essential for leukemia maintenance in TAL1-positive (but not
      TAL1-negative) T-ALL. Exploiting this subtype-specific epigenetic vulnerability, 
      we propose a novel therapeutic approach based on UTX inhibition through in vivo
      administration of an H3K27 demethylase inhibitor that efficiently kills
      TAL1-positive primary human leukemia. These findings provide the first
      opportunity to develop personalized epigenetic therapy for T-ALL patients.

AB  - Pancreatic beta cells are responsible for maintaining glucose homeostasis; their 
      absence or malfunction results in diabetes mellitus. Although there is evidence
      that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in development and
      disease, none have been investigated in vivo in the context of pancreas
      development. In this study, we demonstrate that betalinc1 (beta-cell long
      intergenic noncoding RNA 1), a conserved lncRNA, is necessary for the
      specification and function of insulin-producing beta cells through the
      coordinated regulation of a number of islet-specific transcription factors
      located in the genomic vicinity of betalinc1. Furthermore, deletion of betalinc1 
      results in defective islet development and disruption of glucose homeostasis in
      adult mice.

      cancer-associated cachexia (CAC), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

AB  - In this issue of Genes & Development, Ginart and colleagues (pp. 567-578) study a
      mouse model for Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS) and show that similar cells within 
      one individual can display distinct gene expression patterns because of
      epigenetic marks that are established stochastically during early development.
      Their results provide an excellent explanation for phenotypes seen in RSS and
      other imprinting disorders and especially help us understand how patients with
      similar or even identical genetic mutations can display distinct disease
      profiles.

TI  - Mice deficient in poly(C)-binding protein 4 are susceptible to spontaneous tumors
      through increased expression of ZFP871 that targets p53 for degradation.
PG  - 522-34
LID - 10.1101/gad.271890.115 [doi]
AB  - Poly(C)-binding protein 4 (PCBP4), also called MCG10 and a target of p53, plays a
      role in the cell cycle and is implicated in lung tumor suppression. Here, we
      found that PCBP4-deficient mice are prone to lung adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and
      kidney tumor and that PCBP4-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit
      enhanced cell proliferation but decreased cellular senescence. We also found that
      p53 expression is markedly reduced in PCBP4-deficient MEFs and mouse tissues,
      suggesting that PCBP4 in turn regulates p53 expression. To determine how PCBP4
      regulates p53 expression, PCBP4 targets were identified by RNA
      immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that the
      transcript encoding ZFP871 (zinc finger protein 871; also called ZNF709 in
      humans) interacts with and is regulated by PCBP4 via mRNA stability.
      Additionally, we found that ZFP871 physically interacts with p53 and MDM2
      proteins. Consistently, ectopic expression of ZFP871 decreases-whereas knockdown 
      of ZFP871 increases-p53 protein stability through a proteasome-dependent
      degradation pathway. Moreover, loss of ZFP871 reverses the reduction of p53
      expression by lack of PCBP4, and thus increased expression of ZFP871 is
      responsible for decreased expression of p53 in the PCBP4-deficient MEFs and mouse
      tissues. Interestingly, we found that, like PCBP4, ZFP871 is also regulated by
      DNA damage and p53. Finally, we showed that knockdown of ZFP871 markedly enhances
      p53 expression, leading to growth suppression and apoptosis in a p53-dependent
      manner. Thus, the p53-PCBP4-ZFP871 axis represents a novel feedback loop in the
      p53 pathway. Together, we hypothesize that PCBP4 is a potential tissue-specific
      tumor suppressor and that ZFP871 is part of MDM2 and possibly other ubiquitin E3 
      ligases that target p53 for degradation.

TI  - TALE-light imaging reveals maternally guided, H3K9me2/3-independent emergence of 
      functional heterochromatin in Drosophila embryos.
PG  - 579-93
LID - 10.1101/gad.272237.115 [doi]
AB  - Metazoans start embryogenesis with a relatively naive genome. The
      transcriptionally inert, late-replicating heterochromatic regions, including the 
      constitutive heterochromatin on repetitive sequences near centromeres and
      telomeres, need to be re-established during development. To explore the events
      initiating heterochromatin formation and examine their temporal control, sequence
      specificity, and immediate regulatory consequence, we established a live imaging 
      approach that enabled visualization of steps in heterochromatin emergence on
      specific satellite sequences during the mid-blastula transition (MBT) in
      Drosophila. Unexpectedly, only a subset of satellite sequences, including the
      359-base-pair (bp) repeat sequence, recruited HP1a at the MBT. The recruitment of
      HP1a to the 359-bp repeat was dependent on HP1a's chromoshadow domain but not its
      chromodomain and was guided by maternally provided signals. HP1a recruitment to
      the 359-bp repeat was required for its programmed shift to later replication, and
      ectopic recruitment of HP1a was sufficient to delay replication timing of a
      different repeat. Our results reveal that emergence of constitutive
      heterochromatin follows a stereotyped developmental program in which different
      repetitive sequences use distinct interactions and independent pathways to arrive
      at a heterochromatic state. This differential emergence of heterochromatin on
      various repetitive sequences changes their replication order and remodels the DNA
      replication schedule during embryonic development.

      initiation.
PG  - 471-83
LID - 10.1101/gad.276964.115 [doi]
AB  - To sustain a lifelong ability to initiate organs, plants retain pools of
      undifferentiated cells with a preserved proliferation capacity. The root
      pericycle represents a unique tissue with conditional meristematic activity, and 
      its tight control determines initiation of lateral organs. Here we show that the 
      meristematic activity of the pericycle is constrained by the interaction with the
      adjacent endodermis. Release of these restraints by elimination of endodermal
      cells by single-cell ablation triggers the pericycle to re-enter the cell cycle. 
      We found that endodermis removal substitutes for the phytohormone auxin-dependent
      initiation of the pericycle meristematic activity. However, auxin is
      indispensable to steer the cell division plane orientation of new organ-defining 
      divisions. We propose a dual, spatiotemporally distinct role for auxin during
      lateral root initiation. In the endodermis, auxin releases constraints arising
      from cell-to-cell interactions that compromise the pericycle meristematic
      activity, whereas, in the pericycle, auxin defines the orientation of the cell
      division plane to initiate lateral roots.

LID - 10.1101/gad.273128.115 [doi]
AB  - The Mediator complex governs gene expression by linking upstream signaling
      pathways with the basal transcriptional machinery. However, how individual
      Mediator subunits may function in different tissues remains to be investigated.
      Through skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the Mediator subunit MED13 in mice, 
      we discovered a gene regulatory mechanism by which skeletal muscle modulates the 
      response of the liver to a high-fat diet. Skeletal muscle-specific deletion of
      MED13 in mice conferred resistance to hepatic steatosis by activating a metabolic
      gene program that enhances muscle glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. The
      consequent insulin-sensitizing effect within skeletal muscle lowered systemic
      glucose and insulin levels independently of weight gain and adiposity and
      prevented hepatic lipid accumulation. MED13 suppressed the expression of genes
      involved in glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle by inhibiting the
      nuclear receptor NURR1 and the MEF2 transcription factor. These findings reveal a
      fundamental molecular mechanism for the governance of glucose metabolism and the 
      control of hepatic lipid accumulation by skeletal muscle. Intriguingly, MED13
      exerts opposing metabolic actions in skeletal muscle and the heart, highlighting 
      the customized, tissue-specific functions of the Mediator complex.

AB  - Coordination of differentiation and cell cycle progression represents an
      essential process for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. These
      mechanisms ultimately determine the quantities of specific cell types that are
      generated. Despite their importance, the precise molecular interplays between
      cell cycle machinery and master regulators of cell fate choice remain to be fully
      uncovered. Here, we demonstrate that cell cycle regulators Cyclin D1-3 control
      cell fate decisions in human pluripotent stem cells by recruiting transcriptional
      corepressors and coactivator complexes onto neuroectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm
      genes. This activity results in blocking the core transcriptional network
      necessary for endoderm specification while promoting neuroectoderm factors. The
      genomic location of Cyclin Ds is determined by their interactions with the
      transcription factors SP1 and E2Fs, which result in the assembly of cell
      cycle-controlled transcriptional complexes. These results reveal how the cell
      cycle orchestrates transcriptional networks and epigenetic modifiers to instruct 
      cell fate decisions.

TI  - Mutation of cancer driver MLL2 results in transcription stress and genome
      instability.
PG  - 408-20
LID - 10.1101/gad.275453.115 [doi]
AB  - Genome instability is a recurring feature of tumorigenesis. Mutation in MLL2,
      encoding a histone methyltransferase, is a driver in numerous different cancer
      types, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we present evidence that MLL2 mutation
      results in genome instability. Mouse cells in which MLL2 gene deletion can be
      induced display elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange, gross chromosomal
      aberrations, 53BP1 foci, and micronuclei. Human MLL2 knockout cells are
      characterized by genome instability as well. Interestingly, MLL2 interacts with
      RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and RECQL5, and, although MLL2 mutated cells have
      normal overall H3K4me levels in genes, nucleosomes in the immediate vicinity of
      RNAPII are hypomethylated. Importantly, MLL2 mutated cells display signs of
      substantial transcription stress, and the most affected genes overlap with early 
      replicating fragile sites, show elevated levels of gammaH2AX, and suffer frequent
      mutation. The requirement for MLL2 in the maintenance of genome stability in
      genes helps explain its widespread role in cancer and points to transcription
      stress as a strong driver in tumorigenesis.

PG  - 399-407
LID - 10.1101/gad.274134.115 [doi]
AB  - Understanding new therapeutic paradigms for both castrate-sensitive and more
      aggressive castrate-resistant prostate cancer is essential to improve clinical
      outcomes. As a critically important cellular process, autophagy promotes stress
      tolerance by recycling intracellular components to sustain metabolism important
      for tumor survival. To assess the importance of autophagy in prostate cancer, we 
      generated a new autochthonous genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) with
      inducible prostate-specific deficiency in the Pten tumor suppressor and
      autophagy-related-7 (Atg7) genes. Atg7 deficiency produced an autophagy-deficient
      phenotype and delayed Pten-deficient prostate tumor progression in both
      castrate-naive and castrate-resistant cancers. Atg7-deficient tumors display
      evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, suggesting that autophagy may
      promote prostate tumorigenesis through management of protein homeostasis. Taken
      together, these data support the importance of autophagy for both castrate-naive 
      and castrate-resistant growth in a newly developed GEMM, suggesting a new
      paradigm and model to study approaches to inhibit autophagy in combination with
      known and new therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

LID - 10.1101/gad.270645.115 [doi]
AB  - Post-transcriptional deregulation is a defining feature of metastatic cancer.
      While many microRNAs have been implicated as regulators of metastatic
      progression, less is known about the roles and mechanisms of RNA-binding proteins
      in this process. We identified muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), a gene implicated in
      myotonic dystrophy, as a robust suppressor of multiorgan breast cancer
      metastasis. MBNL1 binds the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of DBNL (drebrin-like 
      protein) and TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1)-two
      genes that we implicate as metastasis suppressors. By enhancing the stability of 
      these genes' transcripts, MBNL1 suppresses cell invasiveness. Consistent with
      these findings, elevated MBNL1 expression in human breast tumors is associated
      with reduced metastatic relapse likelihood. Our findings delineate a
      post-transcriptional network that governs breast cancer metastasis through
      RNA-binding protein-mediated transcript stabilization.

AB  - With 5-year survival rates remaining constant at 6% and rising incidences
      associated with an epidemic in obesity and metabolic syndrome, pancreatic ductal 
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is on track to become the second most common cause of
      cancer-related deaths by 2030. The high mortality rate of PDAC stems primarily
      from the lack of early diagnosis and ineffective treatment for advanced tumors.
      During the past decade, the comprehensive atlas of genomic alterations, the
      prominence of specific pathways, the preclinical validation of such emerging
      targets, sophisticated preclinical model systems, and the molecular
      classification of PDAC into specific disease subtypes have all converged to
      illuminate drug discovery programs with clearer clinical path hypotheses. A
      deeper understanding of cancer cell biology, particularly altered cancer cell
      metabolism and impaired DNA repair processes, is providing novel therapeutic
      strategies that show strong preclinical activity. Elucidation of tumor biology
      principles, most notably a deeper understanding of the complexity of immune
      regulation in the tumor microenvironment, has provided an exciting framework to
      reawaken the immune system to attack PDAC cancer cells. While the long road of
      translation lies ahead, the path to meaningful clinical progress has never been
      clearer to improve PDAC patient survival.

AB  - The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) system is
      an RNA-guided immune system that protects prokaryotes from invading genetic
      elements. This system represents an inheritable and adaptable immune system that 
      is mediated by multisubunit effector complexes. In the Type III-B system, the Cmr
      effector complex has been found to cleave ssRNA in vitro. However, in vivo, it
      has been implicated in transcription-dependent DNA targeting. We show here that
      the Cmr complex from Thermotoga maritima can cleave an ssRNA target that is
      complementary to the CRISPR RNA. We also show that binding of a complementary
      ssRNA target activates an ssDNA-specific nuclease activity in the
      histidine-aspartate (HD) domain of the Cmr2 subunit of the complex. These data
      suggest a mechanism for transcription-coupled DNA targeting by the Cmr complex
      and provide a unifying mechanism for all Type III systems.

LID - 10.1101/gad.272153.115 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems eliminate nucleic acid invaders in bacteria and archaea. The
      effector complex of the Type III-B Cmr system cleaves invader RNAs recognized by 
      the CRISPR RNA (crRNA ) of the complex. Here we show that invader RNAs also
      activate the Cmr complex to cleave DNA. As has been observed for other Type III
      systems, Cmr eliminates plasmid invaders in Pyrococcus furiosus by a mechanism
      that depends on transcription of the crRNA target sequence within the plasmid.
      Notably, we found that the target RNA per se induces DNA cleavage by the Cmr
      complex in vitro. DNA cleavage activity does not depend on cleavage of the target
      RNA but notably does require the presence of a short sequence adjacent to the
      target sequence within the activating target RNA (rPAM [RNA protospacer-adjacent 
      motif]). The activated complex does not require a target sequence (or a PAM) in
      the DNA substrate. Plasmid elimination by the P. furiosus Cmr system also does
      not require the Csx1 (CRISPR-associated Rossman fold [CARF] superfamily) protein.
      Plasmid silencing depends on the HD nuclease and Palm domains of the Cmr2 (Cas10 
      superfamily) protein. The results establish the Cmr complex as a novel DNA
      nuclease activated by invader RNAs containing a crRNA target sequence and a rPAM.

TI  - MLL1 is essential for the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
PG  - 321-36
LID - 10.1101/gad.271882.115 [doi]
AB  - Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and therapy-induced senescence (TIS), while
      tumor-suppressive, also promote procarcinogenic effects by activating the DNA
      damage response (DDR), which in turn induces inflammation. This inflammatory
      response prominently includes an array of cytokines known as the
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Previous observations link the 
      transcription-associated methyltransferase and oncoprotein MLL1 to the DDR,
      leading us to investigate the role of MLL1 in SASP expression. Our findings
      reveal direct MLL1 epigenetic control over proproliferative cell cycle genes:
      MLL1 inhibition represses expression of proproliferative cell cycle regulators
      required for DNA replication and DDR activation, thus disabling SASP expression. 
      Strikingly, however, these effects of MLL1 inhibition on SASP gene expression do 
      not impair OIS and, furthermore, abolish the ability of the SASP to enhance
      cancer cell proliferation. More broadly, MLL1 inhibition also reduces "SASP-like"
      inflammatory gene expression from cancer cells in vitro and in vivo independently
      of senescence. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MLL1 inhibition may be
      a powerful and effective strategy for inducing cancerous growth arrest through
      the direct epigenetic regulation of proliferation-promoting genes and the
      avoidance of deleterious OIS- or TIS-related tumor secretomes, which can promote 
      both drug resistance and tumor progression.

LID - 10.1101/gad.275107.115 [doi]
AB  - Animals alter their reproductive programs to accommodate changes in nutrient
      availability, yet the connections between known nutrient-sensing systems and
      reproductive programs are underexplored, and whether there is a mechanism that
      senses nucleotide levels to coordinate germline proliferation is unknown. We
      established a model system in which nucleotide metabolism is perturbed in both
      the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (cytidine deaminases) and its food
      (Escherichia coli); when fed food with a low uridine/thymidine (U/T) level,
      germline proliferation is arrested. We provide evidence that this impact of U/T
      level on the germline is critically mediated by GLP-1/Notch and MPK-1/MAPK, known
      to regulate germline mitotic proliferation. This germline defect is suppressed by
      hyperactivation of glp-1 or disruption of genes downstream from glp-1 to promote 
      meiosis but not by activation of the IIS or TORC1 pathways. Moreover, GLP-1
      expression is post-transcriptionally modulated by U/T levels. Our results reveal 
      a previously unknown nucleotide-sensing mechanism for controlling reproductivity.

AB  - Senescence stimuli activate multiple tumor suppressor pathways to initiate cycle 
      arrest and a differentiation program characteristic of senescent cells. We
      performed a two-stage, gain-of-function screen to select for the genes whose
      enhanced expression can bypass replicative senescence. We uncovered multiple
      genes known to be involved in p53 and Rb regulation and ATM regulation, two
      components of the CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) complex involved in preventing telomere
      erosion, and genes such as REST and FOXO4 that have been implicated in aging.
      Among the new genes now implicated in senescence, we identified DLX2, a homeobox 
      transcription factor that has been shown to be required for tumor growth and
      metastasis and is associated with poor cancer prognosis. Growth analysis showed
      that DLX2 expression led to increased cellular replicative life span. Our data
      suggest that DLX2 expression reduces the protein components of the TTI1/TTI2/TEL2
      complex, a key complex required for the proper folding and stabilization of ATM
      and other members of the PIKK (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase)
      family kinase, leading to reduced ATM-p53 signaling and senescence bypass. We
      also found that the overexpression of DLX2 exhibited a mutually exclusive
      relationship with p53 alterations in cancer patients. Our functional screen
      identified novel players that may promote tumorigenesis by regulating the ATM-p53
      pathway and senescence.

AB  - Meiotic recombination is required for the segregation of homologous chromosomes
      and is essential for fertility. In most mammals, the DNA double-strand breaks
      (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are directed to a subset of genomic
      loci (hot spots) by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Rapid
      evolution of the DNA-binding specificity of PRDM9 and gradual erosion of
      PRDM9-binding sites by gene conversion will alter the recombination landscape
      over time. To better understand the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot
      spots and its consequences, we mapped DSB hot spots in four major subspecies of
      Mus musculus with different Prdm9 alleles and in their F1 hybrids. We found that 
      hot spot erosion governs the preferential usage of some Prdm9 alleles over others
      in hybrid mice and increases sequence diversity specifically at hot spots that
      become active in the hybrids. As crossovers are disfavored at such hot spots, we 
      propose that sequence divergence generated by hot spot turnover may create an
      impediment for recombination in hybrids, potentially leading to reduced fertility
      and, eventually, speciation.

PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.1101/gad.274928.115 [doi]
AB  - The multidomain zinc finger (ZnF) protein PRDM9 (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous
      domain-containing 9) is thought to influence the locations of recombination hot
      spots during meiosis by sequence-specific DNA binding and trimethylation of
      histone H3 Lys4. The most common variant of human PRDM9, allele A (hPRDM9A),
      recognizes the consensus sequence 5'-NCCNCCNTNNCCNCN-3'. We cocrystallized
      ZnF8-12 of hPRDM9A with an oligonucleotide representing a known hot spot sequence
      and report the structure here. ZnF12 was not visible, but ZnF8-11, like other ZnF
      arrays, follows the right-handed twist of the DNA, with the alpha helices
      occupying the major groove. Each alpha helix makes hydrogen-bond (H-bond)
      contacts with up to four adjacent bases, most of which are purines of the
      complementary DNA strand. The consensus C:G base pairs H-bond with conserved His 
      or Arg residues in ZnF8, ZnF9, and ZnF11, and the consensus T:A base pair H-bonds
      with an Asn that replaces His in ZnF10. Most of the variable base pairs (N) also 
      engage in H bonds with the protein. These interactions appear to compensate to
      some extent for changes from the consensus sequence, implying an adaptability of 
      PRDM9 to sequence variations. We investigated the binding of various alleles of
      hPRDM9 to different hot spot sequences. Allele C was found to bind a C-specific
      hot spot with higher affinity than allele A bound A-specific hot spots, perhaps
      explaining why the former is dominant in A/C heterozygotes. Allele L13 displayed 
      higher affinity for several A-specific sequences, allele L9/L24 displayed lower
      affinity, and allele L20 displayed an altered sequence preference. These
      differences can be rationalized structurally and might contribute to the
      variation observed in the locations and activities of meiotic recombination hot
      spots.

TI  - The p53-Mdm2 interaction and the E3 ligase activity of Mdm2/Mdm4 are conserved
      from lampreys to humans.
PG  - 281-92
LID - 10.1101/gad.274118.115 [doi]
AB  - The extant jawless vertebrates, represented by lampreys and hagfish, are the
      oldest group of vertebrates and provide an interesting genomic evolutionary pivot
      point between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates. Through genome analysis of one
      of these jawless vertebrates, the Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), we
      identified all three members of the important p53 transcription factor
      family--Tp53, Tp63, and Tp73--as well as the Mdm2 and Mdm4 genes. These genes and
      their products are significant cellular regulators in human cancer, and further
      examination of their roles in this most distant vertebrate relative sheds light
      on their origin and coevolution. Their important role in response to DNA damage
      has been highlighted by the discovery of multiple copies of the Tp53 gene in
      elephants. Expression of lamprey p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4 proteins in mammalian cells 
      reveals that the p53-Mdm2 interaction and the Mdm2/Mdm4 E3 ligase activity
      existed in the common ancestor of vertebrates and have been conserved for >500
      million years of vertebrate evolution. Lamprey Mdm2 degrades human p53 with great
      efficiency, but this interaction is not blocked by currently available small
      molecule inhibitors of the human HDM2 protein, suggesting utility of lamprey Mdm2
      in the study of the human p53 signaling pathway.

TI  - Mec1, INO80, and the PAF1 complex cooperate to limit transcription replication
      conflicts through RNAPII removal during replication stress.
PG  - 337-54
LID - 10.1101/gad.273813.115 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about how cells ensure DNA replication in the face of RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII)-mediated transcription, especially under conditions of
      replicative stress. Here we present genetic and proteomic analyses from budding
      yeast that uncover links between the DNA replication checkpoint sensor Mec1-Ddc2 
      (ATR-ATRIP), the chromatin remodeling complex INO80C (INO80 complex), and the
      transcription complex PAF1C (PAF1 complex). We found that a subset of
      chromatin-bound RNAPII is degraded in a manner dependent on Mec1, INO80, and PAF1
      complexes in cells exposed to hydroxyurea (HU). On HU, Mec1 triggers the
      efficient removal of PAF1C and RNAPII from transcribed genes near early firing
      origins. Failure to evict RNAPII correlates inversely with recovery from
      replication stress: paf1Delta cells, like ino80 and mec1 mutants, fail to restart
      forks efficiently after stalling. Our data reveal unexpected synergies between
      INO80C, Mec1, and PAF1C in the maintenance of genome integrity and suggest a
      mechanism of RNAPII degradation that reduces transcription-replication fork
      collision.

TI  - JMJ24 targets CHROMOMETHYLASE3 for proteasomal degradation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1101/gad.274647.115 [doi]
AB  - H3K9 methylation is usually associated with DNA methylation, and together they
      symbolize transcriptionally silenced heterochromatin. A number of proteins
      involved in epigenetic processes have been characterized. However, how the
      stability of these proteins is regulated at the post-translational level is
      largely unknown. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis JmjC domain protein, JMJ24,
      possesses ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. JMJ24 directly targets a DNA
      methyltransferase, CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), for proteasomal degradation to
      initiate destabilization of the heterochromatic state of endogenous silenced
      loci. Our results uncover an additional connection between two conserved
      epigenetic modifications: histone modification and DNA methylation.

TI  - Prrx1 isoform switching regulates pancreatic cancer invasion and metastatic
      colonization.
PG  - 233-47
LID - 10.1101/gad.263327.115 [doi]
AB  - The two major isoforms of the paired-related homeodomain transcription factor 1
      (Prrx1), Prrx1a and Prrx1b, are involved in pancreatic development, pancreatitis,
      and carcinogenesis, although the biological role that these isoforms serve in the
      systemic dissemination of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been
      investigated. An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is believed to be
      important for primary tumor progression and dissemination, whereas a
      mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) appears crucial for metastatic
      colonization. Here, we describe novel roles for both isoforms in the metastatic
      cascade using complementary in vitro and in vivo models. Prrx1b promotes
      invasion, tumor dedifferentiation, and EMT. In contrast, Prrx1a stimulates
      metastatic outgrowth in the liver, tumor differentiation, and MET. We further
      demonstrate that the switch from Prrx1b to Prrx1a governs EMT plasticity in both 
      mouse models of PDAC and human PDAC. Last, we identify hepatocyte growth factor (
      HGF) as a novel transcriptional target of Prrx1b. Targeted therapy of HGF in
      combination with gemcitabine in a preclinical model of PDAC reduces primary tumor
      volume and eliminates metastatic disease. Overall, we provide new insights into
      the isoform-specific roles of Prrx1a and Prrx1b in primary PDAC formation,
      dissemination, and metastatic colonization, allowing for novel therapeutic
      strategies targeting EMT plasticity.

      mechanisms in cancer.
PG  - 220-32
LID - 10.1101/gad.270439.115 [doi]
AB  - Proteases are important for regulating multiple tumorigenic processes, including 
      angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion. Elevated protease expression is
      associated with poor patient prognosis across numerous tumor types. Several
      multigene protease families have been implicated in cancer, including cysteine
      cathepsins. However, whether individual family members have unique roles or are
      functionally redundant remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate
      stage-dependent effects of simultaneously deleting cathepsin B (CtsB) and CtsS in
      a murine pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor model. Early in tumorigenesis, the
      double knockout results in an additive reduction in angiogenic switching, whereas
      at late stages, several tumorigenic phenotypes are unexpectedly restored to
      wild-type levels. We identified CtsZ, which is predominantly supplied by
      tumor-associated macrophages, as the compensatory protease that regulates the
      acquired tumor-promoting functions of lesions deficient in both CtsB and CtsS.
      Thus, deletion of multiple cathepsins can lead to stage-dependent, compensatory
      mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, which has potential implications for
      the clinical consideration of selective versus pan-family cathepsin inhibitors in
      cancer.

AB  - Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate chromatin states, but the
      evolutionary origin and dynamics driving lncRNA-genome interactions are unclear. 
      We adapted an integrative strategy that identifies lncRNA orthologs in different 
      species despite limited sequence similarity, which is applicable to mammalian and
      insect lncRNAs. Analysis of the roX lncRNAs, which are essential for dosage
      compensation of the single X chromosome in Drosophila males, revealed 47 new roX 
      orthologs in diverse Drosophilid species across approximately 40 million years of
      evolution. Genetic rescue by roX orthologs and engineered synthetic lncRNAs
      showed that altering the number of focal, repetitive RNA structures determines
      roX ortholog function. Genomic occupancy maps of roX RNAs in four species
      revealed conserved targeting of X chromosome neighborhoods but rapid turnover of 
      individual binding sites. Many new roX-binding sites evolved from DNA encoding a 
      pre-existing RNA splicing signal, effectively linking dosage compensation to
      transcribed genes. Thus, dynamic change in lncRNAs and their genomic targets
      underlies conserved and essential lncRNA-genome interactions.

TI  - O-GlcNAcylation of master growth repressor DELLA by SECRET AGENT modulates
      multiple signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 164-76
LID - 10.1101/gad.270587.115 [doi]
AB  - The DELLA family of transcription regulators functions as master growth
      repressors in plants by inhibiting phytohormone gibberellin (GA) signaling in
      response to developmental and environmental cues. DELLAs also play a central role
      in mediating cross-talk between GA and other signaling pathways via antagonistic 
      direct interactions with key transcription factors. However, how these crucial
      protein-protein interactions can be dynamically regulated during plant
      development remains unclear. Here, we show that DELLAs are modified by the
      O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) SECRET AGENT (SEC) in
      Arabidopsis. O-GlcNAcylation of the DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA)
      inhibits RGA binding to four of its interactors-PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR3
      (PIF3), PIF4, JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN1, and BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1)-that are 
      key regulators in light, jasmonate, and brassinosteroid signaling pathways,
      respectively. Consistent with this, the sec-null mutant displayed reduced
      responses to GA and brassinosteroid and showed decreased expression of several
      common target genes of DELLAs, BZR1, and PIFs. Our results reveal a direct role
      of OGT in repressing DELLA activity and indicate that O-GlcNAcylation of DELLAs
      provides a fine-tuning mechanism in coordinating multiple signaling activities
      during plant development.

TI  - Chromosome-specific NOR inactivation explains selective rRNA gene silencing and
      dosage control in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 177-90
LID - 10.1101/gad.273755.115 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, scores of excess ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are silenced by
      repressive chromatin modifications. Given the near sequence identity of rRNA
      genes within a species, it is unclear how specific rRNA genes are reproducibly
      chosen for silencing. Using Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype (strain) Col-0, a
      systematic search identified sequence polymorphisms that differ between active
      and developmentally silenced rRNA gene subtypes. Recombinant inbred mapping
      populations derived from three different ecotype crosses were then used to map
      the chromosomal locations of silenced and active RNA gene subtypes. Importantly, 
      silenced and active rRNA gene subtypes are not intermingled. All silenced rRNA
      gene subtypes mapped to the nucleolus organizer region (NOR) on chromosome 2
      (NOR2). All active rRNA gene subtypes mapped to NOR4. Using an engineered A.
      thaliana line in which a portion of Col-0 chromosome 4 was replaced by sequences 
      of another ecotype, we show that a major rRNA gene subtype silenced at NOR2 is
      active when introgressed into the genome at NOR4. Collectively, these results
      reveal that selective rRNA gene silencing is not regulated gene by gene based on 
      mechanisms dependent on subtle gene sequence variation. Instead, we propose that 
      a subchromosomal silencing mechanism operates on a multimegabase scale to
      inactivate NOR2.

TI  - A PTIP-PA1 subcomplex promotes transcription for IgH class switching
      independently from the associated MLL3/MLL4 methyltransferase complex.

LID - 10.1101/gad.268797.115 [doi]
AB  - Class switch recombination (CSR) diversifies antibodies for productive immune
      responses while maintaining stability of the B-cell genome. Transcription at the 
      immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus targets CSR-associated DNA damage and is
      promoted by the BRCT domain-containing PTIP (Pax transactivation
      domain-interacting protein). Although PTIP is a unique component of the
      mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3)/MLL4 chromatin-modifying complex, the mechanisms 
      for how PTIP promotes transcription remain unclear. Here we dissected the minimal
      structural requirements of PTIP and its different protein complexes using
      quantitative proteomics in primary lymphocytes. We found that PTIP functions in
      transcription and CSR separately from its association with the MLL3/MLL4 complex 
      and from its localization to sites of DNA damage. We identified a tandem BRCT
      domain of PTIP that is sufficient for CSR and identified PA1 as its main
      functional protein partner. Collectively, we provide genetic and biochemical
      evidence that a PTIP-PA1 subcomplex functions independently from the MLL3/MLL4
      complex to mediate transcription during CSR. These results further our
      understanding of how multifunctional chromatin-modifying complexes are organized 
      by subcomplexes that harbor unique and distinct activities.

TI  - Control of heterochromatin localization and silencing by the nuclear membrane
      protein Lem2.

LID - 10.1101/gad.271288.115 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptionally silent chromatin localizes to the nuclear periphery, which
      provides a special microenvironment for gene repression. A variety of nuclear
      membrane proteins interact with repressed chromatin, yet the functional role of
      these interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, in
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the nuclear membrane protein Lem2 associates with
      chromatin and mediates silencing and heterochromatin localization. Unexpectedly, 
      we found that these functions can be separated and assigned to different
      structural domains within Lem2, excluding a simple tethering mechanism. Chromatin
      association and tethering of centromeres to the periphery are mediated by the
      N-terminal LEM (LAP2-Emerin-MAN1) domain of Lem2, whereas telomere anchoring and 
      heterochromatin silencing require exclusively its conserved C-terminal MSC
      (MAN1-Src1 C-terminal) domain. Particularly, silencing by Lem2 is epistatic with 
      the Snf2/HDAC (histone deacetylase) repressor complex SHREC at telomeres, while
      its necessity can be bypassed by deleting Epe1, a JmjC protein with
      anti-silencing activity. Furthermore, we found that loss of Lem2 reduces
      heterochromatin association of SHREC, which is accompanied by increased binding
      of Epe1. This reveals a critical function of Lem2 in coordinating these
      antagonistic factors at heterochromatin. The distinct silencing and localization 
      functions mediated by Lem2 suggest that these conserved LEM-containing proteins
      go beyond simple tethering to play active roles in perinuclear silencing.

TI  - MMP-9 facilitates selective proteolysis of the histone H3 tail at genes necessary
      for proficient osteoclastogenesis.
PG  - 208-19
LID - 10.1101/gad.268714.115 [doi]
AB  - Although limited proteolysis of the histone H3 N-terminal tail (H3NT) is
      frequently observed during mammalian differentiation, the specific genomic sites 
      targeted for H3NT proteolysis and the functional significance of H3NT cleavage
      remain largely unknown. Here we report the first method to identify and examine
      H3NT-cleaved regions in mammals, called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of
      acetylated chromatin (ChIPac). By applying ChIPac combined with deep sequencing
      (ChIPac-seq) to an established cell model of osteoclast differentiation, we
      discovered that H3NT proteolysis is selectively targeted near transcription start
      sites of a small group of genes and that most H3NT-cleaved genes displayed
      significant expression changes during osteoclastogenesis. We also discovered that
      the principal H3NT protease of osteoclastogenesis is matrix metalloproteinase 9
      (MMP-9). In contrast to other known H3NT proteases, MMP-9 primarily cleaved
      H3K18-Q19 in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, our results support
      CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of H3K18 as a central regulator of MMP-9 H3NT
      protease activity both in vitro and at H3NT cleavage sites during
      osteoclastogenesis. Importantly, we found that abrogation of H3NT proteolysis
      impaired osteoclastogenic gene activation concomitant with defective osteoclast
      differentiation. Our collective results support the necessity of MMP-9-dependent 
      H3NT proteolysis in regulating gene pathways required for proficient
      osteoclastogenesis.

TI  - P-TEFb regulation of transcription termination factor Xrn2 revealed by a chemical
      genetic screen for Cdk9 substrates.
PG  - 117-31
LID - 10.1101/gad.269589.115 [doi]
AB  - The transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is regulated at discrete
      transition points by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Positive transcription
      elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a complex of Cdk9 and cyclin T1, promotes release
      of paused Pol II into elongation, but the precise mechanisms and targets of Cdk9 
      action remain largely unknown. Here, by a chemical genetic strategy, we
      identified approximately 100 putative substrates of human P-TEFb, which were
      enriched for proteins implicated in transcription and RNA catabolism. Among the
      RNA processing factors phosphorylated by Cdk9 was the 5'-to-3' "torpedo"
      exoribonuclease Xrn2, required in transcription termination by Pol II, which we
      validated as a bona fide P-TEFb substrate in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation
      by Cdk9 or phosphomimetic substitution of its target residue, Thr439, enhanced
      enzymatic activity of Xrn2 on synthetic substrates in vitro. Conversely,
      inhibition or depletion of Cdk9 or mutation of Xrn2-Thr439 to a
      nonphosphorylatable Ala residue caused phenotypes consistent with inefficient
      termination in human cells: impaired Xrn2 chromatin localization and increased
      readthrough transcription of endogenous genes. Therefore, in addition to its role
      in elongation, P-TEFb regulates termination by promoting chromatin recruitment
      and activation of a cotranscriptional RNA processing enzyme, Xrn2.

AB  - Notch signaling regulates tissue morphogenesis through cell-cell interactions.
      The Notch effectors Hes1 and Hes7 are expressed in an oscillatory manner and
      regulate developmental processes such as neurogenesis and somitogenesis,
      respectively. Expression of the mRNA for the mouse Notch ligand Delta-like1
      (Dll1) is also oscillatory. However, the dynamics of Dll1 protein expression are 
      controversial, and their functional significance is unknown. Here, we developed a
      live-imaging system and found that Dll1 protein expression oscillated in neural
      progenitors and presomitic mesoderm cells. Notably, when Dll1 expression was
      accelerated or delayed by shortening or elongating the Dll1 gene, Dll1
      oscillations became severely dampened or quenched at intermediate levels, as
      modeled mathematically. Under this condition, Hes1 and Hes7 oscillations were
      also dampened. In the presomitic mesoderm, steady Dll1 expression led to severe
      fusion of somites and their derivatives, such as vertebrae and ribs. In the
      developing brain, steady Dll1 expression inhibited proliferation of neural
      progenitors and accelerated neurogenesis, whereas optogenetic induction of Dll1
      oscillation efficiently maintained neural progenitors. These results indicate
      that the appropriate timing of Dll1 expression is critical for the oscillatory
      networks and suggest the functional significance of oscillatory cell-cell
      interactions in tissue morphogenesis.

TI  - Regulation of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus by allele-specific enhancer activity.
PG  - 92-101
LID - 10.1101/gad.270413.115 [doi]
AB  - Genomic imprinting is a critical developmental process characteristic of parent
      of origin-specific gene expression. It is well accepted that differentially
      DNA-methylated regions (DMRs) and enhancers are two major classes of cis-elements
      determining parent of origin-specific gene expression, with each recruiting
      different sets of transcription factors. Previously, we identified the AF4/FMR2
      (AFF) family protein AFF3 within the transcription elongation complex SEC-L3.
      Here, we report that AFF3 can specifically bind both gametic DMRs (gDMRs) and
      enhancers within imprinted loci in an allele-specific manner. We identify the
      molecular regulators involved in the recruitment of AFF3 to gDMRs and provide
      mechanistic insight into the requirement of AFF3 at an enhancer for the
      expression of an approximately 200-kb polycistronic transcript within the
      imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus. Our data suggest that the heterochromatic environment 
      at the gDMR reinforces silencing of its related enhancer by controlling the
      binding and activity of AFF3 in an allele-specific manner. In summary, this study
      provides molecular details about the regulation of dosage-critical imprinted gene
      expression through the regulated binding of the transcription elongation factor
      AFF3 between a DMR and an enhancer.

TI  - Acute myeloid leukemia requires Hhex to enable PRC2-mediated epigenetic
      repression of Cdkn2a.
PG  - 78-91
LID - 10.1101/gad.268425.115 [doi]
AB  - Unlike clustered HOX genes, the role of nonclustered homeobox gene family members
      in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis has not been extensively studied. Here we
      found that the hematopoietically expressed homeobox gene Hhex is overexpressed in
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is essential for the initiation and propagation 
      of MLL-ENL-induced AML but dispensable for normal myelopoiesis, indicating a
      specific requirement for Hhex for leukemic growth. Loss of Hhex leads to
      expression of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF), which
      are required for growth arrest and myeloid differentiation following Hhex
      deletion. Mechanistically, we show that Hhex binds to the Cdkn2a locus and
      directly interacts with the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to enable
      H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic repression. Thus, Hhex is a potential therapeutic
      target that is specifically required for AML stem cells to repress tumor
      suppressor pathways and enable continued self-renewal.

TI  - Mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.274027.115 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo pathway was initially identified in Drosophila melanogaster screens for
      tissue growth two decades ago and has been a subject extensively studied in both 
      Drosophila and mammals in the last several years. The core of the Hippo pathway
      consists of a kinase cascade, transcription coactivators, and DNA-binding
      partners. Recent studies have expanded the Hippo pathway as a complex signaling
      network with >30 components. This pathway is regulated by intrinsic cell
      machineries, such as cell-cell contact, cell polarity, and actin cytoskeleton, as
      well as a wide range of signals, including cellular energy status, mechanical
      cues, and hormonal signals that act through G-protein-coupled receptors. The
      major functions of the Hippo pathway have been defined to restrict tissue growth 
      in adults and modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in
      developing organs. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Hippo pathway leads to
      aberrant cell growth and neoplasia. In this review, we focus on recent
      developments in our understanding of the molecular actions of the core Hippo
      kinase cascade and discuss key open questions in the regulation and function of
      the Hippo pathway.

PG  - 34-51
LID - 10.1101/gad.270959.115 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide analyses have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). 
      Malat1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most
      abundant lncRNAs whose expression is altered in numerous cancers. Here we report 
      that genetic loss or systemic knockdown of Malat1 using antisense
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-PyMT mouse
      mammary carcinoma model results in slower tumor growth accompanied by significant
      differentiation into cystic tumors and a reduction in metastasis. Furthermore,
      Malat1 loss results in a reduction of branching morphogenesis in MMTV-PyMT- and
      Her2/neu-amplified tumor organoids, increased cell adhesion, and loss of
      migration. At the molecular level, Malat1 knockdown results in alterations in
      gene expression and changes in splicing patterns of genes involved in
      differentiation and protumorigenic signaling pathways. Together, these data
      demonstrate for the first time a functional role of Malat1 in regulating critical
      processes in mammary cancer pathogenesis. Thus, Malat1 represents an exciting
      therapeutic target, and Malat1 ASOs represent a potential therapy for inhibiting 
      breast cancer progression.

      tumor suppression is not well understood. Using Drosophila and zebrafish models, 
      we show that p53 restricts retrotransposon activity and genetically interacts
      with components of the piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway. Furthermore,
      transposon eruptions occurring in the p53(-) germline were incited by meiotic
      recombination, and transcripts produced from these mobile elements accumulated in
      the germ plasm. In gene complementation studies, normal human p53 alleles
      suppressed transposons, but mutant p53 alleles from cancer patients could not.
      Consistent with these observations, we also found patterns of unrestrained
      retrotransposons in p53-driven mouse and human cancers. Furthermore, p53 status
      correlated with repressive chromatin marks in the 5' sequence of a synthetic
      LINE-1 element. Together, these observations indicate that ancestral functions of
      p53 operate through conserved mechanisms to contain retrotransposons. Since human
      p53 mutants are disabled for this activity, our findings raise the possibility
      that p53 mitigates oncogenic disease in part by restricting transposon mobility.

TI  - BMI1 induces an invasive signature in melanoma that promotes metastasis and
      chemoresistance.

AB  - Melanoma can switch between proliferative and invasive states, which have
      identifying gene expression signatures that correlate with good and poor
      prognosis, respectively. However, the mechanisms controlling these signatures are
      poorly understood. In this study, we identify BMI1 as a key determinant of
      melanoma metastasis by which its overexpression enhanced and its deletion
      impaired dissemination. Remarkably, in this tumor type, BMI1 had no effect on
      proliferation or primary tumor growth but enhanced every step of the metastatic
      cascade. Consistent with the broad spectrum of effects, BMI1 activated widespread
      gene expression changes, which are characteristic of melanoma progression and
      also chemoresistance. Accordingly, we showed that up-regulation or
      down-regulation of BMI1 induced resistance or sensitivity to BRAF inhibitor
      treatment and that induction of noncanonical Wnt by BMI1 is required for this
      resistance. Finally, we showed that our BMI1-induced gene signature encompasses
      all of the hallmarks of the previously described melanoma invasive signature.
      Moreover, our signature is predictive of poor prognosis in human melanoma and is 
      able to identify primary tumors that are likely to become metastatic. These data 
      yield key insights into melanoma biology and establish BMI1 as a compelling drug 
      target whose inhibition would suppress both metastasis and chemoresistance of
      melanoma.

      the mouse intestine.
PG  - 52-63
LID - 10.1101/gad.271130.115 [doi]
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in numerous cell responses, including
      proliferation, DNA damage, and cell death. Based on these disparate activities,
      both promotion and inhibition of ROS have been proposed for cancer therapy.
      However, how the ROS response is determined is not clear. We examined the
      activities of ROS in a model of Apc deletion, where loss of the Wnt target gene
      Myc both rescues APC loss and prevents ROS accumulation. Following APC loss, Myc 
      has been shown to up-regulate RAC1 to promote proliferative ROS through NADPH
      oxidase (NOX). However, APC loss also increased the expression of TIGAR, which
      functions to limit ROS. To explore this paradox, we used three-dimensional (3D)
      cultures and in vivo models to show that deletion of TIGAR increased ROS damage
      and inhibited proliferation. These responses were suppressed by limiting damaging
      ROS but enhanced by lowering proproliferative NOX-derived ROS. Despite having
      opposing effects on ROS levels, loss of TIGAR and RAC1 cooperated to suppress
      intestinal proliferation following APC loss. Our results indicate that the pro-
      and anti-proliferative effects of ROS can be independently modulated in the same 
      cell, with two key targets in the Wnt pathway functioning to integrate the
      different ROS signals for optimal cell proliferation.

AB  - Transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs) are essential for protein synthesis. However, 
      key gene products involved in tRNA biogenesis and subcellular movement remain to 
      be discovered. We conducted the first comprehensive unbiased analysis of the role
      of nearly an entire proteome in tRNA biology and describe 162 novel and 12
      previously known Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene products that function in tRNA
      processing, turnover, and subcellular movement. tRNA nuclear export is of
      particular interest because it is essential, but the known tRNA exporters (Los1
      [exportin-t] and Msn5 [exportin-5]) are unessential. We report that mutations of 
      CRM1 (Exportin-1), MEX67/MTR2 (TAP/p15), and five nucleoporins cause accumulation
      of unspliced tRNA, a hallmark of defective tRNA nuclear export. CRM1 mutation
      genetically interacts with los1Delta and causes altered tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic 
      distribution. The data implicate roles for the protein and mRNA nuclear export
      machineries in tRNA nuclear export. Mutations of genes encoding actin
      cytoskeleton components and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins also cause
      accumulation of unspliced tRNA, likely due to defective splicing on mitochondria.
      Additional gene products, such as chromatin modification enzymes, have
      unanticipated effects on pre-tRNA end processing. Thus, this genome-wide screen
      uncovered putative novel pathways for tRNA nuclear export and extensive links
      between tRNA biology and other aspects of cell physiology.

AB  - Commissural axon guidance depends on a myriad of cues expressed by intermediate
      targets. Secreted semaphorins signal through neuropilin-2/plexin-A1 receptor
      complexes on post-crossing commissural axons to mediate floor plate repulsion in 
      the mouse spinal cord. Here, we show that neuropilin-2/plexin-A1 are also
      coexpressed on commissural axons prior to midline crossing and can mediate
      precrossing semaphorin-induced repulsion in vitro. How premature
      semaphorin-induced repulsion of precrossing axons is suppressed in vivo is not
      known. We discovered that a novel source of floor plate-derived, but not
      axon-derived, neuropilin-2 is required for precrossing axon pathfinding. Floor
      plate-specific deletion of neuropilin-2 significantly reduces the presence of
      precrossing axons in the ventral spinal cord, which can be rescued by inhibiting 
      plexin-A1 signaling in vivo. Our results show that floor plate-derived
      neuropilin-2 is developmentally regulated, functioning as a molecular sink to
      sequester semaphorins, preventing premature repulsion of precrossing axons prior 
      to subsequent down-regulation, and allowing for semaphorin-mediated repulsion of 
      post-crossing axons.

AB  - Tight coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation is central to red
      blood cell formation. Erythropoietin controls the proliferation and survival of
      red blood cell precursors, while variations in GATA-1/FOG-1 complex composition
      and concentrations drive their maturation. However, clear evidence of cross-talk 
      between molecular pathways is lacking. Here, we show that erythropoietin
      activates AKT, which phosphorylates GATA-1 at Ser310, thereby increasing GATA-1
      affinity for FOG-1. In turn, FOG-1 displaces pRb/E2F-2 from GATA-1, ultimately
      releasing free, proproliferative E2F-2. Mice bearing a Gata-1(S310A) mutation
      suffer from fatal anemia when a compensatory pathway for E2F-2 production
      involving insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling is simultaneously
      abolished. In the context of the GATA-1(V205G) mutation resulting in lethal
      anemia, we show that the Ser310 cannot be phosphorylated and that constitutive
      phosphorylation at this position restores partial erythroid differentiation. This
      study sheds light on the GATA-1 pathways that synchronize cell proliferation and 
      differentiation for tissue homeostasis.

AB  - Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) promote replication through
      DNA lesions; however, little is known about the protein factors that affect their
      function in human cells. In yeast, Rev1 plays a noncatalytic role as an
      indispensable component of Polzeta, and Polzeta together with Rev1 mediates a
      highly mutagenic mode of TLS. However, how Rev1 functions in TLS and mutagenesis 
      in human cells has remained unclear. Here we determined the role of Rev1 in TLS
      opposite UV lesions in human and mouse fibroblasts and showed that Rev1 is
      indispensable for TLS mediated by Poleta, Poliota, and Polkappa but is not
      required for TLS by Polzeta. In contrast to its role in mutagenic TLS in yeast,
      Rev1 promotes predominantly error-free TLS opposite UV lesions in humans. The
      identification of Rev1 as an indispensable scaffolding component for Poleta,
      Poliota, and Polkappa, which function in TLS in highly specialized ways opposite 
      a diverse array of DNA lesions and act in a predominantly error-free manner,
      implicates a crucial role for Rev1 in the maintenance of genome stability in
      humans.

AB  - Chromatin comprises nucleosomes as well as nonnucleosomal histone-DNA particles. 
      Prenucleosomes are rapidly formed histone-DNA particles that can be converted
      into canonical nucleosomes by a motor protein such as ACF. Here we show that the 
      prenucleosome is a stable conformational isomer of the nucleosome. It consists of
      a histone octamer associated with approximately 80 base pair (bp) of DNA, which
      is located at a position that corresponds to the central 80 bp of a nucleosome
      core particle. Monomeric prenucleosomes with free flanking DNA do not
      spontaneously fold into nucleosomes but can be converted into canonical
      nucleosomes by an ATP-driven motor protein such as ACF or Chd1. In addition,
      histone H3K56, which is located at the DNA entry and exit points of a canonical
      nucleosome, is specifically acetylated by p300 in prenucleosomes relative to
      nucleosomes. Prenucleosomes assembled in vitro exhibit properties that are
      strikingly similar to those of nonnucleosomal histone-DNA particles in the
      upstream region of active promoters in vivo. These findings suggest that the
      prenucleosome, the only known stable conformational isomer of the nucleosome, is 
      related to nonnucleosomal histone-DNA species in the cell.

PG  - 2517-31
LID - 10.1101/gad.269902.115 [doi]
AB  - Genomic imprinting, an inherently epigenetic phenomenon defined by parent of
      origin-dependent gene expression, is observed in mammals and flowering plants.
      Genome-scale surveys of imprinted expression and the underlying differential
      epigenetic marks have led to the discovery of hundreds of imprinted plant genes
      and confirmed DNA and histone methylation as key regulators of plant imprinting. 
      However, the biological roles of the vast majority of imprinted plant genes are
      unknown, and the evolutionary forces shaping plant imprinting remain rather
      opaque. Here, we review the mechanisms of plant genomic imprinting and discuss
      theories of imprinting evolution and biological significance in light of recent
      findings.

TI  - FANCJ suppresses microsatellite instability and lymphomagenesis independent of
      the Fanconi anemia pathway.
PG  - 2532-46
LID - 10.1101/gad.272740.115 [doi]
AB  - Microsatellites are short tandem repeat sequences that are highly prone to
      expansion/contraction due to their propensity to form non-B-form DNA structures, 
      which hinder DNA polymerases and provoke template slippage. Although error
      correction by mismatch repair plays a key role in preventing microsatellite
      instability (MSI), which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome, activities must also
      exist that unwind secondary structures to facilitate replication fidelity. Here, 
      we report that Fancj helicase-deficient mice, while phenotypically resembling
      Fanconi anemia (FA), are also hypersensitive to replication inhibitors and
      predisposed to lymphoma. Whereas metabolism of G4-DNA structures is largely
      unaffected in Fancj(-/-) mice, high levels of spontaneous MSI occur, which is
      exacerbated by replication inhibition. In contrast, MSI is not observed in
      Fancd2(-/-) mice but is prevalent in human FA-J patients. Together, these data
      implicate FANCJ as a key factor required to counteract MSI, which is functionally
      distinct from its role in the FA pathway.

AB  - Alterations of chromatin modifiers are frequent in cancer, but their functional
      consequences often remain unclear. Focusing on the Polycomb protein EZH2 that
      deposits the H3K27me3 (trimethylation of Lys27 of histone H3) mark, we showed
      that its high expression in solid tumors is a consequence, not a cause, of
      tumorigenesis. In mouse and human models, EZH2 is dispensable for prostate cancer
      development and restrains breast tumorigenesis. High EZH2 expression in tumors
      results from a tight coupling to proliferation to ensure H3K27me3 homeostasis.
      However, this process malfunctions in breast cancer. Low EZH2 expression relative
      to proliferation and mutations in Polycomb genes actually indicate poor prognosis
      and occur in metastases. We show that while altered EZH2 activity consistently
      modulates a subset of its target genes, it promotes a wider transcriptional
      instability. Importantly, transcriptional changes that are consequences of EZH2
      loss are predominantly irreversible. Our study provides an unexpected
      understanding of EZH2's contribution to solid tumors with important therapeutic
      implications.

TI  - The large N-terminal region of the Brr2 RNA helicase guides productive
      spliceosome activation.
PG  - 2576-87
LID - 10.1101/gad.271528.115 [doi]
AB  - The Brr2 helicase provides the key remodeling activity for spliceosome catalytic 
      activation, during which it disrupts the U4/U6 di-snRNP (small nuclear RNA
      protein), and its activity has to be tightly regulated. Brr2 exhibits an unusual 
      architecture, including an approximately 500-residue N-terminal region, whose
      functions and molecular mechanisms are presently unknown, followed by a tandem
      array of structurally similar helicase units (cassettes), only the first of which
      is catalytically active. Here, we show by crystal structure analysis of
      full-length Brr2 in complex with a regulatory Jab1/MPN domain of the Prp8 protein
      and by cross-linking/mass spectrometry of isolated Brr2 that the Brr2 N-terminal 
      region encompasses two folded domains and adjacent linear elements that clamp and
      interconnect the helicase cassettes. Stepwise N-terminal truncations led to yeast
      growth and splicing defects, reduced Brr2 association with U4/U6*U5 tri-snRNPs,
      and increased ATP-dependent disruption of the tri-snRNP, yielding U4/U6 di-snRNP 
      and U5 snRNP. Trends in the RNA-binding, ATPase, and helicase activities of the
      Brr2 truncation variants are fully rationalized by the crystal structure,
      demonstrating that the N-terminal region autoinhibits Brr2 via substrate
      competition and conformational clamping. Our results reveal molecular mechanisms 
      that prevent premature and unproductive tri-snRNP disruption and suggest novel
      principles of Brr2-dependent splicing regulation.

AB  - Glucose-rich diets shorten the life spans of various organisms. However, the
      metabolic processes involved in this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we show
      that sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and mediator-15 (MDT-15)
      prevent the life-shortening effects of a glucose-rich diet by regulating
      fat-converting processes in Caenorhabditis elegans. Up-regulation of the
      SREBP/MDT-15 transcription factor complex was necessary and sufficient for
      alleviating the life-shortening effect of a glucose-rich diet. Glucose feeding
      induced key enzymes that convert saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to unsaturated
      fatty acids (UFAs), which are regulated by SREBP and MDT-15. Furthermore,
      SREBP/MDT-15 reduced the levels of SFAs and moderated glucose toxicity on life
      span. Our study may help to develop strategies against elevated blood glucose and
      free fatty acids, which cause glucolipotoxicity in diabetic patients.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are required to specify hepatic fate within the 
      definitive endoderm through activation of the FGF receptors (FGFRs). While the
      signaling pathways involved in hepatic specification are well understood, the
      mechanisms through which FGFs induce hepatic character within the endoderm are
      ill defined. Here we report the identification of genes whose expression is
      directly regulated by FGFR activity during the transition from endoderm to
      hepatic progenitor cell. The FGFR immediate early genes that were identified
      include those encoding transcription factors, growth factors, and signaling
      molecules. One of these immediate early genes encodes naked cuticle homolog 1
      (NKD1), which is a repressor of canonical WNT (wingless-type MMTV integration
      site) signaling. We show that loss of NKD1 suppresses the formation of hepatic
      progenitor cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells and that this
      phenotype can be rescued by using a pharmacological antagonist of canonical WNT
      signaling. We conclude that FGF specifies hepatic fate at least in large part by 
      inducing expression of NKD1 to transiently suppress the canonical WNT pathway.

AB  - Whole-genome duplication (WGD) doubles the DNA content in the nucleus and leads
      to polyploidy. In whole-organism polyploids, WGD has been implicated in
      adaptability and the evolution of increased genome complexity, but polyploidy can
      also arise in somatic cells of otherwise diploid plants and animals, where it
      plays important roles in development and likely environmental responses. As with 
      whole organisms, WGD can also promote adaptability and diversity in proliferating
      cell lineages, although whether WGD is beneficial is clearly context-dependent.
      WGD is also sometimes associated with aging and disease and may be a facilitator 
      of dangerous genetic and karyotypic diversity in tumorigenesis. Scaling changes
      can affect cell physiology, but problems associated with WGD in large part seem
      to arise from problems with chromosome segregation in polyploid cells. Here we
      discuss both the adaptive potential and problems associated with WGD, focusing
      primarily on cellular effects. We see value in recognizing polyploidy as a key
      player in generating diversity in development and cell lineage evolution, with
      intriguing parallels across kingdoms.

TI  - The glucose-sensing transcription factor MLX promotes myogenesis via myokine
      signaling.
PG  - 2475-89
LID - 10.1101/gad.267419.115 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic stress and changes in nutrient levels modulate many aspects of skeletal
      muscle function during aging and disease. Growth factors and cytokines secreted
      by skeletal muscle, known as myokines, are important signaling factors, but it is
      largely unknown whether they modulate muscle growth and differentiation in
      response to nutrients. Here, we found that changes in glucose levels increase the
      activity of the glucose-responsive transcription factor MLX (Max-like protein X),
      which promotes and is necessary for myoblast fusion. MLX promotes myogenesis not 
      via an adjustment of glucose metabolism but rather by inducing the expression of 
      several myokines, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), whereas RNAi and
      dominant-negative MLX reduce IGF2 expression and block myogenesis. This phenotype
      is rescued by conditioned medium from control muscle cells and by recombinant
      IGF2, which activates the myogenic kinase Akt. Importantly, MLX-null mice display
      decreased IGF2 induction and diminished muscle regeneration in response to
      injury, indicating that the myogenic function of MLX is manifested in vivo. Thus,
      glucose is a signaling molecule that regulates myogenesis and muscle regeneration
      via MLX/IGF2/Akt signaling.

TI  - Elf5-centered transcription factor hub controls trophoblast stem cell
      self-renewal and differentiation through stoichiometry-sensitive shifts in target
      gene networks.
PG  - 2435-48
LID - 10.1101/gad.268821.115 [doi]
AB  - Elf5 is a transcription factor with pivotal roles in the trophoblast compartment,
      where it reinforces a trophoblast stem cell (TSC)-specific transcriptional
      circuit. However, Elf5 is also present in differentiating trophoblast cells that 
      have ceased to express other TSC genes such as Cdx2 and Eomes. In the present
      study, we aimed to elucidate the context-dependent role of Elf5 at the interface 
      between TSC self-renewal and the onset of differentiation. We demonstrate that
      precise levels of Elf5 are critical for normal expansion of the TSC compartment
      and embryonic survival, as Elf5 overexpression triggers precocious trophoblast
      differentiation. Through integration of protein interactome, transcriptome, and
      genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data, we reveal that this
      abundance-dependent function is mediated through a shift in preferred
      Elf5-binding partners; in TSCs, Elf5 interaction with Eomes recruits Tfap2c to
      triply occupied sites at TSC-specific genes, driving their expression. In
      contrast, the Elf5 and Tfap2c interaction becomes predominant as their protein
      levels increase. This triggers binding to double- and single-occupancy sites that
      harbor the cognate Tfap2c motif, causing activation of the associated
      differentiation-promoting genes. These data place Elf5 at the center of a
      stoichiometry-sensitive transcriptional network, where it acts as a molecular
      switch governing the balance between TSC proliferation and differentiation.

AB  - During spinal cord development, ventral neural progenitor cells that express the 
      transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2, called pMN progenitors, produce motor
      neurons and then oligodendrocytes. Whether motor neurons and oligodendrocytes
      arise from common or distinct progenitors in vivo is not known. Using zebrafish, 
      we found that motor neurons and oligodendrocytes are produced sequentially by
      distinct progenitors that have distinct origins. When olig2(+) cells were tracked
      during the peak period of motor neuron formation, most differentiated as motor
      neurons without further cell division. Using time-lapse imaging, we found that,
      as motor neurons differentiated, more dorsally positioned neuroepithelial
      progenitors descended to the pMN domain and initiated olig2 expression.
      Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling during motor neuron differentiation blocked the 
      ventral movement of progenitors, the progressive initiation of olig2 expression, 
      and oligodendrocyte formation. We therefore propose that the motor
      neuron-to-oligodendrocyte switch results from Hedgehog-mediated recruitment of
      glial-fated progenitors to the pMN domain subsequent to neurogenesis.

TI  - Dynamic changes in histone modifications precede de novo DNA methylation in
      oocytes.
PG  - 2449-62
LID - 10.1101/gad.271353.115 [doi]
AB  - Erasure and subsequent reinstatement of DNA methylation in the germline,
      especially at imprinted CpG islands (CGIs), is crucial to embryogenesis in
      mammals. The mechanisms underlying DNA methylation establishment remain poorly
      understood, but a number of post-translational modifications of histones are
      implicated in antagonizing or recruiting the de novo DNA methylation complex. In 
      mouse oogenesis, DNA methylation establishment occurs on a largely unmethylated
      genome and in nondividing cells, making it a highly informative model for
      examining how histone modifications can shape the DNA methylome. Using a
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genome-wide sequencing (ChIP-seq)
      protocol optimized for low cell numbers and novel techniques for isolating
      primary and growing oocytes, profiles were generated for histone modifications
      implicated in promoting or inhibiting DNA methylation. CGIs destined for DNA
      methylation show reduced protective H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) and
      trimethylation (H3K4me3) in both primary and growing oocytes, while permissive
      H3K36me3 increases specifically at these CGIs in growing oocytes. Methylome
      profiling of oocytes deficient in H3K4 demethylase KDM1A or KDM1B indicated that 
      removal of H3K4 methylation is necessary for proper methylation establishment at 
      CGIs. This work represents the first systematic study performing ChIP-seq in
      oocytes and shows that histone remodeling in the mammalian oocyte helps direct de
      novo DNA methylation events.

TI  - High telomerase is a hallmark of undifferentiated spermatogonia and is required
      for maintenance of male germline stem cells.
PG  - 2420-34
LID - 10.1101/gad.271783.115 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase inactivation causes loss of the male germline in worms, fish, and
      mice, indicating a conserved dependence on telomere maintenance in this cell
      lineage. Here, using telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) reporter mice, we
      found that very high telomerase expression is a hallmark of undifferentiated
      spermatogonia, the mitotic population where germline stem cells reside. We
      exploited these high telomerase levels as a basis for purifying undifferentiated 
      spermatogonia using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Telomerase levels in
      undifferentiated spermatogonia and embryonic stem cells are comparable and much
      greater than in somatic progenitor compartments. Within the germline, we
      uncovered an unanticipated gradient of telomerase activity that also enables
      isolation of more mature populations. Transcriptomic comparisons of Tert(High)
      undifferentiated spermatogonia and Tert(Low) differentiated spermatogonia by RNA 
      sequencing reveals marked differences in cell cycle and key molecular features of
      each compartment. Transplantation studies show that germline stem cell activity
      is confined to the Tert(High) cKit(-) population. Telomere shortening in
      telomerase knockout strains causes depletion of undifferentiated spermatogonia
      and eventual loss of all germ cells after undifferentiated spermatogonia drop
      below a critical threshold. These data reveal that high telomerase expression is 
      a fundamental characteristic of germline stem cells, thus explaining the broad
      dependence on telomerase for germline immortality in metazoans.

TI  - Alternate wiring of a KNOXI genetic network underlies differences in leaf
      development of A. thaliana and C. hirsuta.
PG  - 2391-404
LID - 10.1101/gad.269050.115 [doi]
AB  - Two interrelated problems in biology are understanding the regulatory logic and
      predictability of morphological evolution. Here, we studied these problems by
      comparing Arabidopsis thaliana, which has simple leaves, and its relative,
      Cardamine hirsuta, which has dissected leaves comprising leaflets. By
      transferring genes between the two species, we provide evidence for an inverse
      relationship between the pleiotropy of SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and
      BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP) homeobox genes and their ability to modify leaf form. We
      further show that cis-regulatory divergence of BP results in two alternative
      configurations of the genetic networks controlling leaf development. In C.
      hirsuta, ChBP is repressed by the microRNA164A (MIR164A)/ChCUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON
      (ChCUC) module and ChASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (ChAS1), thus creating cross-talk between
      MIR164A/CUC and AS1 that does not occur in A. thaliana. These different genetic
      architectures lead to divergent interactions of network components and growth
      regulation in each species. We suggest that certain regulatory genes with low
      pleiotropy are predisposed to readily integrate into or disengage from conserved 
      genetic networks influencing organ geometry, thus rapidly altering their
      properties and contributing to morphological divergence.

TI  - Context-dependent modulation of Pol II CTD phosphatase SSUP-72 regulates
      alternative polyadenylation in neuronal development.
PG  - 2377-90
LID - 10.1101/gad.266650.115 [doi]
AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is widespread in neuronal development and
      activity-mediated neural plasticity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
      are largely unknown. We used systematic genetic studies and genome-wide surveys
      of the transcriptional landscape to identify a context-dependent regulatory
      pathway controlling APA in the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system. Loss of
      function in ssup-72, a Ser5 phosphatase for the RNA polymerase II (Pol II)
      C-terminal domain (CTD), dampens transcription termination at a strong intronic
      polyadenylation site (PAS) in unc-44/ankyrin yet promotes termination at the weak
      intronic PAS of the MAP kinase dlk-1. A nuclear protein, SYDN-1, which regulates 
      neuronal development, antagonizes the function of SSUP-72 and several nuclear
      polyadenylation factors. This regulatory pathway allows the production of a
      neuron-specific isoform of unc-44 and an inhibitory isoform of dlk-1.
      Dysregulation of the unc-44 and dlk-1 mRNA isoforms in sydn-1 mutants impairs
      neuronal development. Deleting the intronic PAS of unc-44 results in increased
      pre-mRNA processing of neuronal ankyrin and suppresses sydn-1 mutants. These
      results reveal a mechanism by which regulation of CTD phosphorylation controls
      coding region APA in the nervous system.

TI  - NLK phosphorylates Raptor to mediate stress-induced mTORC1 inhibition.
PG  - 2362-76
LID - 10.1101/gad.265116.115 [doi]
AB  - The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central cell growth controller
      and forms two distinct complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 integrates a wide
      range of upstream signals, both positive and negative, to regulate cell growth.
      Although mTORC1 activation by positive signals, such as growth factors and
      nutrients, has been extensively investigated, the mechanism of mTORC1 regulation 
      by stress signals is less understood. In this study, we identified the Nemo-like 
      kinase (NLK) as an mTORC1 regulator in mediating the osmotic and oxidative stress
      signals. NLK inhibits mTORC1 lysosomal localization and thereby suppresses mTORC1
      activation. Mechanistically, NLK phosphorylates Raptor on S863 to disrupt its
      interaction with the Rag GTPase, which is important for mTORC1 lysosomal
      recruitment. Cells with Nlk deletion or knock-in of the Raptor S863
      phosphorylation mutants are defective in the rapid mTORC1 inhibition upon osmotic
      stress. Our study reveals a function of NLK in stress-induced mTORC1 modulation
      and the underlying biochemical mechanism of NLK in mTORC1 inhibition in stress
      response.

PG  - 2325-30
LID - 10.1101/gad.268185.115 [doi]
AB  - p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now
      report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in
      nontransformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases
      its association with the p52 NF-kappaB subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53's 
      conformation and transcriptional output toward a state resembling
      cancer-associated p53 mutants and endows p53 with the ability to promote cell
      migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently down-regulated in breast
      cancer; we propose that such down-regulation might benefit cancer by converting
      p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tumor facilitator.

      methyltransferase 1.
PG  - 2343-8
LID - 10.1101/gad.270611.115 [doi]
AB  - alpha-N-terminal methylation represents a highly conserved and prevalent
      post-translational modification, yet its biological function has remained largely
      speculative. The recent discovery of alpha-N-terminal methyltransferase 1 (NTMT1)
      and its physiological substrates propels the elucidation of a general role of
      alpha-N-terminal methylation in mediating DNA-binding ability of the modified
      proteins. The phenotypes, observed from both NTMT1 knockdown in breast cancer
      cell lines and knockout mouse models, suggest the potential involvement of
      alpha-N-terminal methylation in DNA damage response and cancer development. In
      this study, we report the first crystal structures of human NTMT1 in complex with
      cofactor S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and six substrate peptides,
      respectively, and reveal that NTMT1 contains two characteristic structural
      elements (a beta hairpin and an N-terminal extension) that contribute to its
      substrate specificity. Our complex structures, coupled with mutagenesis, binding,
      and enzymatic studies, also present the key elements involved in locking the
      consensus substrate motif XPK (X indicates any residue type other than D/E) into 
      the catalytic pocket for alpha-N-terminal methylation and explain why NTMT1
      prefers an XPK sequence motif. We propose a catalytic mechanism for
      alpha-N-terminal methylation. Overall, this study gives us the first glimpse of
      the molecular mechanism of alpha-N-terminal methylation and potentially
      contributes to the advent of therapeutic agents for human diseases associated
      with deregulated alpha-N-terminal methylation.

LID - 10.1101/gad.269324.115 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian cells possess two amino acid-sensing kinases: general control
      nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1).
      Their combined effects orchestrate cellular adaptation to amino acid levels, but 
      how their activities are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we
      demonstrate an important link between GCN2 and mTORC1 signaling. Upon deprivation
      of various amino acids, activated GCN2 up-regulates ATF4 to induce expression of 
      the stress response protein Sestrin2, which is required to sustain repression of 
      mTORC1 by blocking its lysosomal localization. Moreover, Sestrin2 induction is
      necessary for cell survival during glutamine deprivation, indicating that
      Sestrin2 is a critical effector of GCN2 signaling that regulates amino acid
      homeostasis through mTORC1 suppression.

      Key substrate recognition and catalytic residues were identified by mutagenesis
      studies. Histone peptide profiling revealed that human NRMT1 is highly selective 
      to human CENP-A and fruit fly H2B, which share a common "Xaa-Pro-Lys/Arg" motif. 
      These results, along with a 1.5 A costructure of human NRMT1 bound to the fruit
      fly H2B peptide, underscore the importance of the NRMT1 recognition motif.

AB  - The apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) controls the onset of many
      known forms of intrinsic apoptosis in mammals. Apaf-1 exists in normal cells as
      an autoinhibited monomer. Upon binding to cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1
      oligomerizes into a heptameric complex known as the apoptosome, which recruits
      and activates cell-killing caspases. Here we present an atomic structure of an
      intact mammalian apoptosome at 3.8 A resolution, determined by single-particle,
      cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural analysis, together with
      structure-guided biochemical characterization, uncovered how cytochrome c
      releases the autoinhibition of Apaf-1 through specific interactions with the WD40
      repeats. Structural comparison with autoinhibited Apaf-1 revealed how dATP
      binding triggers a set of conformational changes that results in the formation of
      the apoptosome. Together, these results constitute the molecular mechanism of
      cytochrome c- and dATP-mediated activation of Apaf-1.

AB  - Postnatal spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) progress through proliferative and
      developmental stages to populate the testicular niche prior to productive
      spermatogenesis. To better understand, we conducted extensive genomic profiling
      at multiple postnatal stages on subpopulations enriched for particular markers
      (THY1, KIT, OCT4, ID4, or GFRa1). Overall, our profiles suggest three broad
      populations of spermatogonia in juveniles: (1) epithelial-like spermatogonia
      (THY1(+); high OCT4, ID4, and GFRa1), (2) more abundant mesenchymal-like
      spermatogonia (THY1(+); moderate OCT4 and ID4; high mesenchymal markers), and (3)
      (in older juveniles) abundant spermatogonia committing to gametogenesis (high
      KIT(+)). Epithelial-like spermatogonia displayed the expected imprinting
      patterns, but, surprisingly, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia lacked imprinting
      specifically at paternally imprinted loci but fully restored imprinting prior to 
      puberty. Furthermore, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia also displayed
      developmentally linked DNA demethylation at meiotic genes and also at certain
      monoallelic neural genes (e.g., protocadherins and olfactory receptors). We also 
      reveal novel candidate receptor-ligand networks involving SSCs and the developing
      niche. Taken together, neonates/juveniles contain heterogeneous epithelial-like
      or mesenchymal-like spermatogonial populations, with the latter displaying
      extensive DNA methylation/chromatin dynamics. We speculate that this plasticity
      helps SSCs proliferate and migrate within the developing seminiferous tubule,
      with proper niche interaction and membrane attachment reverting mesenchymal-like 
      spermatogonial subtype cells back to an epithelial-like state with normal
      imprinting profiles.

LID - 10.1101/gad.268847.115 [doi]
AB  - Splicing of the Drosophila P-element third intron (IVS3) is repressed in somatic 
      tissues due to the function of an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) complex present 
      on the 5' exon RNA. To comprehensively characterize the mechanisms of this
      alternative splicing regulation, we used biochemical fractionation and affinity
      purification to isolate the silencer complex assembled in vitro and identify the 
      constituent proteins by mass spectrometry. Functional assays using splicing
      reporter minigenes identified the proteins hrp36 and hrp38 and the cytoplasmic
      poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 as novel functional components of the splicing
      silencer. hrp48, PSI, and PABPC1 have high-affinity RNA-binding sites on the
      P-element IVS3 5' exon, whereas hrp36 and hrp38 proteins bind with low affinity
      to the P-element silencer RNA. RNA pull-down and immobilized protein assays
      showed that hrp48 protein binding to the silencer RNA can recruit hrp36 and
      hrp38. These studies identified additional components that function at the
      P-element ESS and indicated that proteins with low-affinity RNA-binding sites can
      be recruited in a functional manner through interactions with a protein bound to 
      RNA at a high-affinity binding site. These studies have implications for the role
      of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) in the control of
      alternative splicing at cis-acting regulatory sites.

PG  - 2287-97
LID - 10.1101/gad.267609.115 [doi]
AB  - The host chromatin-binding factor LEDGF/p75 interacts with HIV-1 integrase and
      directs integration to active transcription units. To understand how LEDGF/p75
      recognizes transcription units, we sequenced 1 million HIV-1 integration sites
      isolated from cultured HEK293T cells. Analysis of integration sites showed that
      cancer genes were preferentially targeted, raising concerns about using
      lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. Additional analysis led to the discovery
      that introns and alternative splicing contributed significantly to integration
      site selection. These correlations were independent of transcription levels, size
      of transcription units, and length of the introns. Multivariate analysis with
      five parameters previously found to predict integration sites showed that intron 
      density is the strongest predictor of integration density in transcription units.
      Analysis of previously published HIV-1 integration site data showed that
      integration density in transcription units in mouse embryonic fibroblasts also
      correlated strongly with intron number, and this correlation was absent in cells 
      lacking LEDGF. Affinity purification showed that LEDGF/p75 is associated with a
      number of splicing factors, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of HEK293T
      cells lacking LEDGF/p75 or the LEDGF/p75 integrase-binding domain (IBD) showed
      that LEDGF/p75 contributes to splicing patterns in half of the transcription
      units that have alternative isoforms. Thus, LEDGF/p75 interacts with splicing
      factors, contributes to exon choice, and directs HIV-1 integration to
      transcription units that are highly spliced.

TI  - The bacterial cell cycle regulator GcrA is a sigma70 cofactor that drives gene
      expression from a subset of methylated promoters.

LID - 10.1101/gad.270660.115 [doi]
AB  - Cell cycle progression in most organisms requires tightly regulated programs of
      gene expression. The transcription factors involved typically stimulate gene
      expression by binding specific DNA sequences in promoters and recruiting RNA
      polymerase. Here, we found that the essential cell cycle regulator GcrA in
      Caulobacter crescentus activates the transcription of target genes in a
      fundamentally different manner. GcrA forms a stable complex with RNA polymerase
      and localizes to almost all active sigma(70)-dependent promoters in vivo but
      activates transcription primarily at promoters harboring certain DNA methylation 
      sites. Whereas most transcription factors that contact sigma(70) interact with
      domain 4, GcrA interfaces with domain 2, the region that binds the -10 element
      during strand separation. Using kinetic analyses and a reconstituted in vitro
      transcription assay, we demonstrated that GcrA can stabilize RNA polymerase
      binding and directly stimulate open complex formation to activate transcription. 
      Guided by these studies, we identified a regulon of approximately 200 genes,
      providing new insight into the essential functions of GcrA. Collectively, our
      work reveals a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation, and we discuss the
      potential benefits of activating transcription by promoting RNA polymerase
      isomerization rather than recruitment exclusively.

TI  - WSB1 promotes tumor metastasis by inducing pVHL degradation.
PG  - 2244-57
LID - 10.1101/gad.268128.115 [doi]
AB  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL is an E3 ligase that targets
      hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Mutation of VHL results in HIF up-regulation
      and contributes to processes related to tumor progression such as invasion,
      metastasis, and angiogenesis. However, very little is known with regard to
      post-transcriptional regulation of pVHL. Here we show that WD repeat and SOCS
      box-containing protein 1 (WSB1) is a negative regulator of pVHL through WSB1's E3
      ligase activity. Mechanistically, WSB1 promotes pVHL ubiquitination and
      proteasomal degradation, thereby stabilizing HIF under both normoxic and hypoxic 
      conditions. As a consequence, WSB1 up-regulates the expression of HIF-1alpha's
      target genes and promotes cancer invasion and metastasis through its effect on
      pVHL. Consistent with this, WSB1 protein level negatively correlates with pVHL
      level and metastasis-free survival in clinical samples. This work reveals a new
      mechanism of pVHL's regulation by which cancer acquires invasiveness and
      metastatic tendency.

TI  - CALML5 is a ZNF750- and TINCR-induced protein that binds stratifin to regulate
      epidermal differentiation.
PG  - 2225-30
LID - 10.1101/gad.267708.115 [doi]
AB  - Outward migration of epidermal progenitors occurs with induction of hundreds of
      differentiation genes, but the identities of all regulators required for this
      process are unknown. We used laser capture microdissection followed by RNA
      sequencing to identify calmodulin-like 5 (CALML5) as the most enriched gene in
      differentiating outer epidermis. CALML5 mRNA was up-regulated by the ZNF750
      transcription factor and then stabilized by the long noncoding RNA TINCR. CALML5 
      knockout impaired differentiation, abolished keratohyalin granules, and disrupted
      epidermal barrier function. Mass spectrometry identified SFN
      (stratifin/14-3-3sigma) as a CALML5-binding protein. CALML5 interacts with SFN in
      suprabasal epidermis, cocontrols 13% of late differentiation genes, and modulates
      interaction of SFN to some of its binding partners. A ZNF750-TINCR-CALML5-SFN
      network is thus essential for epidermal differentiation.

      expression in multiple cancers.

LID - 10.1101/gad.269498.115 [doi]
AB  - Somatic mutations in the promoter of the gene for telomerase reverse
      transcriptase (TERT) are the most common noncoding mutations in cancer. They are 
      thought to activate telomerase, contributing to proliferative immortality, but
      the molecular events driving TERT activation are largely unknown. We observed in 
      multiple cancer cell lines that mutant TERT promoters exhibit the H3K4me2/3 mark 
      of active chromatin and recruit the GABPA/B1 transcription factor, while the
      wild-type allele retains the H3K27me3 mark of epigenetic silencing; only the
      mutant promoters are transcriptionally active. These results suggest how a
      single-base-pair mutation can cause a dramatic epigenetic switch and monoallelic 
      expression.

TI  - A chromatin-independent role of Polycomb-like 1 to stabilize p53 and promote
      cellular quiescence.
PG  - 2231-43
LID - 10.1101/gad.267930.115 [doi]
AB  - Polycomb-like proteins 1-3 (PCL1-3) are substoichiometric components of the
      Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that are essential for association of the
      complex with chromatin. However, it remains unclear why three proteins with such 
      apparent functional redundancy exist in mammals. Here we characterize their
      divergent roles in both positively and negatively regulating cellular
      proliferation. We show that while PCL2 and PCL3 are E2F-regulated genes expressed
      in proliferating cells, PCL1 is a p53 target gene predominantly expressed in
      quiescent cells. Ectopic expression of any PCL protein recruits PRC2 to repress
      the INK4A gene; however, only PCL2 and PCL3 confer an INK4A-dependent
      proliferative advantage. Remarkably, PCL1 has evolved a PRC2- and
      chromatin-independent function to negatively regulate proliferation. We show that
      PCL1 binds to and stabilizes p53 to induce cellular quiescence. Moreover,
      depletion of PCL1 phenocopies the defects in maintaining cellular quiescence
      associated with p53 loss. This newly evolved function is achieved by the binding 
      of the PCL1 N-terminal PHD domain to the C-terminal domain of p53 through two
      unique serine residues, which were acquired during recent vertebrate evolution.
      This study illustrates the functional bifurcation of PCL proteins, which act in
      both a chromatin-dependent and a chromatin-independent manner to regulate the
      INK4A and p53 pathways.

TI  - Silencio/CG9754 connects the Piwi-piRNA complex to the cellular heterochromatin
      machinery.
PG  - 2258-71
LID - 10.1101/gad.271908.115 [doi]
AB  - The repression of transposable elements in eukaryotes often involves their
      transcriptional silencing via targeted chromatin modifications. In animal gonads,
      nuclear Argonaute proteins of the PIWI clade complexed with small guide RNAs
      (piRNAs) serve as sequence specificity determinants in this process. How binding 
      of nuclear PIWI-piRNA complexes to nascent transcripts orchestrates
      heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing is unknown. Here, we
      characterize CG9754/Silencio as an essential piRNA pathway factor that is
      required for Piwi-mediated transcriptional silencing in Drosophila. Ectopic
      targeting of Silencio to RNA or DNA is sufficient to elicit silencing
      independently of Piwi and known piRNA pathway factors. Instead, Silencio requires
      the H3K9 methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 for its silencing ability. In agreement
      with this, SetDB1, but not Su(var)3-9, is required for Piwi-mediated
      transcriptional silencing genome-wide. Due to its interaction with the
      target-engaged Piwi-piRNA complex, we suggest that Silencio acts as linker
      between the sequence specificity factor Piwi and the cellular heterochromatin
      machinery.

TI  - Feedback control of growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis of pancreatic
      endocrine progenitors in an epithelial plexus niche.
PG  - 2203-16
LID - 10.1101/gad.267914.115 [doi]
AB  - In the mammalian pancreas, endocrine cells undergo lineage allocation upon
      emergence from a bipotent duct/endocrine progenitor pool, which resides in the
      "trunk epithelium." Major questions remain regarding how niche environments are
      organized within this epithelium to coordinate endocrine differentiation with
      programs of epithelial growth, maturation, and morphogenesis. We used EdU
      pulse-chase and tissue-reconstruction approaches to analyze how endocrine
      progenitors and their differentiating progeny are assembled within the trunk as
      it undergoes remodeling from an irregular plexus of tubules to form the eventual 
      mature, branched ductal arbor. The bulk of endocrine progenitors is maintained in
      an epithelial "plexus state," which is a transient intermediate during epithelial
      maturation within which endocrine cell differentiation is continually robust and 
      surprisingly long-lived. Within the plexus, local feedback effects derived from
      the differentiating and delaminating endocrine cells nonautonomously regulate the
      flux of endocrine cell birth as well as proliferative growth of the bipotent cell
      population using Notch-dependent and Notch-independent influences, respectively. 
      These feedback effects in turn maintain the plexus state to ensure prolonged
      allocation of endocrine cells late into gestation. These findings begin to define
      a niche-like environment guiding the genesis of the endocrine pancreas and
      advance current models for how differentiation is coordinated with the growth and
      morphogenesis of the developing pancreatic epithelium.

TI  - DNA methylation epigenetically silences crossover hot spots and controls
      chromosomal domains of meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2183-202
LID - 10.1101/gad.270876.115 [doi]
AB  - During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo crossover recombination, which is 
      typically concentrated in narrow hot spots that are controlled by genetic and
      epigenetic information. Arabidopsis chromosomes are highly DNA methylated in the 
      repetitive centromeres, which are also crossover-suppressed. Here we demonstrate 
      that RNA-directed DNA methylation is sufficient to locally silence Arabidopsis
      euchromatic crossover hot spots and is associated with increased nucleosome
      density and H3K9me2. However, loss of CG DNA methylation maintenance in met1
      triggers epigenetic crossover remodeling at the chromosome scale, with
      pericentromeric decreases and euchromatic increases in recombination. We used
      recombination mutants that alter interfering and noninterfering crossover repair 
      pathways (fancm and zip4) to demonstrate that remodeling primarily involves
      redistribution of interfering crossovers. Using whole-genome bisulfite
      sequencing, we show that crossover remodeling is driven by loss of CG methylation
      within the centromeric regions. Using cytogenetics, we profiled meiotic DNA
      double-strand break (DSB) foci in met1 and found them unchanged relative to wild 
      type. We propose that met1 chromosome structure is altered, causing
      centromere-proximal DSBs to be inhibited from maturation into interfering
      crossovers. These data demonstrate that DNA methylation is sufficient to silence 
      crossover hot spots and plays a key role in establishing domains of meiotic
      recombination along chromosomes.

TI  - Ctr9, a key subunit of PAFc, affects global estrogen signaling and drives
      ERalpha-positive breast tumorigenesis.

AB  - The human RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated factor complex (hPAFc) and its
      individual subunits have been implicated in human diseases, including cancer.
      However, its involvement in breast cancer awaits investigation. Using data mining
      and human breast cancer tissue microarrays, we found that Ctr9, the key scaffold 
      subunit in hPAFc, is highly expressed in estrogen receptor alpha-positive
      (ERalpha(+)) luminal breast cancer, and the high expression of Ctr9 correlates
      with poor prognosis. Knockdown of Ctr9 in ERalpha(+) breast cancer cells almost
      completely erased estrogen-regulated transcriptional response. At the molecular
      level, Ctr9 enhances ERalpha protein stability, promotes recruitment of ERalpha
      and RNAPII, and stimulates transcription elongation and transcription-coupled
      histone modifications. Knockdown of Ctr9, but not other hPAFc subunits, alters
      the morphology, proliferative capacity, and tamoxifen sensitivity of ERalpha(+)
      breast cancer cells. Together, our study reveals that Ctr9, a key subunit of
      hPAFc, is a central regulator of estrogen signaling that drives ERalpha(+) breast
      tumorigenesis, rendering it a potential target for the treatment of ERalpha(+)
      breast cancer.

TI  - Constitutive BAK activation as a determinant of drug sensitivity in malignant
      lymphohematopoietic cells.
PG  - 2140-52
LID - 10.1101/gad.267997.115 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a key step in the intrinsic
      apoptotic pathway, is incompletely understood. Current models emphasize the role 
      of BH3-only BCL2 family members in BAX and BAK activation. Here we demonstrate
      concentration-dependent BAK autoactivation under cell-free conditions and provide
      evidence that this autoactivation plays a key role in regulating the intrinsic
      apoptotic pathway in intact cells. In particular, we show that up to 80% of BAK
      (but not BAX) in lymphohematopoietic cell lines is oligomerized and bound to
      anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members in the absence of exogenous death stimuli. The
      extent of this constitutive BAK oligomerization is diminished by BAK knockdown
      and unaffected by BIM or PUMA down-regulation. Further analysis indicates that
      sensitivity of cells to BH3 mimetics reflects the identity of the anti-apoptotic 
      proteins to which BAK is constitutively bound, with extensive BCLXL*BAK complexes
      predicting navitoclax sensitivity, and extensive MCL1*BAK complexes predicting
      A1210477 sensitivity. Moreover, high BAK expression correlates with sensitivity
      of clinical acute myelogenous leukemia to chemotherapy, whereas low BAK levels
      correlate with resistance and relapse. Collectively, these results inform current
      understanding of MOMP and provide new insight into the ability of BH3 mimetics to
      induce apoptosis without directly activating BAX or BAK.

AB  - RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (formerly AML1-ETO), a transcription factor generated by the
      t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), dictates a leukemic
      program by increasing self-renewal and inhibiting differentiation. Here we
      demonstrate that the histone demethylase JMJD1C functions as a coactivator for
      RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and is required for its transcriptional program. JMJD1C is directly
      recruited by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 to its target genes and regulates their expression by 
      maintaining low H3K9 dimethyl (H3K9me2) levels. Analyses in JMJD1C knockout mice 
      also establish a JMJD1C requirement for RUNX1-RUNX1T1's ability to increase
      proliferation. We also show a critical role for JMJD1C in the survival of
      multiple human AML cell lines, suggesting that it is required for leukemic
      programs in different AML cell types through its association with key
      transcription factors.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks controlling functional activities of spatially and
      temporally distinct endodermal cell populations in the early mouse embryo remain 
      ill defined. The T-box transcription factor Eomes, acting downstream from
      Nodal/Smad signals, directly activates the LIM domain homeobox transcription
      factor Lhx1 in the visceral endoderm. Here we demonstrate Smad4/Eomes-dependent
      Lhx1 expression in the epiblast marks the entire definitive endoderm lineage, the
      anterior mesendoderm, and midline progenitors. Conditional inactivation of Lhx1
      disrupts anterior definitive endoderm development and impedes node and midline
      morphogenesis in part due to severe disturbances in visceral endoderm
      displacement. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation [ChIP] followed by high-throughput sequencing) experiments
      identified Lhx1 target genes, including numerous anterior definitive endoderm
      markers and components of the Wnt signaling pathway. Interestingly, Lhx1-binding 
      sites were enriched at enhancers, including the Nodal-proximal epiblast enhancer 
      element and enhancer regions controlling Otx2 and Foxa2 expression. Moreover, in 
      proteomic experiments, we characterized a complex comprised of Lhx1, Otx2, and
      Foxa2 as well as the chromatin-looping protein Ldb1. These partnerships
      cooperatively regulate development of the anterior mesendoderm, node, and midline
      cell populations responsible for establishment of the left-right body axis and
      head formation.

AB  - Regenerative medicine aims to restore normal tissue architecture and function.
      However, the basis of tissue regeneration in mammalian solid organs remains
      undefined. Remarkably, mice lacking p21 fully regenerate injured ears without
      discernable scarring. Here we show that, in wild-type mice following tissue
      injury, stromal-derived factor-1 (Sdf1) is up-regulated in the wound epidermis
      and recruits Cxcr4-expressing leukocytes to the injury site. In p21-deficient
      mice, Sdf1 up-regulation and the subsequent recruitment of Cxcr4-expressing
      leukocytes are significantly diminished, thereby permitting scarless appendage
      regeneration. Lineage tracing demonstrates that this regeneration derives from
      fate-restricted progenitor cells. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of
      Sdf1-Cxcr4 signaling enhances tissue repair, including full reconstitution of
      tissue architecture and all cell types. Our findings identify signaling and
      cellular mechanisms underlying appendage regeneration in mice and suggest new
      therapeutic approaches for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Mutations in the transcription factor Forkhead box p1 (FOXP1) are causative for
      neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. However, the function of FOXP1
      within the brain remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we identify the gene
      expression program regulated by FoxP1 in both human neural cells and
      patient-relevant heterozygous Foxp1 mouse brains. We demonstrate a role for FoxP1
      in the transcriptional regulation of autism-related pathways as well as genes
      involved in neuronal activity. We show that Foxp1 regulates the excitability of
      striatal medium spiny neurons and that reduction of Foxp1 correlates with defects
      in ultrasonic vocalizations. Finally, we demonstrate that FoxP1 has an
      evolutionarily conserved role in regulating pathways involved in striatal neuron 
      identity through gene expression studies in human neural progenitors with altered
      FOXP1 levels. These data support an integral role for FoxP1 in regulating
      signaling pathways vulnerable in autism and the specific regulation of striatal
      pathways important for vocal communication.

PG  - 2168-82
LID - 10.1101/gad.270421.115 [doi]
AB  - Thousands of eukaryotic protein-coding genes are noncanonically spliced to
      produce circular RNAs. Bioinformatics has indicated that long introns generally
      flank exons that circularize in Drosophila, but the underlying mechanisms by
      which these circular RNAs are generated are largely unknown. Here, using
      extensive mutagenesis of expression plasmids and RNAi screening, we reveal that
      circularization of the Drosophila laccase2 gene is regulated by both intronic
      repeats and trans-acting splicing factors. Analogous to what has been observed in
      humans and mice, base-pairing between highly complementary transposable elements 
      facilitates backsplicing. Long flanking repeats ( approximately 400 nucleotides
      [nt]) promote circularization cotranscriptionally, whereas pre-mRNAs containing
      minimal repeats (<40 nt) generate circular RNAs predominately after 3' end
      processing. Unlike the previously characterized Muscleblind (Mbl) circular RNA,
      which requires the Mbl protein for its biogenesis, we found that Laccase2
      circular RNA levels are not controlled by Mbl or the Laccase2 gene product but
      rather by multiple hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) and SR
      (serine-arginine) proteins acting in a combinatorial manner. hnRNP and SR
      proteins also regulate the expression of other Drosophila circular RNAs,
      including Plexin A (PlexA), suggesting a common strategy for regulating
      backsplicing. Furthermore, the laccase2 flanking introns support efficient
      circularization of diverse exons in Drosophila and human cells, providing a new
      tool for exploring the functional consequences of circular RNA expression across 
      eukaryotes.

      promotes recombination at sites of stalled replication.
PG  - 2067-80
LID - 10.1101/gad.265629.115 [doi]
AB  - Accurate completion of replication relies on the ability of cells to activate
      error-free recombination-mediated DNA damage bypass at sites of perturbed
      replication. However, as anti-recombinase activities are also recruited to
      replication forks, how recombination-mediated damage bypass is enabled at
      replication stress sites remained puzzling. Here we uncovered that the conserved 
      SUMO-like domain-containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Esc2 facilitates
      recombination-mediated DNA damage tolerance by allowing optimal recruitment of
      the Rad51 recombinase specifically at sites of perturbed replication.
      Mechanistically, Esc2 binds stalled replication forks and counteracts the
      anti-recombinase Srs2 helicase via a two-faceted mechanism involving chromatin
      recruitment and turnover of Srs2. Importantly, point mutations in the SUMO-like
      domains of Esc2 that reduce its interaction with Srs2 cause suboptimal levels of 
      Rad51 recruitment at damaged replication forks. In conclusion, our results reveal
      how recombination-mediated DNA damage tolerance is locally enabled at sites of
      replication stress and globally prevented at undamaged replicating chromosomes.

TI  - Widespread JNK-dependent alternative splicing induces a positive feedback loop
      through CELF2-mediated regulation of MKK7 during T-cell activation.
PG  - 2054-66
LID - 10.1101/gad.267245.115 [doi]
AB  - Alternative splicing is prevalent among genes encoding signaling molecules;
      however, the functional consequence of differential isoform expression remains
      largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that, in response to T-cell activation, the 
      Jun kinase (JNK) kinase MAP kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is alternatively spliced to
      favor an isoform that lacks exon 2. This isoform restores a JNK-docking site
      within MKK7 that is disrupted in the larger isoform. Consistently, we show that
      skipping of MKK7 exon 2 enhances JNK pathway activity, as indicated by c-Jun
      phosphorylation and up-regulation of TNF-alpha. Moreover, this splicing event is 
      itself dependent on JNK signaling. Thus, MKK7 alternative splicing represents a
      positive feedback loop through which JNK promotes its own signaling. We further
      show that repression of MKK7 exon 2 is dependent on the presence of flanking
      sequences and the JNK-induced expression of the RNA-binding protein CELF2, which 
      binds to these regulatory elements. Finally, we found that approximately 25% of
      T-cell receptor-mediated alternative splicing events are dependent on JNK
      signaling. Strikingly, these JNK-dependent events are also significantly enriched
      for responsiveness to CELF2. Together, our data demonstrate a widespread role for
      the JNK-CELF2 axis in controlling splicing during T-cell activation, including a 
      specific role in propagating JNK signaling.

LID - 10.1101/gad.263939.115 [doi]
AB  - Lamina-associated polypeptide 2alpha (LAP2alpha) localizes throughout the
      nucleoplasm and interacts with the fraction of lamins A/C that is not associated 
      with the peripheral nuclear lamina. The LAP2alpha-lamin A/C complex negatively
      affects cell proliferation. Lamins A/C are encoded by LMNA, a single heterozygous
      mutation of which causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). This
      mutation generates the lamin A variant progerin, which we show here leads to loss
      of LAP2alpha and nucleoplasmic lamins A/C, impaired proliferation, and
      down-regulation of extracellular matrix components. Surprisingly, contrary to
      wild-type cells, ectopic expression of LAP2alpha in cells expressing progerin
      restores proliferation and extracellular matrix expression but not the levels of 
      nucleoplasmic lamins A/C. We conclude that, in addition to its cell
      cycle-inhibiting function with lamins A/C, LAP2alpha can also regulate
      extracellular matrix components independently of lamins A/C, which may help
      explain the proliferation-promoting function of LAP2alpha in cells expressing
      progerin.

      cells.
PG  - 2004-9
LID - 10.1101/gad.267112.115 [doi]
AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play integral roles in gene regulation, yet only a
      small fraction of RBPs has been studied in the context of stem cells. Here we
      applied an RNAi screen for RBPs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and
      identified 16 RBPs involved in pluripotency maintenance. Interestingly, six
      identified RBPs, including Krr1 and Ddx47, are part of a complex called small
      subunit processome (SSUP) that mediates 18S rRNA biogenesis. The SSUP components 
      are preferentially expressed in stem cells and enhance the global translational
      rate, which is critical to sustain the protein levels of labile pluripotency
      factors such as Nanog and Esrrb. Furthermore, the SSUP proteins are required for 
      efficient reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells. Our study uncovers the
      role of the SSUP and the importance of translational control in stem cell fate
      decision.

PG  - 1998-2003
LID - 10.1101/gad.266486.115 [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate that the Y3/Y3** noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) bind to the CPSF
      (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and that Y3** associates with
      the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of histone pre-mRNAs. The depletion of Y3**
      impairs the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNAs as well as the formation and
      protein dynamics of histone locus bodies (HLBs), the site of histone mRNA
      synthesis and processing. HLB morphology is also disturbed by knockdown of the
      CPSF but not the U7-snRNP components. In conclusion, we propose that the Y3**
      ncRNA promotes the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNAs by enhancing the
      recruitment of the CPSF to histone pre-mRNAs at HLBs.

TI  - Dynamic enhancer-gene body contacts during transcription elongation.
PG  - 1992-7
LID - 10.1101/gad.255265.114 [doi]
AB  - Enhancers govern transcription through multiple mechanisms, including the
      regulation of elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We characterized the
      dynamics of looped enhancer contacts during synchronous transcription elongation.
      We found that many distal enhancers form stable contacts with their target
      promoters during the entire interval of elongation. Notably, we detected
      additional dynamic enhancer contacts throughout the gene bodies that track with
      elongating RNAPII and the leading edge of RNA synthesis. These results support a 
      model in which the gene body changes its position relative to a stable
      enhancer-promoter complex, which has broad ramifications for enhancer function
      and architectural models of transcriptional elongation.

AB  - The mitochondrion is a complex organelle that serves essential roles in energy
      transduction, ATP production, and a myriad of cellular signaling events. A finely
      tuned regulatory network orchestrates the biogenesis, maintenance, and turnover
      of mitochondria. The high-capacity mitochondrial system in the heart is regulated
      in a dynamic way to generate and consume enormous amounts of ATP in order to
      support the constant pumping function in the context of changing energy demands. 
      This review describes the regulatory circuitry and downstream events involved in 
      mitochondrial biogenesis and its coordination with mitochondrial dynamics in
      developing and diseased hearts.

AB  - We adapted UV CLIP (cross-linking immunoprecipitation) to accurately locate tens 
      of thousands of m(6)A residues in mammalian mRNA with single-nucleotide
      resolution. More than 70% of these residues are present in the 3'-most (last)
      exons, with a very sharp rise (sixfold) within 150-400 nucleotides of the start
      of the last exon. Two-thirds of last exon m(6)A and >40% of all m(6)A in mRNA are
      present in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs); contrary to earlier suggestions, there
      is no preference for location of m(6)A sites around stop codons. Moreover, m(6)A 
      is significantly higher in noncoding last exons than in next-to-last exons
      harboring stop codons. We found that m(6)A density peaks early in the 3' UTR and 
      that, among transcripts with alternative polyA (APA) usage in both the brain and 
      the liver, brain transcripts preferentially use distal polyA sites, as reported, 
      and also show higher proximal m(6)A density in the last exons. Furthermore, when 
      we reduced m6A methylation by knocking down components of the methylase complex
      and then examined 661 transcripts with proximal m6A peaks in last exons, we
      identified a set of 111 transcripts with altered (approximately two-thirds
      increased proximal) APA use. Taken together, these observations suggest a role of
      m(6)A modification in regulating proximal alternative polyA choice.

PG  - 2010-21
LID - 10.1101/gad.269118.115 [doi]
AB  - An unbalanced karyotype, a condition known as aneuploidy, has a profound impact
      on cellular physiology and is a hallmark of cancer. Aneuploid cells experience a 
      number of stresses that are caused by aneuploidy-induced proteomic changes. How
      the aneuploidy-associated stresses affect cells and whether cells respond to them
      are only beginning to be understood. Here we show that autophagosomal cargo such 
      as protein aggregates accumulate within lysosomes in aneuploid cells. This causes
      a lysosomal stress response. Aneuploid cells activate the transcription factor
      TFEB, a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomal gene expression, thereby
      increasing the expression of genes needed for autophagy-mediated protein
      degradation. Accumulation of autophagic cargo within the lysosome and activation 
      of TFEB-responsive genes are also observed in cells in which proteasome function 
      is inhibited, suggesting that proteotoxic stress causes TFEB activation. Our
      results reveal a TFEB-mediated lysosomal stress response as a universal feature
      of the aneuploid state.

      double-strand break formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 1969-79
LID - 10.1101/gad.266056.115 [doi]
AB  - The Caenorhabditis elegans gene rec-1 was the first genetic locus identified in
      metazoa to affect the distribution of meiotic crossovers along the chromosome. We
      report that rec-1 encodes a distant paralog of HIM-5, which was discovered by
      whole-genome sequencing and confirmed by multiple genome-edited alleles. REC-1 is
      phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in vitro, and mutation of the CDK
      consensus sites in REC-1 compromises meiotic crossover distribution in vivo.
      Unexpectedly, rec-1; him-5 double mutants are synthetic-lethal due to a defect in
      meiotic double-strand break formation. Thus, we uncovered an unexpected
      robustness to meiotic DSB formation and crossover positioning that is executed by
      HIM-5 and REC-1 and regulated by phosphorylation.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of ribosomal protein gene coregulation.
PG  - 1942-54
LID - 10.1101/gad.268896.115 [doi]
AB  - The 137 ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) of Saccharomyces provide a model for gene 
      coregulation. We examined the positional and functional organization of their
      regulators (Rap1 [repressor activator protein 1], Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1),
      the transcription machinery (TFIIB, TFIID, and RNA polymerase II), and chromatin 
      at near-base-pair resolution using ChIP-exo, as RPGs are coordinately
      reprogrammed. Where Hmo1 is enriched, Fhl1, Ifh1, Sfp1, and Hmo1 cross-linked
      broadly to promoter DNA in an RPG-specific manner and demarcated by general minor
      groove widening. Importantly, Hmo1 extended 20-50 base pairs (bp) downstream from
      Fhl1. Upon RPG repression, Fhl1 remained in place. Hmo1 dissociated, which was
      coupled to an upstream shift of the +1 nucleosome, as reflected by the Hmo1
      extension and core promoter region. Fhl1 and Hmo1 may create two regulatable and 
      positionally distinct barriers, against which chromatin remodelers position the
      +1 nucleosome into either an activating or a repressive state. Consistent with in
      vitro studies, we found that specific TFIID subunits, in addition to
      cross-linking at the core promoter, made precise cross-links at Rap1 sites, which
      we interpret to reflect native Rap1-TFIID interactions. Our findings suggest how 
      sequence-specific DNA binding regulates nucleosome positioning and transcription 
      complex assembly >300 bp away and how coregulation coevolved with coding
      sequences.

TI  - A monoallelic-to-biallelic T-cell transcriptional switch regulates GATA3
      abundance.
PG  - 1930-41
LID - 10.1101/gad.265025.115 [doi]
AB  - Protein abundance must be precisely regulated throughout life, and nowhere is the
      stringency of this requirement more evident than during T-cell development: A
      twofold increase in the abundance of transcription factor GATA3 results in thymic
      lymphoma, while reduced GATA3 leads to diminished T-cell production. GATA3
      haploinsufficiency also causes human HDR (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal
      dysplasia) syndrome, often accompanied by immunodeficiency. Here we show that
      loss of one Gata3 allele leads to diminished expansion (and compromised
      development) of immature T cells as well as aberrant induction of myeloid
      transcription factor PU.1. This effect is at least in part mediated
      transcriptionally: We discovered that Gata3 is monoallelically expressed in a
      parent of origin-independent manner in hematopoietic stem cells and early T-cell 
      progenitors. Curiously, half of the developing cells switch to biallelic Gata3
      transcription abruptly at midthymopoiesis. We show that the
      monoallelic-to-biallelic transcriptional switch is stably maintained and
      therefore is not a stochastic phenomenon. This unique mechanism, if adopted by

      prevalent phenomenon of monoallelic expression of autosomal genes as well as into
      the variably penetrant pathophysiological spectrum of phenotypes observed in many
      human syndromes that are due to haploinsufficiency of the affected gene.

AB  - The balance between self-renewal and differentiation is crucial for the
      maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Whereas numerous gene regulatory 
      factors have been shown to control HSC self-renewal or drive their
      differentiation, we have relatively few insights into transcription factors that 
      serve to restrict HSC differentiation. In the present work, we identify ETS
      (E-twenty-six)-related gene (ERG) as a critical factor protecting HSCs from
      differentiation. Specifically, loss of Erg accelerates HSC differentiation by
      >20-fold, thus leading to rapid depletion of immunophenotypic and functional
      HSCs. Molecularly, we could demonstrate that ERG, in addition to promoting the
      expression of HSC self-renewal genes, also represses a group of MYC targets,
      thereby explaining why Erg loss closely mimics Myc overexpression. Consistently, 
      the BET domain inhibitor CPI-203, known to repress Myc expression, confers a
      partial phenotypic rescue. In summary, ERG plays a critical role in coordinating 
      the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs.

AB  - Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2 maintain repression at many
      developmental genes in mouse embryonic stem cells and are required for early
      development. However, it is still unclear how they are targeted and how they
      function. We show that the ability of RING1B, a core component of PRC1, to
      ubiquitinate histone H2A is dispensable for early mouse embryonic development and
      much of the gene repression activity of PRC1. Our data support a model in which
      PRC1 and PRC2 reinforce each other's binding but suggest that the key functions
      of PRC1 lie beyond the enzymatic capabilities of RING1B.

AB  - Myxococcus xanthus development requires CsgA, a member of the short-chain alcohol
      dehydrogenase (SCAD) family of proteins. We show that CsgA and SocA, a protein
      that can replace CsgA function in vivo, oxidize the 2'-OH glycerol moiety on
      cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol to produce diacylglycerol (DAG),
      dihydroxyacetone, and orthophosphate. A lipid extract enriched in DAGs from
      wild-type cells initiates development and lipid body production in a csgA mutant 
      to bypass the mutational block. This novel phospholipase C-like reaction is
      widespread. SCADs that prevent neurodegenerative disorders, such as Drosophila
      Sniffer and human HSD10, oxidize cardiolipin with similar kinetic parameters.
      HSD10 exhibits a strong preference for cardiolipin with oxidized fatty acids.
      This activity is inhibited in the presence of the amyloid beta peptide. Three
      HSD10 variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders are inactive with
      cardiolipin. We suggest that HSD10 protects humans from reactive oxygen species
      by removing damaged cardiolipin before it induces apoptosis.

TI  - MERIT40 cooperates with BRCA2 to resolve DNA interstrand cross-links.
PG  - 1955-68
LID - 10.1101/gad.264192.115 [doi]
AB  - MERIT40 is an essential component of the RAP80 ubiquitin recognition complex that
      targets BRCA1 to DNA damage sites. Although this complex is required for BRCA1
      foci formation, its physiologic role in DNA repair has remained enigmatic, as has
      its relationship to canonical DNA repair mechanisms. Surprisingly, we found that 
      Merit40(-/-) mice displayed marked hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand
      cross-links (ICLs) but not whole-body irradiation. MERIT40 was rapidly recruited 
      to ICL lesions prior to FANCD2, and Merit40-null cells exhibited delayed ICL
      unhooking coupled with reduced end resection and homologous recombination at ICL 
      damage. Interestingly, Merit40 mutation exacerbated ICL-induced chromosome
      instability in the context of concomitant Brca2 deficiency but not in conjunction
      with Fancd2 mutation. These findings implicate MERIT40 in the earliest stages of 
      ICL repair and define specific functional interactions between RAP80
      complex-dependent ubiquitin recognition and the Fanconi anemia (FA)-BRCA ICL
      repair network.

TI  - A common polymorphism in the 5' UTR of ERCC5 creates an upstream ORF that confers
      resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.
PG  - 1891-6
LID - 10.1101/gad.261867.115 [doi]
AB  - We show that a common polymorphic variant in the ERCC5 5' untranslated region
      (UTR) generates an upstream ORF (uORF) that affects both the background
      expression of this protein and its ability to be synthesized following exposure
      to agents that cause bulky adduct DNA damage. Individuals that harbor uORF1 have 
      a marked resistance to platinum-based agents, illustrated by the significantly
      reduced progression-free survival of pediatric ependymoma patients treated with
      such compounds. Importantly, inhibition of DNA-PKcs restores sensitivity to
      platinum-based compounds by preventing uORF1-dependent ERCC5 expression. Our data
      support a model in which a heritable 5' noncoding mRNA element influences
      individuals' responses to platinum-based chemotherapy.

TI  - Fgfr1 regulates development through the combinatorial use of signaling proteins.
PG  - 1863-74
LID - 10.1101/gad.264994.115 [doi]
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling governs multiple processes important in 
      development and disease. Many lines of evidence have implicated Erk1/2 signaling 
      induced through Frs2 as the predominant effector pathway downstream from Fgf
      receptors (Fgfrs), but these receptors can also signal through other mechanisms. 
      To explore the functional significance of the full range of signaling downstream 
      from Fgfrs in mice, we engineered an allelic series of knock-in point mutations
      designed to disrupt Fgfr1 signaling functions individually and in combination.
      Analysis of each mutant indicates that Frs2 binding to Fgfr1 has the most
      pleiotropic functions in development but also that the receptor uses multiple
      proteins additively in vivo. In addition to Frs2, Crk proteins and Plcgamma also 
      contribute to Erk1/2 activation, affecting axis elongation and craniofacial and
      limb development and providing a biochemical mechanism for additive signaling
      requirements. Disruption of all known signaling functions diminished Erk1/2 and
      Plcgamma activation but did not recapitulate the peri-implantation Fgfr1-null
      phenotype. This suggests that Erk1/2-independent signaling pathways are
      functionally important for Fgf signaling in vivo.

TI  - Foxa2 and Cdx2 cooperate with Nkx2-1 to inhibit lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.
PG  - 1850-62
LID - 10.1101/gad.267393.115 [doi]
AB  - Despite the fact that the majority of lung cancer deaths are due to metastasis,
      the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression are poorly understood.
      Here, we present evidence that loss of Foxa2 and Cdx2 synergizes with loss of
      Nkx2-1 to fully activate the metastatic program. These three lineage-specific
      transcription factors are consistently down-regulated in metastatic cells
      compared with nonmetastatic cells. Knockdown of these three factors acts
      synergistically and is sufficient to promote the metastatic potential of
      nonmetastatic cells to that of naturally arising metastatic cells in vivo.
      Furthermore, silencing of these three transcription factors is sufficient to
      account for a significant fraction of the gene expression differences between the
      nonmetastatic and metastatic states in lung adenocarcinoma, including
      up-regulated expression of the invadopodia component Tks5long, the embryonal
      proto-oncogene Hmga2, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal mediator Snail. Finally, 
      analyses of tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model and patients show
      that low expression of Nkx2-1, Foxa2, and Cdx2 strongly correlates with more
      advanced tumors and worse survival. Our findings reveal that a large part of the 
      complex transcriptional network in metastasis can be controlled by a small number
      of regulatory nodes that function redundantly, and loss of multiple nodes is
      required to fully activate the metastatic program.

AB  - The YEATS domain, found in a number of chromatin-associated proteins, has
      recently been shown to have the capacity to bind histone lysine acetylation.
      Here, we show that the YEATS domain of Taf14, a member of key transcriptional and
      chromatin-modifying complexes in yeast, is a selective reader of histone H3 Lys9 
      acetylation (H3K9ac). Structural analysis reveals that acetylated Lys9 is
      sandwiched in an aromatic cage formed by F62 and W81. Disruption of this binding 
      in cells impairs gene transcription and the DNA damage response. Our findings
      establish a highly conserved acetyllysine reader function for the YEATS domain
      protein family and highlight the significance of this interaction for Taf14.

AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) tethers chromatin to create an environment for
      gene regulation, but little is known about how this activity is regulated to
      avoid excessive tethering of the genome. Here we propose a negative regulatory
      loop within the NPC controlling the chromatin attachment state, in which Nup155
      and Nup93 recruit Nup62 to suppress chromatin tethering by Nup155. Depletion of
      Nup62 severely disrupts chromatin distribution in the nuclei of female germlines 
      and somatic cells, which can be reversed by codepleting Nup155. Thus, this
      universal regulatory system within the NPC is crucial to control large-scale
      chromatin organization in the nucleus.

TI  - Functions and regulation of the multitasking FANCM family of DNA motor proteins.
PG  - 1777-88
LID - 10.1101/gad.266593.115 [doi]
AB  - Members of the conserved FANCM family of DNA motor proteins play key roles in
      genome maintenance processes. FANCM supports genome duplication and repair under 
      different circumstances and also functions in the ATR-mediated DNA damage
      checkpoint. Some of these roles are shared among lower eukaryotic family members.
      Human FANCM has been linked to Fanconi anemia, a syndrome characterized by cancer
      predisposition, developmental disorder, and bone marrow failure. Recent studies
      on human FANCM and its orthologs from other organisms have provided insights into
      their biological functions, regulation, and collaboration with other genome
      maintenance factors. This review summarizes the progress made, with the goal of
      providing an integrated view of the functions and regulation of these enzymes in 
      humans and model organisms and how they advance our understanding of genome
      maintenance processes.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of pRb loss highlights a signature of decreased mitochondrial 
      oxidative phosphorylation.
PG  - 1875-89
LID - 10.1101/gad.264127.115 [doi]
AB  - The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRb) protein associates with chromatin and
      regulates gene expression. Numerous studies have identified Rb-dependent RNA
      signatures, but the proteomic effects of Rb loss are largely unexplored. We
      acutely ablated Rb in adult mice and conducted a quantitative analysis of RNA and
      proteomic changes in the colon and lungs, where Rb(KO) was sufficient or
      insufficient to induce ectopic proliferation, respectively. As expected, Rb(KO)
      caused similar increases in classic pRb/E2F-regulated transcripts in both
      tissues, but, unexpectedly, their protein products increased only in the colon,
      consistent with its increased proliferative index. Thus, these protein changes
      induced by Rb loss are coupled with proliferation but uncoupled from
      transcription. The proteomic changes in common between Rb(KO) tissues showed a
      striking decrease in proteins with mitochondrial functions. Accordingly, RB1
      inactivation in human cells decreased both mitochondrial mass and oxidative
      phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function. RB(KO) cells showed decreased mitochondrial
      respiratory capacity and the accumulation of hypopolarized mitochondria.
      Additionally, RB/Rb loss altered mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation from
      (13)C-glucose through the TCA cycle in mouse tissues and cultured cells.
      Consequently, RB(KO) cells have an enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial stress
      conditions. In summary, proteomic analyses provide a new perspective on Rb/RB1
      mutation, highlighting the importance of pRb for mitochondrial function and
      suggesting vulnerabilities for treatment.

TI  - Increased mitochondrial function downstream from KDM5A histone demethylase
      rescues differentiation in pRB-deficient cells.
PG  - 1817-34
LID - 10.1101/gad.264036.115 [doi]
AB  - The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRb restricts cell growth through
      inhibition of cell cycle progression. Increasing evidence suggests that pRb also 
      promotes differentiation, but the mechanisms are poorly understood, and the key
      question remains as to how differentiation in tumor cells can be enhanced in
      order to diminish their aggressive potential. Previously, we identified the
      histone demethylase KDM5A (lysine [K]-specific demethylase 5A), which
      demethylates histone H3 on Lys4 (H3K4), as a pRB-interacting protein
      counteracting pRB's role in promoting differentiation. Here we show that loss of 
      Kdm5a restores differentiation through increasing mitochondrial respiration. This
      metabolic effect is both necessary and sufficient to induce the expression of a
      network of cell type-specific signaling and structural genes. Importantly, the
      regulatory functions of pRB in the cell cycle and differentiation are distinct
      because although restoring differentiation requires intact mitochondrial
      function, it does not necessitate cell cycle exit. Cells lacking Rb1 exhibit
      defective mitochondria and decreased oxygen consumption. Kdm5a is a direct
      repressor of metabolic regulatory genes, thus explaining the compensatory role of
      Kdm5a deletion in restoring mitochondrial function and differentiation.
      Significantly, activation of mitochondrial function by the mitochondrial
      biogenesis regulator Pgc-1alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      gamma-coactivator 1alpha; also called PPARGC1A) a coactivator of the Kdm5a target
      genes, is sufficient to override the differentiation block. Overexpression of
      Pgc-1alpha, like KDM5A deletion, inhibits cell growth in RB-negative human cancer
      cell lines. The rescue of differentiation by loss of KDM5A or by activation of
      mitochondrial biogenesis reveals the switch to oxidative phosphorylation as an
      essential step in restoring differentiation and a less aggressive cancer
      phenotype.

AB  - The DNA-binding protein Ikaros is a potent tumor suppressor and hematopoietic
      regulator. However, the mechanisms by which Ikaros functions remain poorly
      understood, due in part to its atypical DNA-binding properties and partnership
      with the poorly understood Mi-2/NuRD complex. In this study, we analyzed five
      sequential stages of thymocyte development in a mouse strain containing a
      targeted deletion of Ikaros zinc finger 4, which exhibits a select subset of
      abnormalities observed in Ikaros-null mice. By examining thymopoiesis in vivo and
      in vitro, diverse abnormalities were observed at each developmental stage. RNA
      sequencing revealed that each stage is characterized by the misregulation of a
      limited number of genes, with a strong preference for stage-specific rather than 
      lineage-specific genes. Strikingly, individual genes rarely exhibited Ikaros
      dependence at all stages. Instead, a consistent feature of the aberrantly
      expressed genes was a reduced magnitude of expression level change during
      developmental transitions. These results, combined with analyses of the interplay
      between Ikaros loss of function and Notch signaling, suggest that Ikaros may not 
      be a conventional activator or repressor of defined sets of genes. Instead, a
      primary function may be to sharpen the dynamic range of gene expression changes
      during developmental transitions via atypical molecular mechanisms that remain
      undefined.

TI  - Mextli proteins use both canonical bipartite and novel tripartite binding modes
      to form eIF4E complexes that display differential sensitivity to 4E-BP
      regulation.
PG  - 1835-49
LID - 10.1101/gad.269068.115 [doi]
AB  - The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are a diverse class of translation regulators
      that share a canonical eIF4E-binding motif (4E-BM) with eIF4G. Consequently, they
      compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thereby inhibiting translation
      initiation. Mextli (Mxt) is an unusual 4E-BP that promotes translation by also
      interacting with eIF3. Here we present the crystal structures of the
      eIF4E-binding regions of the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) and Caenorhabditis
      elegans (Ce) Mxt proteins in complex with eIF4E in the cap-bound and cap-free
      states. The structures reveal unexpected evolutionary plasticity in the
      eIF4E-binding mode, with a classical bipartite interface for Ce Mxt and a novel
      tripartite interface for Dm Mxt. Both interfaces comprise a canonical helix and a
      noncanonical helix that engage the dorsal and lateral surfaces of eIF4E,
      respectively. Remarkably, Dm Mxt contains a C-terminal auxiliary helix that lies 
      anti-parallel to the canonical helix on the eIF4E dorsal surface. In contrast to 
      the eIF4G and Ce Mxt complexes, the Dm eIF4E-Mxt complexes are resistant to
      competition by bipartite 4E-BPs, suggesting that Dm Mxt can bind eIF4E when eIF4G
      binding is inhibited. Our results uncovered unexpected diversity in the binding
      modes of 4E-BPs, resulting in eIF4E complexes that display differential
      sensitivity to 4E-BP regulation.

TI  - Adult Drosophila sensory neurons specify dendritic territories independently of
      dendritic contacts through the Wnt5-Drl signaling pathway.
PG  - 1763-75
LID - 10.1101/gad.262592.115 [doi]
AB  - Sensory neurons with common functions are often nonrandomly arranged and form
      dendritic territories in stereotypic spatial patterns throughout the nervous
      system, yet molecular mechanisms of how neurons specify dendritic territories
      remain largely unknown. In Drosophila larvae, dendrites of class IV sensory
      (C4da) neurons completely but nonredundantly cover the whole epidermis, and the
      boundaries of these tiled dendritic fields are specified through repulsive
      interactions between homotypic dendrites. Here we report that, unlike the larval 
      C4da neurons, adult C4da neurons rely on both dendritic repulsive interactions
      and external positional cues to delimit the boundaries of their dendritic fields.
      We identify Wnt5 derived from sternites, the ventral-most part of the adult
      abdominal epidermis, as the critical determinant for the ventral boundaries.
      Further genetic data indicate that Wnt5 promotes dendrite termination on the
      periphery of sternites through the Ryk receptor family kinase Derailed (Drl) and 
      the Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio in C4da neurons. Our
      findings thus uncover the dendritic contact-independent mechanism that is
      required for dendritic boundary specification and suggest that combinatory
      actions of the dendritic contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms may ensure
      appropriate dendritic territories of a given neuron.

      silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire.
PG  - 1747-62
LID - 10.1101/gad.267252.115 [doi]
AB  - PIWI clade Argonaute proteins silence transposon expression in animal gonads.
      Their target specificity is defined by bound approximately 23- to 30-nucleotide
      (nt) PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are processed from single-stranded
      precursor transcripts via two distinct pathways. Primary piRNAs are defined by
      the endonuclease Zucchini, while biogenesis of secondary piRNAs depends on
      piRNA-guided transcript cleavage and results in piRNA amplification. Here, we
      analyze the interdependencies between these piRNA biogenesis pathways in
      developing Drosophila ovaries. We show that secondary piRNA-guided target slicing
      is the predominant mechanism that specifies transcripts-including those from
      piRNA clusters-as primary piRNA precursors and defines the spectrum of Piwi-bound
      piRNAs in germline cells. Post-transcriptional silencing in the cytoplasm
      therefore enforces nuclear transcriptional target silencing, which ensures the
      tight suppression of transposons during oogenesis. As target slicing also defines
      the nuclear piRNA pool during mouse spermatogenesis, our findings uncover an
      unexpected conceptual similarity between the mouse and fly piRNA pathways.

AB  - Inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homology deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)
      is linked to increased PI3K-AKT signaling, enhanced organismal growth, and cancer
      development. Here we generated and analyzed Pten knock-in mice harboring a C2
      domain missense mutation at phenylalanine 341 (Pten(FV)), found in human cancer. 
      Despite having reduced levels of PTEN protein, homozygous Pten(FV/FV) embryos
      have intact AKT signaling, develop normally, and are carried to term.
      Heterozygous Pten(FV/+) mice develop carcinoma in the thymus, stomach, adrenal
      medulla, and mammary gland but not in other organs typically sensitive to Pten
      deficiency, including the thyroid, prostate, and uterus. Progression to carcinoma
      in sensitive organs ensues in the absence of overt AKT activation. Carcinoma in
      the uterus, a cancer-resistant organ, requires a second clonal event associated
      with the spontaneous activation of AKT and downstream signaling. In summary, this
      PTEN noncatalytic missense mutation exposes a core tumor suppressor function
      distinct from inhibition of canonical AKT signaling that predisposes to
      organ-selective cancer development in vivo.

AB  - Conformation of antigen receptor gene loci spatially juxtaposes rearranging gene 
      segments in the appropriate cell lineage and developmental stage. We describe a
      three-step pathway that establishes the structure of the 2.8-Mb immunoglobulin
      heavy chain gene (IgH) locus in pro-B cells. Each step uses a different
      transcription factor and leads to increasing levels of structural organization.
      CTCF mediates one level of compaction that folds the locus into several 250- to
      400-kb subdomains, and Pax5 further compacts the 2-Mb region that encodes
      variable (VH) gene segments. The 5' and 3' domains are brought together by the
      transcription factor YY1 to establish the configuration within which gene
      recombination initiates. Such stepwise mechanisms may apply more generally to
      establish regulatory fine structure within megabase-sized topologically
      associated domains.

TI  - Neurofibromatosis-1 regulation of neural stem cell proliferation and multilineage
      differentiation operates through distinct RAS effector pathways.
PG  - 1677-82
LID - 10.1101/gad.261677.115 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder caused by 
      impaired function of the neurofibromin RAS regulator. Using a combination of Nf1 
      genetically engineered mice and pharmacological/genetic inhibition approaches, we
      report that neurofibromin differentially controls neural stem cell (NSC)
      proliferation and multilineage differentiation through the selective use of the
      PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK pathways. While PI3K/AKT governs neurofibromin-regulated NSC
      proliferation, multilineage differentiation is MEK-dependent. Moreover, whereas
      MEK-regulated multilineage differentiation requires Smad3-induced Jagged-1
      expression and Notch activation, MEK/Smad3-regulated Hes1 induction is only
      responsible for astrocyte and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, these
      findings establish distinct roles for the RAS effector pathways in regulating
      brain NSC function.

AB  - Timely ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is fundamental to cell cycle
      control, but the precise degradation order at each cell cycle phase transition is
      still unclear. We investigated the degradation order among substrates of a single
      human E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4(Cdt2), which mediates the S-phase degradation of 
      key cell cycle proteins, including Cdt1, PR-Set7, and p21. Our analysis of
      synchronized cells and asynchronously proliferating live single cells revealed a 
      consistent order of replication-coupled destruction during both S-phase entry and
      DNA repair; Cdt1 is destroyed first, whereas p21 destruction is always
      substantially later than that of Cdt1. These differences are attributable to the 
      CRL4(Cdt2) targeting motif known as the PIP degron, which binds DNA-loaded
      proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA(DNA)) and recruits CRL4(Cdt2). Fusing
      Cdt1's PIP degron to p21 causes p21 to be destroyed nearly concurrently with Cdt1
      rather than consecutively. This accelerated degradation conferred by the Cdt1 PIP
      degron is accompanied by more effective Cdt2 recruitment by Cdt1 even though p21 
      has higher affinity for PCNA(DNA). Importantly, cells with artificially
      accelerated p21 degradation display evidence of stalled replication in mid-S
      phase and sensitivity to replication arrest. We therefore propose that sequential
      degradation ensures orderly S-phase progression to avoid replication stress and
      genome instability.

PG  - 1696-706
LID - 10.1101/gad.267286.115 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by mutations in a number of genes, 
      including the gene encoding the RNA/DNA-binding protein translocated in
      liposarcoma or fused in sarcoma (TLS/FUS or FUS). Previously, we identified a
      number of FUS target genes, among them MECP2. To investigate how ALS mutations in
      FUS might impact target gene expression, we examined the effects of several FUS
      derivatives harboring ALS mutations, such as R521C (FUS(C)), on MECP2 expression 
      in transfected human U87 cells. Strikingly, FUS(C) and other mutants not only
      altered MECP2 alternative splicing but also markedly increased mRNA abundance,
      which we show resulted from sharply elevated stability. Paradoxically, however,
      MeCP2 protein levels were significantly reduced in cells expressing ALS mutant
      derivatives. Providing a parsimonious explanation for these results, biochemical 
      fractionation and in vivo localization studies revealed that MECP2 mRNA
      colocalized with cytoplasmic FUS(C) in insoluble aggregates, which are
      characteristic of ALS mutant proteins. Together, our results establish that ALS
      mutations in FUS can strongly impact target gene expression, reflecting a
      dominant effect of FUS-containing aggregates.

TI  - Local and sex-specific biases in crossover vs. noncrossover outcomes at meiotic
      recombination hot spots in mice.
PG  - 1721-33
LID - 10.1101/gad.265561.115 [doi]
AB  - Meiotic recombination initiated by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) yields 
      two types of interhomolog recombination products, crossovers and noncrossovers,
      but what determines whether a DSB will yield a crossover or noncrossover is not
      understood. In this study, we analyzed the influence of sex and chromosomal
      location on mammalian recombination outcomes by constructing fine-scale
      recombination maps in both males and females at two mouse hot spots located in
      different regions of the same chromosome. These include the most comprehensive
      maps of recombination hot spots in oocytes to date. One hot spot, located
      centrally on chromosome 1, behaved similarly in male and female meiosis:
      Crossovers and noncrossovers formed at comparable levels and ratios in both
      sexes. In contrast, at a distal hot spot, crossovers were recovered only in males
      even though noncrossovers were obtained at similar frequencies in both sexes.
      These findings reveal an example of extreme sex-specific bias in recombination
      outcome. We further found that estimates of relative DSB levels are surprisingly 
      poor predictors of relative crossover frequencies between hot spots in males. Our
      results demonstrate that the outcome of mammalian meiotic recombination can be
      biased, that this bias can vary depending on location and cellular context, and
      that DSB frequency is not the only determinant of crossover frequency.

TI  - Condensin promotes the juxtaposition of DNA flanking its loading site in Bacillus
      subtilis.
PG  - 1661-75
LID - 10.1101/gad.265876.115 [doi]
AB  - SMC condensin complexes play a central role in compacting and resolving
      replicated chromosomes in virtually all organisms, yet how they accomplish this
      remains elusive. In Bacillus subtilis, condensin is loaded at centromeric parS
      sites, where it encircles DNA and individualizes newly replicated origins. Using 
      chromosome conformation capture and cytological assays, we show that condensin
      recruitment to origin-proximal parS sites is required for the juxtaposition of
      the two chromosome arms. Recruitment to ectopic parS sites promotes alignment of 
      large tracks of DNA flanking these sites. Importantly, insertion of parS sites on
      opposing arms indicates that these "zip-up" interactions only occur between
      adjacent DNA segments. Collectively, our data suggest that condensin resolves
      replicated origins by promoting the juxtaposition of DNA flanking parS sites,
      drawing sister origins in on themselves and away from each other. These results
      are consistent with a model in which condensin encircles the DNA flanking its
      loading site and then slides down, tethering the two arms together. Lengthwise
      condensation via loop extrusion could provide a generalizable mechanism by which 
      condensin complexes act dynamically to individualize origins in B. subtilis and, 
      when loaded along eukaryotic chromosomes, resolve them during mitosis.

TI  - mafba is a downstream transcriptional effector of Vegfc signaling essential for
      embryonic lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish.
PG  - 1618-30
LID - 10.1101/gad.263210.115 [doi]
AB  - The lymphatic vasculature plays roles in tissue fluid balance, immune cell
      trafficking, fatty acid absorption, cancer metastasis, and cardiovascular
      disease. Lymphatic vessels form by lymphangiogenesis, the sprouting of new
      lymphatics from pre-existing vessels, in both development and disease contexts.
      The apical signaling pathway in lymphangiogenesis is the VEGFC/VEGFR3 pathway,
      yet how signaling controls cellular transcriptional output remains unknown. We
      used a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify the transcription factor
      mafba as essential for lymphatic vessel development. We found that mafba is
      required for the migration of lymphatic precursors after their initial sprouting 
      from the posterior cardinal vein. mafba expression is enriched in sprouts
      emerging from veins, and we show that mafba functions cell-autonomously during
      lymphatic vessel development. Mechanistically, Vegfc signaling increases mafba
      expression to control downstream transcription, and this regulatory relationship

AB  - Eukaryotic gene expression is tightly regulated post-transcriptionally by
      RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs. The RBP AU-rich-binding factor 1
      (AUF1) isoform p37 was found to have high affinity for the microRNA let-7b in
      vitro (Kd = approximately 6 nM) in cells. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation, 
      in vitro association, and single-molecule-binding analyses revealed that AUF1
      promoted let-7b loading onto Argonaute 2 (AGO2), the catalytic component of the
      RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In turn, AGO2-let-7 triggered target mRNA
      decay. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism by which AUF1 binding and transfer 
      of microRNA let-7 to AGO2 facilitates let-7-elicited gene silencing.

TI  - DNA break-induced sumoylation is enabled by collaboration between a SUMO ligase
      and the ssDNA-binding complex RPA.
PG  - 1593-8
LID - 10.1101/gad.265058.115 [doi]
AB  - Upon genome damage, large-scale protein sumoylation occurs from yeast to humans
      to promote DNA repair. Currently, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown.
      Here we show that, upon DNA break induction, the budding yeast SUMO ligase Siz2
      collaborates with the ssDNA-binding complex RPA (replication protein A) to induce
      the sumoylation of recombination factors and confer damage resistance. Both RPA
      and nuclease-generated ssDNA promote Siz2-mediated sumoylation. Mechanistically, 
      the conserved Siz2 interaction with RPA enables Siz2 localization to damage
      sites. These findings provide a molecular basis for recruiting SUMO ligases to
      the vicinity of their substrates to induce sumoylation upon DNA damage.

TI  - Inhibition of the autocrine IL-6-JAK2-STAT3-calprotectin axis as targeted therapy
      for HR-/HER2+ breast cancers.
PG  - 1631-48
LID - 10.1101/gad.262642.115 [doi]
AB  - HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast adenocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group in which
      hormone receptor (HR) status influences therapeutic decisions and patient
      outcome. By combining genome-wide RNAi screens with regulatory network analysis, 
      we identified STAT3 as a critically activated master regulator of HR(-)/HER2(+)
      tumors, eliciting tumor dependency in these cells. Mechanistically, HR(-)/HER2(+)
      cells secrete high levels of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine, inducing the
      activation of STAT3, which in turn promotes a second autocrine stimulus to
      increase S100A8/9 complex (calprotectin) production and secretion. Increased
      calprotectin levels activate signaling pathways involved in proliferation and
      resistance. Importantly, we demonstrated that inhibition of the IL-6-Janus kinase
      2 (JAK2)-STAT3-calprotectin axis with FDA-approved drugs, alone and in
      combination with HER2 inhibitors, reduced the tumorigenicity of HR(-)/HER2(+)
      breast cancers, opening novel targeted therapeutic opportunities.

PG  - 1587-92
LID - 10.1101/gad.262998.115 [doi]
AB  - Tumor heterogeneity can create a unique symbiotic tumor microenvironment.
      Earlier, we showed that clonal evolution in mouse small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      can result in subclones that, upon cografting, endow the neuroendocrine tumor
      cells with metastatic potential. We now show that paracrine signaling between
      SCLC subclones is a critical requirement in the early steps of the metastatic
      process, such as local invasion and intravasation. We further show evidence that 
      paracrine signaling via fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2) and Mapk between these 
      diverged tumor subclones causes enhanced expression of the Pea3 (polyomavirus
      enhancer activator 3) transcription factor, resulting in metastatic dissemination
      of the neuroendocrine tumor subclones. Our data reveal for the first time
      paracrine signaling between tumor cell subclones in SCLC that results in
      metastatic spread of SCLC.

TI  - A novel 3' splice site recognition by the two zinc fingers in the U2AF small
      subunit.

LID - 10.1101/gad.267104.115 [doi]
AB  - The pre-mRNA splicing reaction of eukaryotic cells has to be carried out
      extremely accurately, as failure to recognize the splice sites correctly causes
      serious disease. The small subunit of the U2AF heterodimer is essential for the
      determination of 3' splice sites in pre-mRNA splicing, and several single-residue
      mutations of the U2AF small subunit cause severe disorders such as
      myelodysplastic syndromes. However, the mechanism of RNA recognition is poorly
      understood. Here we solved the crystal structure of the U2AF small subunit
      (U2AF23) from fission yeast, consisting of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain 
      flanked by two conserved CCCH-type zinc fingers (ZFs). The two ZFs are positioned
      side by side on the beta sheet of the RRM domain. Further mutational analysis
      revealed that the ZFs bind cooperatively to the target RNA sequence, but the RRM 
      domain acts simply as a scaffold to organize the ZFs and does not itself contact 
      the RNA directly. This completely novel and unexpected mode of RNA-binding
      mechanism by the U2AF small subunit sheds light on splicing errors caused by
      mutations of this highly conserved protein.

TI  - miR-431 promotes differentiation and regeneration of old skeletal muscle by
      targeting Smad4.
PG  - 1605-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.263574.115 [doi]
AB  - The myogenic capacity of myoblasts decreases in skeletal muscle with age. In
      addition to environmental factors, intrinsic factors are important for
      maintaining the regenerative potential of muscle progenitor cells, but their
      identities are largely unknown. Here, comparative analysis of microRNA (miRNA)
      expression profiles in young and old myoblasts uncovered miR-431 as a novel miRNA
      showing markedly reduced abundance in aged myoblasts. Importantly, elevating
      miR-431 improved the myogenic capacity of old myoblasts, while inhibiting
      endogenous miR-431 lowered myogenesis. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses
      revealed that miR-431 directly interacted with the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
      of Smad4 mRNA, which encodes one of the downstream effectors of TGF-beta
      signaling. In keeping with the low levels of miR-431 in old myoblasts, SMAD4
      levels increased in this myoblast population. Interestingly, in an in vivo model 
      of muscle regeneration following cardiotoxin injury, ectopic miR-431 injection
      greatly improved muscle regeneration and reduced SMAD4 levels. Consistent with
      the finding that the mouse miR-431 seed sequence in the Smad4 3' UTR is conserved
      in the human SMAD4 3' UTR, inhibition of miR-431 also repressed the myogenic
      capacity of human skeletal myoblasts. Taken together, our results suggest that
      the age-associated miR-431 plays a key role in maintaining the myogenic ability
      of skeletal muscle with age.

TI  - The poly(A)-binding protein Nab2 functions in RNA polymerase III transcription.
PG  - 1565-75
LID - 10.1101/gad.266205.115 [doi]
AB  - RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) synthesizes most small RNAs, the most prominent
      being tRNAs. Although the basic mechanism of RNAPIII transcription is well
      understood, recent evidence suggests that additional proteins play a role in
      RNAPIII transcription. Here, we discovered by a genome-wide approach that Nab2, a
      poly(A)-binding protein important for correct poly(A) tail length and nuclear
      mRNA export, is present at all RNAPIII transcribed genes. The occupancy of Nab2
      at RNAPIII transcribed genes is dependent on transcription. Using a novel
      temperature-sensitive allele of NAB2, nab2-34, we show that Nab2 is required for 
      the occupancy of RNAPIII and TFIIIB at target genes. Furthermore, Nab2 interacts 
      with RNAPIII, TFIIIB, and RNAPIII transcripts. Importantly, impairment of Nab2
      function causes an RNAPIII transcription defect in vivo and in vitro. Taken
      together, we establish Nab2, an important mRNA biogenesis factor, as a novel
      player required for RNAPIII transcription by stabilizing TFIIIB and RNAPIII at
      promoters.

TI  - The host Integrator complex acts in transcription-independent maturation of
      herpesvirus microRNA 3' ends.
PG  - 1552-64
LID - 10.1101/gad.266973.115 [doi]
AB  - Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) is an oncogenic gamma-herpesvirus that produces
      microRNAs (miRNAs) by cotranscription of precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpins
      immediately downstream from viral small nuclear RNAs (snRNA). The host cell
      Integrator complex, which recognizes the snRNA 3' end processing signal (3' box),
      generates the 5' ends of HVS pre-miRNA hairpins. Here, we identify a novel 3'
      box-like sequence (miRNA 3' box) downstream from HVS pre-miRNAs that is essential
      for miRNA biogenesis. In vivo knockdown and rescue experiments confirmed that the
      3' end processing of HVS pre-miRNAs also depends on Integrator activity.
      Interaction between Integrator and HVS primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) substrates that 
      contain only the miRNA 3' box was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and an in
      situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) that we developed to localize specific
      transient RNA-protein interactions inside cells. Surprisingly, in contrast to
      snRNA 3' end processing, HVS pre-miRNA 3' end processing by Integrator can be
      uncoupled from transcription, enabling new approaches to study Integrator
      enzymology.

TI  - CaV3.2 calcium channels control NMDA receptor-mediated transmission: a new
      mechanism for absence epilepsy.
PG  - 1535-51
LID - 10.1101/gad.260869.115 [doi]
AB  - CaV3.2 T-type calcium channels, encoded by CACNA1H, are expressed throughout the 
      brain, yet their general function remains unclear. We discovered that CaV3.2
      channels control NMDA-sensitive glutamatergic receptor (NMDA-R)-mediated
      transmission and subsequent NMDA-R-dependent plasticity of AMPA-R-mediated
      transmission at rat central synapses. Interestingly, functional CaV3.2 channels
      primarily incorporate into synapses, replace existing CaV3.2 channels, and can
      induce local calcium influx to control NMDA transmission strength in an
      activity-dependent manner. Moreover, human childhood absence epilepsy
      (CAE)-linked hCaV3.2(C456S) mutant channels have a higher channel open
      probability, induce more calcium influx, and enhance glutamatergic transmission. 
      Remarkably, cortical expression of hCaV3.2(C456S) channels in rats induces 2- to 
      4-Hz spike and wave discharges and absence-like epilepsy characteristic of CAE
      patients, which can be suppressed by AMPA-R and NMDA-R antagonists but not T-type
      calcium channel antagonists. These results reveal an unexpected role of CaV3.2
      channels in regulating NMDA-R-mediated transmission and a novel epileptogenic
      mechanism for human CAE.

      activation.
PG  - 1524-34
LID - 10.1101/gad.261792.115 [doi]
AB  - The central region of MDM2 is critical for p53 activation and tumor suppression. 
      Upon ribosomal stress, this region is bound by ribosomal proteins, particularly
      ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11), leading to MDM2 inactivation and subsequent p53
      activation. Here, we solved the complex structure of human MDM2-RPL11 at 2.4 A.
      MDM2 extensively interacts with RPL11 through an acidic domain and two zinc
      fingers. Formation of the MDM2-RPL11 complex induces substantial conformational
      changes in both proteins. RPL11, unable to bind MDM2 mutants, fails to induce the
      activation of p53 in cells. MDM2 mimics 28S rRNA binding to RPL11. The C4 zinc
      finger determines RPL11 binding to MDM2 but not its homolog, MDMX. Our results
      highlight the essential role of the RPL11-MDM2 interaction in p53 activation and 
      tumor suppression and provide a structural basis for potential new anti-tumor
      drug development.

TI  - The oncogenic BRD4-NUT chromatin regulator drives aberrant transcription within
      large topological domains.
PG  - 1507-23
LID - 10.1101/gad.267583.115 [doi]
AB  - NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), a subtype of squamous cell cancer, is one of the
      most aggressive human solid malignancies known. NMC is driven by the creation of 
      a translocation oncoprotein, BRD4-NUT, which blocks differentiation and drives
      growth of NMC cells. BRD4-NUT forms distinctive nuclear foci in patient tumors,
      which we found correlate with approximately 100 unprecedented, hyperacetylated
      expanses of chromatin that reach up to 2 Mb in size. These "megadomains" appear
      to be the result of aberrant, feed-forward loops of acetylation and binding of
      acetylated histones that drive transcription of underlying DNA in NMC patient
      cells and naive cells induced to express BRD4-NUT. Megadomain locations are
      typically cell lineage-specific; however, the cMYC and TP63 regions are targeted 
      in all NMCs tested and play functional roles in tumor growth. Megadomains appear 
      to originate from select pre-existing enhancers that progressively broaden but
      are ultimately delimited by topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries.
      Therefore, our findings establish a basis for understanding the powerful role
      played by large-scale chromatin organization in normal and aberrant
      lineage-specific gene transcription.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways are essential regulators of
      vertebrate skeletal development. FGF signaling regulates development of the limb 
      bud and formation of the mesenchymal condensation and has key roles in regulating
      chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and bone and mineral homeostasis. This review
      updates our review on FGFs in skeletal development published in Genes &
      Development in 2002, examines progress made on understanding the functions of the
      FGF signaling pathway during critical stages of skeletogenesis, and explores the 
      mechanisms by which mutations in FGF signaling molecules cause skeletal
      malformations in humans. Links between FGF signaling pathways and other
      interacting pathways that are critical for skeletal development and could be
      exploited to treat genetic diseases and repair bone are also explored.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, with small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC) representing the most aggressive subtype. Standard treatments have not
      changed in decades, and the 5-year survival rate has remained <7%. Genomic
      analyses have identified key driver mutations of SCLC that were subsequently
      validated in animal models of SCLC. To provide better treatment options, a deeper
      understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC
      initiation, progression, metastasis, and acquisition of resistance is required.
      In this review, we describe the genetic landscape of SCLC, features of the cell
      of origin, and targeted therapeutic approaches.

TI  - beta-Catenin destruction complex-independent regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling by
      APC in intestinal tumorigenesis.
PG  - 1493-506
LID - 10.1101/gad.264515.115 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) underlie familial adenomatous
      polyposis (FAP), an inherited cancer syndrome characterized by the widespread
      development of colorectal polyps. APC is best known as a scaffold protein in the 
      beta-catenin destruction complex, whose activity is antagonized by canonical Wnt 
      signaling. Whether other effector pathways mediate APC's tumor suppressor
      function is less clear. Here we report that activation of YAP, the downstream
      effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is a general hallmark of tubular
      adenomas from FAP patients. We show that APC functions as a scaffold protein that
      facilitates the Hippo kinase cascade by interacting with Sav1 and Lats1.
      Consistent with the molecular link between APC and the Hippo signaling pathway,
      genetic analysis reveals that YAP is absolutely required for the development of
      APC-deficient adenomas. These findings establish Hippo-YAP signaling as a
      critical effector pathway downstream from APC, independent from its involvement
      in the beta-catenin destruction complex.

TI  - Pancreatic cancer modeling using retrograde viral vector delivery and in vivo
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic genome editing.

LID - 10.1101/gad.264861.115 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a genomically diverse, prevalent, and 
      almost invariably fatal malignancy. Although conventional genetically engineered 
      mouse models of human PDAC have been instrumental in understanding pancreatic
      cancer development, these models are much too labor-intensive, expensive, and
      slow to perform the extensive molecular analyses needed to adequately understand 
      this disease. Here we demonstrate that retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of 
      either adenoviral-Cre or lentiviral-Cre vectors allows titratable initiation of
      pancreatic neoplasias that progress into invasive and metastatic PDAC. To enable 
      in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation in the pancreas, we generated a
      Cre-regulated Cas9 allele and lentiviral vectors that express Cre and a
      single-guide RNA. CRISPR-mediated targeting of Lkb1 in combination with oncogenic
      Kras expression led to selection for inactivating genomic alterations, absence of
      Lkb1 protein, and rapid tumor growth that phenocopied Cre-mediated genetic
      deletion of Lkb1. This method will transform our ability to rapidly interrogate
      gene function during the development of this recalcitrant cancer.

PG  - 1487-92
LID - 10.1101/gad.265439.115 [doi]
AB  - Histone H2A monoubiquitylation (H2Aub) is considered to be a key effector in
      transcriptional repression by Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1). We analyzed
      Drosophila with a point mutation in the PRC1 subunit Sce that abolishes its H2A
      ubiquitylase activity or with point mutations in the H2A and H2Av residues
      ubiquitylated by PRC1. H2Aub is essential for viability and required for
      efficient histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation by PRC2 early in embryogenesis.
      However, H2Aub-deficient animals fully maintain repression of PRC1 target genes
      and do not show phenotypes characteristic of Polycomb group mutants. PRC1 thus
      represses canonical target genes independently of H2Aub.

TI  - Chaperoning 5S RNA assembly.
PG  - 1432-46
LID - 10.1101/gad.260349.115 [doi]
AB  - In eukaryotes, three of the four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)-the 5.8S, 18S, and
      25S/28S rRNAs-are processed from a single pre-rRNA transcript and assembled into 
      ribosomes. The fourth rRNA, the 5S rRNA, is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and
      is assembled into the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP), containing ribosomal
      proteins Rpl5/uL18 and Rpl11/uL5, prior to its incorporation into preribosomes.
      In mammals, the 5S RNP is also a central regulator of the homeostasis of the
      tumor suppressor p53. The nucleolar localization of the 5S RNP and its assembly
      into preribosomes are performed by a specialized complex composed of Rpf2 and
      Rrs1 in yeast or Bxdc1 and hRrs1 in humans. Here we report the structural and
      functional characterization of the Rpf2-Rrs1 complex alone, in complex with the
      5S RNA, and within pre-60S ribosomes. We show that the Rpf2-Rrs1 complex contains
      a specialized 5S RNA E-loop-binding module, contacts the Rpl5 protein, and also
      contacts the ribosome assembly factor Rsa4 and the 25S RNA. We propose that the
      Rpf2-Rrs1 complex establishes a network of interactions that guide the
      incorporation of the 5S RNP in preribosomes in the initial conformation prior to 
      its rotation to form the central protuberance found in the mature large ribosomal
      subunit.

TI  - Histone H3.3 maintains genome integrity during mammalian development.

AB  - Histone H3.3 is a highly conserved histone H3 replacement variant in metazoans
      and has been implicated in many important biological processes, including cell
      differentiation and reprogramming. Germline and somatic mutations in H3.3 genomic
      incorporation pathway components or in H3.3 encoding genes have been associated
      with human congenital diseases and cancers, respectively. However, the role of
      H3.3 in mammalian development remains unclear. To address this question, we
      generated H3.3-null mouse models through classical genetic approaches. We found
      that H3.3 plays an essential role in mouse development. Complete depletion of
      H3.3 leads to developmental retardation and early embryonic lethality. At the
      cellular level, H3.3 loss triggers cell cycle suppression and cell death.
      Surprisingly, H3.3 depletion does not dramatically disrupt gene regulation in the
      developing embryo. Instead, H3.3 depletion causes dysfunction of heterochromatin 
      structures at telomeres, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions of chromosomes,
      leading to mitotic defects. The resulting karyotypical abnormalities and DNA
      damage lead to p53 pathway activation. In summary, our results reveal that an
      important function of H3.3 is to support chromosomal heterochromatic structures, 
      thus maintaining genome integrity during mammalian development.

PG  - 1362-76
LID - 10.1101/gad.263707.115 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone post-translational modifications,
      control longevity in diverse organisms. Relatedly, loss of proper transcriptional
      regulation on a global scale is an emerging phenomenon of shortened life span,
      but the specific mechanisms linking these observations remain to be uncovered.
      Here, we describe a life span screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is designed
      to identify amino acid residues of histones that regulate yeast replicative
      aging. Our results reveal that lack of sustained histone H3K36 methylation is
      commensurate with increased cryptic transcription in a subset of genes in old
      cells and with shorter life span. In contrast, deletion of the K36me2/3
      demethylase Rph1 increases H3K36me3 within these genes, suppresses cryptic
      transcript initiation, and extends life span. We show that this aging phenomenon 
      is conserved, as cryptic transcription also increases in old worms. We propose
      that epigenetic misregulation in aging cells leads to loss of transcriptional
      precision that is detrimental to life span, and, importantly, this acceleration
      in aging can be reversed by restoring transcriptional fidelity.

AB  - E proteins are conserved regulators of growth and development. We show that the
      Caenorhabditis elegans E-protein helix-loop-helix-2 (HLH-2) functions as a
      homodimer in directing development and function of the anchor cell (AC) of the
      gonad, the critical organizer of uterine and vulval development. Our
      structure-function analysis of HLH-2 indicates that dimerization drives its
      degradation in other uterine cells (ventral uterine precursor cells [VUs]) that
      initially have potential to be the AC. We also provide evidence that this mode of
      dimerization-driven down-regulation can target other basic HLH (bHLH) dimers as
      well. Remarkably, human E proteins can functionally substitute for C. elegans
      HLH-2 in regulating AC development and also display dimerization-dependent
      degradation in VUs. Our results suggest that dimerization-driven regulation of
      bHLH protein stability may be a conserved mechanism for differential regulation
      in specific cell contexts.

AB  - N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent and internal modification that
      occurs in the messenger RNAs (mRNA) of most eukaryotes, although its functional
      relevance remained a mystery for decades. This modification is installed by the
      m(6)A methylation "writers" and can be reversed by demethylases that serve as
      "erasers." In this review, we mainly summarize recent progress in the study of
      the m(6)A mRNA methylation machineries across eukaryotes and discuss their newly 
      uncovered biological functions. The broad roles of m(6)A in regulating cell fates
      and embryonic development highlight the existence of another layer of epigenetic 
      regulation at the RNA level, where mRNA is subjected to chemical modifications
      that affect protein expression.

LID - 10.1101/gad.265215.115 [doi]
AB  - PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs protect germ cells from the activity of
      mobile genetic elements. Two classes of piRNAs-primary and secondary-are defined 
      by their mechanisms of biogenesis. Primary piRNAs are processed directly from
      transcripts of piRNA cluster loci, whereas secondary piRNAs are generated in an
      adaptive amplification loop, termed the ping-pong cycle. In mammals, piRNA
      populations are dynamic, shifting as male germ cells develop. Embryonic piRNAs
      consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward
      transposons. In meiotic cells, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and
      largely restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters. The
      transition from the embryonic to the adult piRNA pathway is not well understood. 
      Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the
      production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong occurs
      inappropriately in meiotic cells. Ping-pong initiates piRNA responses against not
      only transposons but also protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs, including
      genes essential for germ cell development. Thus, the sterility of Rnf17 mutants
      may be a manifestation of a small RNA-based autoimmune reaction.

LID - 10.1101/gad.264929.115 [doi]
AB  - The Mst-Lats kinase cascade is central to the Hippo tumor-suppressive pathway
      that controls organ size and tissue homeostasis. The adaptor protein Mob1
      promotes Lats activation by Mst, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show
      that human Mob1 binds to autophosphorylated docking motifs in active Mst2. This
      binding enables Mob1 phosphorylation by Mst2. Phosphorylated Mob1 undergoes
      conformational activation and binds to Lats1. We determine the crystal structures
      of phospho-Mst2-Mob1 and phospho-Mob1-Lats1 complexes, revealing the structural
      basis of both phosphorylation-dependent binding events. Further biochemical and
      functional analyses demonstrate that Mob1 mediates Lats1 activation through
      dynamic scaffolding and allosteric mechanisms. Thus, Mob1 acts as a
      phosphorylation-regulated coupler of kinase activation by virtue of its ability
      to engage multiple ligands. We propose that stepwise, phosphorylation-triggered
      docking interactions of nonkinase elements enhance the specificity and robustness
      of kinase signaling cascades.

AB  - Chromosome translocations are well-established hallmarks of cancer cells and
      often occur at nonrandom sites in the genome. The molecular features that define 
      recurrent chromosome breakpoints are largely unknown. Using a combination of
      bioinformatics, biochemical analysis, and cell-based assays, we identify here
      specific histone modifications as facilitators of chromosome breakage and
      translocations. We show enrichment of several histone modifications over
      clinically relevant translocation-prone genome regions. Experimental modulation
      of histone marks sensitizes genome regions to breakage by endonuclease challenge 
      or irradiation and promotes formation of chromosome translocations of endogenous 
      gene loci. Our results demonstrate that histone modifications predispose genome
      regions to chromosome breakage and translocations.

      transcription by chaperone Spt2.
PG  - 1326-40
LID - 10.1101/gad.261115.115 [doi]
AB  - Cells use specific mechanisms such as histone chaperones to abrogate the inherent
      barrier that the nucleosome poses to transcribing polymerases. The current model 
      postulates that nucleosomes can be transiently disrupted to accommodate passage
      of RNA polymerases and that histones H3 and H4 possess their own chaperones
      dedicated to the recovery of nucleosomes. Here, we determined the crystal
      structure of the conserved C terminus of human Suppressors of Ty insertions 2
      (hSpt2C) chaperone bound to an H3/H4 tetramer. The structural studies demonstrate
      that hSpt2C is bound to the periphery of the H3/H4 tetramer, mimicking the
      trajectory of nucleosomal-bound DNA. These structural studies have been
      complemented with in vitro binding and in vivo functional studies on mutants that
      disrupt key intermolecular contacts involving two acidic patches and hydrophobic 
      residues on Spt2C. We show that contacts between both human and yeast Spt2C with 
      the H3/H4 tetramer are required for the suppression of H3/H4 exchange as measured
      by H3K56ac and new H3 deposition. These interactions are also crucial for the
      inhibition of spurious transcription from within coding regions. Together, our
      data indicate that Spt2 interacts with the periphery of the H3/H4 tetramer and
      promotes its recycling in the wake of RNA polymerase.

      activity by resveratrol.
PG  - 1316-25
LID - 10.1101/gad.265462.115 [doi]
AB  - Sirtuins with an extended N-terminal domain (NTD), represented by yeast Sir2 and 
      human SIRT1, harbor intrinsic mechanisms for regulation of their NAD-dependent
      deacetylase activities. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms is crucial for
      understanding the biological functions of sirtuins and development of potential
      therapeutics. In particular, SIRT1 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic
      target, and the search for SIRT1-activating compounds (STACs) has been actively
      pursued. However, the effectiveness of a class of reported STACs (represented by 
      resveratrol) as direct SIRT1 activators is under debate due to the complication
      involving the use of fluorogenic substrates in in vitro assays. Future efforts of
      SIRT1-based therapeutics necessitate the dissection of the molecular mechanism of
      SIRT1 stimulation. We solved the structure of SIRT1 in complex with resveratrol
      and a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-containing peptide. The structure reveals
      the presence of three resveratrol molecules, two of which mediate the interaction
      between the AMC peptide and the NTD of SIRT1. The two NTD-bound resveratrol
      molecules are principally responsible for promoting tighter binding between SIRT1
      and the peptide and the stimulation of SIRT1 activity. The structural information
      provides valuable insights into regulation of SIRT1 activity and should benefit
      the development of authentic SIRT1 activators.

TI  - Homeostatic control of Hippo signaling activity revealed by an endogenous
      activating mutation in YAP.
PG  - 1285-97
LID - 10.1101/gad.264234.115 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway converges on YAP to regulate growth, differentiation,
      and regeneration. Previous studies with overexpressed proteins have shown that
      YAP is phosphorylated by its upstream kinase, Lats1/2, on multiple sites,
      including an evolutionarily conserved 14-3-3-binding site whose phosphorylation
      is believed to inhibit YAP by excluding it from the nucleus. Indeed, nuclear
      localization of YAP or decreased YAP phosphorylation at this site (S168 in
      Drosophila, S127 in humans, and S112 in mice) is widely used in current
      literature as a surrogate of YAP activation even though the physiological
      importance of this phosphorylation event in regulating endogenous YAP activity
      has not been defined. Here we address this question by introducing a Yap(S112A)
      knock-in mutation in the endogenous Yap locus. The Yap(S112A) mice are
      surprisingly normal despite nuclear localization of the mutant YAP protein in
      vivo and profound defects in cytoplasmic translocation in vitro. Interestingly,
      the mutant Yap(S112A) mice show a compensatory decrease in YAP protein levels due
      to increased phosphorylation at a mammalian-specific phosphodegron site on YAP.
      These findings reveal a robust homeostatic mechanism that maintains physiological
      levels of YAP activity and caution against the assumptive use of YAP localization
      alone as a surrogate of YAP activity.

TI  - A YAP/TAZ-induced feedback mechanism regulates Hippo pathway homeostasis.
PG  - 1271-84
LID - 10.1101/gad.262816.115 [doi]
AB  - YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with
      PDZ-binding motif) are major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway that
      influences tissue homeostasis, organ size, and cancer development. Aberrant
      hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ causes tissue overgrowth and tumorigenesis, whereas
      their inactivation impairs tissue development and regeneration. Dynamic and
      precise control of YAP/TAZ activity is thus important to ensure proper
      physiological regulation and homeostasis of the cells. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ
      activation results in activation of their negative regulators, LATS1/2 (large
      tumor suppressor 1/2) kinases, to constitute a negative feedback loop of the
      Hippo pathway in both cultured cells and mouse tissues. YAP/TAZ in complex with
      the transcription factor TEAD (TEA domain family member) directly induce LATS2
      expression. Furthermore, YAP/TAZ also stimulate the kinase activity of LATS1/2
      through inducing NF2 (neurofibromin 2). This feedback regulation is responsible
      for the transient activation of YAP upon lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) stimulation 
      and the inhibition of YAP-induced cell migration. Thus, this LATS-mediated
      feedback loop provides an efficient mechanism to establish the robustness and
      homeostasis of YAP/TAZ regulation.

LID - 10.1101/gad.257840.114 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation is essential for protecting the mammalian germline against
      transposons. When DNA methylation-based transposon control is defective, meiotic 
      chromosome pairing is consistently impaired during spermatogenesis: How and why
      meiosis is vulnerable to transposon activity is unknown. Using two DNA
      methylation-deficient backgrounds, the Dnmt3L and Miwi2 mutant mice, we reveal
      that DNA methylation is largely dispensable for silencing transposons before
      meiosis onset. After this, it becomes crucial to back up to a developmentally
      programmed H3K9me2 loss. Massive retrotransposition does not occur following
      transposon derepression, but the meiotic chromatin landscape is profoundly
      affected. Indeed, H3K4me3 marks gained over transcriptionally active transposons 
      correlate with formation of SPO11-dependent double-strand breaks and recruitment 
      of the DMC1 repair enzyme in Dnmt3L(-/-) meiotic cells, whereas these features
      are normally exclusive to meiotic recombination hot spots. Here, we demonstrate
      that DNA methylation restrains transposons from adopting chromatin
      characteristics amenable to meiotic recombination, which we propose prevents the 
      occurrence of erratic chromosomal events.

LID - 10.1101/gad.257071.114 [doi]
AB  - Transcription factor-mediated reprograming is a powerful method to study cell
      fate changes. In this study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Gata6
      can initiate reprograming of multiple cell types to induced extraembryonic
      endoderm stem (iXEN) cells. Intriguingly, Gata6 is sufficient to drive iXEN cells
      from mouse pluripotent cells and differentiated neural cells. Furthermore, GATA6 
      induction in human embryonic stem (hES) cells also down-regulates pluripotency
      gene expression and up-regulates extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) genes, revealing 
      a conserved function in mediating this cell fate switch. Profiling
      transcriptional changes following Gata6 induction in mES cells reveals step-wise 
      pluripotency factor disengagement, with initial repression of Nanog and Esrrb,
      then Sox2, and finally Oct4, alongside step-wise activation of ExEn genes.
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation and subsequent high-throughput sequencing analysis 
      shows Gata6 enrichment near pluripotency and endoderm genes, suggesting that
      Gata6 functions as both a direct repressor and activator. Together, this
      demonstrates that Gata6 is a versatile and potent reprograming factor that can
      act alone to drive a cell fate switch from diverse cell types.

AB  - TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) plays a central role in regulating growth, 
      development, and behavior in response to nutrient cues. We previously showed that
      leucine-derived monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFAs) and derived
      glucosylceramide promote intestinal TORC1 activity for post-embryonic development
      and foraging behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that
      clathrin/adaptor protein 1 (AP-1)-dependent intestinal apical membrane polarity
      and polarity-dependent localization of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase)
      mediate the impact of the lipid pathway on intestinal TORC1 activation. Moreover,
      NPRL-3 represses mmBCFA-dependent intestinal TORC1 activity at least partly by
      regulating apical membrane polarity. Our results provide new insights into TORC1 
      regulation by lipids and membrane polarity in a specific tissue.

PG  - 1203-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.261982.115 [doi]
AB  - Tissues with defined cellular hierarchies in development and homeostasis give
      rise to tumors with cellular hierarchies, suggesting that tumors recapitulate
      specific tissues and mimic their origins. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most
      prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor and contains self-renewing,
      tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contribute to tumor initiation and
      therapeutic resistance. As normal stem and progenitor cells participate in tissue
      development and repair, these developmental programs re-emerge in CSCs to support
      the development and progressive growth of tumors. Elucidation of the molecular
      mechanisms that govern CSCs has informed the development of novel targeted
      therapeutics for GBM and other brain cancers. CSCs are not self-autonomous units;
      rather, they function within an ecological system, both actively remodeling the
      microenvironment and receiving critical maintenance cues from their niches. To
      fulfill the future goal of developing novel therapies to collapse CSC dynamics,
      drawing parallels to other normal and pathological states that are highly
      interactive with their microenvironments and that use developmental signaling
      pathways will be beneficial.

TI  - The nucleoporin Nup153 regulates embryonic stem cell pluripotency through gene
      silencing.
PG  - 1224-38
LID - 10.1101/gad.260919.115 [doi]
AB  - Nucleoporins (Nups) are a family of proteins best known as the constituent
      building blocks of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), membrane-embedded channels that
      mediate nuclear transport across the nuclear envelope. Recent evidence suggests
      that several Nups have additional roles in controlling the activation and
      silencing of developmental genes; however, the mechanistic details of these
      functions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that depletion of Nup153 in
      mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) causes the derepression of developmental genes
      and induction of early differentiation. This loss of stem cell identity is not
      associated with defects in the nuclear import of key pluripotency factors.
      Rather, Nup153 binds around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of developmental
      genes and mediates the recruitment of the polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to
      a subset of its target loci. Our results demonstrate a chromatin-associated role 
      of Nup153 in maintaining stem cell pluripotency by functioning in mammalian
      epigenetic gene silencing.

TI  - Mutant p53 cooperates with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate
      VEGFR2 in breast cancer cells.
PG  - 1298-315
LID - 10.1101/gad.263202.115 [doi]
AB  - Mutant p53 impacts the expression of numerous genes at the level of transcription
      to mediate oncogenesis. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2 (VEGFR2), the primary functional VEGF receptor that mediates endothelial cell
      vascularization, as a mutant p53 transcriptional target in multiple breast cancer
      cell lines. Up-regulation of VEGFR2 mediates the role of mutant p53 in increasing
      cellular growth in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture
      conditions. Mutant p53 binds near the VEGFR2 promoter transcriptional start site 
      and plays a role in maintaining an open conformation at that location. Relatedly,
      mutant p53 interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, which is required for remodeling
      the VEGFR2 promoter. By both querying individual genes regulated by mutant p53
      and performing RNA sequencing, the results indicate that >40% of all mutant
      p53-regulated gene expression is mediated by SWI/SNF. We surmise that mutant p53 
      impacts transcription of VEGFR2 as well as myriad other genes by promoter
      remodeling through interaction with and likely regulation of the SWI/SNF
      chromatin remodeling complex. Therefore, not only might mutant p53-expressing
      tumors be susceptible to anti VEGF therapies, impacting SWI/SNF tumor suppressor 
      function in mutant p53 tumors may also have therapeutic potential.

TI  - Mechanism of regulation of 'chromosome kissing' induced by Fob1 and its
      physiological significance.

LID - 10.1101/gad.260844.115 [doi]
AB  - Protein-mediated "chromosome kissing" between two DNA sites in trans (or in cis) 
      is known to facilitate three-dimensional control of gene expression and DNA
      replication. However, the mechanisms of regulation of the long-range interactions
      are unknown. Here, we show that the replication terminator protein Fob1 of
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoted chromosome kissing that initiated rDNA
      recombination and controlled the replicative life span (RLS). Oligomerization of 
      Fob1 caused synaptic (kissing) interactions between pairs of terminator (Ter)
      sites that initiated recombination in rDNA. Fob1 oligomerization and Ter-Ter
      kissing were regulated by intramolecular inhibitory interactions between the
      C-terminal domain (C-Fob1) and the N-terminal domain (N-Fob1). Phosphomimetic
      substitutions of specific residues of C-Fob1 counteracted the inhibitory
      interaction. A mutation in either N-Fob1 that blocked Fob1 oligomerization or
      C-Fob1 that blocked its phosphorylation antagonized chromosome kissing and
      recombination and enhanced the RLS. The results provide novel insights into a
      mechanism of regulation of Fob1-mediated chromosome kissing.

AB  - Topoisomerase IV (topo IV), an essential factor during chromosome segregation,
      resolves the catenated chromosomes at the end of each replication cycle. How the 
      decatenating activity of the topo IV is regulated during the early stages of the 
      chromosome cycle despite being in continuous association with the chromosome
      remains poorly understood. Here we report a novel cell cycle-regulated protein in
      Caulobacter crescentus, NstA (negative switch for topo IV decatenation activity),
      that inhibits the decatenation activity of the topo IV during early stages of the
      cell cycle. We demonstrate that in C. crescentus, NstA acts by binding to the
      ParC DNA-binding subunit of topo IV. Most importantly, we uncover a dynamic
      oscillation of the intracellular redox state during the cell cycle, which
      correlates with and controls NstA activity. Thus, we propose that predetermined
      dynamic intracellular redox fluctuations may act as a global regulatory switch to
      control cellular development and cell cycle progression and may help retain
      pathogens in a suitable cell cycle state when encountering redox stress from the 
      host immune response.

TI  - Minishelterins separate telomere length regulation and end protection in fission 
      yeast.
PG  - 1164-74
LID - 10.1101/gad.261123.115 [doi]
AB  - The conserved shelterin complex is critical for chromosome capping and
      maintaining telomere length homeostasis. In fission yeast, shelterin is comprised
      of five proteins. Taz1, Rap1, and Poz1 function as negative regulators of
      telomere elongation, whereas Pot1 and Tpz1 are critical for end capping and
      telomerase recruitment. How the five proteins work together to safeguard
      chromosome ends and promote telomere length homeostasis is a matter of great
      interest. Using a combination of deletions, fusions, and tethers, we define key
      elements of shelterin important for telomere length regulation. Surprisingly,
      deletion of the entire Rap1 and Poz1 proteins does not impair telomere length
      regulation as long as a static bridge is provided between Taz1 and Tpz1. Cells
      harboring minishelterin display wild-type telomere length and intact subtelomeric
      silencing. However, protection against end fusions in G1 is compromised in the
      absence of Rap1. Our data reveal a remarkable plasticity in shelterin
      architecture and separate functions in length regulation and end protection.

TI  - Sex comb on midleg (Scm) is a functional link between PcG-repressive complexes in
      Drosophila.
PG  - 1136-50
LID - 10.1101/gad.260562.115 [doi]
AB  - The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key regulators of development in Drosophila
      and are strongly implicated in human health and disease. How PcG complexes form
      repressive chromatin domains remains unclear. Using cross-linked affinity
      purifications of BioTAP-Polycomb (Pc) or BioTAP-Enhancer of zeste [E(z)], we
      captured all PcG-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) or PRC2 core components and Sex comb
      on midleg (Scm) as the only protein strongly enriched with both complexes.
      Although previously not linked to PRC2, we confirmed direct binding of Scm and
      PRC2 using recombinant protein expression and colocalization of Scm with PRC1,
      PRC2, and H3K27me3 in embryos and cultured cells using ChIP-seq (chromatin
      immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing). Furthermore, we found 
      that RNAi knockdown of Scm and overexpression of the dominant-negative Scm-SAM
      (sterile alpha motif) domain both affected the binding pattern of E(z) on
      polytene chromosomes. Aberrant localization of the Scm-SAM domain in long
      contiguous regions on polytene chromosomes revealed its independent ability to
      spread on chromatin, consistent with its previously described ability to
      oligomerize in vitro. Pull-downs of BioTAP-Scm captured PRC1 and PRC2 and
      additional repressive complexes, including PhoRC, LINT, and CtBP. We propose that
      Scm is a key mediator connecting PRC1, PRC2, and transcriptional silencing.
      Combined with previous structural and genetic analyses, our results strongly
      suggest that Scm coordinates PcG complexes and polymerizes to produce broad
      domains of PcG silencing.

TI  - The SLC36 transporter Pathetic is required for extreme dendrite growth in
      Drosophila sensory neurons.
PG  - 1120-35
LID - 10.1101/gad.259119.115 [doi]
AB  - Dendrites exhibit enormous diversity in form and can differ in size by several
      orders of magnitude even in a single animal. However, whether neurons with large 
      dendrite arbors have specialized mechanisms to support their growth demands is
      unknown. To address this question, we conducted a genetic screen for mutations
      that differentially affected growth in neurons with different-sized dendrite
      arbors. From this screen, we identified a mutant that selectively affects
      dendrite growth in neurons with large dendrite arbors without affecting dendrite 
      growth in neurons with small dendrite arbors or the animal overall. This mutant
      disrupts a putative amino acid transporter, Pathetic (Path), that localizes to
      the cell surface and endolysosomal compartments in neurons. Although Path is
      broadly expressed in neurons and nonneuronal cells, mutation of path impinges on 
      nutrient responses and protein homeostasis specifically in neurons with large
      dendrite arbors but not in other cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that 
      specialized molecular mechanisms exist to support growth demands in neurons with 
      large dendrite arbors and define Path as a founding member of this growth
      program.

TI  - Human telomerase: biogenesis, trafficking, recruitment, and activation.
PG  - 1095-105

AB  - Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein enzyme that catalyzes the extension of
      telomeric DNA in eukaryotes. Recent work has begun to reveal key aspects of the
      assembly of the human telomerase complex, its intracellular trafficking involving
      Cajal bodies, and its recruitment to telomeres. Once telomerase has been
      recruited to the telomere, it appears to undergo a separate activation step,
      which may include an increase in its repeat addition processivity. This review
      covers human telomerase biogenesis, trafficking, and activation, comparing key
      aspects with the analogous events in other species.

TI  - PDGFRalpha signaling drives adipose tissue fibrosis by targeting progenitor cell 
      plasticity.
PG  - 1106-19
LID - 10.1101/gad.260554.115 [doi]
AB  - Fibrosis is a common disease process in which profibrotic cells disturb organ
      function by secreting disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM). Adipose tissue
      fibrosis occurs during obesity and is associated with metabolic dysfunction, but 
      how profibrotic cells originate is still being elucidated. Here, we use a
      developmental model to investigate perivascular cells in white adipose tissue
      (WAT) and their potential to cause organ fibrosis. We show that a Nestin-Cre
      transgene targets perivascular cells (adventitial cells and pericyte-like cells) 
      in WAT, and Nestin-GFP specifically labels pericyte-like cells. Activation of
      PDGFRalpha signaling in perivascular cells causes them to transition into
      ECM-synthesizing profibrotic cells. Before this transition occurs, PDGFRalpha
      signaling up-regulates mTOR signaling and ribosome biogenesis pathways and
      perturbs the expression of a network of epigenetically imprinted genes that have 
      been implicated in cell growth and tissue homeostasis. Isolated Nestin-GFP(+)
      cells differentiate into adipocytes ex vivo and form WAT when transplanted into
      recipient mice. However, PDGFRalpha signaling opposes adipogenesis and generates 
      profibrotic cells instead, which leads to fibrotic WAT in transplant experiments.
      These results identify perivascular cells as fibro/adipogenic progenitors in WAT 
      and show that PDGFRalpha targets progenitor cell plasticity as a profibrotic
      mechanism.

TI  - A localized nucleolar DNA damage response facilitates recruitment of the
      homology-directed repair machinery independent of cell cycle stage.
PG  - 1151-63
LID - 10.1101/gad.260703.115 [doi]
AB  - DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two main pathways: nonhomologous 
      end-joining and homologous recombination (HR). Repair pathway choice is thought
      to be determined by cell cycle timing and chromatin context. Nucleoli, prominent 
      nuclear subdomains and sites of ribosome biogenesis, form around nucleolar
      organizer regions (NORs) that contain rDNA arrays located on human acrocentric
      chromosome p-arms. Actively transcribed rDNA repeats are positioned within the
      interior of the nucleolus, whereas sequences proximal and distal to NORs are
      packaged as heterochromatin located at the nucleolar periphery. NORs provide an
      opportunity to investigate the DSB response at highly transcribed, repetitive,
      and essential loci. Targeted introduction of DSBs into rDNA, but not abutting
      sequences, results in ATM-dependent inhibition of their transcription by RNA
      polymerase I. This is coupled with movement of rDNA from the nucleolar interior
      to anchoring points at the periphery. Reorganization renders rDNA accessible to
      repair factors normally excluded from nucleoli. Importantly, DSBs within rDNA
      recruit the HR machinery throughout the cell cycle. Additionally, unscheduled DNA
      synthesis, consistent with HR at damaged NORs, can be observed in G1 cells. These
      results suggest that HR can be templated in cis and suggest a role for
      chromosomal context in the maintenance of NOR genomic stability.

AB  - The assembly of a nervous system requires the extension of axons and dendrites to
      specific regions where they are matched with appropriate synaptic targets.
      Although the cues that guide long-range outgrowth have been characterized
      extensively, additional mechanisms are required to explain short-range guidance
      in neural development. Using a complementary combination of time-lapse imaging by
      fluorescence confocal microscopy and serial block-face electron microscopy, we
      identified a novel type of presynaptic projection that participates in the
      assembly of the vertebrate nervous system. Synapse formation by each hair cell of
      the zebrafish's lateral line occurs during a particular interval after the cell's
      birth. During the same period, projections emerge from the cellular soma,
      extending toward a specific subpopulation of mature hair cells and interacting
      with polarity-specific afferent nerve terminals. The terminals then extend along 
      the projections to reach appropriately matched presynaptic sites, after which the
      projections recede. Our results suggest that presynaptic projections act as
      transient scaffolds for short-range partner matching, a mechanism that may occur 
      elsewhere in the nervous system.

TI  - Position-specific binding of FUS to nascent RNA regulates mRNA length.
PG  - 1045-57
LID - 10.1101/gad.255737.114 [doi]
AB  - More than half of all human genes produce prematurely terminated polyadenylated
      short mRNAs. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. CLIP-seq 
      (cross-linking immunoprecipitation [CLIP] combined with deep sequencing) of FUS
      (fused in sarcoma) in neuronal cells showed that FUS is frequently clustered
      around an alternative polyadenylation (APA) site of nascent RNA. ChIP-seq
      (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing) of RNA
      polymerase II (RNAP II) demonstrated that FUS stalls RNAP II and prematurely
      terminates transcription. When an APA site is located upstream of an FUS cluster,
      FUS enhances polyadenylation by recruiting CPSF160 and up-regulates the
      alternative short transcript. In contrast, when an APA site is located downstream
      from an FUS cluster, polyadenylation is not activated, and the RNAP
      II-suppressing effect of FUS leads to down-regulation of the alternative short
      transcript. CAGE-seq (cap analysis of gene expression [CAGE] combined with deep
      sequencing) and PolyA-seq (a strand-specific and quantitative method for
      high-throughput sequencing of 3' ends of polyadenylated transcripts) revealed
      that position-specific regulation of mRNA lengths by FUS is operational in
      two-thirds of transcripts in neuronal cells, with enrichment in genes involved in
      synaptic activities.

PG  - 1032-44
LID - 10.1101/gad.260455.115 [doi]
AB  - MIWI catalytic activity is required for spermatogenesis, indicating that
      piRNA-guided cleavage is critical for germ cell development. To identify meiotic 
      piRNA targets, we augmented the mouse piRNA repertoire by introducing a human
      meiotic piRNA cluster. This triggered a spermatogenesis defect by inappropriately
      targeting the piRNA machinery to mouse mRNAs essential for germ cell development.
      Analysis of such de novo targets revealed a signature for pachytene piRNA target 
      recognition. This enabled identification of both transposable elements and
      meiotically expressed protein-coding genes as targets of native piRNAs. Cleavage 
      of genic targets began at the pachytene stage and resulted in progressive
      repression through meiosis, driven at least in part via the ping-pong cycle. Our 
      data support the idea that meiotic piRNA populations must be strongly selected to
      enable successful spermatogenesis, both driving the response away from essential 
      genes and directing the pathway toward mRNA targets that are regulated by small
      RNAs in meiotic cells.

AB  - Copy number heterogeneity is a prominent feature within tumors. The molecular
      basis for this heterogeneity remains poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate
      that hypoxia induces transient site-specific copy gains (TSSGs) in primary,
      nontransformed, and transformed human cells. Hypoxia-driven copy gains are not
      dependent on HIF1alpha or HIF2alpha; however, they are dependent on the KDM4A
      histone demethylase and are blocked by inhibition of KDM4A with a small molecule 
      or the natural metabolite succinate. Furthermore, this response is conserved at a
      syntenic region in zebrafish cells. Regions with site-specific copy gain are also
      enriched for amplifications in hypoxic primary tumors. These tumors exhibited
      amplification and overexpression of the drug resistance gene CKS1B, which we
      recapitulated in hypoxic breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that
      hypoxia provides a biological stimulus to create transient site-specific copy
      alterations that could result in heterogeneity within tumors and cell
      populations. These findings have major implications in our understanding of copy 
      number heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance genes in cancer.

PG  - 989-99
LID - 10.1101/gad.262758.115 [doi]
AB  - Two Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated proteins, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 
      and the E3-ubiquitin (Ub) ligase PARKIN, are central to mitochondrial quality
      control. In this pathway, PINK1 accumulates on defective mitochondria, eliciting 
      the translocation of PARKIN from the cytosol to mediate the clearance of damaged 
      mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). Throughout the different stages of
      mitophagy, post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical for the
      regulation of PINK1 and PARKIN activity and function. Indeed, activation and
      recruitment of PARKIN onto damaged mitochondria involves PINK1-mediated
      phosphorylation of both PARKIN and Ub. Through a stepwise cascade, PARKIN is
      converted from an autoinhibited enzyme into an active phospho-Ub-dependent E3
      ligase. Upon activation, PARKIN ubiquitinates itself in concert with many
      different mitochondrial substrates. The Ub conjugates attached to these
      substrates can in turn be phosphorylated by PINK1, which triggers further cycles 
      of PARKIN recruitment and activation. This feed-forward amplification loop
      regulates both PARKIN activity and mitophagy. However, the precise steps and
      sequence of PTMs in this cascade are only now being uncovered. For instance, the 
      Ub conjugates assembled by PARKIN consist predominantly of noncanonical K6-linked
      Ub chains. Moreover, these modifications are reversible and can be disassembled
      by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including Ub-specific protease 8 (USP8),
      USP15, and USP30. However, PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ub can impede the
      activity of these DUBs, adding a new layer of complexity to the regulation of
      PARKIN-mediated mitophagy by PTMs. It is therefore evident that further insight
      into how PTMs regulate the PINK1-PARKIN pathway will be critical for our
      understanding of mitochondrial quality control.

AB  - Budding yeast Mph1 helicase and its orthologs drive multiple DNA transactions.
      Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate these motor proteins is central to
      understanding genome maintenance processes. Here, we show that the conserved
      histone fold MHF complex promotes Mph1-mediated repair of damaged replication
      forks but does not influence the outcome of DNA double-strand break repair.
      Mechanistically, scMHF relieves the inhibition imposed by the structural
      maintenance of chromosome protein Smc5 on Mph1 activities relevant to
      replication-associated repair through binding to Mph1 but not DNA. Thus, scMHF is
      a function-specific enhancer of Mph1 that enables flexible response to different 
      genome repair situations.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major contributor to cancer-related mortality. 
      LIN28A and LIN28B are highly related RNA-binding protein paralogs that regulate
      biogenesis of let-7 microRNAs and influence development, metabolism, tissue
      regeneration, and oncogenesis. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of either 
      LIN28 paralog cooperates with the Wnt pathway to promote invasive intestinal
      adenocarcinoma in murine models. When LIN28 alone is induced genetically, half of
      the resulting tumors harbor Ctnnb1 (beta-catenin) mutation. When overexpressed in
      Apc(Min/+) mice, LIN28 accelerates tumor formation and enhances proliferation and
      invasiveness. In conditional genetic models, enforced expression of a
      LIN28-resistant form of the let-7 microRNA reduces LIN28-induced tumor burden,
      while silencing of LIN28 expression reduces tumor volume and increases tumor
      differentiation, indicating that LIN28 contributes to tumor maintenance. We
      detected aberrant expression of LIN28A and/or LIN28B in 38% of a large series of 
      human CRC samples (n = 595), where LIN28 expression levels were associated with
      invasive tumor growth. Our late-stage CRC murine models and analysis of primary
      human tumors demonstrate prominent roles for both LIN28 paralogs in promoting CRC
      growth and progression and implicate the LIN28/let-7 pathway as a therapeutic
      target.

AB  - Specific recognition of centromere-specific histone variant CENP-A-containing
      chromatin by CENP-N is an essential process in the assembly of the kinetochore
      complex at centromeres prior to mammalian cell division. However, the mechanisms 
      of CENP-N recruitment to centromeres/kinetochores remain unknown. Here, we show
      that a CENP-A-specific RG loop (Arg80/Gly81) plays an essential and dual
      regulatory role in this process. The RG loop assists the formation of a compact
      "ladder-like" structure of CENP-A chromatin, concealing the loop and thus
      impairing its role in recruiting CENP-N. Upon G1/S-phase transition, however,
      centromeric chromatin switches from the compact to an open state, enabling the
      now exposed RG loop to recruit CENP-N prior to cell division. Our results provide
      the first insights into the mechanisms by which the recruitment of CENP-N is
      regulated by the structural transitions between compaction and relaxation of
      centromeric chromatin during the cell cycle.

TI  - Regulation of recombination at yeast nuclear pores controls repair and triplet
      repeat stability.
PG  - 1006-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.256404.114 [doi]
AB  - Secondary structure-forming DNA sequences such as CAG repeats interfere with
      replication and repair, provoking fork stalling, chromosome fragility, and
      recombination. In budding yeast, we found that expanded CAG repeats are more
      likely than unexpanded repeats to localize to the nuclear periphery. This
      positioning is transient, occurs in late S phase, requires replication, and is
      associated with decreased subnuclear mobility of the locus. In contrast to
      persistent double-stranded breaks, expanded CAG repeats at the nuclear envelope
      associate with pores but not with the inner nuclear membrane protein Mps3.
      Relocation requires Nup84 and the Slx5/8 SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase but not 
      Rad51, Mec1, or Tel1. Importantly, the presence of the Nup84 pore subcomplex and 
      Slx5/8 suppresses CAG repeat fragility and instability. Repeat instability in
      nup84, slx5, or slx8 mutant cells arises through aberrant homologous
      recombination and is distinct from instability arising from the loss of ligase
      4-dependent end-joining. Genetic and physical analysis of Rad52 sumoylation and
      binding at the CAG tract suggests that Slx5/8 targets sumoylated Rad52 for
      degradation at the pore to facilitate recovery from acute replication stress by
      promoting replication fork restart. We thereby confirmed that the relocation of
      damage to nuclear pores plays an important role in a naturally occurring repair
      process.

LID - 10.1101/gad.251520.114 [doi]
AB  - Plants flower in an appropriate season to allow sufficient vegetative development
      and position flower development in favorable environments. In Arabidopsis,
      CONSTANS (CO) and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1) promote flowering by 
      inducing FLOWER LOCUS T (FT) expression in the long-day afternoon. The CO protein
      is present in the morning but could not activate FT expression due to unknown
      negative mechanisms, which prevent premature flowering before the day length
      reaches a threshold. Here, we report that TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) and related
      proteins interact with the activation domain of CO and CO-like (COL) proteins and
      inhibit CO activity. TOE1 binds to the FT promoter near the CO-binding site, and 
      reducing TOE function results in a morning peak of the FT mRNA. In addition, TOE1
      interacts with the LOV domain of FKF1 and likely interferes with the FKF1-CO
      interaction, resulting in partial degradation of the CO protein in the afternoon 
      to prevent premature flowering.

AB  - We developed a method for genome-wide mapping of DNA excision repair named XR-seq
      (excision repair sequencing). Human nucleotide excision repair generates two
      incisions surrounding the site of damage, creating an approximately 30-mer. In
      XR-seq, this fragment is isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. We
      used XR-seq to produce stranded, nucleotide-resolution maps of repair of two
      UV-induced DNA damages in human cells: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and
      (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs]. In wild-type cells, CPD
      repair was highly associated with transcription, specifically with the template
      strand. Experiments in cells defective in either transcription-coupled excision
      repair or general excision repair isolated the contribution of each pathway to
      the overall repair pattern and showed that transcription-coupled repair of both
      photoproducts occurs exclusively on the template strand. XR-seq maps capture
      transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and
      bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. XR-seq data also
      uncovered the repair characteristics and novel sequence preferences of CPDs and
      (6-4)PPs. XR-seq and the resulting repair maps will facilitate studies of the
      effects of genomic location, chromatin context, transcription, and replication on
      DNA repair in human cells.

AB  - MAF1 is a global repressor of RNA polymerase III transcription that regulates the
      expression of highly abundant noncoding RNAs in response to nutrient availability
      and cellular stress. Thus, MAF1 function is thought to be important for metabolic
      economy. Here we show that a whole-body knockout of Maf1 in mice confers
      resistance to diet-induced obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by
      reducing food intake and increasing metabolic inefficiency. Energy expenditure in
      Maf1(-/-) mice is increased by several mechanisms. Precursor tRNA synthesis was
      increased in multiple tissues without significant effects on mature tRNA levels, 
      implying increased turnover in a futile tRNA cycle. Elevated futile cycling of
      hepatic lipids was also observed. Metabolite profiling of the liver and skeletal 
      muscle revealed elevated levels of many amino acids and spermidine, which links
      the induction of autophagy in Maf1(-/-) mice with their extended life span. The
      increase in spermidine was accompanied by reduced levels of nicotinamide
      N-methyltransferase, which promotes polyamine synthesis, enables nicotinamide
      salvage to regenerate NAD(+), and is associated with obesity resistance.
      Consistent with this, NAD(+) levels were increased in muscle. The importance of
      MAF1 for metabolic economy reveals the potential for MAF1 modulators to protect
      against obesity and its harmful consequences.

PG  - 923-33
LID - 10.1101/gad.259309.115 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation patterns are set up in a relatively fixed programmed manner
      during normal embryonic development and are then stably maintained. Using
      genome-wide analysis, we discovered a postnatal pathway involving gender-specific
      demethylation that occurs exclusively in the male liver. This demodification is
      programmed to take place at tissue-specific enhancer sequences, and our data show
      that the methylation state at these loci is associated with and appears to play a
      role in the transcriptional regulation of nearby genes. This process is mediated 
      by the secretion of testosterone at the time of sexual maturity, but the
      resulting methylation profile is stable and therefore can serve as an epigenetic 
      memory even in the absence of this inducer. These findings add a new dimension to
      our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in vivo and provide the
      foundations for deciphering how environment can impact on the epigenetic
      regulation of genes in general.

AB  - The fundamental question of which genes are most important in controlling liver
      regeneration remains unanswered. We employed a parallel screen to test the impact
      of 43 selected genes on liver repopulation in the Fah(-/-) mouse model of
      hereditary tyrosinemia. We discovered that the transcription factor Foxa3 was a
      strong promoter of liver regeneration, while tumor necrosis factor receptor 1
      (TNFR1) was the most significant suppressor of repopulation among all of the
      genes tested. Our approach enabled the identification of these factors as
      important regulators of liver repopulation and potential drug targets for the
      promotion of liver repopulation.

PG  - 898-903
LID - 10.1101/gad.261743.115 [doi]
AB  - Aneuploidy-the gain or loss of one or more whole chromosome-typically has an
      adverse impact on organismal fitness, manifest in conditions such as Down
      syndrome. A central question is whether aneuploid phenotypes are the consequence 
      of copy number changes of a few especially harmful genes that may be present on
      the extra chromosome or are caused by copy number alterations of many genes that 
      confer no observable phenotype when varied individually. We used the
      proliferation defect exhibited by budding yeast strains carrying single
      additional chromosomes (disomes) to distinguish between the "few critical genes" 
      hypothesis and the "mass action of genes" hypothesis. Our results indicate that
      subtle changes in gene dosage across a chromosome can have significant phenotypic
      consequences. We conclude that phenotypic thresholds can be crossed by mass
      action of copy number changes that, on their own, are benign.

AB  - The key RNA sequence elements and protein factors necessary for 3' processing of 
      polyadenylated mRNA precursors are well known. Recent studies, however, have
      significantly reshaped current models for the protein-RNA interactions involved
      in poly(A) site recognition, painting a picture more complex than previously
      envisioned and also providing new insights into regulation of this important step
      in gene expression. Here we review the recent advances in this area and provide a
      perspective for future studies.

TI  - Structural mechanisms of DREAM complex assembly and regulation.
PG  - 961-74
LID - 10.1101/gad.257568.114 [doi]
AB  - The DREAM complex represses cell cycle genes during quiescence through
      scaffolding MuvB proteins with E2F4/5 and the Rb tumor suppressor paralog p107 or
      p130. Upon cell cycle entry, MuvB dissociates from p107/p130 and recruits B-Myb
      and FoxM1 for up-regulating mitotic gene expression. To understand the
      biochemical mechanisms underpinning DREAM function and regulation, we
      investigated the structural basis for DREAM assembly. We identified a sequence in
      the MuvB component LIN52 that binds directly to the pocket domains of p107 and
      p130 when phosphorylated on the DYRK1A kinase site S28. A crystal structure of
      the LIN52-p107 complex reveals that LIN52 uses a suboptimal LxSxExL sequence
      together with the phosphate at nearby S28 to bind the LxCxE cleft of the pocket
      domain with high affinity. The structure explains the specificity for p107/p130
      over Rb in the DREAM complex and how the complex is disrupted by viral
      oncoproteins. Based on insights from the structure, we addressed how DREAM is
      disassembled upon cell cycle entry. We found that p130 and B-Myb can both bind
      the core MuvB complex simultaneously but that cyclin-dependent kinase
      phosphorylation of p130 weakens its association. Together, our data inform a
      novel target interface for studying MuvB and p130 function and the design of
      inhibitors that prevent tumor escape in quiescence.

TI  - Loss of TET2 in hematopoietic cells leads to DNA hypermethylation of active
      enhancers and induction of leukemogenesis.
PG  - 910-22
LID - 10.1101/gad.260174.115 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation is tightly regulated throughout mammalian development, and
      altered DNA methylation patterns are a general hallmark of cancer. The
      methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 is frequently mutated in hematological disorders,
      including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has been suggested to protect CG
      dinucleotide (CpG) islands and promoters from aberrant DNA methylation. In this
      study, we present a novel Tet2-dependent leukemia mouse model that closely
      recapitulates gene expression profiles and hallmarks of human AML1-ETO-induced
      AML. Using this model, we show that the primary effect of Tet2 loss in
      preleukemic hematopoietic cells is progressive and widespread DNA
      hypermethylation affecting up to 25% of active enhancer elements. In contrast,
      CpG island and promoter methylation does not change in a Tet2-dependent manner
      but increases relative to population doublings. We confirmed this specific
      enhancer hypermethylation phenotype in human AML patients with TET2 mutations.
      Analysis of immediate gene expression changes reveals rapid deregulation of a
      large number of genes implicated in tumorigenesis, including many down-regulated 
      tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we propose that TET2 prevents leukemic
      transformation by protecting enhancers from aberrant DNA methylation and that it 
      is the combined silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in TET2 mutated
      hematopoietic cells that contributes to increased stem cell proliferation and
      leukemogenesis.

      protein and nucleotide sequences.
PG  - 876-86
LID - 10.1101/gad.259358.115 [doi]
AB  - Repetitive nucleotide or amino acid sequences are often engineered into probes
      and biosensors to achieve functional readouts and robust signal amplification.
      However, these repeated sequences are notoriously prone to aberrant deletion and 
      degradation, impacting the ability to correctly detect and interpret biological
      functions. Here, we introduce a facile and generalizable approach to solve this
      often unappreciated problem by modifying the nucleotide sequences of the target
      mRNA to make them nonrepetitive but still functional ("synonymous"). We first
      demonstrated the procedure by designing a cassette of synonymous MS2 RNA motifs
      and tandem coat proteins for RNA imaging and showed a dramatic improvement in
      signal and reproducibility in single-RNA detection in live cells. The same
      approach was extended to enhancing the stability of engineered fluorescent
      biosensors containing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of
      fluorescent proteins on which a great majority of systems thus far in the field
      are based. Using the synonymous modification to FRET biosensors, we achieved
      correct expression of full-length sensors, eliminating the aberrant truncation
      products that often were assumed to be due to nonspecific proteolytic cleavages. 
      Importantly, the biological interpretations of the sensor are significantly
      different when a correct, full-length biosensor is expressed. Thus, we show here 
      a useful and generally applicable method to maintain the integrity of expressed
      genes, critical for the correct interpretation of probe readouts.

AB  - Maturation of the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) in eukaryotes is a complex and
      highly coordinated process that requires the concerted action of a large,
      dynamic, ribonucleoprotein complex, the LSU processome. While we know that >80
      ribosome biogenesis factors are required throughout the course of LSU assembly,
      little is known about how these factors interact with each other within the LSU
      processome. To interrogate its organization and architecture, we took a systems
      biology approach and performed a semi-high-throughput, array-based, directed
      yeast two-hybrid assay. Assaying 4800 protein-protein interactions, we identified
      232 high-confidence, binary-interacting protein pairs, representing a fourfold
      increase from current knowledge. The resulting LSU processome interactome map has
      enhanced our understanding of the organization and function of the biogenesis
      factors within the LSU processome, revealing both novel and previously identified
      subcomplexes and hub proteins, including Nop4.

TI  - Pcf11 orchestrates transcription termination pathways in yeast.
PG  - 849-61
LID - 10.1101/gad.251470.114 [doi]
AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, short noncoding RNA (ncRNA) generated by RNA
      polymerase II (Pol II) are terminated by the NRD complex consisting of Nrd1,
      Nab3, and Sen1. We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and
      polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent
      transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain
      (CTD)-interacting domain (CID). Pcf11 localizes downstream from Nrd1 on NRD
      terminators, and its recruitment depends on Nrd1. Furthermore, mutation of the
      Pcf11 CID results in Nrd1 retention on chromatin, delayed degradation of ncRNA,
      and restricted Pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation and Sen1-Pol II interaction.
      Finally, the pcf11-13 and sen1-1 mutant phenotypes are very similar, as both
      accumulate RNA:DNA hybrids and display Pol II pausing downstream from NRD
      terminators. We predict a mechanism by which the exchange of Nrd1 and Pcf11 on
      chromatin facilitates Pol II pausing and CTD Ser2-P phosphorylation. This in turn
      promotes Sen1 activity that is required for NRD-dependent transcription
      termination in vivo.

TI  - Myc and SAGA rewire an alternative splicing network during early somatic cell
      reprogramming.
PG  - 803-16
LID - 10.1101/gad.255109.114 [doi]
AB  - Embryonic stem cells are maintained in a self-renewing and pluripotent state by
      multiple regulatory pathways. Pluripotent-specific transcriptional networks are
      sequentially reactivated as somatic cells reprogram to achieve pluripotency. How 
      epigenetic regulators modulate this process and contribute to somatic cell
      reprogramming is not clear. Here we performed a functional RNAi screen to
      identify the earliest epigenetic regulators required for reprogramming. We
      identified components of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, in
      particular Gcn5, as critical regulators of reprogramming initiation. Furthermore,
      we showed in mouse pluripotent stem cells that Gcn5 strongly associates with Myc 
      and that, upon initiation of somatic reprogramming, Gcn5 and Myc form a positive 
      feed-forward loop that activates a distinct alternative splicing network and the 
      early acquisition of pluripotency-associated splicing events. These studies
      expose a Myc-SAGA pathway that drives expression of an essential alternative
      splicing regulatory network during somatic cell reprogramming.

AB  - Mammalian cells mostly rely on extracellular molecules to transfer signals to
      other cells. However, in stress conditions, more robust mechanisms might be
      necessary to facilitate cell-cell communications. Cellular senescence, a stress
      response associated with permanent exit from the cell cycle and the development
      of an immunogenic phenotype, limits both tumorigenesis and tissue damage.
      Paradoxically, the long-term presence of senescent cells can promote tissue
      damage and aging within their microenvironment. Soluble factors secreted from
      senescent cells mediate some of these cell-nonautonomous effects. However, it is 
      unknown whether senescent cells impact neighboring cells by other mechanisms.
      Here we show that senescent cells directly transfer proteins to neighboring cells
      and that this process facilitates immune surveillance of senescent cells by
      natural killer (NK) cells. We found that transfer of proteins to NK and T cells
      is increased in the murine preneoplastic pancreas, a site where senescent cells
      are present in vivo. Proteomic analysis and functional studies of the transferred
      proteins revealed that the transfer is strictly dependent on cell-cell contact
      and CDC42-regulated actin polymerization and is mediated at least partially by
      cytoplasmic bridges. These findings reveal a novel mode of intercellular
      communication by which senescent cells regulate their immune surveillance and
      might impact tumorigenesis and tissue aging.

TI  - Regulation of early T-lineage gene expression and developmental progression by
      the progenitor cell transcription factor PU.1.
PG  - 832-48
LID - 10.1101/gad.259879.115 [doi]
AB  - The ETS family transcription factor PU.1 is essential for the development of
      several blood lineages, including T cells, but its function in intrathymic T-cell
      precursors has been poorly defined. In the thymus, high PU.1 expression persists 
      through multiple cell divisions in early stages but then falls sharply during
      T-cell lineage commitment. PU.1 silencing is critical for T-cell commitment, but 
      it has remained unknown how PU.1 activities could contribute positively to T-cell
      development. Here we employed conditional knockout and modified antagonist PU.1
      constructs to perturb PU.1 function stage-specifically in early T cells. We show 
      that PU.1 is needed for full proliferation, restricting access to some non-T
      fates, and controlling the timing of T-cell developmental progression such that
      removal or antagonism of endogenous PU.1 allows precocious access to T-cell
      differentiation. Dominant-negative effects reveal that this repression by PU.1 is
      mediated indirectly. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identifies novel targets 
      of PU.1 positive and negative regulation affecting progenitor cell signaling and 
      cell biology and indicating distinct regulatory effects on different subsets of
      progenitor cell transcription factors. Thus, in addition to supporting early
      T-cell proliferation, PU.1 regulates the timing of activation of the core
      T-lineage developmental program.

TI  - Oxygen-sensing PHDs regulate bone homeostasis through the modulation of
      osteoprotegerin.
PG  - 817-31
LID - 10.1101/gad.255000.114 [doi]
AB  - The bone microenvironment is composed of niches that house cells across variable 
      oxygen tensions. However, the contribution of oxygen gradients in regulating bone
      and blood homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we generated mice with either single
      or combined genetic inactivation of the critical oxygen-sensing prolyl
      hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes (PHD1-3) in osteoprogenitors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 
      (HIF) activation associated with Phd2 and Phd3 inactivation drove bone
      accumulation by modulating osteoblastic/osteoclastic cross-talk through the
      direct regulation of osteoprotegerin (OPG). In contrast, combined inactivation of
      Phd1, Phd2, and Phd3 resulted in extreme HIF signaling, leading to polycythemia
      and excessive bone accumulation by overstimulating angiogenic-osteogenic
      coupling. We also demonstrate that genetic ablation of Phd2 and Phd3 was
      sufficient to protect ovariectomized mice against bone loss without disrupting
      hematopoietic homeostasis. Importantly, we identify OPG as a HIF target gene
      capable of directing osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis to regulate bone
      homeostasis. Here, we show that coordinated activation of specific PHD isoforms
      fine-tunes the osteoblastic response to hypoxia, thereby directing two important 
      aspects of bone physiology: cross-talk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts and
      angiogenic-osteogenic coupling.

AB  - The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has garnered considerable attention due to
      its genetic links to Alzheimer's disease. Death receptor 6 (DR6) was recently
      shown to bind APP via the protein extracellular regions, stimulate axonal
      pruning, and inhibit synapse formation. Here, we report the crystal structure of 
      the DR6 ectodomain in complex with the E2 domain of APP and show that it supports
      a model for APP-induced dimerization and activation of cell surface DR6.

LID - 10.1101/gad.258293.115 [doi]
AB  - Bidirectional tRNA movement between the nucleus and the cytoplasm serves multiple
      biological functions. To gain a biochemical understanding of the mechanisms for
      tRNA subcellular dynamics, we developed in vivo beta-importin complex
      coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays using budding yeast. Our studies provide the
      first in vivo biochemical evidence that two beta-importin family members, Los1
      (exportin-t) and Msn5 (exportin-5), serve overlapping but distinct roles in tRNA 
      nuclear export. Los1 assembles complexes with RanGTP and tRNA. Both
      intron-containing pre-tRNAs and spliced tRNAs, regardless of whether they are
      aminoacylated, assemble into Los1-RanGTP complexes, documenting that Los1
      participates in both primary nuclear export and re-export of tRNAs to the
      cytoplasm. In contrast, beta-importin Msn5 preferentially assembles with RanGTP
      and spliced, aminoacylated tRNAs, documenting its role in tRNA nuclear re-export.
      Tef1/2 (the yeast form of translation elongation factor 1alpha [eEF1A]) aids the 
      specificity of Msn5 for aminoacylated tRNAs to form a quaternary complex
      consisting of Msn5, RanGTP, aminoacylated tRNA, and Tef1/2. Assembly and/or
      stability of this quaternary complex requires Tef1/2, thereby facilitating
      efficient re-export of aminoacylated tRNAs to the cytoplasm.

TI  - A conserved intronic U1 snRNP-binding sequence promotes trans-splicing in
      Drosophila.
PG  - 760-71
LID - 10.1101/gad.258863.115 [doi]
AB  - Unlike typical cis-splicing, trans-splicing joins exons from two separate
      transcripts to produce chimeric mRNA and has been detected in most eukaryotes.
      Trans-splicing in trypanosomes and nematodes has been characterized as a spliced 
      leader RNA-facilitated reaction; in contrast, its mechanism in higher eukaryotes 
      remains unclear. Here we investigate mod(mdg4), a classic trans-spliced gene in
      Drosophila, and report that two critical RNA sequences in the middle of the last 
      5' intron, TSA and TSB, promote trans-splicing of mod(mdg4). In TSA, a
      13-nucleotide (nt) core motif is conserved across Drosophila species and is
      essential and sufficient for trans-splicing, which binds U1 small nuclear RNP
      (snRNP) through strong base-pairing with U1 snRNA. In TSB, a conserved secondary 
      structure acts as an enhancer. Deletions of TSA and TSB using the CRISPR/Cas9
      system result in developmental defects in flies. Although it is not clear how the
      5' intron finds the 3' introns, compensatory changes in U1 snRNA rescue
      trans-splicing of TSA mutants, demonstrating that U1 recruitment is critical to
      promote trans-splicing in vivo. Furthermore, TSA core-like motifs are found in
      many other trans-spliced Drosophila genes, including lola. These findings
      represent a novel mechanism of trans-splicing, in which RNA motifs in the 5'
      intron are sufficient to bring separate transcripts into close proximity to
      promote trans-splicing.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) generates vast transcriptomic complexity in the
      vertebrate nervous system. However, the extent to which trans-acting splicing
      regulators and their target AS regulatory networks contribute to nervous system
      development is not well understood. To address these questions, we generated mice
      lacking the vertebrate- and neural-specific Ser/Arg repeat-related protein of 100
      kDa (nSR100/SRRM4). Loss of nSR100 impairs development of the central and
      peripheral nervous systems in part by disrupting neurite outgrowth, cortical
      layering in the forebrain, and axon guidance in the corpus callosum. Accompanying
      these developmental defects are widespread changes in AS that primarily result in
      shifts to nonneural patterns for different classes of splicing events. The main
      component of the altered AS program comprises 3- to 27-nucleotide (nt) neural
      microexons, an emerging class of highly conserved AS events associated with the
      regulation of protein interaction networks in developing neurons and neurological
      disorders. Remarkably, inclusion of a 6-nt, nSR100-activated microexon in Unc13b 
      transcripts is sufficient to rescue a neuritogenesis defect in nSR100 mutant
      primary neurons. These results thus reveal critical in vivo neurodevelopmental
      functions of nSR100 and further link these functions to a conserved program of
      neuronal microexon splicing.

TI  - miR-182 integrates apoptosis, growth, and differentiation programs in
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 732-45
LID - 10.1101/gad.257394.114 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal, therapy-resistant brain cancer
      consisting of numerous tumor cell subpopulations, including stem-like
      glioma-initiating cells (GICs), which contribute to tumor recurrence following
      initial response to therapy. Here, we identified miR-182 as a regulator of
      apoptosis, growth, and differentiation programs whose expression level is
      correlated with GBM patient survival. Repression of Bcl2-like12 (Bcl2L12), c-Met,
      and hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2A) is of central importance to miR-182
      anti-tumor activity, as it results in enhanced therapy susceptibility, decreased 
      GIC sphere size, expansion, and stemness in vitro. To evaluate the
      tumor-suppressive function of miR-182 in vivo, we synthesized miR-182-based
      spherical nucleic acids (182-SNAs); i.e., gold nanoparticles covalently
      functionalized with mature miR-182 duplexes. Intravenously administered 182-SNAs 
      penetrated the blood-brain/blood-tumor barriers (BBB/BTB) in orthotopic GBM
      xenografts and selectively disseminated throughout extravascular glioma
      parenchyma, causing reduced tumor burden and increased animal survival. Our
      results indicate that harnessing the anti-tumor activities of miR-182 via safe
      and robust delivery of 182-SNAs represents a novel strategy for therapeutic
      intervention in GBM.

AB  - Functional data indicate that specific histone modification enzymes can be key to
      longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans, but the molecular basis of how chromatin
      structure modulates longevity is not well understood. In this study, we profiled 
      the genome-wide pattern of trimethylation of Lys36 on histone 3 (H3K36me3) in the
      somatic cells of young and old Caenorhabditis elegans. We revealed a new role of 
      H3K36me3 in maintaining gene expression stability through aging with important
      consequences on longevity. We found that genes with dramatic expression change
      during aging are marked with low or even undetectable levels of H3K36me3 in their
      gene bodies irrespective of their corresponding mRNA abundance. Interestingly, 3'
      untranslated region (UTR) length strongly correlates with H3K36me3 levels and
      age-dependent mRNA expression stability. A similar negative correlation between
      H3K36me3 marking and mRNA expression change during aging was also observed in
      Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting a conserved mechanism for H3K36me3 in
      suppressing age-dependent mRNA expression change. Importantly, inactivation of
      the methyltransferase met-1 resulted in a decrease in global H3K36me3 marks, an
      increase in mRNA expression change with age, and a shortened life span,
      suggesting a causative role of the H3K36me3 marking in modulating age-dependent
      gene expression stability and longevity.

AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, absence of the checkpoint kinase Mec1 (ATR) is
      viable upon mutations that increase the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase 
      (RNR) complex. Whether this pathway is conserved in mammals remains unknown. Here
      we show that cells from mice carrying extra alleles of the RNR regulatory subunit
      RRM2 (Rrm2(TG)) present supraphysiological RNR activity and reduced chromosomal
      breakage at fragile sites. Moreover, increased Rrm2 gene dosage significantly
      extends the life span of ATR mutant mice. Our study reveals the first genetic
      condition in mammals that reduces fragile site expression and alleviates the
      severity of a progeroid disease by increasing RNR activity.

AB  - A subset of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that contain inverted Alu elements in their 3'
      untranslated region are inefficiently exported to the cytoplasm and retained in
      subnuclear bodies called paraspeckles. The arginine methyltransferase CARM1
      (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) promotes the nuclear export
      of these mRNAs by methylating the paraspeckle component p54(nrb), which reduces
      the binding of p54(nrb) to the inverted Alu elements, and down-regulating
      synthesis of another paraspeckle component, the long noncoding RNA NEAT1, which
      inhibits paraspeckle formation.

TI  - Phenotypic evolution through variation in splicing of the noncoding RNA COOLAIR.
PG  - 696-701
LID - 10.1101/gad.258814.115 [doi]
AB  - The extent to which natural polymorphisms in noncoding sequences have functional 
      consequences is still unknown. A large proportion of the natural variation in
      flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions is due to noncoding cis
      polymorphisms that define distinct haplotypes of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Here,
      we show that a single natural intronic polymorphism in one haplotype affects FLC 
      expression and thus flowering by specifically changing splicing of the FLC
      antisense transcript COOLAIR. Altered antisense splicing increases FLC expression
      via a cotranscriptional mechanism involving capping of the FLC nascent
      transcript. Single noncoding polymorphisms can therefore be a major contributor
      to phenotypic evolution through modulation of noncoding transcripts.

TI  - Activin/nodal signaling and NANOG orchestrate human embryonic stem cell fate
      decisions by controlling the H3K4me3 chromatin mark.
PG  - 702-17
LID - 10.1101/gad.255984.114 [doi]
AB  - Stem cells can self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types. These
      characteristics are maintained by the combination of specific signaling pathways 
      and transcription factors that cooperate to establish a unique epigenetic state. 
      Despite the broad interest of these mechanisms, the precise molecular controls by
      which extracellular signals organize epigenetic marks to confer multipotency
      remain to be uncovered. Here, we use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to show
      that the Activin-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway cooperates with the core pluripotency 
      factor NANOG to recruit the DPY30-COMPASS histone modifiers onto key
      developmental genes. Functional studies demonstrate the importance of these
      interactions for correct histone 3 Lys4 trimethylation and also self-renewal and 
      differentiation. Finally, genetic studies in mice show that Dpy30 is also
      necessary to maintain pluripotency in the pregastrulation embryo, thereby
      confirming the existence of similar regulations in vivo during early embryonic
      development. Our results reveal the mechanisms by which extracellular factors
      coordinate chromatin status and cell fate decisions in hESCs.

TI  - SCF(JFK) is a bona fide E3 ligase for ING4 and a potent promoter of the
      angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.
PG  - 672-85
LID - 10.1101/gad.254292.114 [doi]
AB  - Loss of function/dysregulation of inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4) and
      hyperactivation of NF-kappaB are frequent events in many types of human
      malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these remarkable
      aberrations are not understood. Here, we report that ING4 is physically
      associated with JFK. We demonstrated that JFK targets ING4 for ubiquitination and
      degradation through assembly of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) complex. We showed that 
      JFK-mediated ING4 destabilization leads to the hyperactivation of the canonical
      NF-kappaB pathway and promotes angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.
      Significantly, the expression of JFK is markedly up-regulated in breast cancer,
      and the level of JFK is negatively correlated with that of ING4 and positively
      correlated with an aggressive clinical behavior of breast carcinomas. Our study
      identified SCF(JFK) as a bona fide E3 ligase for ING4 and unraveled the
      JFK-ING4-NF-kappaB axis as an important player in the development and progression
      of breast cancer, supporting the pursuit of JFK as a potential target for breast 
      cancer intervention.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) develops predominantly through pancreatic 
      intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
      (IPMN) precursor lesions. Pancreatic acinar cells are reprogrammed to a
      "ductal-like" state during PanIN-PDA formation. Here, we demonstrate a parallel
      mechanism operative in mature duct cells during which functional cells undergo
      "ductal retrogression" to form IPMN-PDA. We further identify critical
      antagonistic roles for Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), a catalytic subunit of the
      SWI/SNF complexes, during IPMN-PDA development. In mature duct cells, Brg1
      inhibits the dedifferentiation that precedes neoplastic transformation, thus
      attenuating tumor initiation. In contrast, Brg1 promotes tumorigenesis in
      full-blown PDA by supporting a mesenchymal-like transcriptional landscape. We
      further show that JQ1, a drug that is currently being tested in clinical trials
      for hematological malignancies, impairs PDA tumorigenesis by both mimicking some 
      and inhibiting other Brg1-mediated functions. In summary, our study demonstrates 
      the context-dependent roles of Brg1 and points to potential therapeutic treatment
      options based on epigenetic regulation in PDA.

      pathway.
PG  - 646-57

AB  - Although all retroviruses recruit host cell RNAs into virions, both the spectrum 
      of RNAs encapsidated and the mechanisms by which they are recruited remain
      largely unknown. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain a
      comprehensive description of the RNAs packaged by a model retrovirus, murine
      leukemia virus. The major encapsidated host RNAs are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and 
      members of the VL30 class of endogenous retroviruses. Remarkably, although
      Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) assembles in the cytoplasm, precursors to specific
      tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are all
      enriched in virions. Consistent with their cytoplasmic recruitment, packaging of 
      both pre-tRNAs and U6 snRNA requires the nuclear export receptor Exportin-5.
      Adenylated and uridylated forms of these RNAs accumulate in cells and virions
      when the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease DIS3L2 and subunits of the RNA exosome are
      depleted. Together, our data reveal that MLV recruits RNAs from a novel host cell
      surveillance pathway in which unprocessed and unneeded nuclear ncRNAs are
      exported to the cytoplasm for degradation.

TI  - Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated
      nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus.
PG  - 630-45
LID - 10.1101/gad.257048.114 [doi]
AB  - In many cells, mRNAs containing inverted repeated Alu elements (IRAlus) in their 
      3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are inefficiently exported to the cytoplasm. Such 
      nuclear retention correlates with paraspeckle-associated protein complexes
      containing p54(nrb). However, nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus is
      variable, and how regulation of retention and export is achieved is poorly
      understood. Here we show one mechanism of such regulation via the arginine
      methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1). We
      demonstrate that disruption of CARM1 enhances the nuclear retention of mRNAs
      containing IRAlus. CARM1 regulates this nuclear retention pathway at two levels: 
      CARM1 methylates the coiled-coil domain of p54(nrb), resulting in reduced binding
      of p54(nrb) to mRNAs containing IRAlus, and also acts as a transcription
      regulator to suppress NEAT1 transcription, leading to reduced paraspeckle
      formation. These actions of CARM1 work together synergistically to regulate the
      export of transcripts containing IRAlus from paraspeckles under certain cellular 
      stresses, such as poly(I:C) treatment. This work demonstrates how a
      post-translational modification of an RNA-binding protein affects protein-RNA
      interaction and also uncovers a mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the
      long noncoding RNA NEAT1.

TI  - Regulation of Mec1 kinase activity by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex.
PG  - 591-602
LID - 10.1101/gad.257626.114 [doi]
AB  - ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes alter chromatin structure through
      interactions with chromatin substrates such as DNA, histones, and nucleosomes.
      However, whether chromatin remodeling complexes have the ability to regulate
      nonchromatin substrates remains unclear. Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint
      kinase Mec1 (ATR in mammals) is an essential master regulator of genomic
      integrity. Here we found that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is capable
      of regulating Mec1 kinase activity. In vivo, Mec1 activity is reduced by the
      deletion of Snf2, the core ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. SWI/SNF
      interacts with Mec1, and cross-linking studies revealed that the Snf2 ATPase is
      the main interaction partner for Mec1. In vitro, SWI/SNF can activate Mec1 kinase
      activity in the absence of chromatin or known activators such as Dpb11. The
      subunit requirement of SWI/SNF-mediated Mec1 regulation differs from that of
      SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. Functionally, SWI/SNF-mediated Mec1
      regulation specifically occurs in S phase of the cell cycle. Together, these
      findings identify a novel regulator of Mec1 kinase activity and suggest that
      ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can regulate nonchromatin substrates
      such as a checkpoint kinase.

AB  - Epigenetic states defined by chromatin can be maintained through mitotic cell
      division. However, it remains unknown how histone-based information is
      transmitted. Here we combine nascent chromatin capture (NCC) and triple-SILAC
      (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) labeling to track
      histone modifications and histone variants during DNA replication and across the 
      cell cycle. We show that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are transmitted 
      with parental histones to newly replicated DNA. Di- and trimethylation marks are 
      diluted twofold upon DNA replication, as a consequence of new histone deposition.
      Importantly, within one cell cycle, all PTMs are restored. In general, new
      histones are modified to mirror the parental histones. However, H3K9
      trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3 are propagated by continuous modification
      of parental and new histones because the establishment of these marks extends
      over several cell generations. Together, our results reveal how histone marks
      propagate and demonstrate that chromatin states oscillate within the cell cycle.

AB  - Eukaryotic cells produce several classes of long and small noncoding RNA (ncRNA).
      Many DNA and RNA viruses synthesize their own ncRNAs. Like their host
      counterparts, viral ncRNAs associate with proteins that are essential for their
      stability, function, or both. Diverse biological roles--including the regulation 
      of viral replication, viral persistence, host immune evasion, and cellular
      transformation--have been ascribed to viral ncRNAs. In this review, we focus on
      the multitude of functions played by ncRNAs produced by animal viruses. We also
      discuss their biogenesis and mechanisms of action.

LID - 10.1101/gad.254631.114 [doi]
AB  - Piwi-piRNA (Piwi-interacting RNA) ribonucleoproteins (piRNPs) enforce
      retrotransposon silencing, a function critical for preserving the genome
      integrity of germ cells. The molecular functions of most of the factors that have
      been genetically implicated in primary piRNA biogenesis are still elusive. Here
      we show that MOV10L1 exhibits 5'-to-3' directional RNA-unwinding activity in
      vitro and that a point mutation that abolishes this activity causes a failure in 
      primary piRNA biogenesis in vivo. We demonstrate that MOV10L1 selectively binds
      piRNA precursor transcripts and is essential for the generation of intermediate
      piRNA processing fragments that are subsequently loaded to Piwi proteins.
      Multiple analyses suggest an intimate coupling of piRNA precursor processing with
      elements of local secondary structures such as G quadruplexes. Our results
      support a model in which MOV10L1 RNA helicase activity promotes unwinding and
      funneling of the single-stranded piRNA precursor transcripts to the endonuclease 
      that catalyzes the first cleavage step of piRNA processing.

TI  - An evolutionarily conserved DNA architecture determines target specificity of the
      TWIST family bHLH transcription factors.
PG  - 603-16
LID - 10.1101/gad.242842.114 [doi]
AB  - Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors recognize the canonical E-box
      (CANNTG) to regulate gene transcription; however, given the prevalence of E-boxes
      in a genome, it has been puzzling how individual bHLH proteins selectively
      recognize E-box sequences on their targets. TWIST is a bHLH transcription factor 
      that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during development and
      tumor metastasis. High-resolution mapping of TWIST occupancy in human and
      Drosophila genomes reveals that TWIST, but not other bHLH proteins, recognizes a 
      unique double E-box motif with two E-boxes spaced preferentially by 5
      nucleotides. Using molecular modeling and binding kinetic analyses, we found that
      the strict spatial configuration in the double E-box motif aligns two TWIST-E47
      dimers on the same face of DNA, thus providing a high-affinity site for a highly 
      stable intramolecular tetramer. Biochemical analyses showed that the WR domain of
      TWIST dimerizes to mediate tetramer formation, which is functionally required for
      TWIST-induced EMT. These results uncover a novel mechanism for a bHLH
      transcription factor to recognize a unique spatial configuration of E-boxes to
      achieve target specificity. The WR-WR domain interaction uncovered here sets an
      example of target gene specificity of a bHLH protein being controlled
      allosterically by a domain outside of the bHLH region.

AB  - S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) stimulate replication initiation and
      accelerate progression through the replication timing program, but it is unknown 
      which CDK substrates are responsible for these effects. CDK phosphorylation of
      the replication factor TICRR (TopBP1-interacting checkpoint and replication
      regulator)/TRESLIN is required for DNA replication. We show here that
      phosphorylated TICRR is limiting for S-phase progression. Overexpression of a
      TICRR mutant with phosphomimetic mutations at two key CDK-phosphorylated residues
      (TICRR(TESE)) stimulates DNA synthesis and shortens S phase by increasing
      replication initiation. This effect requires the TICRR region that is necessary
      for its interaction with MDM two-binding protein. Expression of TICRR(TESE) does 
      not grossly alter the spatial organization of replication forks in the nucleus
      but does increase replication clusters and the number of replication forks within
      each cluster. In contrast to CDK hyperactivation, the acceleration of S-phase
      progression by TICRR(TESE) does not induce DNA damage. These results show that
      CDK can stimulate initiation and compress the replication timing program by
      phosphorylating a single protein, suggesting a simple mechanism by which S-phase 
      length is controlled.

TI  - The KRAB zinc finger protein ZFP809 is required to initiate epigenetic silencing 
      of endogenous retroviruses.
PG  - 538-54
LID - 10.1101/gad.252767.114 [doi]
AB  - Retroviruses have been invading mammalian germlines for millions of years,
      accumulating in the form of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that account for
      nearly one-tenth of the mouse and human genomes. ERVs are epigenetically silenced
      during development, yet the cellular factors recognizing ERVs in a
      sequence-specific manner remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that ZFP809, a
      member of the Kruppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) family,
      initiates the silencing of ERVs in a sequence-specific manner via recruitment of 
      heterochromatin-inducing complexes. ZFP809 knockout mice display highly elevated 
      levels of ZFP809-targeted ERVs in somatic tissues. ERV reactivation is
      accompanied by an epigenetic shift from repressive to active histone
      modifications but only slight destabilization of DNA methylation. Importantly,
      using conditional alleles and rescue experiments, we demonstrate that ZFP809 is
      required to initiate ERV silencing during embryonic development but becomes
      largely dispensable in somatic tissues. Finally, we show that the DNA-binding
      specificity of ZFP809 is evolutionarily conserved in the Muroidea superfamily of 
      rodents and predates the endogenization of retroviruses presently targeted by
      ZFP809 in Mus musculus. In sum, these data provide compelling evidence that
      ZFP809 evolved to recognize foreign DNA and establish histone modification-based 
      epigenetic silencing of ERVs.

TI  - A KAP1 phosphorylation switch controls MyoD function during skeletal muscle
      differentiation.
PG  - 513-25
LID - 10.1101/gad.254532.114 [doi]
AB  - The transcriptional activator MyoD serves as a master controller of myogenesis.
      Often in partnership with Mef2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2), MyoD binds to the
      promoters of hundreds of muscle genes in proliferating myoblasts yet activates
      these targets only upon receiving cues that launch differentiation. What
      regulates this off/on switch of MyoD function has been incompletely understood,
      although it is known to reflect the action of chromatin modifiers. Here, we
      identify KAP1 (KRAB [Kruppel-like associated box]-associated protein 1)/TRIM28
      (tripartite motif protein 28) as a key regulator of MyoD function. In myoblasts, 
      KAP1 is present with MyoD and Mef2 at many muscle genes, where it acts as a
      scaffold to recruit not only coactivators such as p300 and LSD1 but also
      corepressors such as G9a and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1), with promoter
      silencing as the net outcome. Upon differentiation, MSK1-mediated phosphorylation
      of KAP1 releases the corepressors from the scaffold, unleashing transcriptional
      activation by MyoD/Mef2 and their positive cofactors. Thus, our results reveal
      KAP1 as a previously unappreciated interpreter of cell signaling, which modulates
      the ability of MyoD to drive myogenesis.

      Unkempt.
PG  - 501-12
LID - 10.1101/gad.258483.115 [doi]
AB  - Cellular morphology is an essential determinant of cellular function in all
      kingdoms of life, yet little is known about how cell shape is controlled. Here we
      describe a molecular program that controls the early morphology of neurons
      through a metazoan-specific zinc finger protein, Unkempt. Depletion of Unkempt in
      mouse embryos disrupts the shape of migrating neurons, while ectopic expression
      confers neuronal-like morphology to cells of different nonneuronal lineages. We
      found that Unkempt is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and identified its 
      precise binding sites within coding regions of mRNAs linked to protein metabolism
      and trafficking. RNA binding is required for Unkempt-induced remodeling of
      cellular shape and is directly coupled to a reduced production of the encoded
      proteins. These findings link post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression 
      with cellular shape and have general implications for the development and disease
      of multicellular organisms.

AB  - The DREAM (DP, Retinoblastoma [Rb]-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex controls cellular
      quiescence by repressing cell cycle genes, but its mechanism of action is poorly 
      understood. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans DREAM targets have an
      unusual pattern of high gene body HTZ-1/H2A.Z. In mutants of lin-35, the sole
      p130/Rb-like gene in C. elegans, DREAM targets have reduced gene body HTZ-1/H2A.Z
      and increased expression. Consistent with a repressive role for gene body H2A.Z, 
      many DREAM targets are up-regulated in htz-1/H2A.Z mutants. Our results indicate 
      that the DREAM complex facilitates high gene body HTZ-1/H2A.Z, which plays a role
      in target gene repression.

TI  - Resistance to therapy in BRCA2 mutant cells due to loss of the nucleosome
      remodeling factor CHD4.
PG  - 489-94
LID - 10.1101/gad.256214.114 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary cancers derive from gene defects that often compromise DNA repair.
      Thus, BRCA-associated cancers are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as
      cisplatin. The efficacy of cisplatin is limited, however, by the development of
      resistance. One cisplatin resistance mechanism is restoration of homologous
      recombination (HR), which can result from BRCA reversion mutations. However, in
      BRCA2 mutant cancers, cisplatin resistance can occur independently of restored HR
      by a mechanism that remains unknown. Here we performed a genome-wide shRNA screen
      and found that loss of the nucleosome remodeling factor CHD4 confers cisplatin
      resistance. Restoration of cisplatin resistance is independent of HR but
      correlates with restored cell cycle progression, reduced chromosomal aberrations,
      and enhanced DNA damage tolerance. Suggesting clinical relevance,
      cisplatin-resistant clones lacking genetic reversion of BRCA2 show de novo loss
      of CHD4 expression in vitro. Moreover, BRCA2 mutant ovarian cancers with reduced 
      CHD4 expression significantly correlate with shorter progression-free survival
      and shorter overall survival. Collectively, our findings indicate that CHD4
      modulates therapeutic response in BRCA2 mutant cancer cells.

AB  - We performed a genome-scale shRNA screen for modulators of B-cell leukemia
      progression in vivo. Results from this work revealed dramatic distinctions
      between the relative effects of shRNAs on the growth of tumor cells in culture
      versus in their native microenvironment. Specifically, we identified many
      "context-specific" regulators of leukemia development. These included the gene
      encoding the zinc finger protein Phf6. While inactivating mutations in PHF6 are
      commonly observed in human myeloid and T-cell malignancies, we found that Phf6
      suppression in B-cell malignancies impairs tumor progression. Thus, Phf6 is a
      "lineage-specific" cancer gene that plays opposing roles in developmentally
      distinct hematopoietic malignancies.

TI  - The yin and yang of kidney development and Wilms' tumors.
PG  - 467-82
LID - 10.1101/gad.256396.114 [doi]
AB  - Wilms' tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common pediatric renal cancer. The
      tumors morphologically resemble embryonic kidneys with a disrupted architecture
      and are associated with undifferentiated metanephric precursors. Here, we discuss
      genetic and epigenetic findings in Wilms' tumor in the context of renal
      development. Many of the genes implicated in Wilms' tumorigenesis are involved in
      the control of nephron progenitors or the microRNA (miRNA) processing pathway.
      Whereas the first group of genes has been extensively studied in normal
      development, the second finding suggests important roles for miRNAs in
      general-and specific miRNAs in particular-in normal kidney development that still
      await further analysis. The recent identification of Wilms' tumor cancer stem
      cells could provide a framework to integrate these pathways and translate them
      into new or improved therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Mechanism of siRNA production from repetitive DNA.
PG  - 526-37
LID - 10.1101/gad.255828.114 [doi]
AB  - RNAi is a conserved genome defense mechanism in eukaryotes that protects against 
      deleterious effects of transposons and viral invasion. Repetitive DNA loci are a 
      major source for the production of eukaryotic small RNAs, but how these small
      RNAs are produced is not clear. Quelling in Neurospora is one of the first known 
      RNAi-related phenomena and is triggered by the presence of multiple copies of
      transgenes. Here we showed that DNA tandem repeats and double-strand breaks are
      necessary and, when both are present, sufficient to trigger gene silencing and
      siRNA production. Introduction of a site-specific double-strand break or DNA
      fragile site resulted in homologous recombination of repetitive sequences, which 
      is required for gene silencing. In addition to siRNA production, the quelling
      pathway also maintains tandem repeats by regulating homologous recombination. Our
      study identified the mechanistic trigger for siRNA production from repetitive DNA
      and established a role for siRNA in maintaining genome stability.

TI  - Structures of regulatory machinery reveal novel molecular mechanisms controlling 
      B. subtilis nitrogen homeostasis.
PG  - 451-64
LID - 10.1101/gad.254714.114 [doi]
AB  - All cells must sense and adapt to changing nutrient availability. However,
      detailed molecular mechanisms coordinating such regulatory pathways remain poorly
      understood. In Bacillus subtilis, nitrogen homeostasis is controlled by a unique 
      circuitry composed of the regulator TnrA, which is deactivated by
      feedback-inhibited glutamine synthetase (GS) during nitrogen excess and
      stabilized by GlnK upon nitrogen depletion, and the repressor GlnR. Here we
      describe a complete molecular dissection of this network. TnrA and GlnR, the
      global nitrogen homeostatic transcription regulators, are revealed as founders of
      a new structural family of dimeric DNA-binding proteins with C-terminal,
      flexible, effector-binding sensors that modulate their dimerization. Remarkably, 
      the TnrA sensor domains insert into GS intersubunit catalytic pores,
      destabilizing the TnrA dimer and causing an unprecedented GS
      dodecamer-to-tetradecamer conversion, which concomitantly deactivates GS. In
      contrast, each subunit of the GlnK trimer "templates" active TnrA dimers. Unlike 
      TnrA, GlnR sensors mediate an autoinhibitory dimer-destabilizing interaction
      alleviated by GS, which acts as a GlnR chaperone. Thus, these studies unveil
      heretofore unseen mechanisms by which inducible sensor domains drive metabolic
      reprograming in the model Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis.

TI  - Structural basis for corepressor assembly by the orphan nuclear receptor TLX.
PG  - 440-50
LID - 10.1101/gad.254904.114 [doi]
AB  - The orphan nuclear receptor TLX regulates neural stem cell self-renewal in the
      adult brain and functions primarily as a transcription repressor through
      recruitment of Atrophin corepressors, which bind to TLX via a conserved peptide
      motif termed the Atro box. Here we report crystal structures of the human and
      insect TLX ligand-binding domain in complex with Atro box peptides. In these
      structures, TLX adopts an autorepressed conformation in which its helix H12
      occupies the coactivator-binding groove. Unexpectedly, H12 in this autorepressed 
      conformation forms a novel binding pocket with residues from helix H3 that
      accommodates a short helix formed by the conserved ALXXLXXY motif of the Atro
      box. Mutations that weaken the TLX-Atrophin interaction compromise the repressive
      activity of TLX, demonstrating that this interaction is required for Atrophin to 
      confer repressor activity to TLX. Moreover, the autorepressed conformation is
      conserved in the repressor class of orphan nuclear receptors, and mutations of
      corresponding residues in other members of this class of receptors diminish their
      repressor activities. Together, our results establish the functional conservation
      of the autorepressed conformation and define a key sequence motif in the Atro box
      that is essential for TLX-mediated repression.

TI  - A high-sensitivity phospho-switch triggered by Cdk1 governs chromosome
      morphogenesis during cell division.
PG  - 426-39
LID - 10.1101/gad.253294.114 [doi]
AB  - The initiation of chromosome morphogenesis marks the beginning of mitosis in all 
      eukaryotic cells. Although many effectors of chromatin compaction have been
      reported, the nature and design of the essential trigger for global chromosome
      assembly remain unknown. Here we reveal the identity of the core mechanism
      responsible for chromosome morphogenesis in early mitosis. We show that the
      unique sensitivity of the chromosome condensation machinery for the kinase
      activity of Cdk1 acts as a major driving force for the compaction of chromatin at
      mitotic entry. This sensitivity is imparted by multisite phosphorylation of a
      conserved chromatin-binding sensor, the Smc4 protein. The multisite
      phosphorylation of this sensor integrates the activation state of Cdk1 with the
      dynamic binding of the condensation machinery to chromatin. Abrogation of this
      event leads to chromosome segregation defects and lethality, while moderate
      reduction reveals the existence of a novel chromatin transition state specific to
      mitosis, the intertwist configuration. Collectively, our results identify the
      mechanistic basis governing chromosome morphogenesis in early mitosis and how
      distinct chromatin compaction states can be established via specific thresholds
      of Cdk1 kinase activity.

AB  - It is now well established that the E and Id protein axis regulates multiple
      steps in lymphocyte development. However, it remains unknown how E and Id
      proteins mechanistically enforce and maintain the naive T-cell fate. Here we show
      that Id2 and Id3 suppressed the development and expansion of innate variant
      follicular helper T (TFH) cells. Innate variant TFH cells required major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like signaling and were associated with 
      germinal center B cells. We found that Id2 and Id3 induced Foxo1 and Foxp1
      expression to antagonize the activation of a TFH transcription signature. We show
      that Id2 and Id3 acted upstream of the Hif1a/Foxo/AKT/mTORC1 pathway as well as
      the c-myc/p19Arf module to control cellular expansion. We found that mice
      depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression developed colitis and alphabeta T-cell
      lymphomas. Lymphomas depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression displayed elevated
      levels of c-myc, whereas p19Arf abundance declined. Transcription signatures of
      Id2- and Id3-depleted lymphomas revealed similarities to genetic deficiencies
      associated with Burkitt lymphoma. We propose that, in response to antigen
      receptor and/or cytokine signaling, the E-Id protein axis modulates the
      activities of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-Hif1a and c-myc/p19Arf pathways to control
      cellular expansion and homeostatic proliferation.

TI  - Suppression of pervasive noncoding transcription in embryonic stem cells by
      esBAF.
PG  - 362-78
LID - 10.1101/gad.253534.114 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 75% of the human genome is transcribed, the majority of which does 
      not encode protein. However, many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are rapidly degraded
      after transcription, and relatively few have established functions, questioning
      the significance of this observation. Here we show that esBAF, a SWI/SNF family
      nucleosome remodeling factor, suppresses transcription of ncRNAs from
      approximately 57,000 nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) throughout the genome of 
      mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We show that esBAF functions to both keep NDRs
      nucleosome-free and promote elevated nucleosome occupancy adjacent to NDRs.
      Reduction of adjacent nucleosome occupancy upon esBAF depletion is strongly
      correlated with ncRNA expression, suggesting that flanking nucleosomes form a
      barrier to pervasive transcription. Upon forcing nucleosome occupancy near two
      NDRs using a nucleosome-positioning sequence, we found that esBAF is no longer
      required to silence transcription. Therefore, esBAF's function to enforce
      nucleosome occupancy adjacent to NDRs, and not its function to maintain NDRs in a
      nucleosome-free state, is necessary for silencing transcription over ncDNA.
      Finally, we show that the ability of a strongly positioned nucleosome to repress 
      ncRNA depends on its translational positioning. These data reveal a novel role
      for esBAF in suppressing pervasive transcription from open chromatin regions in
      ESCs.

AB  - To acquire the ability to recognize and destroy virus and plasmid invaders,
      prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas systems capture fragments of DNA within the host CRISPR
      locus. Our results indicate that the process of adaptation by a Type II-A
      CRISPR-Cas system in Streptococcus thermophilus requires Cas1, Cas2, and Csn2.
      Surprisingly, we found that Cas9, previously identified as the nuclease
      responsible for ultimate invader destruction, is also essential for adaptation.
      Cas9 nuclease activity is dispensable for adaptation. In addition, our studies
      revealed extensive, unbiased acquisition of the self-targeting host genome
      sequence by the CRISPR-Cas system that is masked in the presence of active target
      destruction.

PG  - 350-5
LID - 10.1101/gad.256255.114 [doi]
AB  - Here we show that the Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex (Ino80C) directly
      prevents euchromatin from invading transcriptionally silent chromatin within
      intergenic regions and at the border of euchromatin and heterochromatin. Deletion
      of Ino80C subunits leads to increased H3K79 methylation and noncoding RNA
      polymerase II (Pol II) transcription centered at the Ino80C-binding sites. The
      effect of Ino80C is direct, as it blocks H3K79 methylation by Dot1 in vitro.
      Heterochromatin stimulates the binding of Ino80C in vitro and in vivo. Our data
      reveal that Ino80C serves as a general silencing complex that restricts
      transcription to gene units in euchromatin.

AB  - Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are composed of several copies of approximately 30 
      different proteins called nucleoporins (Nups). NPCs penetrate the nuclear
      envelope (NE) and regulate the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules.
      Beyond this vital role, NPC components influence genome functions in a
      transport-independent manner. Nups play an evolutionarily conserved role in gene 
      expression regulation that, in metazoans, extends into the nuclear interior.
      Additionally, in proliferative cells, Nups play a crucial role in genome
      integrity maintenance and mitotic progression. Here we discuss genome-related
      functions of Nups and their impact on essential DNA metabolism processes such as 
      transcription, chromosome duplication, and segregation.

TI  - Recognition of H3K9 methylation by GLP is required for efficient establishment of
      H3K9 methylation, rapid target gene repression, and mouse viability.
PG  - 379-93
LID - 10.1101/gad.254425.114 [doi]
AB  - GLP and G9a are major H3K9 dimethylases and are essential for mouse early
      embryonic development. GLP and G9a both harbor ankyrin repeat domains that are
      capable of binding H3K9 methylation. However, the functional significance of
      their recognition of H3K9 methylation is unknown. Here, we report that the
      histone methyltransferase activities of GLP and G9a are stimulated by neighboring
      nucleosomes that are premethylated at H3K9. These stimulation events function in 
      cis and are dependent on the H3K9 methylation binding activities of ankyrin
      repeat domains of GLP and G9a. Disruption of the H3K9 methylation-binding
      activity of GLP in mice causes growth retardation of embryos, ossification
      defects of calvaria, and postnatal lethality due to starvation of the pups. In
      mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) harboring a mutant GLP that lacks
      H3K9me1-binding activity, critical pluripotent genes, including Oct4 and Nanog,
      display inefficient establishment of H3K9me2 and delayed gene silencing during
      differentiation. Collectively, our study reveals a new activation mechanism for
      GLP and G9a that plays an important role in ESC differentiation and mouse
      viability.

AB  - The transcription factor (TF) interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) controls both
      developmental and inflammatory stimulus-inducible genes in macrophages, but the
      mechanisms underlying these two different functions are largely unknown. One
      possibility is that these different roles are linked to the ability of IRF8 to
      bind alternative DNA sequences. We found that IRF8 is recruited to distinct sets 
      of DNA consensus sequences before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.
      In resting cells, IRF8 was mainly bound to composite sites together with the
      master regulator of myeloid development PU.1. Basal IRF8-PU.1 binding maintained 
      the expression of a broad panel of genes essential for macrophage functions (such
      as microbial recognition and response to purines) and contributed to basal
      expression of many LPS-inducible genes. After LPS stimulation, increased
      expression of IRF8, other IRFs, and AP-1 family TFs enabled IRF8 binding to
      thousands of additional regions containing low-affinity multimerized IRF sites
      and composite IRF-AP-1 sites, which were not premarked by PU.1 and did not
      contribute to the basal IRF8 cistrome. While constitutively expressed
      IRF8-dependent genes contained only sites mediating basal IRF8/PU.1 recruitment, 
      inducible IRF8-dependent genes contained variable combinations of constitutive
      and inducible sites. Overall, these data show at the genome scale how the same TF
      can be linked to constitutive and inducible gene regulation via distinct
      combinations of alternative DNA-binding sites.

TI  - Cytokinesis breaks dicentric chromosomes preferentially at pericentromeric
      regions and telomere fusions.
PG  - 322-36
LID - 10.1101/gad.254664.114 [doi]
AB  - Dicentric chromosomes are unstable products of erroneous DNA repair events that
      can lead to further genome rearrangements and extended gene copy number
      variations. During mitosis, they form anaphase bridges, resulting in chromosome
      breakage by an unknown mechanism. In budding yeast, dicentrics generated by
      telomere fusion break at the fusion, a process that restores the parental
      karyotype and protects cells from rare accidental telomere fusion. Here, we
      observed that dicentrics lacking telomere fusion preferentially break within a
      25- to 30-kb-long region next to the centromeres. In all cases, dicentric
      breakage requires anaphase exit, ruling out stretching by the elongated mitotic
      spindle as the cause of breakage. Instead, breakage requires cytokinesis. In the 
      presence of dicentrics, the cytokinetic septa pinch the nucleus, suggesting that 
      dicentrics are severed after actomyosin ring contraction. At this time,
      centromeres and spindle pole bodies relocate to the bud neck, explaining how
      cytokinesis can sever dicentrics near centromeres.

TI  - PRDM16 enhances nuclear receptor-dependent transcription of the brown
      fat-specific Ucp1 gene through interactions with Mediator subunit MED1.
PG  - 308-21
LID - 10.1101/gad.252809.114 [doi]
AB  - PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) induces expression of brown fat-specific genes
      in brown and beige adipocytes, although the underlying transcription-related
      mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, in vitro studies show that PRDM16,
      through its zinc finger domains, directly interacts with the MED1 subunit of the 
      Mediator complex, is recruited to the enhancer of the brown fat-specific
      uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) gene through this interaction, and enhances thyroid
      hormone receptor (TR)-driven transcription in a biochemically defined system in a
      Mediator-dependent manner, thus providing a direct link to the general
      transcription machinery. Complementary cell-based studies show that upon
      forskolin treatment, PRDM16 induces Ucp1 expression in undifferentiated murine
      embryonic fibroblasts, that this induction depends on MED1 and TR, and,
      consistent with a direct effect, that PRDM16 is recruited to the Ucp1 enhancer.
      Related studies have defined MED1 and PRDM16 interaction domains important for
      Ucp1 versus Ppargc1a induction by PRDM16. These results reveal novel mechanisms
      for PRDM16 function through the Mediator complex.

AB  - PR (PRD1-BF1-RIZ1 homologous) domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) drives a brown fat
      differentiation program, but the mechanisms by which PRDM16 activates brown
      fat-selective genes have been unclear. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation
      (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses in brown adipose tissue
      (BAT), we reveal that PRDM16 binding is highly enriched at a broad set of brown
      fat-selective genes. Importantly, we found that PRDM16 physically binds to MED1, 
      a component of the Mediator complex, and recruits it to superenhancers at brown
      fat-selective genes. PRDM16 deficiency in BAT reduces MED1 binding at PRDM16
      target sites and causes a fundamental change in chromatin architecture at key
      brown fat-selective genes. Together, these data indicate that PRDM16 controls
      chromatin architecture and superenhancer activity in BAT.

TI  - Structure of the apoptosome: mechanistic insights into activation of an initiator
      caspase from Drosophila.
PG  - 277-87
LID - 10.1101/gad.255877.114 [doi]
AB  - Apoptosis is executed by a cascade of caspase activation. The autocatalytic
      activation of an initiator caspase, exemplified by caspase-9 in mammals or its
      ortholog, Dronc, in fruit flies, is facilitated by a multimeric adaptor complex
      known as the apoptosome. The underlying mechanism by which caspase-9 or Dronc is 
      activated by the apoptosome remains unknown. Here we report the electron
      cryomicroscopic (cryo-EM) structure of the intact apoptosome from Drosophila
      melanogaster at 4.0 A resolution. Analysis of the Drosophila apoptosome, which
      comprises 16 molecules of the Dark protein (Apaf-1 ortholog), reveals molecular
      determinants that support the assembly of the 2.5-MDa complex. In the absence of 
      dATP or ATP, Dronc zymogen potently induces formation of the Dark apoptosome,
      within which Dronc is efficiently activated. At 4.1 A resolution, the cryo-EM
      structure of the Dark apoptosome bound to the caspase recruitment domain (CARD)
      of Dronc (Dronc-CARD) reveals two stacked rings of Dronc-CARD that are sandwiched
      between two octameric rings of the Dark protein. The specific interactions
      between Dronc-CARD and both the CARD and the WD40 repeats of a nearby Dark
      protomer are indispensable for Dronc activation. These findings reveal important 
      mechanistic insights into the activation of initiator caspase by the apoptosome.

TI  - Bifurcating action of Smoothened in Hedgehog signaling is mediated by Dlg5.
PG  - 262-76
LID - 10.1101/gad.252676.114 [doi]
AB  - Binding of the Hedgehog (Hh) protein signal to its receptor, Patched, induces
      accumulation of the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) within the 
      primary cilium and of the zinc finger transcription factor Gli2 at the ciliary
      tip, resulting ultimately in Gli-mediated changes in nuclear gene expression.
      However, the mechanism by which pathway activation is communicated from Smo to
      Gli2 is not known. In an effort to elucidate this mechanism, we identified Dlg5
      (Discs large, homolog 5) in a biochemical screen for proteins that preferentially
      interact with activated Smo. We found that disruption of Smo-Dlg5 interactions or
      depletion of endogenous Dlg5 leads to diminished Hh pathway response without a
      significant impact on Smo ciliary accumulation. We also found that Dlg5 is
      localized at the basal body, where it associates with another pathway component, 
      Kif7. We show that Dlg5 is required for Hh-induced enrichment of Kif7 and Gli2 at
      the tip of the cilium but is dispensable for Gpr161 exit from the cilium and the 
      consequent suppression of Gli3 processing into its repressor form. Our findings
      suggest a bifurcation of Smo activity in Hh response, with a Dlg5-independent arm
      for suppression of Gli repressor formation and a second arm involving Smo
      interaction with Dlg5 for Gli activation.

TI  - TGF-beta/Smad signaling through DOCK4 facilitates lung adenocarcinoma metastasis.
PG  - 250-61
LID - 10.1101/gad.248963.114 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms by which TGF-beta promotes lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) metastasis
      are largely unknown. Here, we report that in lung ADC cells, TGF-beta potently
      induces expression of DOCK4, but not other DOCK family members, via the Smad
      pathway and that DOCK4 induction mediates TGF-beta's prometastatic effects by
      enhancing tumor cell extravasation. TGF-beta-induced DOCK4 stimulates lung ADC
      cell protrusion, motility, and invasion without affecting
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These processes, which are fundamental to
      tumor cell extravasation, are driven by DOCK4-mediated Rac1 activation, unveiling
      a novel link between TGF-beta and Rac1. Thus, our findings uncover the atypical
      Rac1 activator DOCK4 as a key component of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway that
      promotes lung ADC cell extravasation and metastasis.

AB  - Changes in the pattern of gene expression play an important role in allowing
      cancer cells to acquire their hallmark characteristics, while genomic instability
      enables cells to acquire genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis. Chromatin 
      plays central roles in both transcriptional regulation and the maintenance of
      genomic stability. Studies by cancer genome consortiums have identified frequent 
      mutations in genes encoding chromatin regulatory factors and histone proteins in 
      human cancer, implicating them as major mediators in the pathogenesis of both
      hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we review recent advances in
      our understanding of the role of chromatin in cancer, focusing on transcriptional
      regulatory complexes, enhancer-associated factors, histone point mutations, and
      alterations in heterochromatin-interacting factors.

TI  - Lamins at the crossroads of mechanosignaling.
PG  - 225-37
LID - 10.1101/gad.255968.114 [doi]
AB  - The intermediate filament proteins, A- and B-type lamins, form the nuclear lamina
      scaffold adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. B-type lamins confer elasticity,
      while A-type lamins lend viscosity and stiffness to nuclei. Lamins also
      contribute to chromatin regulation and various signaling pathways affecting gene 
      expression. The mechanical roles of lamins and their functions in gene regulation
      are often viewed as independent activities, but recent findings suggest a highly 
      cross-linked and interdependent regulation of these different functions,
      particularly in mechanosignaling. In this newly emerging concept, lamins act as a
      "mechanostat" that senses forces from outside and responds to tension by
      reinforcing the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. A-type lamins, emerin,
      and the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex directly
      transmit forces from the extracellular matrix into the nucleus. These mechanical 
      forces lead to changes in the molecular structure, modification, and assembly
      state of A-type lamins. This in turn activates a tension-induced "inside-out
      signaling" through which the nucleus feeds back to the cytoskeleton and the
      extracellular matrix to balance outside and inside forces. These functions
      regulate differentiation and may be impaired in lamin-linked diseases, leading to
      cellular phenotypes, particularly in mechanical load-bearing tissues.

      therapeutically essential. Here, we address the relative importance of SMN
      restoration in the central nervous system (CNS) versus peripheral tissues in
      mouse models using a therapeutic splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide to
      restore SMN and a complementary decoy oligonucleotide to neutralize its effects
      in the CNS. Increasing SMN exclusively in peripheral tissues completely rescued
      necrosis in mild SMA mice and robustly extended survival in severe SMA mice, with
      significant improvements in vulnerable tissues and motor function. Our data
      demonstrate a critical role of peripheral pathology in the mortality of SMA mice 
      and indicate that peripheral SMN restoration compensates for its deficiency in
      the CNS and preserves motor neurons. Thus, SMA is not a cell-autonomous defect of
      motor neurons in SMA mice.

AB  - Start sites of DNA replication are marked by the origin recognition complex
      (ORC), which coordinates Mcm2-7 helicase loading to form the prereplicative
      complex (pre-RC). Although pre-RC assembly is well characterized in vitro, the
      process is poorly understood within the local chromatin environment surrounding
      replication origins. To reveal how the chromatin architecture modulates origin
      selection and activation, we "footprinted" nucleosomes, transcription factors,
      and replication proteins at multiple points during the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
      cell cycle. Our nucleotide-resolution protein occupancy profiles resolved a
      precise ORC-dependent footprint at 269 origins in G2. A separate class of
      inefficient origins exhibited protein occupancy only in G1, suggesting that
      stable ORC chromatin association in G2 is a determinant of origin efficiency. G1 
      nucleosome remodeling concomitant with pre-RC assembly expanded the origin
      nucleosome-free region and enhanced activation efficiency. Finally, the local
      chromatin environment restricts the loading of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer either
      upstream of or downstream from the ARS consensus sequence (ACS).

      transcription-associated DNA damage that promotes homologous recombination.
PG  - 197-211
LID - 10.1101/gad.252189.114 [doi]
AB  - How chromatin shapes pathways that promote genome-epigenome integrity in response
      to DNA damage is an issue of crucial importance. We report that human bromodomain
      (BRD)-containing proteins, the primary "readers" of acetylated chromatin, are
      vital for the DNA damage response (DDR). We discovered that more than one-third
      of all human BRD proteins change localization in response to DNA damage. We
      identified ZMYND8 (zinc finger and MYND [myeloid, Nervy, and DEAF-1] domain
      containing 8) as a novel DDR factor that recruits the nucleosome remodeling and
      histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex to damaged chromatin. Our data define a
      transcription-associated DDR pathway mediated by ZMYND8 and the NuRD complex that
      targets DNA damage, including when it occurs within transcriptionally active
      chromatin, to repress transcription and promote repair by homologous
      recombination. Thus, our data identify human BRD proteins as key chromatin
      modulators of the DDR and provide novel insights into how DNA damage within
      actively transcribed regions requires chromatin-binding proteins to orchestrate
      the appropriate response in concordance with the damage-associated chromatin
      context.

TI  - FBXL20-mediated Vps34 ubiquitination as a p53 controlled checkpoint in regulating
      autophagy and receptor degradation.
PG  - 184-96
LID - 10.1101/gad.252528.114 [doi]
AB  - Vacuolar protein-sorting 34 (Vps34), the catalytic subunit in the class III
      PtdIns3 (phosphatidylinositol 3) kinase complexes, mediates the production of
      PtdIns3P, a key intracellular lipid involved in regulating autophagy and receptor
      degradation. However, the signal transduction pathways by which extracellular
      signals regulate Vps34 complexes and the downstream cellular mechanisms are not
      well understood. Here we show that DNA damage-activated mitotic arrest and CDK
      activation lead to the phosphorylation of Vps34, which provides a signal to
      promote its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by FBXL20 (an
      F-box protein) and the associated Skp1 (S-phase kinase-associated
      protein-1)-Cullin1 complex, leading to inhibition of autophagy and receptor
      endocytosis. Furthermore, we show that the expression of FBXL20 is regulated by
      p53-dependent transcription. Our study provides a molecular pathway by which DNA 
      damage regulates Vps34 complexes and its downstream mechanisms, including
      autophagy and receptor endocytosis, through SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box)-mediated
      ubiquitination and degradation. Since the expression of FBXL20 is regulated by
      p53-dependent transcription, the control of Vps34 ubiquitination and proteasomal 
      degradation by FBXL20 and the associated SCF complex expression provides a novel 
      checkpoint for p53 to regulate autophagy and receptor degradation in DNA damage
      response.

TI  - ATDC induces an invasive switch in KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis.
PG  - 171-83
LID - 10.1101/gad.253591.114 [doi]
AB  - The initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is linked to activating 
      mutations in KRAS. However, in PDA mouse models, expression of oncogenic mutant
      KRAS during development gives rise to tumors only after a prolonged latency or
      following induction of pancreatitis. Here we describe a novel mouse model
      expressing ataxia telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC, also known as 
      TRIM29 [tripartite motif 29]) that, in the presence of oncogenic KRAS,
      accelerates pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation and the
      development of invasive and metastatic cancers. We found that ATDC up-regulates
      CD44 in mouse and human PanIN lesions via activation of beta-catenin signaling,
      leading to the induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
      phenotype characterized by expression of Zeb1 and Snail1. We show that ATDC is
      up-regulated by oncogenic Kras in a subset of PanIN cells that are capable of
      invading the surrounding stroma. These results delineate a novel molecular
      pathway for EMT in pancreatic tumorigenesis, showing that ATDC is a proximal
      regulator of EMT.

AB  - Cellular dedifferentiation is the regression of a cell from a specialized state
      to a more multipotent state and is implicated in cancer. However, the
      transcriptional network that prevents differentiated cells from reacquiring stem 
      cell fate is so far unclear. Neuroblasts (NBs), the Drosophila neural stem cells,
      are a model for the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.
      Here we show that the Drosophila zinc finger transcription factor Nervous fingers
      1 (Nerfin-1) locks neurons into differentiation, preventing their reversion into 
      NBs. Following Prospero-dependent neuronal specification in the ganglion mother
      cell (GMC), a Nerfin-1-specific transcriptional program maintains differentiation
      in the post-mitotic neurons. The loss of Nerfin-1 causes reversion to
      multipotency and results in tumors in several neural lineages. Both the onset and
      rate of neuronal dedifferentiation in nerfin-1 mutant lineages are dependent on
      Myc- and target of rapamycin (Tor)-mediated cellular growth. In addition,
      Nerfin-1 is required for NB differentiation at the end of neurogenesis. RNA
      sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis show that 
      Nerfin-1 administers its function by repression of self-renewing-specific and
      activation of differentiation-specific genes. Our findings support the model of
      bidirectional interconvertibility between neural stem cells and their
      post-mitotic progeny and highlight the importance of the Nerfin-1-regulated
      transcriptional program in neuronal maintenance.

PG  - 123-8
LID - 10.1101/gad.254870.114 [doi]
AB  - The methyltransferase activity of the trithorax group (TrxG) protein MLL1 found
      within its COMPASS (complex associated with SET1)-like complex is allosterically 
      regulated by a four-subunit complex composed of WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY30
      (also referred to as WRAD). We report structural evidence showing that in WRAD, a
      concave surface of the Ash2L SPIa and ryanodine receptor (SPRY) domain binds to a
      cluster of acidic residues, referred to as the D/E box, in RbBP5. Mutational
      analysis shows that residues forming the Ash2L/RbBP5 interface are important for 
      heterodimer formation, stimulation of MLL1 catalytic activity, and erythroid cell
      terminal differentiation. We also demonstrate that a phosphorylation switch on
      RbBP5 stimulates WRAD complex formation and significantly increases KMT2 (lysine 
      [K] methyltransferase 2) enzyme methylation rates. Overall, our findings provide 
      structural insights into the assembly of the WRAD complex and point to a novel
      regulatory mechanism controlling the activity of the KMT2/COMPASS family of
      lysine methyltransferases.

PG  - 109-22
LID - 10.1101/gad.255554.114 [doi]
AB  - During eukaryotic cell division, chromosomes must be precisely partitioned to
      daughter cells. This relies on a mechanism to move chromosomes in defined
      directions within the parental cell. While sister chromatids are segregated from 
      one another in mitosis and meiosis II, specific adaptations enable the
      segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I to reduce ploidy for
      gamete production. Many of the factors that drive these directed chromosome
      movements are known, and their molecular mechanism has started to be uncovered.
      Here we review the mechanisms of eukaryotic chromosome segregation, with a
      particular emphasis on the modifications that ensure the segregation of
      homologous chromosomes during meiosis I.

TI  - Poly-ADP ribosylation of PTEN by tankyrases promotes PTEN degradation and tumor
      growth.
PG  - 157-70
LID - 10.1101/gad.251785.114 [doi]
AB  - PTEN [phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate phosphatase and tensin homolog
      deleted from chromosome 10], a phosphatase and critical tumor suppressor, is
      regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including
      phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which affect PTEN 
      localization and protein stability. Here we report ADP-ribosylation as a new
      post-translational modification of PTEN. We identified PTEN as a novel substrate 
      of tankyrases, which are members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). We 
      showed that tankyrases interact with and ribosylate PTEN, which promotes the
      recognition of PTEN by a PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF146, leading to PTEN
      ubiquitination and degradation. Double knockdown of tankyrase1/2 stabilized PTEN,
      resulting in the subsequent down-regulation of AKT phosphorylation and thus
      suppressed cell proliferation and glycolysis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.
      Furthermore, tankyrases were up-regulated and negatively correlated with PTEN
      expression in human colon carcinomas. Together, our study revealed a new
      regulation of PTEN and highlighted a role for tankyrases in the PTEN-AKT pathway 
      that can be explored further for cancer treatment.

AB  - Altered epidermal differentiation characterizes numerous skin diseases affecting 
      >25% of the human population. Here we identified Fra-2/AP-1 as a key regulator of
      terminal epidermal differentiation. Epithelial-restricted, ectopic expression of 
      Fra-2 induced expression of epidermal differentiation genes located within the
      epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). Moreover, in a papilloma-prone
      background, a reduced tumor burden was observed due to precocious keratinocyte
      differentiation by Fra-2 expression. Importantly, loss of Fra-2 in suprabasal
      keratinocytes is sufficient to cause skin barrier defects due to reduced
      expression of differentiation genes. Mechanistically, Fra-2 binds and
      transcriptionally regulates EDC gene promoters, which are co-occupied by the
      transcriptional repressor Ezh2. Fra-2 remains transcriptionally inactive in
      nondifferentiated keratinocytes, where it was found monomethylated and
      dimethylated on Lys104 and interacted with Ezh2. Upon keratinocyte
      differentiation, Fra-2 is C-terminally phosphorylated on Ser320 and Thr322 by
      ERK1/2, leading to transcriptional activation. Thus, the induction of epidermal
      differentiation by Fra-2 is controlled by a dual mechanism involving
      Ezh2-dependent methylation and activation by ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation.

TI  - The G-patch protein Spp2 couples the spliceosome-stimulated ATPase activity of
      the DEAH-box protein Prp2 to catalytic activation of the spliceosome.
PG  - 94-107
LID - 10.1101/gad.253070.114 [doi]
AB  - Structural rearrangement of the activated spliceosome (B(act)) to yield a
      catalytically active complex (B*) is mediated by the DEAH-box NTPase Prp2 in
      cooperation with the G-patch protein Spp2. However, how the energy of ATP
      hydrolysis by Prp2 is coupled to mechanical work and what role Spp2 plays in this
      process are unclear. Using a purified splicing system, we demonstrate that Spp2
      is not required to recruit Prp2 to its bona fide binding site in the B(act)
      spliceosome. In the absence of Spp2, the B(act) spliceosome efficiently triggers 
      Prp2's NTPase activity, but NTP hydrolysis is not coupled to ribonucleoprotein
      (RNP) rearrangements leading to catalytic activation of the spliceosome.
      Transformation of the B(act) to the B* spliceosome occurs only when Spp2 is
      present and is accompanied by dissociation of Prp2 and a reduction in its NTPase 
      activity. In the absence of spliceosomes, Spp2 enhances Prp2's RNA-dependent
      ATPase activity without affecting its RNA affinity. Our data suggest that Spp2
      plays a major role in coupling Prp2's ATPase activity to remodeling of the
      spliceosome into a catalytically active machine.

TI  - A novel mechanism for Prp5 function in prespliceosome formation and proofreading 
      the branch site sequence.
PG  - 81-93
LID - 10.1101/gad.253708.114 [doi]
AB  - The DEAD-box RNA helicase Prp5 is required for the formation of the
      prespliceosome through an ATP-dependent function to remodel U2 small nuclear
      ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and an ATP-independent function of unknown
      mechanism. Prp5 has also been implicated in proofreading the branch site
      sequence, but the molecular mechanism has not been well characterized. Using
      actin precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) carrying branch site mutations, we identified a
      Prp5-containing prespliceosome with Prp5 directly bound to U2 small nuclear RNA
      (snRNA). Prp5 is in contact with U2 in regions on and near the
      branchpoint-interacting stem-loop (BSL), suggesting that Prp5 may function in
      stabilizing the BSL. Regardless of its ATPase activity, Prp5 mutants that
      suppress branch site mutations associate with the spliceosome less tightly and
      allow more tri-snRNP binding for the reaction to proceed. Our results suggest a
      novel mechanism for how Prp5 functions in prespliceosome formation and
      proofreading of the branch site sequence. Prp5 binds to the spliceosome in
      association with U2 by interacting with the BSL and is released upon the
      base-pairing of U2 with the branch site to allow the recruitment of the
      tri-snRNP. Mutations impairing U2-branch site base-pairing retard Prp5 release
      and impede tri-snRNP association. Prp5 mutations that destabilize the Prp5-U2
      interaction suppress branch site mutations by allowing progression of the
      pathway.

      introns.
PG  - 63-80
LID - 10.1101/gad.247361.114 [doi]
AB  - Deep sequencing of embryonic stem cell RNA revealed many specific internal
      introns that are significantly more abundant than the other introns within
      polyadenylated transcripts; we classified these as "detained" introns (DIs). We
      identified thousands of DIs, many of which are evolutionarily conserved, in human
      and mouse cell lines as well as the adult mouse liver. DIs can have half-lives of
      over an hour yet remain in the nucleus and are not subject to nonsense-mediated
      decay (NMD). Drug inhibition of Clk, a stress-responsive kinase, triggered rapid 
      splicing changes for a specific subset of DIs; half showed increased splicing,
      and half showed increased intron detention, altering transcript pools of >300
      genes. Srsf4, which undergoes a dramatic phosphorylation shift in response to Clk
      kinase inhibition, regulates the splicing of some DIs, particularly in genes
      encoding RNA processing and splicing factors. The splicing of some DIs-including 
      those in Mdm4, a negative regulator of p53-was also altered following DNA damage.
      After 4 h of Clk inhibition, the expression of >400 genes changed significantly, 
      and almost one-third of these are p53 transcriptional targets. These data suggest
      a widespread mechanism by which the rate of splicing of DIs contributes to the
      level of gene expression.

TI  - Common and distinct DNA-binding and regulatory activities of the BEN-solo
      transcription factor family.
PG  - 48-62
LID - 10.1101/gad.252122.114 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the BEN (BANP, E5R, and NAC1) domain was recognized as a new class of
      conserved DNA-binding domain. The fly genome encodes three proteins that bear
      only a single BEN domain ("BEN-solo" factors); namely, Insensitive (Insv), Bsg25A
      (Elba1), and CG9883 (Elba2). Insv homodimers preferentially bind CCAATTGG
      palindromes throughout the genome to mediate transcriptional repression, whereas 
      Bsg25A and Elba2 heterotrimerize with their obligate adaptor, Elba3 (i.e., the
      ELBA complex), to recognize a CCAATAAG motif in the Fab-7 insulator. While these 
      data suggest distinct DNA-binding properties of BEN-solo proteins, we performed
      reporter assays that indicate that both Bsg25A and Elba2 can individually
      recognize Insv consensus sites efficiently. We confirmed this by solving the
      structure of Bsg25A complexed to the Insv site, which showed that key aspects of 
      the BEN:DNA recognition strategy are similar between these proteins. We next show
      that both Insv and ELBA proteins are competent to mediate transcriptional
      repression via Insv consensus sequences but that the ELBA complex appears to be
      selective for the ELBA site. Reciprocally, genome-wide analysis reveals that Insv
      exhibits significant cobinding to class I insulator elements, indicating that it 
      may also contribute to insulator function. Indeed, we observed abundant Insv
      binding within the Hox complexes with substantial overlaps with class I
      insulators, many of which bear Insv consensus sites. Moreover, Insv
      coimmunoprecipitates with the class I insulator factor CP190. Finally, we
      observed that Insv harbors exclusive activity among fly BEN-solo factors with
      respect to regulation of Notch-mediated cell fate choices in the peripheral
      nervous system. This in vivo activity is recapitulated by BEND6, a mammalian
      BEN-solo factor that conserves the Notch corepressor function of Insv but not its
      capacity to bind Insv consensus sites. Altogether, our data define an array of
      common and distinct biochemical and functional properties of this new family of
      transcription factors.

      Genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the phenomenon of promoter-bound Pol
      II pausing is widespread, especially for genes involved in developmental and
      stimulus-responsive pathways. However, a mechanistic understanding of the paused 
      Pol II state at promoters is limited. For example, at a global level, it is
      unclear to what extent the engaged paused Pol II is stably tethered to the
      promoter or undergoes rapid cycles of initiation and termination. Here we used
      the small molecule triptolide (TPL), an XPB/TFIIH inhibitor, to block
      transcriptional initiation and then measured Pol II occupancy by chromatin
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq).
      This inhibition of initiation enabled us to investigate different states of
      paused Pol II. Specifically, our global analysis revealed that most genes with
      paused Pol II, as defined by a pausing index, show significant clearance of Pol
      II during the period of TPL treatment. Our study further identified a group of
      genes with unexpectedly stably paused Pol II, with unchanged Pol II occupancy
      even after 1 h of inhibition of initiation. This group of genes constitutes a
      small portion of all paused genes defined by the conventional criterion of
      pausing index. These findings could pave the way for evaluating the contribution 
      of different elongation/pausing factors on different states of Pol II pausing in 
      developmental and other stimulus-responsive pathways.

PG  - 23-38
LID - 10.1101/gad.251835.114 [doi]
AB  - Cohesin is implicated in establishing and maintaining pluripotency. Whether this 
      is because of essential cohesin functions in the cell cycle or in gene regulation
      is unknown. Here we tested cohesin's contribution to reprogramming in systems
      that reactivate the expression of pluripotency genes in the absence of
      proliferation (embryonic stem [ES] cell heterokaryons) or DNA replication
      (nuclear transfer). Contrary to expectations, cohesin depletion enhanced the
      ability of ES cells to initiate somatic cell reprogramming in heterokaryons. This
      was explained by increased c-Myc (Myc) expression in cohesin-depleted ES cells,
      which promoted DNA replication-dependent reprogramming of somatic fusion
      partners. In contrast, cohesin-depleted somatic cells were poorly reprogrammed in
      heterokaryons, due in part to defective DNA replication. Pluripotency gene
      induction was rescued by Myc, which restored DNA replication, and by nuclear
      transfer, where reprogramming does not require DNA replication. These results
      redefine cohesin's role in pluripotency and reveal a novel function for Myc in
      promoting the replication-dependent reprogramming of somatic nuclei.

      alpha6Bbeta1 integrin to sustain breast cancer stem cells.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1101/gad.253682.114 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how the extracellular matrix impacts the function of cancer stem
      cells (CSCs) is a significant but poorly understood problem. We report that
      breast CSCs produce a laminin (LM) 511 matrix that promotes self-renewal and
      tumor initiation by engaging the alpha6Bbeta1 integrin and activating the Hippo
      transducer TAZ. Although TAZ is important for the function of breast CSCs, the
      mechanism is unknown. We observed that TAZ regulates the transcription of the
      alpha5 subunit of LM511 and the formation of a LM511 matrix. These data establish
      a positive feedback loop involving TAZ and LM511 that contributes to stemness in 
      breast cancer.

TI  - Browning of human adipocytes requires KLF11 and reprogramming of PPARgamma
      superenhancers.
PG  - 7-22
LID - 10.1101/gad.250829.114 [doi]
AB  - Long-term exposure to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      (PPARgamma) agonists such as rosiglitazone induces browning of rodent and human
      adipocytes; however, the transcriptional mechanisms governing this phenotypic
      switch in adipocytes are largely unknown. Here we show that rosiglitazone-induced
      browning of human adipocytes activates a comprehensive gene program that leads to
      increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Once induced, this gene program and
      oxidative capacity are maintained independently of rosiglitazone, suggesting that
      additional browning factors are activated. Browning triggers reprogramming of
      PPARgamma binding, leading to the formation of PPARgamma "superenhancers" that
      are selective for brown-in-white (brite) adipocytes. These are highly associated 
      with key brite-selective genes. Based on such an association, we identified an
      evolutionarily conserved metabolic regulator, Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11), as 
      a novel browning transcription factor in human adipocytes that is required for
      rosiglitazone-induced browning, including the increase in mitochondrial oxidative
      capacity. KLF11 is directly induced by PPARgamma and appears to cooperate with
      PPARgamma in a feed-forward manner to activate and maintain the brite-selective
      gene program.
