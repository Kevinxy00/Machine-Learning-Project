TI  - SIRT3 restricts HBV transcription and replication via epigenetic regulation of
      cccDNA involving SUV39H1 and SETD1A histone methyltransferases.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29912 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem worldwide.
      Maintenance of the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) which serves as a
      template for HBV RNA transcription is responsible for the failure of eradicating 
      chronic HBV during current antiviral therapy. cccDNA is assembled with cellular
      histone proteins into chromatin, but little is known about the regulation of HBV 
      chromatin by histone posttranslational modifications. In this study, we
      identified SIRT3 as a host factor restricting HBV transcription and replication
      by screening seven members of Sirtuin family which is the class III histone
      deacetylase. Ectopic SIRT3 expression significantly reduced total HBV RNAs,
      3.5-kb RNA as well as replicative intermediate DNA in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP
      cells and PHH. In contrast, gene silencing of SIRT3 promoted HBV transcription
      and replication. Mechanistic study found nuclear SIRT3 was recruited to the HBV
      cccDNA, where it deacetylated histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9). Importantly, occupancy
      of SIRT3 onto cccDNA could increase the recruitment of histone methyltransferase 
      SUV39H1 to cccDNA and decrease recruitment of SETD1A, leading to a marked
      increase of H3K9me3 and a decrease of H3K4me3 on cccDNA. Moreover, SIRT3-mediated
      HBV cccDNA transcriptional repression involved decreased binding of host RNA
      polymerase II and transcription factor YY1 to cccDNA. Finally, viral protein HBx 
      could relieve SIRT3-mediated cccDNA transcriptional repression by inhibiting both
      SIRT3 expression and its recruitment to cccDNA. CONCLUSION: SIRT3 is a novel host
      factor epigenetically restricting HBV cccDNA transcription by acting
      cooperatively with histone methyltransferase. These data provided a rational for 
      the use of SIRT3 activators in the prevention or treatment of HBV infection. This

AB  - Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who have virological failure (VF) after
      treatment containing a nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor have limited
      retreatment options. MAGELLAN-1 Part 2 was a randomized, open-label, phase 3
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ribavirin (RBV)-free glecaprevir and
      pibrentasvir (G/P; 300 mg/120 mg) in patients with chronic HCV and past VF on at 
      least one NS3/4A protease and/or NS5A inhibitor-containing therapy. Patients with
      compensated liver disease, with or without cirrhosis, and HCV genotype (GT) 1, 4,
      5, or 6 were randomized 1:1 to receive 12 or 16 weeks of G/P. The primary
      endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 weeks posttreatment
      (SVR12). Among 91 patients treated, 87 had GT1 and 4 had GT4 infection. SVR12 was
      achieved by 89% (39 of 44) and 91% (43 of 47) of patients who received 12 and 16 
      weeks of G/P, respectively. Virological relapse occurred in 9% (4 of 44) of
      patients treated with 12 weeks of G/P; there were no relapses with 16 weeks of
      treatment. Past treatment history with one class of inhibitor (protease or NS5A) 
      had no impact on SVR12, whereas past treatment with both classes of inhibitors
      was associated with lower SVR12 rate. The most common adverse event (AE) was
      headache (>/=10% of patients), and there were no serious AEs assessed as related 
      to study drugs or AEs leading to discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Sixteen weeks of
      G/P treatment achieved a high SVR12 rate in patients with HCV GT1 infection and
      past failure to regimens containing either NS5A inhibitors or NS3 protease
      inhibitors. (Hepatology 2018;67:1253-1260).

TI  - Optimizing lonafarnib treatment for the management of chronic delta hepatitis:
      The LOWR HDV-1 study.
PG  - 1224-1236
LID - 10.1002/hep.29658 [doi]
AB  - In a proof-of-concept (POC) study, the oral prenylation inhibitor, lonafarnib
      (LNF), decreased hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA during 4 weeks of treatment. Here,
      we explored optimal LNF regimens. Fifteen patients (five groups; 3 per group)
      completed dosing as follows: (1) LNF 200 mg twice-daily (BID; 12 weeks); (2) LNF 
      300 mg BID (12 weeks); (3) LNF 100 mg thrice-daily (5 weeks); (4) LNF 100 mg BID 
      + pegylated interferon alfa (PEG-IFNalpha) 180 mug once-weekly (QW; 8 weeks); and
      (5) LNF 100 mg BID + ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg once-daily (QD; 8 weeks).
      Tolerability and efficacy were assessed. Higher LNF monotherapy doses had greater
      decreases in HDV viral load than achieved in the original POC study. However,
      this was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events. Addition of
      RTV 100 mg QD to a LNF 100 mg BID regimen yielded better antiviral responses than
      LNF 300 mg BID monotherapy and with less side effects. A similar improvement was 
      observed with LNF 100 mg BID + PEG-IFNalpha 180 mug QW. Two of 6 patients who
      received 12 weeks of LNF experienced transient posttreatment alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) increases resulting in HDV-RNA negativity and ALT
      normalization. CONCLUSION: The cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, RTV, allows a lower
      LNF dose to be used while achieving higher levels of postabsorption LNF, yielding
      better antiviral responses and tolerability. In addition, combining LNF with
      PEG-IFNalpha achieved more substantial and rapid HDV-RNA reduction, compared to
      historical responses with PEG-IFNalpha alone. Twelve weeks of LNF can result in
      posttreatment HDV-RNA negativity in some patients, which we speculate results
      from restoring favorable immune responses. These results support further
      development of LNF with RTV boosting and exploration of the combination of LNF
      with PEG-IFN. (Hepatology 2018;67:1224-1236).

TI  - Perioperative von Willebrand factor dynamics are associated with liver
      regeneration and predict outcome after liver resection.
PG  - 1516-1530
LID - 10.1002/hep.29651 [doi]
AB  - von Willebrand Factor (vWF) was found to mediate platelet influx during the early
      phase of liver regeneration in mice. Furthermore, increased vWF-antigen (vWF-Ag) 
      levels were shown to be predictive for outcome of patients with chronic liver
      disease. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the relevance of perioperative vWF-Ag
      dynamics in terms of liver regeneration and clinical outcome in patients
      undergoing liver resection (LR). Accordingly, we observed that vWF-Ag and its
      activity-estimated by ristocetin cofactor measurement-increased immediately after
      induction of liver regeneration and was associated with platelet accumulation
      within the liver. However, a significant vWF-Ag burst was only observed in
      patients with unaffected postoperative liver regeneration. E-selectin, as an
      established marker for endothelial cell activation, was found to correlate with
      vWF-Ag in the liver vein after induction of liver regeneration (R = 0.535, P =
      0.022). Preoperative vWF-Ag levels significantly predicted postoperative liver
      dysfunction (LD; N = 95; area under the curve, 0.725; P = 0.009). Furthermore, a 
      cutoff of vWF-Ag >/=182% was defined to identify patients with a higher risk for 
      postoperative LD or morbidity. This was confirmed within an independent
      mulitcenter validation cohort (N = 133). Ultimately, multivariable analysis
      revealed that vWF-Ag was an independent predictor of postoperative LD and
      morbidity. CONCLUSION: Within this study, we were able to provide evidence that
      an initial vWF burst is required to allow for adequate platelet accumulation and 
      concomitant liver regeneration post-LR and might be abolished as a consequence of
      intrahepatic endothelial cell dysfunction. We were further able to reveal and
      validate the potential of preoperative vWF-antigen levels to predict poor
      postoperative outcome in patients undergoing LR. Despite the pathophysiological
      relevance of our findings, vWF-Ag seems to be a valuable tool for preoperative
      risk assessment in patients undergoing LR. (Hepatology 2018;67:1516-1530).

TI  - Association of vitamin E intake at early childhood with alanine aminotransferase 
      levels at mid-childhood.

AB  - The extent to which vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) intake early in childhood is
      associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level later in childhood is
      unknown. The objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that higher
      alpha-tocopherol intake during early childhood is associated with lower odds of
      elevated ALT levels during mid-childhood and to examine how body mass index (BMI)
      influences these relationships. We studied 528 children in Project Viva. Mothers 
      reported child dietary intake at early childhood visits (median 3.1 years) using 
      a validated food frequency questionnaire. At mid-childhood (median 7.6 years), we
      collected child blood and anthropometric data. The main outcome was elevated
      sex-specific mid-childhood ALT level (>/=22.1 U/L for female children and >/=25.8
      U/L for male children). In multivariable logistic regression models, we assessed 
      the association of energy-adjusted alpha-tocopherol intake with ALT levels,
      adjusting for child age, sex, race/ethnicity, diet, and age-adjusted sex-specific
      BMI z-score at mid-childhood. Among children in this study, 48% were female, 63% 
      were non-Hispanic white, 19% were non-Hispanic black, and 4% were
      Hispanic/Latino. Mean alpha-tocopherol intake was 3.7 +/- 1.0 mg/day (range,
      1.4-9.2) at early childhood. At mid-childhood, mean BMI z-score was 0.41 +/- 1.0 
      units and 22% had an elevated ALT level. In multivariable-adjusted logistic
      regression models, children with higher early childhood vitamin E intake had
      lower odds of elevated mid-childhood ALT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.62; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.39, 0.99) for quartiles 2-4 compared with the lowest 
      quartile of intake. Findings persisted after accounting for early childhood diet 
      (AOR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.36, 1.08) and were strengthened after additionally
      accounting for mid-childhood BMI z-score (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32, 0.99).
      CONCLUSION: In this cohort, higher early childhood intake of alpha-tocopherol was
      associated with lower odds of elevated mid-childhood ALT level. (Hepatology

TI  - WW and C2 domain-containing proteins regulate hepatic cell differentiation and
      tumorigenesis through the hippo signaling pathway.
PG  - 1546-1559
LID - 10.1002/hep.29647 [doi]
AB  - The Hippo pathway regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
      Upon activation, it inhibits the import of the transcriptional coactivator
      yes-associated protein (YAP) into the nucleus, thus suppressing transcription of 
      pro-proliferative genes. Hence, dynamic and precise control of the Hippo pathway 
      is crucial for organ size control and the prevention of tumor formation. Hippo
      signaling is controlled by a growing number of upstream regulators, including WW 
      and C2 domain-containing (WWC) proteins, which trigger a serine/threonine kinase 
      pathway. One component of this is the large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinase, which
      phosphorylates YAP, trapping it in the cytoplasm. WWC proteins have been shown to
      interact with LATS in vitro and stimulate its kinase activity, thus directly
      promoting cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated YAP. However, the function
      of the WWC proteins in the regulation of cell proliferation, organ size control, 
      and tumor prevention in vivo has not yet been determined. Here, we show that loss
      of hepatic WWC expression in mice leads to tissue overgrowth, inflammation,
      fibrosis, and formation of liver carcinoma. WWC-deficient mouse livers display
      reduced LATS activity, increased YAP-mediated gene transcription, and enhanced
      proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells. In addition, loss of WWC expression in
      the liver accelerates the turnover of angiomotin proteins, which act as negative 
      regulators of YAP activity. CONCLUSION: Our data define an essential in vivo
      function for WWC proteins as regulators of canonical and noncanonical Hippo
      signaling in hepatic cell growth and liver tumorigenesis. Thus, expression of WWC
      proteins may serve as novel prognostic factors in human liver carcinoma.

TI  - Restoration of a healthy intestinal microbiota normalizes portal hypertension in 
      a rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1485-1498
LID - 10.1002/hep.29646 [doi]
AB  - Portal hypertension (PH) drives most of the clinical complications in chronic
      liver diseases. However, its progression in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
      and its association with the intestinal microbiota (IM) have been scarcely
      studied. Our aim was to investigate the role of the IM in the mechanisms leading 
      to PH in early NASH. The experimental design was divided in two stages. In stage 
      1, Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 8 weeks a high-fat, high-glucose/fructose
      diet (HFGFD) or a control diet/water (CD). Representative rats were selected as
      IM donors for stage 2. In stage 2, additional HFGFD and CD rats underwent
      intestinal decontamination, followed by IM transplantation with feces from
      opposite-diet donors (heterologous transplant) or autologous fecal transplant (as
      controls), generating four groups: CD-autotransplanted, CD-transplanted,
      HFGFD-autotransplanted, HFGFD-transplanted. After IM transplantation, the
      original diet was maintained for 12-14 days until death. HFGFD rats developed
      obesity, insulin resistance, NASH without fibrosis but with PH, intrahepatic
      endothelial dysfunction, and IM dysbiosis. In HFGFD rats, transplantation with
      feces from CD donors caused a significant reduction of PH to levels comparable to
      CD without significant changes in NASH histology. The reduction in PH was due to 
      a 31% decrease of intrahepatic vascular resistance compared to the
      HFGFD-autotransplanted group (P < 0.05). This effect occurs through restoration
      of the sensitivity to insulin of the hepatic protein kinase B-dependent
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The IM exerts a 
      direct influence in the development of PH in rats with diet-induced NASH and
      dysbiosis; PH, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction revert when a
      healthy IM is restored. (Hepatology 2018;67:1485-1498).

      nanoparticles efficiently reduces hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.
PG  - 1392-1407
LID - 10.1002/hep.29643 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor with limited systemic and
      locoregional modalities of treatment. Although microRNA (miRNA) based therapies
      have significant potential, their targeted delivery remains a major challenge.
      miR-199a-3p functions as an important tumor suppressor in HCC, which regulates
      various cellular processes. Recently, peptide-based nanoparticles (NPs) have been
      developed to deliver oligonucleotides including miRNA. Here, we describe the
      synthesis and characterization of arginine alpha,beta-dehydrophenylalanine
      (RDeltaF) nanoparticles for the selective delivery of miR-199a-3p to restore
      dysregulated gene expression in HCC. Targeted delivery was achieved by
      conjugating lactobionic acid (LA) with RDeltaF NPs (RDeltaF-LA NPs), a ligand for
      the asialoglycoprotein receptor known to be overexpressed in HCC cell lines.
      RDeltaF-LA NPs condensed miR-199a-3p had an average size of approximately 60nm
      and a zeta potential of approximately +2.54 mV. RDeltaF-LA/miR NPs were found to 
      be stable in serum as well as against RNase attack. RDeltaF-LA/miR NPs showed an 
      enhanced cellular uptake and an efficient delivery of miR-199a-3p leading to a
      significant increase in miR-199a-3p levels (over 500 fold). The increased
      miR-199a-3p levels remarkably suppressed cell proliferation and migration as well
      as induced cellular apoptosis and downregulation of the specific target gene
      (mTOR) in vitro. RDeltaF-LA/miR NPs showed high tumor/ low organ ratios after
      intravenous injection into HCC tumor bearing nude mice. RDeltaF-LA/miR NPs
      treated mice demonstrated>50% decline in tumor growth, which also corresponded
      well with suppression of mTOR protein expression, tumor cell proliferation and
      increased survival rate (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: RDeltaF-LA/miR NPs showed
      significantly enhanced delivery of the miRNA which underscores their potential
      for further development as a therapeutic approach for HCC. (Hepatology

AB  - The optimal threshold of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) for the detection
      of hepatic steatosis using both M and XL probe is unknown in nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD). Magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction
      (MRI-PDFF) is an accurate and precise method of detecting the presence of hepatic
      steatosis that is superior to CAP. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate
      the diagnostic accuracy and optimal threshold of CAP for the detection of hepatic
      steatosis as defined by MRI-PDFF >/= 5%. This prospective cross-sectional study
      included 119 adults (59% women) with and without NAFLD who underwent MRI-PDFF and
      CAP using either M or XL probe when indicated within a 6-month period at the
      NAFLD Research Center, University of California, San Diego. The mean ( +/-
      standard deviation) age and body mass index were 52.4 (+/-15.2) years and 29.9
      (+/-5.5) kg/m(2) , respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD (MRI-PDFF >/= 5%) and
      MRI-PDFF >/= 10% was 70.6% and 47.1%, respectively. The area under the receiver
      operating characteristic (AUROC) of CAP for the detection of MRI-PDFF >/= 5% was 
      0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.90) at the cut-point of 288 dB/m and
      of MRI-PDFF >/= 10% was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94) at the cut-point of 306 dB/m.
      When stratified by the interquartile range (IQR) of CAP, we observed that an IQR 
      below the median (30 dB/m) had a robust AUROC compared with an IQR above the
      median (0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-1.00] versus 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56-0.85]; P = 0.0117),
      and these differences were statistically and clinically significant. CONCLUSION: 
      The cut-point of CAP for presence of hepatic steatosis (MRI-PDFF >/= 5%) was 288 
      dB/m. The diagnostic accuracy of CAP for the detection of hepatic steatosis is
      more reliable when the IQR of CAP is <30 dB/m. These data have implications for
      the clinical use of CAP in the assessment of NAFLD. (Hepatology

TI  - Hepatic leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) attenuates
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via SHP1-TRAF6 pathway.
PG  - 1303-1319
LID - 10.1002/hep.29633 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent liver
      pathology characterized by hepatic steatosis and commonly accompanied by
      systematic inflammation and metabolic disorder. Despite an accumulating number of
      studies, no pharmacological strategy is available to treat this condition in the 
      clinic. In this study, we applied extensive gain- and loss-of-function approaches
      to identify the key immune factor leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4
      (LILRB4) as a negative regulator of NAFLD. The hepatocyte-specific knockout of
      LILRB4 (LILRB4-HKO) exacerbated high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, glucose
      metabolic imbalance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and systematic inflammation in
      mice, whereas LILRB4 overexpression in hepatocytes showed a completely opposite
      phenotype relative to that of LILRB4-HKO mice when compared with their
      corresponding controls. Further investigations of molecular mechanisms
      demonstrated that LILRB4 recruits SHP1 to inhibit TRAF6 ubiquitination and
      subsequent inactivation of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein
      kinase cascades. From a therapeutic perspective, the overexpression of LILRB4 in 
      a genetic model of NAFLD, ob/ob mice, largely reversed the inherent hepatic
      steatosis, inflammation, and metabolic disorder. CONCLUSION: Targeting hepatic
      LILRB4 to improve its expression or activation represents a promising strategy
      for the treatment of NAFLD as well as related liver and metabolic diseases.

TI  - Zebrafish abcb11b mutant reveals strategies to restore bile excretion impaired by
      bile salt export pump deficiency.
PG  - 1531-1545
LID - 10.1002/hep.29632 [doi]
AB  - Bile salt export pump (BSEP) adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B11 (ABCB11)
      is a liver-specific ABC transporter that mediates canalicular bile salt excretion
      from hepatocytes. Human mutations in ABCB11 cause progressive familial
      intrahepatic cholestasis type 2. Although over 150 ABCB11 variants have been
      reported, our understanding of their biological consequences is limited by the
      lack of an experimental model that recapitulates the patient phenotypes. We
      applied CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology to knock out abcb11b, the
      ortholog of human ABCB11, in zebrafish and found that these mutants died
      prematurely. Histological and ultrastructural analyses showed that abcb11b mutant
      zebrafish exhibited hepatocyte injury similar to that seen in patients with
      progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2. Hepatocytes of mutant
      zebrafish failed to excrete the fluorescently tagged bile acid that is a
      substrate of human BSEP. Multidrug resistance protein 1, which is thought to play
      a compensatory role in Abcb11 knockout mice, was mislocalized to the hepatocyte
      cytoplasm in abcb11b mutant zebrafish and in a patient lacking BSEP protein due
      to nonsense mutations in ABCB11. We discovered that BSEP deficiency induced
      autophagy in both human and zebrafish hepatocytes. Treatment with rapamycin
      restored bile acid excretion, attenuated hepatocyte damage, and extended the life
      span of abcb11b mutant zebrafish, correlating with the recovery of canalicular
      multidrug resistance protein 1 localization. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these
      data suggest a model that rapamycin rescues BSEP-deficient phenotypes by
      prompting alternative transporters to excrete bile salts; multidrug resistance
      protein 1 is a candidate for such an alternative transporter. (Hepatology

TI  - The circulating microbiome signature and inferred functional metagenomics in
      alcoholic hepatitis.
PG  - 1284-1302
LID - 10.1002/hep.29623 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal dysbiosis is implicated in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). However, changes 
      in the circulating microbiome, its association with the presence and severity of 
      AH, and its functional relevance in AH is unknown. Qualitative and quantitative
      assessment of changes in the circulating microbiome were performed by sequencing 
      bacterial DNA in subjects with moderate AH (MAH) (n = 18) or severe AH (SAH) (n =
      19). These data were compared with heavy drinking controls (HDCs) without obvious
      liver disease (n = 19) and non-alcohol-consuming controls (NACs, n = 20). The
      data were related to endotoxin levels and markers of monocyte activation. Linear 
      discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis, inferred metagenomics, and
      predictive functional analysis using PICRUSt were performed. There was a
      significant increase in 16S copies/ng DNA both in MAH (P < 0.01) and SAH (P <
      0.001) subjects. Compared with NACs, the relative abundance of phylum
      Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in HDCs, MAH, and SAH (P < 0.001). In
      contrast, all alcohol-consuming groups had enrichment with Fusobacteria; this was
      greatest for HDCs and decreased progressively in MAH and SAH. Subjects with SAH
      had significantly higher endotoxemia (P = 0.01). Compared with alcohol-consuming 
      groups, predictive functional metagenomics indicated an enrichment of bacteria
      with genes related to methanogenesis and denitrification. Furthermore, both HDCs 
      and SAH showed activation of a type III secretion system that has been linked to 
      gram-negative bacterial virulence. Metagenomics in SAH versus NACs predicted
      increased isoprenoid synthesis via mevalonate and anthranilate degradation, known
      modulators of gram-positive bacterial growth and biofilm production,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Heavy alcohol consumption appears to be the primary
      driver of changes in the circulating microbiome associated with a shift in its
      inferred metabolic functions. (Hepatology 2018;67:1284-1302).

      the liver.

LID - 10.1002/hep.29616 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent and complex disease that 
      confers a high risk of severe liver disorders. Despite such public and clinical
      health importance, very few effective therapies are currently available for
      NAFLD. We report a protective function and the underlying mechanism of
      dual-specificity phosphatase 14 (DUSP14) in NAFLD and related metabolic
      disorders. Insulin resistance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and concomitant
      inflammatory responses, key pathological processes involved in NAFLD development,
      were significantly ameliorated by hepatocyte-specific DUSP14 overexpression
      (DUSP14-HTG) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced or genetically obese mouse models. By
      contrast, specific DUSP14 deficiency in hepatocytes (DUSP14-HKO) aggravated these
      pathological alterations. We provided mechanistic evidence that DUSP14 directly
      binds to and dephosphorylates transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 
      (TAK1), resulting in the reduced activation of TAK1 and its downstream signaling 
      molecules c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK), p38, and nuclear factor kappa B
      NF-kappaB. This effect was further evidenced by the finding that inhibiting TAK1 
      activity effectively attenuated the deterioration of glucolipid metabolic
      phenotype in DUSP14-HKO mice challenged by HFD administration. Furthermore, we
      identified that both the binding domain and the phosphatase activity of DUSP14
      are required for its protective role against hepatic steatosis, because
      interruption of the DUSP14-TAK1 interaction abolished the mitigative effects of
      DUSP14. CONCLUSION: Hepatocyte DUSP14 is required for maintaining hepatic
      metabolic homeostasis and for suppressing inflammation, a novel function that
      relies on constraining TAK1 hyperactivation. (Hepatology 2018;67:1320-1338).

AB  - An accurate tool enabling early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      clinically important, given that early detection of HCC markedly improves
      survival. We aimed to investigate the molecular markers underlying early
      progression of HCC that can be detected in precancerous lesions. We designed a
      gene selection strategy to identify potential driver genes by integrative
      analysis of transcriptome and clinicopathological data of human multistage HCC
      tissues, including precancerous lesions, low- and high-grade dysplastic nodules. 
      The gene selection process was guided by detecting the selected molecules in both
      HCC and precancerous lesion. Using various computational approaches, we selected 
      10 gene elements as a candidate and, through immunohistochemical staining, showed
      that barrier to autointegration factor 1 (BANF1), procollagen-lysine,
      2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (PLOD3), and splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3B4) 
      are HCC decision markers with superior capability to diagnose early-stage HCC in 
      a large cohort of HCC patients, as compared to the currently popular trio of HCC 
      diagnostic markers: glypican 3, glutamine synthetase, and heat-shock protein 70. 
      Targeted inactivation of BANF1, PLOD3, and SF3B4 inhibits in vitro and in vivo
      liver tumorigenesis by selectively modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      and cell-cycle proteins. Treatment of nanoparticles containing small-interfering 
      RNAs of the three genes suppressed liver tumor incidence as well as tumor growth 
      rates in a spontaneous mouse HCC model. We also demonstrated that SF3B4
      overexpression triggers SF3b complex to splice tumor suppressor KLF4 transcript
      to nonfunctional skipped exon transcripts. This contributes to malignant
      transformation and growth of hepatocyte through transcriptional inactivation of
      p27(Kip1) and simultaneously activation of Slug genes. CONCLUSION: The findings
      suggest molecular markers of BANF1, PLOD3, and SF3B4 indicating early-stage HCC
      in precancerous lesion, and also suggest drivers for understanding the
      development of hepatocarcinogenesis. (Hepatology 2018;67:1360-1377).

AB  - Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      infection, but only 20%-40% of patients respond well. Clinical observations have 
      suggested that HBV genotype is associated with the response to IFN therapy;
      however, its role in viral responsiveness to IFN in HBV-infected hepatocytes
      remains unclear. Here, we produced infectious virions of HBV genotypes A to D to 
      infect three well-recognized cell-culture-based HBV infection systems, including 
      primary human hepatocytes (PHH), differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG), and HepG2-NTCP 
      cells to quantitatively compare the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha on HBV across
      genotypes and cell models. The efficacy of IFN-alpha against HBV in hepatocytes
      was generally similar across genotypes A2, B5, C2, and D3; however, it was
      significantly different among the infection models given that the half maximal
      inhibitory concentration value of IFN-alpha for inhibition of viral DNA
      replication in PHH (<20 U/mL) and dHepaRG cells were much lower than that in
      HepG2-NTCP cells (>500 U/mL). Notably, even in PHH, IFN-alpha did not reduce HBV 
      covalently closed circular DNA at the concentrations for which viral antigens and
      DNA replication intermediates were strongly reduced. The three cell-culture
      models exhibited differential cellular response to IFN-alpha. The genes reported 
      to be associated with responsiveness to IFN-alpha in patients were robustly
      induced in PHH while weakly induced in HepG2-NTCP cells upon IFN-alpha treatment.
      Reduction or promotion of IFN response in PHH or HepG2-NTCP cells significantly
      attenuated or improved the inhibitory capacity of IFN-alpha on HBV replication,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: In the cell-culture-based HBV infection models, the
      sensitivity of HBV to IFN-alpha in hepatocytes is determined more by the
      cell-intrinsic IFN response than by viral genotype, and improvement of the IFN
      response in HepG2-NTCP cells promotes the efficacy of IFN-alpha against HBV.

TI  - Telomere length and reactive oxygen species levels are positively associated with
      a high risk of mortality and recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1378-1391
LID - 10.1002/hep.29604 [doi]
AB  - Telomeres protect chromosomal ends from deterioration and have been shown to be
      susceptible to shortening by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage. ROS
      levels increase during the progression from early to advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). An independent study found that the telomeres in most HCC
      tissues lengthened during carcinogenic advancement. Activated telomerase has been
      hypothesized to elongate telomeres during the progression of malignant HCC, but
      it remains unclear which signaling pathway is necessary for telomerase activation
      in HCC. Here, we showed using cell lines derived from human HCC that H2 O2 ,
      which is a major component of ROS in living organisms, elongates telomeres by
      increasing telomerase activity through protein kinase B (AKT) activation. The AKT
      inhibitor, perifosine, decreased telomere length, cellular viability, and H2 O2
      -mediated migration and invasion capacity in HCC cells while also inhibiting AKT 
      activation, telomere maintenance, and tumor growth in nude mice. Advanced HCC
      tissues showed a positive correlation among ROS levels, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT)
      levels, and telomere length. Furthermore, patients with HCC tumors that have high
      ROS levels and long telomeres displayed poorer survival rates. These data
      demonstrate the significant utilities of ROS levels, pAKT levels, and telomere
      length for predicting a poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Taken together, AKT 
      activation could be essential for telomere maintenance in advanced HCC tumors as 
      well as being an important contributor to malignant HCC progression. CONCLUSION: 
      We showed that H2 O2 contributes to telomere elongation through AKT activation in
      advanced HCC, suggesting that an AKT inhibitor such as perifosine may be useful
      for treating patients with malignant HCC. (Hepatology 2018;67:1378-1391).

TI  - Increase in liver stiffness after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
      is associated with inflammation and predicts mortality.
PG  - 1472-1484

AB  - Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) efficiently treats
      complications of portal hypertension. Liver and spleen stiffness might predict
      clinically significant portal hypertension. This prospective study investigated
      liver stiffness in patients receiving TIPS regardless of indication. Of 83
      included patients, 16 underwent transient elastography immediately before and 30 
      minutes after TIPS (acute group), while 67 received shear wave elastography of
      liver and spleen 1 day before and 7 days after TIPS (chronic group) and were
      followed further. In blood samples obtained before TIPS from cubital, portal, and
      hepatic veins, levels of several interleukins (IL1b, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL18) and
      interferon-gamma were analyzed. In 27 patients (5 acute, 22 chronic), it resulted
      in an increase in liver stiffness of >10%. In 56 patients, liver stiffness
      decreased or remained unchanged (<10%). Importantly, spleen stiffness measured by
      shear wave elastography decreased in all patients (chronic group). None of the
      clinical or laboratory parameters differed between patients with increase in
      liver stiffness and those without. Of note, patients with increased liver
      stiffness showed higher overall and/or hepatic venous levels of proinflammatory
      cytokines at TIPS and higher incidence of organ failure and worse survival after 
      TIPS. C-reactive protein values and increase of >10% in liver stiffness after
      TIPS were the only independent predictors of mortality in these patients.
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the presence of systemic inflammation
      predisposes patients to develop increased liver stiffness after TIPS, a predictor
      of organ failure and death. (NCT03072615) (Hepatology 2018;67:1472-1484).

      hyperbilirubinemia.
PG  - 1609-1619
LID - 10.1002/hep.29599 [doi]
AB  - Neurotoxic bilirubin is the end product of heme catabolism in mammals. Bilirubin 
      is solely conjugated by uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, which is a
      membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid. Due to low 
      function of hepatic and intestinal uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 
      during the neonatal period, human neonates develop mild to severe physiological
      hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulation of bilirubin in the brain leads to the onset of 
      irreversible brain damage, termed kernicterus. Breastfeeding is one of the most
      significant factors that increase the risk of developing kernicterus in infants. 
      Why does this most natural way of feeding increase the risk of brain damage or
      even death? This question leads to the hypothesis that breast milk-induced
      hyperbilirubinemia might bring certain benefits that outweigh those risks. While 
      bilirubin is neurotoxic and cytotoxic, this compound is also a potent
      antioxidant. There are studies showing improved clinical conditions in patients
      with hyperbilirubinemia. Accumulating evidence also shows that genetic
      polymorphisms linked to hyperbilirubinemia are beneficial against various
      diseases. In this review article, we first introduce the production, metabolism, 
      and transport of bilirubin. We then discuss the potential benefits of neonatal
      and adult hyperbilirubinemia. Finally, epigenetic factors as well as metabolomic 
      information associated with hyperbilirubinemia are described. This review article
      advances the understanding of the physiological importance of the paradoxical
      compound bilirubin. (Hepatology 2018;67:1609-1619).

      liver transplantation.

AB  - The use of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive organs in liver transplantation (LT) 
      has increased in the era of direct-acting antiviral therapy. A rising demand for 
      organs, the increased ability to effectively treat HCV infection in the
      transplant setting, and an unprecedented increase in HCV-positive donors have all
      contributed to this trend. A recent abrupt rise in opioid use in the United
      States has resulted in a surge of injection drug use, transmission of HCV, and
      opioid-related overdose deaths. Geographical areas most affected by the opioid
      epidemic have experienced a rapid increase in recovery and utilization of
      HCV-positive donor organs, in which the proportion of deceased donor LTs in the
      United States from donors who are HCV positive has increased nearly 2-fold within
      the last 3 years. The prospect of expanding the organ donor pool with
      HCV-positive donors and achieving acceptable posttransplant outcomes has
      generated much interest in the areas of liver, kidney, and thoracic
      transplantation, including the potential for transplanting organs from HCV
      positive donors into HCV-negative recipients. Developing strategies to ensure
      appropriate selection of potential recipients of HCV-positive organs, initiating 
      timely antiviral therapy, and defining associated risks will be critical in
      achieving optimal posttransplant outcomes in this setting. (Hepatology

TI  - Therapeutic inhibition of inflammatory monocyte recruitment reduces
      steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis.
PG  - 1270-1283
LID - 10.1002/hep.29544 [doi]
AB  - Macrophages are key regulators of liver fibrosis progression and regression in
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver macrophages comprise resident
      phagocytes, Kupffer cells, and monocyte-derived cells, which are recruited
      through the chemokine receptor C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). We aimed at
      elucidating the therapeutic effects of inhibiting monocyte infiltration in NASH
      models by using cenicriviroc (CVC), an oral dual chemokine receptor CCR2/CCR5
      antagonist that is under clinical evaluation. Human liver tissues from NASH
      patients were analyzed for CCR2(+) macrophages, and administration of CVC was
      tested in mouse models of steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis progression, and
      fibrosis regression. In human livers from 17 patients and 4 controls, CCR2(+)
      macrophages increased parallel to NASH severity and fibrosis stage, with a
      concomitant inflammatory polarization of these cluster of differentiation 68(+) ,
      portal monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF). Similar to human disease, we observed
      a massive increase of hepatic MoMF in experimental models of steatohepatitis and 
      liver fibrosis. Therapeutic treatment with CVC significantly reduced the
      recruitment of hepatic Ly-6C(+) MoMF in all models. In experimental
      steatohepatitis with obesity, therapeutic CVC application significantly improved 
      insulin resistance and hepatic triglyceride levels. In fibrotic steatohepatitis, 
      CVC treatment ameliorated histological NASH activity and hepatic fibrosis. CVC
      inhibited the infiltration of Ly-6C(+) monocytes, without direct effects on
      macrophage polarization, hepatocyte fatty acid metabolism, or stellate cell
      activation. Importantly, CVC did not delay fibrosis resolution after injury
      cessation. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that MoMF, but not Kupffer cells,
      specifically up-regulate multiple growth factors and cytokines associated with
      fibrosis progression, while Kupffer cells activated pathways related to
      inflammation initiation and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological
      inhibition of CCR2(+) monocyte recruitment efficiently ameliorates insulin
      resistance, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis, corroborating the therapeutic
      potential of CVC in patients with NASH. (Hepatology 2018;67:1270-1283).

TI  - C/EBP homologous protein-induced loss of intestinal epithelial stemness
      contributes to bile duct ligation-induced cholestatic liver injury in mice.
PG  - 1441-1457
LID - 10.1002/hep.29540 [doi]
AB  - Impaired intestinal barrier function promotes the progression of various liver
      diseases, including cholestatic liver diseases. The close association of primary 
      sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with inflammatory bowel disease highlights the
      importance of the gut-liver axis. It has been reported that bile duct ligation
      (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis is significantly reduced in C/EBP homologous protein
      knockout (CHOP(-/-) ) mice. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In
      the current study, we demonstrate that BDL induces striking and acute hepatic
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses after 1 day, which return to normal
      after 3 days. No significant hepatocyte apoptosis is detected 7-14 days following
      BDL. However, the inflammatory response is significantly increased after 7 days, 
      which is similar to what we found in human PSC liver samples. BDL-induced loss of
      stemness in intestinal stem cells (ISCs), disruption of intestinal barrier
      function, bacterial translocation, activation of hepatic inflammation, M2
      macrophage polarization and liver fibrosis are significantly reduced in CHOP(-/-)
      mice. In addition, intestinal organoids derived from CHOP(-/-) mice contain more 
      and longer crypt structures than those from wild-type (WT) mice, which is
      consistent with the upregulation of stem cell markers (leucine-rich
      repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5, olfactomedin 4, and SRY [sex
      determining region Y]-box 9) and in vivo findings that CHOP(-/-) mice have longer
      villi and crypts as compared to WT mice. Similarly, mRNA levels of CD14,
      interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemotactic
      protein-1 are increased and stem cell proliferation is suppressed in the duodenum
      of patients with cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Activation of ER stress and subsequent
      loss of stemness of ISCs plays a critical role in BDL-induced systemic
      inflammation and cholestatic liver injury. Modulation of the ER stress response
      represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cholestatic liver diseases as
      well as other inflammatory diseases. (Hepatology 2018;67:1441-1457).

TI  - MicroRNA-506 promotes primary biliary cholangitis-like features in cholangiocytes
      and immune activation.
PG  - 1420-1440
LID - 10.1002/hep.29533 [doi]
AB  - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease
      associated with autoimmune phenomena targeting intrahepatic bile duct cells
      (cholangiocytes). Although its etiopathogenesis remains obscure, development of
      antimitochondrial autoantibodies against pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 is a
      common feature. MicroRNA (miR) dysregulation occurs in liver and immune cells of 
      PBC patients, but its functional relevance is largely unknown. We previously
      reported that miR-506 is overexpressed in PBC cholangiocytes and directly targets
      both Cl(-) / HCO3- anion exchanger 2 and type III inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
      receptor, leading to cholestasis. Here, the regulation of miR-506 gene expression
      and its role in cholangiocyte pathophysiology and immune activation was studied. 
      Several proinflammatory cytokines overexpressed in PBC livers (such as
      interleukin-8 [IL8], IL12, IL17, IL18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha)
      stimulated miR-506 promoter activity in human cholangiocytes, as revealed by
      luciferase reporter assays. Experimental overexpression of miR-506 in
      cholangiocytes dysregulated the cell proteomic profile (by mass spectrometry),
      affecting proteins involved in different biological processes including
      mitochondrial metabolism. In cholangiocytes, miR-506 (1) induced
      dedifferentiation with down-regulation of biliary and epithelial markers together
      with up-regulation of mesenchymal, proinflammatory, and profibrotic markers; (2) 
      impaired cell proliferation and adhesion; (3) increased oxidative and endoplasmic
      reticulum stress; (4) caused DNA damage; and (5) sensitized to
      caspase-3-dependent apoptosis induced by cytotoxic bile acids. These events were 
      also associated with impaired energy metabolism in mitochondria (proton leak and 
      less adenosine triphosphate production) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2
      overexpression. Coculture of miR-506 overexpressing cholangiocytes with PBC
      immunocytes induced activation and proliferation of PBC immunocytes. CONCLUSION: 
      Different proinflammatory cytokines enhance the expression of miR-506 in biliary 
      epithelial cells; miR-506 induces PBC-like features in cholangiocytes and
      promotes immune activation, representing a potential therapeutic target for PBC
      patients. (Hepatology 2018;67:1420-1440).

TI  - Graft-infiltrating PD-L1(hi) cross-dressed dendritic cells regulate antidonor T
      cell responses in mouse liver transplant tolerance.
PG  - 1499-1515
LID - 10.1002/hep.29529 [doi]
AB  - Although a key role of cross-dressing has been established in immunity to viral
      infection and more recently in the instigation of transplant rejection, its role 
      in tolerance is unclear. We investigated the role of intragraft dendritic cells
      (DCs) and cross-dressing in mouse major histocompatibility complex
      (MHC)-mismatched liver transplant tolerance that occurs without therapeutic
      immunosuppression. Although donor interstitial DCs diminished rapidly after
      transplantation, they were replaced in the liver by host DCs that peaked on
      postoperative day (POD) 7 and persisted indefinitely. Approximately 60% of these 
      recipient DCs displayed donor MHC class I, indicating cross-dressing. By
      contrast, only a very minor fraction (0%-2%) of cross-dressed DCs (CD-DCs) was
      evident in the spleen. CD-DCs sorted from liver grafts expressed much higher
      levels of T cell inhibitory programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and high levels of
      interleukin-10 compared with non-CD-DCs (nCD-DCs) isolated from the graft.
      Concomitantly, high incidences of programed death protein 1 (PD-1)(hi) T cell
      immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM-3)(+) exhausted
      graft-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells were observed. Unlike nCD-DCs, the CD-DCs
      failed to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic T cells but markedly suppressed
      antidonor host T cell proliferation. CD-DCs were much less evident in allografts 
      from DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12)(-/-) donors that were rejected
      acutely. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that graft-infiltrating PD-L1(hi)
      CD-DCs may play a key role in the regulation of alloimmunity and in the induction
      of liver transplant tolerance. (Hepatology 2018;67:1499-1515).

TI  - The interplay of type I and type II interferons in murine autoimmune cholangitis 
      as a basis for sex-biased autoimmunity.
PG  - 1408-1419
LID - 10.1002/hep.29524 [doi]
AB  - We have reported on a murine model of autoimmune cholangitis, generated by
      altering the AU-rich element (ARE) by deletion of the interferon gamma
      (IFN-gamma) 3' untranslated region (coined ARE-Del(-/-) ), that has striking
      similarities to human primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with female predominance.
      Previously, we suggested that the sex bias of autoimmune cholangitis was
      secondary to intense and sustained type I and II IFN signaling. Based on this
      thesis, and to define the mechanisms that lead to portal inflammation, we
      specifically addressed the hypothesis that type I IFNs are the driver of this
      disease. To accomplish these goals, we crossed ARE-Del(-/-) mice with IFN type I 
      receptor alpha chain (Ifnar1) knockout mice. We report herein that loss of type I
      IFN receptor signaling in the double construct of ARE-Del(-/-) Ifnar1(-/-) mice
      dramatically reduces liver pathology and abrogated sex bias. More importantly,
      female ARE-Del(-/-) mice have an increased number of germinal center (GC) B cells
      as well as abnormal follicular formation, sites which have been implicated in
      loss of tolerance. Deletion of type I IFN signaling in ARE-Del(-/-) Ifnar1(-/-)
      mice corrects these GC abnormalities, including abnormal follicular structure.
      CONCLUSION: Our data implicate type I IFN signaling as a necessary component of
      the sex bias of this murine model of autoimmune cholangitis. Importantly these
      data suggest that drugs that target the type I IFN signaling pathway would have
      potential benefit in the earlier stages of PBC. (Hepatology 2018;67:1408-1419).

TI  - Pregnancy in Wilson's disease: Management and outcome.
PG  - 1261-1269
LID - 10.1002/hep.29490 [doi]
AB  - Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism causing
      toxic hepatic and neural copper accumulation. Clinical symptoms vary widely, from
      asymptomatic disease to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease with or
      without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Continuation of specific medical treatment for
      WD is recommended during pregnancy, but reports of pregnancy outcomes in WD
      patients are sparse. In a retrospective, multicenter study, 282 pregnancies in
      136 WD patients were reviewed. Age at disease onset, age at conception, and
      WD-specific treatments were recorded. Maternal complications during pregnancy,
      rate of spontaneous abortions, and birth defects were analyzed with respect to
      medical treatment during pregnancy. Worsening of liver function tests was evident
      during 16 of 282 (6%) pregnancies and occurred in undiagnosed patients as well as
      in those under medical treatment. Liver test abnormalities resolved in all cases 
      after delivery. Aggravation of neurological symptoms during pregnancy was rare
      (1%), but tended to persist after delivery. The overall spontaneous abortion rate
      in the study cohort was 73 of 282 (26%). Patients with an established diagnosis
      of WD receiving medical treatment experienced significantly fewer spontaneous
      abortions than patients with undiagnosed WD (odds ratio, 2.853 [95% confidence
      interval, 1.634-4.982]). Birth defects occurred in 7 of 209 (3%) live births.
      CONCLUSION: Pregnancy in WD patients on anticopper therapy is safe. The
      spontaneous abortion rate in treated patients was lower than that in
      therapy-naive patients. Although the teratogenic potential of copper chelators is
      a concern, the rate of birth defects in our cohort was low. Treatment for WD
      should be maintained during pregnancy, and patients should be monitored closely
      for hepatic and neurological symptoms. (Hepatology 2018;67:1261-1269).

TI  - Survival of patients with cirrhosis and acute peptic ulcer bleeding compared with
      variceal bleeding using current first-line therapies.
PG  - 1458-1471
LID - 10.1002/hep.29370 [doi]
AB  - The presence of cirrhosis increases the mortality of patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding (PUB). Both acute variceal bleeding (AVB) and PUB are associated with
      substantial mortality in cirrhosis. This multicenter cohort study was performed
      to assess whether the mortality of patients with cirrhosis with PUB is different 
      from that of those with AVB. Patients with cirrhosis and acute gastrointestinal
      bleeding were consecutively included and treated with somatostatin and proton
      pump inhibitor infusion from admission and with antibiotic prophylaxis. Emergency
      endoscopy with endoscopic therapy was performed within the first 6 hours. 646
      patients with AVB and 144 with PUB were included. There were baseline differences
      between groups, such as use of gastroerosive drugs or beta-blockers. Child-Pugh
      and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease MELD scores were similar. Further bleeding 
      was more frequent in the AVB group than those in the PUB group (18% vs. 10%; odds
      ratio [OR] = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.29-0.88). However, mortality 
      risk at 45 days was similar in both groups (19% in the AVB group vs. 17% in the
      PUB group; OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.55-1.33; P = 0.48). Different parameters, such
      as Child-Pugh score, acute kidney injury, acute on chronic liver failure, or
      presence of shock or bacterial infection, but not the cause of bleeding, were
      related to the risk of death. Only 2% of the PUB group versus 3% of the AVB group
      died with uncontrolled bleeding (P = 0.39), whereas the majority of patients in
      either group died from liver failure or attributed to other comorbidities.
      CONCLUSION: Using current first-line therapy, patients with cirrhosis and acute
      peptic ulcer bleeding have a similar survival than those with variceal bleeding. 
      The risk of further bleeding is higher in patients with variceal hemorrhage.
      However, few patients in both groups died from uncontrolled bleeding, rather the 
      cause of death was usually related to liver failure or comorbidities. (Hepatology
      2018;67:1458-1471).

TI  - Reframing the approach to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: Longitudinal
      assessment with HALTHCC improves ablate and wait strategy.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29907 [doi]
AB  - Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are screened at presentation for
      appropriateness of liver transplantation (LT) using morphometric criteria, which 
      poorly specifies risk. Morphology is the crux of measuring tumor response to
      locoregional therapy (LRT) using modified response evaluation criteria in solid
      tumors (mRECIST). This study investigated the utility of following a continuous
      risk score (hazard associated with liver transplantation in HCC [HALTHCC]) to
      longitudinally assess risk. This multicenter retrospective study from 2002-2014
      enrolled 419 patients listed for LT for HCC. One cohort had LRT while waiting
      (n=351), compared to the control group (n=68) without LRT. Imaging studies
      (n=2085) were collated to laboratory data to calculate HALTHCC, MORAL,
      Metroticket 2.0, and AFP Score, longitudinally. Cox proportional hazards
      evaluated associations of HALTHCC and peri-LRT changes with intention-to-treat
      survival (considering dropout or post-LT mortality) and utility was assessed with
      Harrell's C-index. HALTHCC better predicted ITT outcome (LT=309, dropout=110)
      when assessed closer to de-listing (P<0.0001), maximally just prior to delisting 
      (C-index 0.742 [0.643-0.790]). Delta-HALTHCC after LRT was more sensitive to
      changes in risk than mRECIST. HALTHCC score and the peri-LRT percentage change
      were independently associated with ITT mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=1.105
      [1.045-1.169] per point and 1.014 [1.004-1.024] per percent, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS: HALTHCC is superior in assessing tumor risk in candidates awaiting
      LT and its utility increases over time. Peri-LRT relative change in HALTHCC
      outperforms mRECIST in stratifying risk of dropout, mortality and recurrence
      after LT. With improving estimates of post-LT outcomes, it is reasonable to
      consider allocation using HALTHCC and not just waiting time. Furthermore, this
      study supports a shift in perspective, from listing to allocation, to better
      utilize precious donor organs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - BILIARY ATRESIA: Clinical and Research Challenges for the 21(st) Century.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29905 [doi]
AB  - Biliary atresia (BA) is a fibroinflammatory disease of the intra- and
      extrahepatic biliary tree. Without medical treatment, surgical hepatic
      portoenterosmy (HPE) may restore bile drainage, but progression of the
      intrahepatic disease results in complications of portal hypertension and advanced
      cirrhosis in most children. Recognizing that further progress in the field is
      unlikely without a better understanding of the underlying cause(s) and
      pathogenesis of the disease, the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive
      and Kidney Diseases sponsored a research workshop focused on innovative and
      promising approaches and on identifying future areas of research. Investigators
      discussed recent advances using gestational ultrasound and results of newborn BA 
      screening with serum direct (conjugated) bilirubin that support a pre-natal onset
      of biliary injury. Experimental and human studies implicate the toxic properties 
      of environmental toxins (e.g. biliatresone) and of viruses (e.g. CMV) to the
      biliary system. Among host factors, sequence variants in genes related to biliary
      development and ciliopathies, a notable lack of a cholangiocyte glycocalyx and of
      submucosal collagen bundles in the neonatal extrahepatic bile ducts, and an
      innate pro-inflammatory bias of the neonatal immune system contribute to an
      increased susceptibility to damage and obstruction following an epithelial
      injury. These advances form the foundation for a future research agenda focused
      on identifying the environmental and host factor(s) that cause BA, the potential 
      use of population screening, studies of the mechanisms of prominent fibrosis in
      young infants, determinations of clinical surrogates of disease progression, and 
      the design of clinical trials that target subgroups of patients with initial
      drainage following HPE. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Liver Angiopoietin-2 is a key predictor of de novo or recurrent hepatocellular
      cancer after HCV direct-acting antivirals.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29911 [doi]
AB  - Recent reports suggested that direct acting antivirals (DAAs) might favor
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).In Study 1,we studied the proangiogenic liver
      microenvironment in 242 DAAs-treated chronic Hepatitis C patients with advanced
      fibrosis.Angiopoietin-2 expression was studied in tissue (cirrhotic and/or
      neoplastic) from recurrent,de novo,non-recurrent HCC or patients never developing
      HCC.Circulating Angiopoietin-2,vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF),and
      C-reactive protein were also measured. In Study 2,we searched for factors
      associated with de novo HCC in 257 patients with cirrhosis of different
      etiologies enrolled in a dedicated prospective study. Thorough
      biochemical,clinical,hemodynamic,endoscopic, elastographic,and echo-Doppler
      work-up was performed in both studies.In Study 1,none without cirrhosis developed
      HCC.Of 183 patients with cirrhosis,14/28 (50.0%) with previous HCC recurred while
      21/155 (13.5%) developed de novo HCC.Recurrent and de novo HCCs had significantly
      higher liver fibrosis scores,portal pressure,and systemic inflammation than
      non-recurrent HCC or patients never developing HCC. In recurrent/de novo HCC
      patients,tumor and non-tumor Angiopoietin-2 showed an inverse relationship with
      portal vein velocity (r=-0.412,p=0.037 and r= -0.409,p=0.047,respectively) and a 
      positive relationship with liver stiffness
      (r=0.526,p=0.007;r=0.525,p=0.003,respectively).Baseline circulating VEGF and
      cirrhotic liver Angiopoietin-2 were significantly related (r=0.414,p=0.044).VEGF 
      increased during DAAs, remaining stably elevated at 3 months follow-up, when it
      significantly related with serum Angiopoietin-2 (r=0.531,p=0.005).Angiopoietin-2 
      expression in the primary tumor or in cirrhotic tissue before DAAs was
      independently related with the risk of HCC recurrence (OR 1.137,95%CI
      1.044-1.137,p=0.003) or occurrence (OR 1.604,95% CI 1.080-2.382;p=0.019).In Study
      2,DAA treatment (OR 4.770,95%CI 1.395-16.316,p=0.013) and large varices (OR
      3.857,95%CI 1.127-13.203,p=0.032) were independent predictors of de novo HCC.
      CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that DAAs-mediated increase of VEGF favors HCC
      recurrence/occurrence in susceptible patients, i.e. those with more severe
      fibrosis and splanchnic collateralization, who already have abnormal activation
      in liver tissues of neo-angiogenetic pathways, as shown by increased
      Angiopoietin-2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Receipt of a pediatric liver offer as the first offer reduces waitlist mortality 
      for adult women.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In liver transplantation, adults with small stature have a
      greater susceptibility to waitlist mortality. This may explain the persistent
      waitlist mortality disparity that exists for women. We hypothesized that women
      who receive early offers of pediatric donor livers have improved waitlist
      survival, and that preferentially offering these organs to women mitigates this
      sex-based disparity. METHODS: We analyzed donor liver offers from 2010 to 2014.
      Adult candidates who received a first offer that ranked within the first three
      match run positions from the donors' perspective were classified based on gender 
      and whether they received a pediatric versus adult offer. We used competing risks
      regression to associate first offer type and waitlist mortality. RESULTS: 8,101
      waitlist candidates received a first offer that was ranked within the first three
      match run positions: 5.6% (293/5,202) men and 6.2% (179/2,899) women received a
      pediatric donor liver as their first offer. In multivariable analyses, compared
      to adult-first men, adult-first women (sHR1.33, 95%CI 1.17-1.51, p < 0.01) had an
      increased pre-transplant mortality risk while pediatric-first men and
      pediatric-first women had non-inferior risks of morality. Pediatric-to-adult and 
      adult-to-adult recipients had similar risks of graft failure and post-transplant 
      mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Ours is the first study to examine allograft selection,
      by donor age, recipient sex, and in effect size, as a means to address
      disparities in waitlist mortality. We found that women who received a pediatric
      donor liver as the first offer had a lower risk of waitlist mortality compared to
      those who receive adult offers. Our data provides a simple approach to mitigating
      the increased waitlist mortality experienced by women by incorporating donor and 
      recipient size, as variables, into organ allocation. This article is protected by

TI  - Landscape of immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma and its
      additional impact on histological and molecular classification.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29904 [doi]
AB  - Immune cells constitute an important element of tumor tissue. Accumulating
      evidence indicates their clinicopathological significance in predicting prognosis
      and therapeutic efficacy. Nonetheless, the combinations of immune cells forming
      the immune microenvironment and their association with histological findings
      remain largely unknown. Moreover, it is unclear which immune cells or immune
      microenvironments are the most prognostically significant. Here, we
      comprehensively analyzed the immune microenvironment and its intratumor
      heterogeneity in 919 regions of 158 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and the
      results were compared with the corresponding histological and prognostic data.
      Consequently, we classified immune microenvironment of HCC into three distinct
      immunosubtypes: Immune-high, Immune-mid, and Immune-low. The Immune-high subtype 
      was characterized by increased B/plasma cell and T cell infiltration, and the
      Immune-high subtype and B cell infiltration were identified as independent
      positive prognostic factors. Varying degrees of intratumor heterogeneity of the
      immune microenvironment were observed, some of which reflected the multistep
      nature of HCC carcinogenesis. However, the predominant pattern of immunosubtype
      and immune cell infiltration of each tumor was prognostically important. Of note,
      the Immune-high subtype was associated with poorly differentiated HCC, CK19(+)
      and/or SALL4(+) high-grade HCC, and Hoshida's S1/Boyault's G2 subclasses.
      Furthermore, patients with high-grade HCC of the predominant Immune-high subtype 
      had significantly better prognosis. These results provide the rationale for
      evaluating the immune microenvironment in addition to the usual
      histological/molecular classification of HCC. CONCLUSION: The immune
      microenvironment of HCC can be classified into three immunosubtypes (Immune-high,
      Immune-mid, and Immune-low) with additional prognostic impact on histological and
      molecular classification of HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Indeterminate pediatric acute liver failure is uniquely characterized by a
      CD103+CD8+ T-cell infiltrate.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29901 [doi]
AB  - The cause of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is unknown in up to 40% of
      cases. Evidence suggests aberrant immune system activation may play a role. We
      hypothesized indeterminate PALF cases would exhibit a unique pattern of hepatic
      inflammation. This was a retrospective and prospective study of PALF cases due to
      indeterminate (iPALF), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), or known diagnosis (dPALF)
      etiology. Liver tissue sections were stained with immunohistochemical (IHC)
      markers for cytotoxic T-cells (CD8), perforin, and tissue resident memory T-cells
      (CD103), and scored as minimal, moderate, or dense. Lymphocytes were isolated
      from liver tissue for T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) sequencing and flow
      cytometry studies. Thirty-three iPALF, 9 AIH, and 14 dPALF cases were included.
      Dense hepatic infiltrates of CD8+ T-cells were found in 27 (82%) iPALF compared
      to 1 (7%) dPALF case (p<0.0001). Perforin staining was dense or moderate in 19
      (73%) of 26 iPALF cases compared to minimal in all 7 dPALF cases (p=0.004). 16
      (62%) of 26 iPALF cases had dense CD103 staining compared to none of the 6 dPALF 
      cases (p=0.001). TCRbeta sequencing of iPALF cases demonstrated increased
      clonality compared to dPALF and control cases. Flow cytometry and IHC revealed
      iPALF intrahepatic leukocytes were predominantly tissue resident memory CD8+ T
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Indeterminate PALF is characterized by a dense CD8+ T-cell
      hepatic infiltrate consistent with expansion of a tissue resident memory T-cell
      phenotype. CD8+ T-cells are a new biomarker of immune dysregulation in iPALF and 
      may be used to better identify and define this group. This article is protected

TI  - Hepatocyte microvesicle levels improve prediction of mortality in patients with
      cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29903 [doi]
AB  - Microvesicles (MVs) are extracellular vesicles released by cells following
      activation or apoptosis. Some MV subpopulations augment with cirrhosis severity
      and contribute to portal hypertension. This study aimed at determining if plasma 
      MV levels can estimate the presence of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)
      >/= 10 mmHg and predict mortality in patients with advanced chronic liver
      disease. All patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver
      catheterization between 2013 and 2015 at two centers were prospectively included.
      We measured circulating levels of annexin V+, platelet, leukocyte, endothelial
      and hepatocyte MVs. The test cohort included 139 patients. Hepatocyte MV levels
      were 4.0 and 2.2 fold higher in patients with Child-Pugh C than in those with
      Child-Pugh A or B liver disease, respectively. Levels of other MV subpopulations 
      were not influenced by liver disease severity. Hepatocyte MV levels correlated
      with HVPG, but could not identify patients with HVPG >/= 10 mmHg. Hepatocyte MV
      level > 65 U/L predicted 6-month mortality independently of Child-Pugh score and 
      of MELD. Patients with hepatocyte MV levels > 65 U/L and MELD > 15 had a higher
      6-month mortality than other patients (23% vs. 3%; p=0.001). These findings were 
      confirmed in a validation cohort including 103 patients. CONCLUSION: Circulating 
      MV levels cannot identify patients with HVPG >/= 10 mmHg. By contrast, hepatocyte
      MV levels strongly improve prediction of 6-month mortality in patients with
      advanced chronic liver disease. Therapies associated with decreased levels of
      circulating hepatocyte MV might be attractive strategies in patients with severe 
      cirrhosis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Loss of PDK4 switches the hepatic NF-kappaB/TNF pathway from pro-survival to
      pro-apoptosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29902 [doi]
AB  - It has been established that NF-kappaB members promote survival by upregulating
      anti-apoptotic genes and that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB
      is required for TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate
      that this pro-survival pathway is switched to pro-apoptosis under pyruvate
      dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)-deficient conditions. PDK4-deficiency triggered
      hepatic apoptosis concomitantly with increased numbers of aberrant mitochondria, 
      ROS production, sustained JNK activation, and reduction of GSH. Interestingly,
      PDK4 retained p65 in cytoplasm via a direct protein-protein interaction.
      Disruption of PDK4-p65 association promoted p65 nuclear translocation. This in
      turn facilitated p65 binding to the TNF promoter to activate TNF-TNFR1 apoptotic 
      pathway. Pdk4(-/-) livers were sensitized to Jo2 and GalN/LPS-mediated apoptotic 
      injury which was prevented by the inhibition of p65 or TNFR1. The pro-survival
      activity of TNF was shifted, which was switched to a pro-apoptotic activity in
      Pdk4(-/-) hepatocytes as a result of impaired activation of pro-survival
      NF-kappaB targets. CONCLUSION: PDK4 is indispensible to dictate the fate of
      TNF/NF-kappaB-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. This article is protected by

TI  - Blocking H1/H2 histamine receptors inhibits damage/fibrosis in Mdr2(-/-) mice and
      human cholangiocarcinoma tumorigenesis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29898 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) patients are at risk of
      developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). We have shown that: (i) histamine (HA)
      increases biliary hyperplasia via H1/H2 histamine receptors (HRs) and (ii) HA
      levels increase and mast cells (MCs) infiltrate during PSC and CCA. We aimed to
      examine the effects of chronic treatment with H1/H2HR antagonists on PSC and CCA.
      METHODS: Wild-type and Mdr2(-/-) mice were treated by osmotic minipumps with
      saline, mepyramine or ranitidine (10mg/kg BW/day) or a combination of
      mepyramine/ranitidine for 4 wks. Liver damage was assessed by H&E. We evaluated
      (i) H1/H2 HR expression; (ii) MC presence; (iii) l-histidine decarboxylase
      (HDC)/HA axis; (iv) cholangiocyte proliferation/bile duct mass (v)
      fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Nu/nu mice were implanted with
      Mz-ChA-1 cells into the hind flanks and treated with saline, mepyramine or
      ranitidine. Tumor growth was measured and we evaluated: (i) H1/H2HR expression;
      (ii) proliferation; (iii) MC activation; (iv) angiogenesis and (v)
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vitro, human hepatic stellate cells
      were evaluated for H1HR and H2HR expression. Cultured cholangiocytes and CCA
      lines were treated with saline, mepyramine or ranitidine (25 muM) before
      evaluating proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT, and potential signaling mechanisms. 
      RESULTS: H1/H2HR and MC presence increased in human PSC and CCA. In H1/H2HR
      antagonist (alone or in combination)-treated Mdr2(-/-) mice, liver and biliary
      damage and fibrosis decreased compared to saline treatment. H1/H2HR antagonists
      decreased tumor growth, serum HA, angiogenesis and EMT. In vitro, H1/H2HR
      blockers reduced biliary proliferation, and CCA cells had decreased
      proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and migration. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of H1/H2HR
      reverses PSC-associated damage and decreases CCA growth, angiogenesis and EMT.
      Since PSC patients are at risk of developing CCA, using HR blockers may be
      therapeutic for these diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - The High Burden of Alcoholic Cirrhosis in Privately Insured Persons in the United
      States.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29887 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) is a major cause of liver-related
      morbidity and mortality in the United States (US). Rising rates of alcohol use
      disorders in the US will likely result in more alcoholic liver disease. Our aim
      was to determine the prevalence, healthcare utilization, and costs of AC among
      privately insured persons in the US. METHODS: We collected data from persons aged
      18-64 with AC (identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes) enrolled in the Truven
      MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (2009-2015). We determined
      yearly prevalence, weighted to the national employer-sponsored, privately insured
      population. Using competing risk analysis, we estimated event rates for portal
      hypertensive complications and estimated the association between alcoholic
      cirrhosis and costs as well as admissions and readmissions. RESULTS: 294,215
      people had cirrhosis in 2015 and 105,871 (36%) had AC. Mean age at AC diagnosis
      was 53.5 years. 32% were women. Over the 7 years queried, estimated national
      cirrhosis prevalence rose from 0.19% to 0.27% (p<0.001) and from 0.07% to 0.10%
      (p<0.001) for AC. Compared to non-AC, AC enrollees were significantly more likely
      to have portal hypertensive complications at diagnosis, and higher yearly
      cirrhosis and alcohol-related admissions (25 excess cirrhosis admissions and 6.3 
      excess alcohol-related admissions per 100 enrollees) as well as all-cause
      readmissions. Per-person costs in the first year after diagnosis nearly doubled
      for AC versus non-AC persons (US$44,835 vs 23,319). CONCLUSION: In a nationally
      representative cohort of privately insured persons, AC enrollees were
      disproportionately sicker at presentation, admitted and readmitted more often,
      and incurred nearly double the per-person healthcare costs compared to those with
      non-AC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare and chronic liver disease for which
      there is no effective therapy. There has been growing interest in developing
      treatments for this condition with several agents being proposed as potential
      therapies. However, there is lack of clarity about how to measure clinical
      benefit in trials in patients with this complex and rare disease. This article

TI  - NTCP inhibition has hepatoprotective effects in cholestasis in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29888 [doi]
AB  - Accumulation of bile salts during cholestasis leads to hepatic and biliary
      injury, driving inflammatory and fibrotic processes. The Na(+) -Taurocholate
      Cotransporting Polypeptide (NTCP) is the major hepatic uptake transporter of bile
      salts, and can be specifically inhibited by myrcludex B. We hypothesized that
      inhibition of NTCP dampens cholestatic liver injury. Acute cholestasis was
      induced in mice by a 3.5-diethoxycarbonyl-1.4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet or by
      bile duct ligation (BDL). Chronic cholestasis was investigated in Atp8b1-G308V
      and Abcb4/Mdr2 deficient mice. Mice were injected daily with myrcludex B or
      vehicle. Myrcludex B reduced plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in DDC-fed,
      Atp8b1-G308V and BDL mice by 39%, 27% and 48% respectively. Expression of genes
      involved in fibrosis, proliferation and inflammation was reduced by myrcludex B
      treatment in DDC-fed and Atp8b1-G308V mice. NTCP-inhibition increased plasma bile
      salt levels from 604+/-277 to 1746+/-719 microM in DDC-fed mice, 432+/-280 to
      762+/-288 microM in Atp8b1-G308V mice and from 522+/-130 to 3625+/-378 microM in 
      BDL mice. NTCP-inhibition strongly aggravated weight loss in BDL mice, but not in
      other cholestatic models studied. NTCP-inhibition reduced biliary bile salt
      output in DDC-fed and Atp8b1-G308V mice by approximately 50% whilst phospholipid 
      (PL) output was maintained, resulting in a higher PL/bile salt ratio. Conversely,
      liver injury in Abcb4 deficient mice, lacking biliary phospholipid output, was
      aggravated after myrcludex B treatment. CONCLUSION: NTCP-inhibition by myrcludex 
      B has hepatoprotective effects, by reducing bile salt load in hepatocytes and
      increasing the biliary PL/bile salt ratio. High micromolar plasma bile salt
      levels after NTCP-inhibition were well tolerated. NTCP-inhibition may be
      beneficial in selected forms of cholestasis. This article is protected by

TI  - ASS1 and peri-portal gene expression in sonic hedgehog hepatocellular adenomas.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29884 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Genetic alterations define different molecular subclasses of
      hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) linked with risk factors, histology and clinical
      behavior. Recently, ASS1, a major peri-portal protein, was proposed as a marker
      of HCA with a high risk of hemorrhage. We aimed to assess the significance of
      ASS1 expression through the scope of the HCA molecular classification. METHODS:
      ASS1 expression was evaluated using RNAseq, quantitative RT-PCR and
      Immunohistochemistry. ASS1 and GLI1 expression were analyzed in vitro after
      modulation of GLI1 expression. RESULTS: Using RNAseq in 27 HCA and 5 non-tumor
      liver samples, ASS1 expression was highly correlated with GLI1 expression
      (P<0.0001, R=0.75). In the overall series of 408 HCA, ASS1 overexpression was
      significantly associated with sonic hedgehog HCA (shHCA) compared to other
      molecular subgroups (P<0.0001) suggesting that sonic hedgehog signaling control
      ASS1 expression. GLI1 expression silencing by siRNA induced a downregulation of
      ASS1 in PLC/PFR5 and SNU878 cell lines. In 390 HCA, we showed that ASS1
      expression belonged to the peri-portal expression program that was maintained in 
      shHCA but down-regulated in all the other HCA subtypes. In contrast, HCA with
      ss-catenin activation showed an activation of a perivenous program. Despite the
      significant association between GLI1 and ASS1 expression, ASS1 mRNA expression
      was not associated with specific clinical features. At the protein level using
      immunohistochemistry, PTGDS was strongly and specifically overexpressed in shHCA.
      CONCLUSION: ASS1 is associated with sonic hedgehog activation as part of a
      peri-portal program expressed in shHCA, a molecular subgroup defined by
      INHBE-GLI1 gene fusion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 is an endogenous negative regulator of metabolic
      dysfunctions in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29889 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by hepatic steatosis,
      insulin resistance and inflammation, poses a high risk of cardiometabolic
      disorders. Ubiquitin specific protease 4 (USP4), a deubiquitinating enzyme, is
      pivotally involved in regulating multiple inflammatory pathways; however, the
      role of USP4 in NAFLD is unknown. Here we report that USP4 expression was
      dramatically downregulated in the livers from NAFLD patients and different NAFLD 
      mouse models induced by a high fat diet (HFD) or a genetic deficiency (ob/ob) as 
      well as in palmitate-treated hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific USP4 depletion
      exacerbated hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and inflammatory response in
      HFD-induced NAFLD mice. Conversely, hepatic USP4 overexpression notably
      alleviated the pathological alterations in two different NAFLD models.
      Mechanistically, hepatocyte USP4 directly bound to and deubiquitinated
      transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), leading to a
      suppression of the activation of downstream NF-kappaB and JNK cascades, which in 
      turn reversed the disruption of the IRS-AKT-GSK3beta signaling. In addition,
      USP4-TAK1 interaction and subsequent TAK1 deubiquitination were required for the 
      amelioration of metabolic dysfunctions. Collectively, the present study provides 
      the first evidence that USP4 functions as a pivotal suppressor in NAFLD and
      related metabolic disorders. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Acute HBV infection in humanized chimeric mice has multiphasic viral kinetics.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chimeric uPA/SCID mice reconstituted with humanized livers are useful
      for studying HBV infection in the absence of an adaptive immune response.
      However, the detailed characterization of HBV infection kinetics necessary to
      enable in-depth mechanistic studies in this novel in vivo HBV infection model is 
      lacking. METHODS: To characterize HBV kinetics post-inoculation (p.i.) to steady 
      state, 42 mice were inoculated with HBV. Serum HBV DNA was frequently measured
      from 1 minute to 63 days p.i. Total intrahepatic HBV DNA, HBV cccDNA, and HBV RNA
      was measured in a subset of mice at 2, 4, 6, 10, and 13 weeks p.i. HBV half-life 
      (t1/2 ) was estimated using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: During the
      first 6 h p.i. serum HBV declined in repopulated uPA/SCID mice with a t1/2 =62
      min [95%CI=59-67min]. Thereafter, viral decline slowed followed by a 2 day lower 
      plateau. Subsequent viral amplification was multiphasic with an initial mean
      doubling time of t2 =8+/-3 h followed by an interim plateau before prolonged
      amplification (t2 =2+/-0.5 days) to a final HBV steady state of 9.3+/-0.3 log
      copies/ml. Serum HBV and intrahepatic HBV DNA were positively correlated (R(2)
      =0.98). CONCLUSIONS: HBV infection in uPA/SCID chimeric mice is highly dynamic
      despite the absence of an adaptive immune response. The serum HBV t1/2 in
      humanized uPA/SCID mice was estimated to be approximately 1 h regardless of
      inoculum size. The HBV acute infection kinetics presented here is an important
      step in characterizing this experimental model system so that it can be
      effectively used to elucidate the dynamics of the HBV lifecycle and thus possibly
      reveal effective antiviral drug targets. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Sphingosine kinase 1 promotes liver fibrosis by preventing miR-19b-3p-mediated
      inhibition of CCR2.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29885 [doi]
AB  - Chronic liver disease mediated by activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and
      Kupffer cells (KCs) leads to liver fibrosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the
      molecular mechanism and define the cell type involved in mediating the
      SphK1-dependent effect on liver fibrosis. The levels of expression and activity
      of SphK1 were significantly increased in fibrotic livers compared with the normal
      livers in human. SphK1 was co-expressed with a range of HSC/KC markers including 
      desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and F4/80 in fibrotic liver.
      Deficiency of SphK1 (SphK1(-/-) ) resulted in a marked amelioration of hepatic
      injury, including transaminase activities, histology, collagen deposition,
      alpha-SMA and inflammation, in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) or bile duct ligation
      (BDL)-induced mice. Likewise, treatment with a specific inhibitor of SphK1, 5C,
      also significantly prevented liver injury and fibrosis in mice induced by CCl4 or
      BDL. In cellular levels, inhibition of SphK1 significantly blocked the activation
      and migration of HSCs and KCs. Moreover, SphK1 knockout in KCs reduced the
      secretion of CCL2, and SphK1 knockout in HSCs reduced CCR2 (CCL2 receptor)
      expression in HSCs. CCL2 in SphK1(-/-) mice was decreased whereas microRNA-19b-3p
      in SphK1(-/-) mice was increased compared with WT mice. Furthermore,
      microRNA-19b-3p downregulated CCR2 in HSCs. The functional effect of SphK1 in
      HSCs on liver fibrosis was further strengthened by the results of animal
      experiments using a bone marrow transplantation method. CONCLUSION: SphK1 has
      distinct roles in the activation of KCs and HSCs in liver fibrosis.
      Mechanistically, SphK1 in KCs mediates CCL2 secretion, and SphK1 in HSCs
      upregulates CCR2 by downregulation of miR-19b-3p. This article is protected by

TI  - Novel link between gut-microbiome derived metabolite and shared gene-effects with
      hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29892 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that gut-microbiome is associated with nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to examine if serum metabolites especially 
      those derived from the gut-microbiome have a shared gene-effect with hepatic
      steatosis and fibrosis. This is a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective
      discovery cohort including 156 well-characterized Twins and Families with
      untargeted metabolome profiling assessment. Hepatic steatosis was assessed using 
      magnetic-resonance-imaging proton-density-fat-fraction (MRI-PDFF) and fibrosis
      using MR-elastography (MRE). A twin additive genetics and unique environment
      effects (AE) model was used to estimate the shared gene-effect between
      metabolites and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. The findings were validated in an
      independent prospective validation cohort of 156 participants with biopsy-proven 
      NAFLD including shotgun metagenomics sequencing assessment in a subgroup of the
      cohort. In the discovery cohort, 56 metabolites including 6 microbial metabolites
      had a significant shared gene-effect with both hepatic steatosis and fibrosis
      after adjustment for age, sex and ethnicity. In the validation cohort 6
      metabolites were associated with advanced fibrosis. Among them, only one
      microbial metabolite, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, remained consistent and
      statistically significantly associated with liver fibrosis in the discovery and
      validation cohort (fold-change of higher-MRE versus lower-MRE:1.78,p<0.001 and of
      advanced versus no advanced fibrosis:1.26,p=0.037, respectively). The share
      genetic determination of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate with hepatic steatosis was RG
      :0.57,95%CI:0.27-0.80,p<0.001 and with fibrosis was RG
      :0.54,95%CI:0.036-1,p=0.036. Pathway reconstruction linked
      3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate to several human gut-microbiome species. In the
      validation cohort, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate was significantly correlated with
      the abundance of several gut-microbiome species, belonging only to Firmicutes,
      Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla, previously reported as associated with
      advanced fibrosis. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept study provides evidence of a
      link between the gut-microbiome and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate that shares
      gene-effect with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. This article is protected by

TI  - PRDM8 Exhibits Anti-Tumor Activities Toward Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Targeting
      NAP1L1.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29890 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major leading cause of cancer mortality
      worldwide. PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 8 (PRDM8) is a key
      regulator in neural development and testis steroidogenesis, however, its role in 
      liver carcinogenesis remains to be investigated. In this study, PRDM8 was found
      down-regulated in HCC, which was linked with shorter recurrence-free survival.
      Lentiviral-based overexpression and knockdown approaches showed that PRDM8
      inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. PRDM8 caused G1/S cell
      cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. In vivo tumor model confirmed the anti-tumor 
      role of PRDM8 in HCC growth and metastasis. Mechanistic study showed that PRDM8
      suppressed PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade through the regulation of nucleosome
      assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1). CONCLUSIONS: PRDM8 as a functional tumor
      suppressor is frequently down-regulated in HCC. Through regulating NAP1L1, PRDM8 
      inhibits PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in HCC. PRDM8 is a potential target for novel
      therapies of HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hepatic Resection Compared to Chemoembolization in Intermediate to Advanced Stage
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-analysis of High-Quality Studies.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29883 [doi]
AB  - According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease treatment
      guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the role of surgery has been
      expanded beyond the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm. We compared
      primary hepatectomy (PH) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients 
      with intermediate to advanced (BCLC stage-B/C) stage HCC to determine the current
      evidence. Through database search, we included 18 high-quality studies (1
      randomized controlled trial [RCT], 5 propensity-score matching non-randomized
      comparative trials [NRCT], and 12 NRCTs) that compared survival outcomes of 5,986
      patients after PH and TACE. We found significant survival benefits for PH over
      TACE in BCLC stage-B/C patients (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59; 95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 0.51-0.67; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 84%). According to the BCLC, both stage-B
      and stage-C patients showed significantly better overall survival for PH compared
      to TACE (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.43-0.65; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 77%; HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 
      0.59-0.77; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 79%, respectively). Five-year survival rates for
      PH were significantly higher than those for TACE in BCLC stage-B/C, stage-B, and 
      BCLC stage-C patients (OR: 2.71, 2.77, and 3.03, respectively; all P < 0.00001). 
      Survival benefits persisted across subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression
      analyses; inter-study heterogeneity remained constant. CONCLUSION: This
      meta-analysis suggests that surgical resection provides survival benefits in
      patients with intermediate to advanced stage HCC. The evidence found herein may
      assist in the choice of treatment modality based on diverse definitions of
      operability. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

LID - 10.1002/hep.29880 [doi]
AB  - With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) followed by the physician
      payment reform, there is an urgent need to better understand the complex
      relationships between structure (including incentives), processes, and outcomes
      of health care and, based on this understanding, identify interventions that can 
      ensure delivery of high value care to patients with liver disease. As
      hepatologists, how do we systematically address these issues and ensure that we
      provide high-value care to our patients? These factors combine in the burgeoning 
      field of health services research. This paper seeks to describe how health
      services research influences the practice of hepatology, the tools and
      technologies it utilizes, as well as how interested individuals can seek to
      acquire knowledge and methodologic training in health services research. Finally,
      we summarize the current state of health services research in hepatology and
      liver transplantation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Tyrosine Kinase SYK is a Potential Therapeutic Target for Liver Fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29881 [doi]
AB  - Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) plays a critical role in immune cell signaling
      pathways and has been reported as a novel biomarker for human hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). We sought to investigate the mechanism by which SYK promotes
      liver fibrosis and to evaluate SYK as a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. We
      evaluated the cellular localization of SYK and the association between SYK
      expression and liver fibrogenesis in normal, HBV-infected, HCV-infected and
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver tissue (n=36, 127, 22 and 30,
      respectively). A PCR array was used to detect the changes in transcription factor
      expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) with SYK knockdown. The effects of
      SYK antagonism on liver fibrogenesis were studied in LX-2 cells, TWNT-4 cells,
      primary human HSCs, and three progressive fibrosis/cirrhosis animal models,
      including a carbon tetrachloride mouse model, and diethylnitrosamine and bile
      duct ligation rat models. We found that SYK protein in HSCs and hepatocytes
      correlated positively with liver fibrosis stage in human liver tissue. HBV or HCV
      infection significantly increased SYK and cytokine expression in hepatocytes.
      Increasing cytokine production further induced SYK expression and
      fibrosis-related gene transcription in HSCs. Up-regulated SYK in HSCs promoted
      HSC activation by increasing the expression of specific transcription factors
      related to activation of HSCs. SYK antagonism effectively suppressed liver
      fibrosis via inhibition of HSC activation, and decreased obstructive jaundice and
      reduced HCC development in animal models. CONCLUSIONS: SYK promotes liver
      fibrosis via activation of HSCs and is an attractive potential therapeutic target
      for liver fibrosis and prevention of HCC development. This article is protected

TI  - Impact of IFNL4 genotype on Interferon-stimulated Gene Expression during DAA
      therapy for Hepatitis C.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29877 [doi]
AB  - New directly acting antivirals (DAAs) provide very high cure rates in most
      patients infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, some patient groups have
      been relatively harder to treat including those with cirrhosis or infected with
      HCV genotype 3. In the recent BOSON trial, genotype 3, cirrhotic patients
      receiving a 16 week course of sofosbuvir and ribavirin had a sustained virologic 
      response rate (SVR) of around 50%. In cirrhotic patients, IFNL4 CC genotype was
      significantly associated with SVR. This genotype was also associated with a lower
      interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in peripheral blood and in liver at
      baseline. Unexpectedly, patients with the CC genotype showed a dynamic increase
      in ISG expression between weeks 4 and 16 of DAA therapy, while the reverse was
      true for non-CC patients. These data provide an important dynamic link between
      host genotype and phenotype in HCV therapy also potentially relevant to naturally
      acquired infection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Long Term Outcomes and Predictive Scores for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and HBsAg
      Seroclearance after HBeAg Seroclearance.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29874 [doi]
AB  - The significance of hepatitis B e-antigen seroclearance (ESC) in the long term is
      not well defined. The current study aimed to determine the clinical outcomes, the
      factors and predictive scores for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis B 
      surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance of a large cohort of patients undergoing
      ESC. Patients with documented ESC were followed up 3-6 monthly. Baseline
      characteristics and longitudinal laboratory results were recorded. Predictive
      scores for HCC (HCC-ESC) and HBsAg seroclearance (HBsAg-ESC) were derived from
      multivariate Cox regression models. A total of 723 patients underwent ESC with a 
      median ESC age and follow-up of 36.0 and 18.3 years respectively. Only 3.5% and
      3.0% had persistently normal ALT and HBV DNA <2logs IU/mL respectively after ESC.
      For patients with 100%, 100-90%, 90-50%, 50-10%, 10-0%, and 0% normal ALT after
      HBeAg seroclearance, the rate of HCC was 4.3%, 2.2%, 3.6%, 3.9%, 17.3%, and 37.2%
      at 20 years after ESC respectively (p<0.001). At 20 years after ESC, the
      cumulative incidence of HCC and HBsAg seroclearance was 7.9% and 13.5%
      respectively, with an overall survival of 91.5%. ESC age, male sex, cirrhosis,
      hypoalbuminemia, viral load, and ALT were significant factors for HCC, whereas
      ESC age, male sex, viral load, and antiviral therapy were significant factors for
      HBsAg seroclearance. The AUROC for HCC-ESC and HBsAg-ESC scores to predict HCC
      and HBsAg seroclearance at 20 years after ESC was 0.92 and 0.74 respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: Male gender, older age at ESC, ALT, and higher level of HBV DNA were
      associated with higher rates of HCC after ESC. HCC-ESC and HBsAg-ESC predictive
      scores can determine the likelihood of developing HCC and achieving HBsAg
      seroclearance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - The hepatic BMAL1/AKT/Lipogenesis axis protects against alcoholic liver disease
      via promoting PPARalpha pathway.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29878 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol liver disease (ALD) is one of the major chronic liver diseases worldwide,
      ranging from fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and potentially
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Epidemiological studies suggest a potential link
      between ALD and impaired circadian rhythms, but the role of hepatic circadian
      proteins in the pathogenesis of ALD remains unknown. Here we show that the
      circadian clock protein BMAL1 in hepatocytes is both necessary and sufficient to 
      protect mice from alcohol liver disease. Ethanol diet-fed mice with
      liver-specific knockout (Bmal1-LKO) or depletion of Bmal1 develop more severe
      liver steatosis and injury as well as a simultaneous suppression of both de novo 
      lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, which can be rescued by the supplementation
      of synthetic PPARalpha ligands. Restoring de novo lipogenesis in the liver of
      Bmal1-LKO mice by constitutively active AKT not only elevates hepatic fatty acid 
      oxidation but also alleviates ethanol-induced fatty liver and liver injury.
      Furthermore, hepatic over-expression of lipogenic transcription factor ChREBP,
      but not SREBP-1c, in the liver of Bmal1-LKO mice also increases fatty acid
      oxidation and partially reduces ethanol-induced fatty liver and liver injury.
      CONCLUSION: we identified a novel protective role of BMAL1 in hepatocytes against
      ALD. The protective action of BMAL1 during alcohol consumption depends on its
      ability to couple ChREBP-induced de novo lipogenesis with PPARalpha-mediated
      fatty oxidation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Key HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and role of the BTNL2 gene for response to a
      hepatitis B vaccine.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29876 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 5-10% of individuals, who are vaccinated with a hepatitis B (HB)
      vaccine designed based on the HBV genotype C, fail to acquire protective levels
      of antibodies. Here, host genetic factors behind low immune response to this HB
      vaccine were investigated by a genome wide association study (GWAS) and HLA
      association tests. A GWAS and HLA association tests were carried out using a
      total of 1,193 Japanese individuals including 107 low responders, 351
      intermediate responders, and 735 high responders. Classical HLA class II alleles 
      were statistically imputed using the genome-wide SNP typing data. The GWAS
      identified independent associations of HLA-DRB1-DQB1, HLA-DPB1 and BTNL2 genes
      with immune response to a HB vaccine designed based on the HBV genotype C. Five
      HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and two DPB1 alleles showed significant associations
      with response to the HB vaccine in a comparison of three groups of 1,193 HB
      vaccinated individuals. When frequencies of DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles
      were compared between low immune responders and HBV patients, significant
      associations were identified for three DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, and no association
      was identified for any of the DPB1 alleles. In contrast, no association was
      identified for DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes and DPB1 alleles in a comparison between high
      immune responders and healthy individuals. The findings in this study clearly
      show the importance of HLA-DR-DQ (i.e. recognition of a vaccine related HB
      surface antigen (HBsAg) by specific DR-DQ haplotypes) and BTNL2 molecules (i.e.
      high immune response to HB vaccine) for response to a HB vaccine designed based
      on the HBV genotype C. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Host and viral factors associated with serum hepatitis B virus RNA levels among
      patients in need for treatment.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29872 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA in serum is a novel biomarker for intrahepatic HBV
      replication and treatment response. For its proper use it is essential to
      identify factors influencing serum HBV RNA level. Using a RACE PCR technique
      (lower limit of detection 800 copies/mL [c/mL]), serum HBV RNA levels were
      measured in samples of 488 untreated individuals with chronic HBV infection who
      were eligible to treatment according to currently used recommendations. We
      explored the association of serum levels of HBV RNA with patient and virus
      associated factors. HBV genotype distribution was 21/10/20/46/3% for
      A/B/C/D/other. Mean HBV RNA serum level was 5.9 (1.6) log10 c/mL (HBeAg-positive 
      CHB: 6.5 [1.2] log c/mL, HBeAg-negative CHB: 4.1 [1.2] log c/mL; p<0.001). By
      multivariable linear regression, factors associated with lower HBV RNA level were
      HBeAg-negativity (beta=-0.69, p<0.001), HBV genotypes A (beta=-0.13, p=0.002), B 
      (beta=-0.07, p=0.049) and C (beta=-0.61, p<0.001) in comparison to D, and
      presence of HBV basal core promoter mutation either alone (beta=-0.14, p=0.001)
      or in combination with precore mutation (beta=-0.22, p<0.001). Higher serum ALT
      was associated with higher HBV RNA (beta=0.23, p<0.001). HBV RNA correlated
      strongly with HBV DNA (HBeAg-pos: r=0.72, p<0.001; HBeAg-neg: r=0.78, p<0.001),
      and moderately with qHBsAg (HBeAg-pos: r=0.54, p<0.001; HBeAg-neg: r=0.19,
      p=0.04) and qHBeAg (r=0.41, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In this multi-ethnic cohort of 
      488 untreated individuals with chronic hepatitis B, factors associated with serum
      HBV RNA level were HBeAg status, serum ALT, HBV genotype, and presence of basal
      core promotor mutations. For the future use of serum HBV RNA as a clinical marker
      it seems mandatory to take these factors in consideration. This article is

TI  - Dual Role for Inositol-requiring Enzyme 1alpha in Promoting the Development of
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma during Diet-induced Obesity.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29871 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is associated with both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chronic
      metabolic inflammation. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR)
      and has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear whether individual UPR pathways are
      mechanistically linked to HCC development, however. Here we report a dual role
      for inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha), the ER-localized UPR signal
      transducer, in obesity-promoted HCC development. We found that genetic ablation
      of IRE1alpha in hepatocytes not only markedly reduced the occurrence of
      diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in LKO mice when fed a normal chow (NC)
      diet, but also protected against the acceleration of HCC progression during
      high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Irrespective of their adiposity states, LKO mice
      showed decreased hepatocyte proliferation and STAT3 activation, even in the face 
      of increased hepatic apoptosis. Furthermore, IRE1alpha abrogation blunted
      obesity-associated activation of hepatic IKKbeta-NF-kappaB pathway, leading to
      reduced production of the tumor-promoting inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6.
      Importantly, higher IRE1alpha expression along with elevated STAT3
      phosphorylation was also observed in the tumor tissues from human HCC patients,
      correlating with their poorer survival rate. CONCLUSION: These results
      demonstrate that IRE1alpha acts in a feed-forward loop during obesity-induced
      metabolic inflammation to promote HCC development through STAT3-mediated
      hepatocyte proliferation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus coinfection in the era of
      direct-acting antiviral agents: No longer a difficult-to-treat population.
PG  - 847-857
LID - 10.1002/hep.29642 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in human immunodeficiency virus 1
      (HIV)-infected individuals has been historically marked by low sustained
      virologic response (SVR) rates in comparison to those without HIV infection,
      resulting in the Food and Drug Administration labeling those coinfected as a
      "special population with an unmet medical need." We systematically reviewed the
      treatment of chronic HCV infection in those infected with HIV. We propose that
      with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, patients coinfected with
      HCV and HIV have similar SVR rates as HCV-monoinfected persons and that DAAs
      address an unmet medical need in this population. A review was performed using
      Medical Subject Heading terms within the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library
      databases to search for studies dated between January 2004 and July 2017.
      Keywords used in the study included "hepatitis C," "HIV," "coinfection," and
      "direct-acting antiviral." SVR rates for those with HCV and HIV coinfection
      treated with interferon-based therapies were substantially lower that SVR rates
      of HCV-monoinfected individuals. The advent of DAA agents has resulted in similar
      SVR rates between monoinfected and coinfected individuals, with SVR >93%. These
      medications have been demonstrated to have improved safety, efficacy, and
      tolerability in comparison to interferon-based regimens. CONCLUSION: The
      designation of a "special population" for those with coinfection requires
      reconsideration; DAA therapies have resulted in similarly high rates of SVR for
      HCV infection in those with and without HIV infection; despite these
      improvements, however, clinicians must be cognizant of negative predictors of SVR
      and barriers to treatment that may be more common in the coinfected population.

      patients with acute liver injury/failure and hyperammonemia.
PG  - 1003-1013
LID - 10.1002/hep.29621 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral edema remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
      with acute liver failure (ALF) and has been linked to elevated blood ammonia
      levels. l-ornithine phenylacetate (OPA) may decrease ammonia by promoting its
      renal excretion as phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN), decreasing the risk of cerebral 
      edema. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of OPA in
      patients with ALF and acute liver injury (ALI), including those with renal
      failure. Forty-seven patients with ALI/ALF and ammonia >/=60 muM were enrolled.
      Patients received OPA in a dose escalation scheme from 3.3 g every 24 hours to 10
      g every 24 hours; 15 patients received 20 g every 24 hours throughout the
      infusion for up to 120 hours. Plasma phenylacetate (PA) concentrations were
      uniformly below target (<75 mug/mL) in those receiving 3.3 g every 24 hours
      (median [interquartile range] 5.0 [5.0] mug/mL), and increased to target levels
      in all but one who received 20 g every 24 hours (150 [100] mug/mL). Plasma [PAGN]
      increased, and conversion of PA to PAGN became saturated, with increasing OPA
      dose. Urinary PAGN clearance and creatinine clearance were linearly related (r = 
      0.831, P < 0.0001). Mean ammonia concentrations based on the area under the curve
      decreased to a greater extent in patients who received 20 g of OPA every 24 hours
      compared with those who received the maximal dose of 3.3 or 6.7 g every 24 hours 
      (P = 0.046 and 0.022, respectively). Of the reported serious adverse events
      (AEs), which included 11 deaths, none was attributable to study medication. The
      only nonserious AEs possibly related to study drug were headache and
      nausea/vomiting. CONCLUSION: OPA was well-tolerated in patients with ALI/ALF, and
      no safety signals were identified. Target [PA] was achieved at infusion rates of 
      20 g every 24 hours, leading to ammonia excretion in urine as PAGN in proportion 
      to renal function. Randomized, controlled studies of high-dose OPA are needed to 
      determine its use as an ammonia-scavenging agent in patients with ALF.

      liver ischemia/reperfusion injury.
PG  - 1056-1070
LID - 10.1002/hep.29605 [doi]
AB  - The role and regulators of extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion in hepatic
      ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury have not been defined. Rab27a is a guanosine
      triphosphatase known to control EV release. Interferon regulatory factor 1
      (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in liver IR and
      regulates certain guanosine triphosphatases. However, the relationships among
      IRF-1, Rab27a, and EV secretion are largely unknown. Here, we show induction of
      IRF-1 and Rab27a both in vitro in hypoxic hepatocytes and in vivo in warm IR and 
      orthotopic liver transplantation livers. Interferon gamma stimulation, IRF-1
      transduction, or IR promoted Rab27a expression and EV secretion. Meanwhile,
      silencing of IRF-1 decreased Rab27a expression and EV secretion. Rab27a silencing
      decreased EV secretion and liver IR injury. Ten putative IRF-1 binding motifs in 
      the 1,692-bp Rab27a promoter region were identified. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay verified five
      functional IRF-1 binding motifs, which were confirmed by a Rab27a promoter
      luciferase assay. IR-induced EVs contained higher oxidized phospholipids (OxPL). 
      OxPLs on the EV surface activated neutrophils through the toll-like receptor 4
      pathway. OxPL-neutralizing E06 antibody blocked the effect of EVs and decreased
      liver IR injury. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a novel mechanism by which
      IRF-1 regulates Rab27a transcription and EV secretion, leading to OxPL activation
      of neutrophils and subsequent hepatic IR injury. (Hepatology 2018;67:1056-1070).

TI  - Fat-free muscle mass in magnetic resonance imaging predicts acute-on-chronic
      liver failure and survival in decompensated cirrhosis.
PG  - 1014-1026
LID - 10.1002/hep.29602 [doi]
AB  - Muscle mass seems to be a prognostic marker in patients with liver cirrhosis.
      However, reported methods to quantify muscle mass are heterogeneous, consented
      cutoff values are missing, and most studies have used computed tomography. This
      study evaluated fat-free muscle area (FFMA) as a marker of sarcopenia using
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with decompensated cirrhosis with
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The total erector spinae
      muscle area and the intramuscular fat tissue area were measured and subtracted to
      calculate the FFMA in 116 patients with cirrhosis by TIPS and MRI. The training
      cohort of 71 patients compared computed tomography-measured transversal psoas
      muscle thickness with FFMA. In 15 patients MRI was performed before and after
      TIPS, and in 12 patients follistatin serum measurements were carried out. The
      results on FFMA were confirmed in a validation cohort of 45 patients. FFMA
      correlated with follistatin and transversal psoas muscle thickness and showed
      slightly better association with survival than transversal psoas muscle
      thickness. Gender-specific cutoff values for FFMA were determined for sarcopenia.
      Decompensation (ascites, overt hepatic encephalopathy) persisted after TIPS in
      the sarcopenia group but resolved in the nonsarcopenia group. Sarcopenic patients
      showed no clinical improvement after TIPS as well as higher mortality, mainly due
      to development of acute-on-chronic liver failure. FFMA was an independent
      predictor of survival in these patients. CONCLUSION: This study offers an
      easy-to-apply MRI-based measurement of fat-free muscle mass as a marker of
      sarcopenia in decompensated patients; while TIPS might improve sarcopenia and
      thereby survival, persistence of sarcopenia after TIPS is associated with a
      reduced response to TIPS and a higher risk of acute-on-chronic liver failure
      development and mortality. (Hepatology 2018;67:1014-1026).

TI  - Should we treat acute hepatitis C? A decision and cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 837-846
LID - 10.1002/hep.29611 [doi]
AB  - It is not standard practice to treat patients with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection. However, as the incidence of HCV in the United States continues to
      rise, it may be time to re-evaluate acute HCV management in the era of
      direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. In this study, a microsimulation model was 
      developed to analyze the trade-offs between initiating HCV therapy in the acute
      versus chronic phase of infection. By simulating the lifetime clinical course of 
      patients with acute HCV infection, we were able to project long-term outcomes
      such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. We found that treating
      acute HCV versus deferring treatment until the chronic phase increased QALYs by
      0.02 and increased costs by $483 in patients not at risk of transmitting HCV. The
      resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $19,991 per QALY,
      demonstrating that treatment of acute HCV was cost-effective using a
      willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. In patients at risk of
      transmitting HCV, treating acute HCV became cost-saving, increasing QALYs by 0.03
      and decreasing costs by $3,655. CONCLUSION: Immediate treatment of acute HCV with
      DAAs can improve clinical outcomes and be highly cost-effective or cost-saving
      compared with deferring treatment until the chronic phase of infection. If future
      studies continue to demonstrate effective HCV cure with shorter 6-week treatment 
      duration, then it may be time to revisit current HCV guidelines to incorporate
      recommendations that account for the clinical and economic benefits of treating
      acute HCV in the era of DAAs. (Hepatology 2018;67:837-846).

      fraction in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 858-872
LID - 10.1002/hep.29596 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proton density
      fat fraction (PDFF) in children to stratify hepatic steatosis grade before and
      after treatment in the Cysteamine Bitartrate Delayed-Release for the Treatment of
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children (CyNCh) trial, using centrally
      scored histology as reference. Participants had multiecho 1.5 Tesla (T) or 3T MRI
      on scanners from three manufacturers. Of 169 enrolled children, 110 (65%) and 83 
      (49%) had MRI and liver biopsy at baseline and at end of treatment (EOT; 52
      weeks), respectively. At baseline, 17% (19 of 110), 28% (31 of 110), and 55% (60 
      of 110) of liver biopsies showed grades 1, 2, and 3 histological steatosis;
      corresponding PDFF (mean +/- SD) values were 10.9 +/- 4.1%, 18.4 +/- 6.2%, and
      25.7 +/- 9.7%, respectively. PDFF classified grade 1 versus 2-3 and 1-2 versus 3 
      steatosis with areas under receiving operator characteristic curves (AUROCs) of
      0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80, 0.94) and 0.79 (0.70, 0.87),
      respectively. PDFF cutoffs at 90% specificity were 17.5% for grades 2-3 steatosis
      and 23.3% for grade 3 steatosis. At EOT, 47% (39 of 83), 41% (34 of 83), and 12% 
      (10 of 83) of biopsies showed improved, unchanged, and worsened steatosis grade, 
      respectively, with corresponding PDFF (mean +/- SD) changes of -7.8 +/- 6.3%,
      -1.2 +/- 7.8%, and 4.9 +/- 5.0%, respectively. PDFF change classified steatosis
      grade improvement and worsening with AUROCs (95% CIs) of 0.76 (0.66, 0.87) and
      0.83 (0.73, 0.92), respectively. PDFF change cut-off values at 90% specificity
      were -11.0% and +5.5% for improvement and worsening. CONCLUSION: MRI-estimated
      PDFF has high diagnostic accuracy to both classify and predict histological
      steatosis grade and change in histological steatosis grade in children with
      NAFLD. (Hepatology 2018;67:858-872).

TI  - Myeloid Notch1 deficiency activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway and aggravates
      hepatocellular damage in mouse ischemic livers.
PG  - 1041-1055
LID - 10.1002/hep.29593 [doi]
AB  - Notch signaling plays an emerging role in the regulation of immune cell
      development and function during inflammatory response. Activation of the ras
      homolog gene family member A/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway
      promotes leukocyte accumulation in tissue injury. However, it remains unknown
      whether Notch signaling regulates ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK-mediated 
      immune responses in liver ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. This study
      investigated intracellular signaling pathways regulated by Notch receptors in the
      IR-stressed liver and in vitro. In a mouse model of IR-induced liver inflammatory
      injury, we found that mice with myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout showed
      aggravated hepatocellular damage, with increased serum alanine aminotransferase
      levels, hepatocellular apoptosis, macrophage/neutrophil trafficking, and
      proinflammatory mediators compared to Notch1-proficient controls. Unlike in the
      controls, myeloid Notch1 ablation diminished hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1)
      and augmented c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein
      kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), JNK, ROCK1, and phosphatase and tensin
      homolog (PTEN) activation in ischemic livers. Disruption of JSAP1 in
      myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout livers improved hepatocellular function and
      reduced JNK, ROCK1, PTEN, and toll-like receptor 4 activation. Moreover, ROCK1
      knockdown inhibited PTEN and promoted Akt, leading to depressed toll-like
      receptor 4. In parallel in vitro studies, transfection of lentivirus-expressing
      Notch1 intracellular domain promoted Hes1 and inhibited JSAP1 in
      lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Hes1 deletion
      enhanced JSAP1/JNK activation, whereas clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9-mediated JSAP1 knockout
      diminished ROCK1/PTEN and toll-like receptor 4 signaling. CONCLUSION: Myeloid
      Notch1 deficiency activates the ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK pathway and
      exacerbates hepatocellular injury by inhibiting transcriptional repressor Hes1
      and inducing scaffold protein JSAP1 in IR-triggered liver inflammation; our
      findings underscore the crucial role of the Notch-Hes1 axis as a novel regulator 
      of innate immunity-mediated inflammation and imply the therapeutic potential for 
      the management of organ IR injury in transplant recipients. (Hepatology

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer. Most cases of HCC
      arise in a cirrhotic/fibrotic liver, indicating that environment may play a
      paramount role in cancer genesis. Previous studies from our group and others have
      shown that, in desmoplastic cancers, there is a rich intercellular communication 
      between activated, cancer-associated fibroblasts and cancer cells. Moreover,
      extracellular vesicles (EVs), or exosomes, have been identified as an important
      arm of this intercellular communication platform. Finally, these studies have
      shown that EVs can carry microRNA (miR) species in vivo and deliver them to
      desmoplastic cancers. The precise role played by activated liver
      fibroblasts/stellate cells in HCC development is insufficiently known. Based on
      previous studies, it appears plausible that activated fibroblasts produce signals
      carried by EVs that promote HCC genesis. In the current study, we first
      hypothesized and then demonstrated that stellate cell-derived EVs 1) can be
      loaded with an miR species of choice (miR-335-5p); 2) are taken up by HCC cells
      in vitro and more importantly in vivo; 3) can supply the miR-335-5p cargo to
      recipient HCC cells in vitro as well as in vivo; and 4) inhibit HCC cell
      proliferation and invasion in vitro as well as induce HCC tumor shrinkage in
      vivo. Finally, we identified messenger RNA targets for miR-335 that are
      down-regulated after treatment with EV-miR-335-5p. This study informs potential
      therapeutic strategies in HCC, whereby stellate cell-derived EVs are loaded with 
      therapeutic nucleic acids and delivered in vivo. (Hepatology 2018;67:940-954).

TI  - MicroRNA 15a/16-1 suppresses aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent interleukin-22
      secretion in CD4(+) T cells and contributes to immune-mediated organ injury.
PG  - 1027-1040
LID - 10.1002/hep.29573 [doi]
AB  - Interleukin-22 (IL-22), as a link between leukocytic and nonleukocytic cells, has
      gained increasing attention for its pronounced tissue-protective properties.
      MicroRNAs, emerging as crucial immune modulators, have been reported to be
      involved in the production and action of various cytokines. However, the precise 
      control of IL-22 by microRNAs and its subsequent actions remained to be
      elucidated. In this study, we found a negative correlation between the expression
      of microRNA 15a/16-1 (miR-15a/16-1) and IL-22 in the model of concanavalin
      A-induced, immune-mediated liver injury. Knockout of miR-15a/16-1 ameliorated
      liver injury in an IL-22-dependent manner. Further results revealed that cluster 
      of differentiation 4-positive (CD4(+) ) T cells were the major source of IL-22
      during liver injury and that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor was the direct target 
      of miR-15a/16-1 in CD4(+) T cells. In vivo and in vitro data showed that
      miR-15a/16-1 knockout CD4(+) T cells produced more IL-22, while overexpression of
      miR-15a/16-1 down-regulated the IL-22 production by inhibiting the aryl
      hydrocarbon receptor. Moreover, transfer of miR-15a/16-1 knockout CD4(+) T cells 
      promoted tissue repair compared to wild-type CD4(+) T cells by up-regulating
      IL-22. In addition, as a synergistic effect, IL-22 could down-regulate
      miR-15a/16-1 expression by activating phosphorylated signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3-c-myc signaling, and the decrease of miR-15a/16-1 in
      damaged hepatocytes contributed to IL-22-mediated tissue repair by reducing cell 
      apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation. As further proof, we demonstrated the
      role of miR-15a/16-1 in controlling IL-22 production and IL-22-mediated
      reconstruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier in a dextran sodium
      sulfate-induced colitis model. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miR-15a/16-1 
      acts as a essential regulator of IL-22 and that the miR-15a/16-1-aryl hydrocarbon
      receptor-IL-22 regulatory axis plays a central role in tissue repair; modulation 
      of miR-15a/16-1 might hold promise in developing new strategies to enhance
      IL-22-mediated tissue repair. (Hepatology 2018;67:1027-1040).

PG  - 1109-1126

AB  - Alcohol is a well-established risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but
      the mechanisms by which it promotes liver cancer are not well understood. Several
      studies have shown that cellular protein arginine methylation is inhibited by
      alcohol. Arginine methylation is controlled by the reciprocal activity of protein
      arginine methyltransferases, primarily protein arginine methyl transferase 1
      (PRMT1), and a demethylase Jumonji C domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6). The aim
      of this study was to explore the role of arginine methylation changes in alcohol 
      pathogenesis. We found that PRMT1 activity is inhibited in livers of mice fed
      with alcohol compared to pair-fed mice. Using hepatocyte-specific PRMT1 knockout 
      mice, we identified that loss of PRMT1 results in enhanced hepatocyte
      proliferation and a 33% increase in liver size. This increased hepatocyte
      proliferation was associated with reduced expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor
      4 alpha (Hnf4alpha), an important regulator of liver tumorigenesis. We found that
      PRMT1 regulates Hnf4alpha expression directly through arginine methylation at the
      (Hnf4alpha) promoter. In the absence of PRMT1, JMJD6 can demethylate the
      Hnf4alpha promoter and suppress its expression. We were able to restore Hnf4alpha
      expression and abolish the increase in hepatocyte proliferation by knockdown of
      JMJD6 in PRMT1 knockout mice. Knockdown of JMJD6 in alcohol-fed mice similarly
      increased Hnf4alpha expression. We then examined whether loss of arginine
      methylation might play a role in alcohol-associated liver cancers. We examined 25
      human HCC specimens and found a strong correlation (R = 0.8; P < 0.01) between
      arginine methylation levels and Hnf4alpha expression in these specimens,
      suggesting that the above mechanism is relevant in patients. CONCLUSION: Taken
      together, these data suggest that PRMT1 inhibition, such as induced by alcohol,
      may result in epigenetic changes leading to loss of Hnf4alpha. This effect may
      contribute to alcohol's ability to promote liver tumors. (Hepatology
      2018;67:1109-1126).

AB  - Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a metabolically active organ, associated with
      higher risk of malignancies. We evaluated whether VAT is associated with the risk
      of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients presenting with cirrhosis as well
      as HCC recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with cirrhosis (n = 
      678; 457 male) who were assessed for LT (289 with HCC) were evaluated for body
      composition analysis. Patients who underwent LT (n = 247, 168 male) were
      subsequently evaluated for body composition, and 96 of these patients (78 male)
      had HCC. VAT, subcutaneous adipose tissues, and total adipose tissues were
      quantified by computed tomography at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and
      reported as indexes (cross-sectional area normalized for height [square
      centimeters per square meter]). At the time of LT assessment, the VAT index
      (VATI) was higher in male patients with HCC compared to non-HCC patients (75 +/- 
      3 versus 60 +/- 3 cm(2) /m(2) , P = 0.001). The VATI, subcutaneous adipose tissue
      index, and total adipose tissue index were higher in male patients with HCC
      compared to non-HCC patients. By multivariate analysis, male patients with VATI
      >/=65 cm(2) /m(2) had a higher risk of HCC (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.31-2.76; P = 0.001). In male patients with HCC who underwent LT, a
      VATI >/=65 cm(2) /m(2) adjusted for Milan criteria was independently associated
      with higher risk of HCC recurrence (hazard ratio, 5.34; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.19-23.97; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: High VATI is an independent risk factor for
      HCC in male patients with cirrhosis and for recurrence of HCC after LT.

TI  - Cell death markers in patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation.
PG  - 989-1002
LID - 10.1002/hep.29581 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the role of cell death in patients with 
      cirrhosis and acute decompensation (AD) and acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)
      using plasma-based biomarkers. The patients studied were part of the CANONIC
      (CLIF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in Cirrhosis) study (N = 337; AD, 258; ACLF,
      79); additional cohorts included healthy volunteers, stable patients with
      cirrhosis, and a group of 16 AD patients for histological studies.
      Caspase-cleaved keratin 18 (cK18) and keratin 18 (K18), which reflect apoptotic
      and total cell death, respectively, and cK18:K18 ratio (apoptotic index) were
      measured in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentrations of
      cK18 and K18 increased and the cK18:K18 ratio decreased with increasing severity 
      of AD and ACLF (P < 0.001, respectively). Alcohol etiology, no previous
      decompensation, and alcohol abuse were associated with increased cell death
      markers whereas underlying infection was not. Close correlation was observed
      between the cell death markers and, markers of systemic inflammation, hepatic
      failure, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin, but not with markers of
      extrahepatic organ injury. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end
      labeling staining confirmed evidence of greater hepatic cell death in patients
      with ACLF as opposed to AD. Inclusion of cK18 and K18 improved the performance of
      the CLIF-C AD score in prediction of progression from AD to ACLF (P < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Cell death, likely hepatic, is an important feature of AD and ACLF
      and its magnitude correlates with clinical severity. Nonapoptotic forms of cell
      death predominate with increasing severity of AD and ACLF. The data suggests that
      ACLF is a heterogeneous entity and shows that the importance of cell death in its
      pathophysiology is dependent on predisposing factors, precipitating illness,
      response to injury, and type of organ failure. (Hepatology 2018;67:989-1002).

TI  - Cholangiocyte autophagy contributes to hepatic cystogenesis in polycystic liver
      disease and represents a potential therapeutic target.
PG  - 1088-1108
LID - 10.1002/hep.29577 [doi]
AB  - Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a group of genetic disorders with limited
      treatment options and significant morbidity. Hepatic cysts arise from
      cholangiocytes exhibiting a hyperproliferative phenotype. Considering that
      hyperproliferation of many cell types is associated with alterations in
      autophagy, we hypothesized that autophagy is altered in PLD cholangiocytes,
      contributes to hepatic cystogenesis, and might represent a potential therapeutic 
      target. We employed functional pathway cluster analysis and next-generation
      sequencing, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence confocal
      microscopy, and western blotting to assess autophagy in human and rodent PLD
      cholangiocytes. A three-dimensional culture model was used to study the effects
      of molecular and pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy on hepatic cystogenesis in
      vitro, and the polycystic kidney disease-specific rat, an animal model of PLD, to
      study the effects of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that interferes with the
      autophagy pathway, on disease progression in vivo. Assessment of the
      transcriptome of PLD cholangiocytes followed by functional pathway cluster
      analysis revealed that the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is one of the most altered
      pathways in PLD. Direct evaluation of autophagy in PLD cholangiocytes both in
      vitro and in vivo showed increased number and size of autophagosomes, lysosomes, 
      and autolysosomes; overexpression of autophagy-related proteins (Atg5, Beclin1,
      Atg7, and LC3); and enhanced autophagic flux associated with activation of the
      cAMP-protein kinase A-cAMP response element-binding protein signaling pathway.
      Molecular and pharmacologic intervention in autophagy with ATG7 small interfering
      RNA, bafilomycin A1 , and hydroxychloroquine reduced proliferation of PLD
      cholangiocytes in vitro and growth of hepatic cysts in three-dimensional
      cultures. Hydroxychloroquine also efficiently inhibited hepatic cystogenesis in
      the polycystic kidney disease-specific rat. CONCLUSION: Autophagy is increased in
      PLD cholangiocytes, contributes to hepatic cystogenesis, and represents a
      potential therapeutic target for disease treatment. (Hepatology

TI  - Chronic liver injury alters driver mutation profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      in mice.
PG  - 924-939
LID - 10.1002/hep.29565 [doi]
AB  - Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) develop in a chronically injured liver, yet
      the extent to which this microenvironment promotes neoplastic transformation or
      influences selective pressures for genetic drivers of HCC remains unclear. We
      sought to determine the impact of hepatic injury in an established mouse model of
      HCC induced by Sleeping Beauty transposon mutagenesis. Chemically induced chronic
      liver injury dramatically increased tumor penetrance and significantly altered
      driver mutation profiles, likely reflecting distinct selective pressures. In
      addition to established human HCC genes and pathways, we identified several
      injury-associated candidates that represent promising loci for further study.
      Among them, we found that FIGN is overexpressed in human HCC and promotes
      hepatocyte invasion. We also validated Gli2's oncogenic potential in vivo,
      providing direct evidence that Hedgehog signaling can drive liver tumorigenesis
      in the context of chronic injury. Finally, we show that a subset of
      injury-associated candidate genes identifies two distinct classes of human HCCs. 
      Further analysis of these two subclasses revealed significant trends among common
      molecular classification schemes of HCC. The genes and mechanisms identified here
      provide functional insights into the origin of HCC in a chronic liver damage
      environment. CONCLUSION: A chronically damaged liver microenvironment influences 
      the genetic mechanisms that drive hepatocarcinogenesis. (Hepatology
      2018;67:924-939).

TI  - Distinct role of nuclear receptor corepressor 1 regulated de novo fatty acids
      synthesis in liver regeneration and hepatocarcinogenesis in mice.
PG  - 1071-1087
LID - 10.1002/hep.29562 [doi]
AB  - It is urgent that the means to improve liver regeneration (LR) be found, while
      mitigating the concurrent risk of hepatocarcinogenesis (HCG). Nuclear receptor
      corepressor 1 (NCoR1) is a co-repressor of nuclear receptors, which regulates the
      expression level of metabolic genes; however, little is known about its potential
      contribution for LR and HCG. Here, we found that liver-specific NCoR1 knockout in
      mice (NCoR1(Deltahep) ) dramatically enhances LR after partial hepatectomy and,
      surprisingly, blocks the process of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCG. Both
      RNA-sequencing and metabolic assay results revealed improved expression of Fasn
      and Acc2 in NCoR1(Deltahep) mice, suggesting the critical role of de novo fatty
      acid synthesis (FAS) in LR. Continual enhanced de novo FAS in NCoR1(Deltahep)
      mice resulted in overwhelmed adenosine triphosphate ATP and nicotinamide adenine 
      dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) consumption and increased mitochondrial reactive
      oxygen species production, which subsequently attenuated HCG through inducing
      apoptosis of hepatocytes at an early stage after DEN administration. CONCLUSION: 
      NCoR1 functions as a negative modulator for hepatic de novo FAS and mitochondria 
      energy adaptation, playing distinct roles in regeneration or carcinogenesis.

TI  - Reassessing the safety concerns of utilizing blood donations from patients with
      hemochromatosis.
PG  - 1150-1157
LID - 10.1002/hep.29521 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism that may
      lead to iron overload. Clinical penetrance is low, however those afflicted may
      develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, and
      cardiomyopathy. Treatment of HH involves regular phlebotomy to reduce the
      systemic iron burden. In many countries-including the United States-numerous
      blood centers do not accept donated blood obtained from HH patients during
      therapeutic phlebotomy and there are inconsistent positions regarding this
      globally. This refusal of blood is borne out of a few concerns. First, there is a
      theoretical increase in the infectious risk of these blood products, particularly
      by siderophilic organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica. Second, given the
      increased incidence of hepatitis C infection from nonvoluntary donors in the
      1970s, there is a concern that blood units from HH donors may harbor additional
      risk given the nonvoluntary nature of their presentation. In this review, we
      examine the existing biological and clinical data concerning infectious risk and 
      summarize clinical experience from centers allowing HH donors, and demonstrate
      that blood from HH patients is safe and should be allowed into the donor pool. We
      conclude that there is no convincing evidence to exclude this population from
      serving as blood donors. (Hepatology 2018;67:1150-1157).

TI  - A multifunctional nanocarrier for efficient TRAIL-based gene therapy against
      hepatocellular carcinoma with desmoplasia in mice.
PG  - 899-913
LID - 10.1002/hep.29513 [doi]
AB  - The anticancer efficacy of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based
      therapy is limited because of systemic toxicity, poor bioavailability, and
      development of TRAIL resistance. We developed a tumor-targeted LCPP
      (lipid/calcium/phosphate/protamine) nanoparticle (NP) to deliver TRAIL plasmid
      DNA (pDNA) into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in a mouse model of HCC.
      TRAIL pDNA was encapsulated in a pH stimuli-responsive calcium phosphate (CaP)
      core, and protamine was added to facilitate nuclear delivery of pDNA. In
      addition, intracellular release of Ca(2+) from the CaP core overcame TRAIL
      resistance by calcium influx-dependent DR5 up-regulation. TRAIL expression also
      attenuated fibrosis in liver tissues surrounding HCCs by reverting activated
      hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to a quiescent state or by directly inducing
      apoptosis in activated HSCs. CONCLUSION: TRAIL pDNA delivered by HCC-targeted
      LCPP NPs in combination with conventional sorafenib treatment attenuated HCC
      progression as well as liver fibrosis. Overall, our study presents an effective
      TRAIL-based cancer therapy that could be developed for clinical applications.

PG  - 1132-1149
LID - 10.1002/hep.29496 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant c-Met activity has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), suggesting that c-Met inhibition may have therapeutic potential.
      However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity
      (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have
      failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy. This lack of observed efficacy
      is likely due to several factors, including trial design, lack of patient
      selection according to tumor c-Met status, and the prevalent off-target activity 
      of these agents, which may indicate that c-Met inhibition is incomplete. In
      contrast, selective c-Met inhibitors (tepotinib, capmatinib) can be dosed at a
      level predicted to achieve complete inhibition of tumor c-Met activity. Moreover,
      results from early trials can be used to optimize the design of clinical trials
      of these agents. Preliminary results suggest that selective c-Met inhibitors have
      antitumor activity in HCC, with acceptable safety and tolerability in patients
      with Child-Pugh A liver function. Ongoing trials have been designed to assess the
      efficacy and safety of selective c-Met inhibition compared with standard therapy 
      in patients with HCC that were selected based on tumor c-Met status. Thus, c-Met 
      inhibition continues to be an active area of research in HCC, with well-designed 
      trials in progress to investigate the benefit of selective c-Met inhibitors.

TI  - Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1beta drives
      mitochondrial and anabolic signatures that contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma
      progression in mice.
PG  - 884-898
LID - 10.1002/hep.29484 [doi]
AB  - The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)
      coactivator-1beta (PGC-1 beta) is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis 
      and oxidative metabolism as well as of antioxidant defense. Specifically, in the 
      liver, PGC-1beta also promotes de novo lipogenesis, thus sustaining cellular
      anabolic processes. Given the relevant pathogenic role of mitochondrial and fatty
      acid metabolism in hepatocarcinoma (HCC), here we pointed to PGC-1beta as a
      putative novel transcriptional player in the development and progression of HCC. 
      For this purpose, we generated both hepatic-specific PGC-1beta-overexpressing
      (LivPGC-1beta) and PGC-1beta knockout (LivPGC-1betaKO) mice, and we challenged
      them with both chemical and genetic models of hepatic carcinogenesis. Our results
      demonstrate a pivotal role of PGC-1beta in driving liver tumor development.
      Indeed, whereas mice overexpressing PGC-1beta show greater tumor susceptibility, 
      PGC-1beta knockout mice are protected from carcinogenesis. High levels of
      PGC-1beta are able to boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger expression,
      therefore limiting the detrimental ROS accumulation and, consequently, apoptosis.
      Moreover, it supports tumor anabolism, enhancing the expression of genes involved
      in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. Accordingly, the specific hepatic
      ablation of PGC-1beta promotes the accumulation of ROS-driven macromolecule
      damage, finally limiting tumor growth. CONCLUSION: The present data elect hepatic
      PGC-1beta as a transcriptional gatekeeper of mitochondrial function and redox
      status in HCC, orchestrating different metabolic programs that allow tumor
      progression. (Hepatology 2018;67:884-898).

TI  - Src kinase inhibition reduces inflammatory and cytoskeletal changes in DeltaF508 
      human cholangiocytes and improves cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
      regulator correctors efficacy.
PG  - 972-988
LID - 10.1002/hep.29400 [doi]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the channel mutated
      in cystic fibrosis (CF), is expressed by the biliary epithelium (i.e.,
      cholangiocytes) of the liver. Progressive clinical liver disease (CF-associated
      liver disease; CFLD) occurs in around 10% of CF patients and represents the third
      leading cause of death. Impaired secretion and inflammation contribute to CFLD;
      however, the lack of human-derived experimental models has hampered the
      understanding of CFLD pathophysiology and the search for a cure. We have
      investigated the cellular mechanisms altered in human CF cholangiocytes using
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from healthy controls and a
      DeltaF508 CFTR patient. We have devised a novel protocol for the differentiation 
      of human iPSC into polarized monolayers of cholangiocytes. Our results show that 
      iPSC-cholangiocytes reproduced the polarity and the secretory function of the
      biliary epithelium. Protein kinase A/cAMP-mediated fluid secretion was impaired
      in DeltaF508 cholangiocytes and negligibly improved by VX-770 and VX-809, two
      small molecule drugs used to correct and potentiate DeltaF508 CFTR. Moreover,
      DeltaF508 cholangiocytes showed increased phosphorylation of Src kinase and
      Toll-like receptor 4 and proinflammatory changes, including increased nuclear
      factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activation, secretion of
      proinflammatory chemokines (i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and
      interleukin-8), as well as alterations of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Treatment
      with Src inhibitor
      (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyramidine) decreased the
      inflammatory changes and improved cytoskeletal defects. Inhibition of Src, along 
      with administration of VX-770 and VX-809, successfully restored fluid secretion
      to normal levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings have strong translational potential
      and indicate that targeting Src kinase and decreasing inflammation may increase
      the efficacy of pharmacological therapies aimed at correcting the basic DeltaF508
      defect in CF liver patients. These studies also demonstrate the promise of
      applying iPSC technology in modeling human cholangiopathies. (Hepatology

TI  - Radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Statistical confirmation of
      improved survival in responders by landmark analyses.
PG  - 873-883
LID - 10.1002/hep.29480 [doi]
AB  - Does imaging response predict survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)? We
      studied the ability of posttherapeutic imaging response to predict overall
      survival. Over 14 years, 948 patients with HCC were treated with
      radioembolization. Patients with baseline metastases, vascular invasion,
      multifocal disease, Child-Pugh > B7, and transplanted/resected were excluded.
      This created our homogeneous study cohort of 134 patients with Child-Pugh </= B7 
      and solitary HCC. Response (using European Association for Study of the Liver
      [EASL] and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 [RECIST 1.1]
      criteria) was associated with survival using Landmark and risk-of-death
      methodologies after reviewing 960 scans. In a subanalysis, survival times of
      responders were compared to those of patients with stable disease (SD) and
      progressive disease (PD). Uni/multivariate survival analyses were performed at
      each Landmark. At the 3-month Landmark, responders survived longer than
      nonresponders by EASL (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; confidence interval [CI],
      0.26-0.82; P = 0.002) but not RECIST 1.1 criteria (HR, 0.70; CI, 0.37-1.32; P =
      0.32). At the 6-month Landmark, responders survived longer than nonresponders by 
      EASL (HR, 0.32; CI, 0.15-0.77; P < 0.001) and RECIST 1.1 criteria (HR, 0.50; CI, 
      0.29-0.87; P = 0.021). At the 12-month Landmark, responders survived longer than 
      nonresponders by EASL (HR, 0.34; CI, 0.15-0.77; P < 0.001) and RECIST 1.1
      criteria (HR, 0.52; CI 0.27-0.98; P = 0.049). At 6 months, risk of death was
      lower for responders by EASL (P < 0.001) and RECIST 1.1 (P = 0.0445). In
      subanalyses, responders lived longer than patients with SD or PD. EASL response
      was a significant predictor of survival at 3-, 6-, and 12-month Landmarks on
      uni/multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Response to radioembolization in patients 
      with solitary HCC can prognosticate improved survival. EASL necrosis criteria
      outperformed RECIST 1.1 size criteria in predicting survival. The therapeutic
      objective of radioembolization should be radiologic response and not solely to
      prevent progression. (Hepatology 2018;67:873-883).

TI  - beta-Catenin regulation of farnesoid X receptor signaling and bile acid
      metabolism during murine cholestasis.
PG  - 955-971
LID - 10.1002/hep.29371 [doi]
AB  - Cholestatic liver diseases result from impaired bile flow and are characterized
      by inflammation, atypical ductular proliferation, and fibrosis. The
      Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a role in bile duct development, yet its role in
      cholestatic injury remains indeterminate. Liver-specific beta-catenin knockout
      mice and wild-type littermates were subjected to cholestatic injury through bile 
      duct ligation or short-term exposure to 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine
      diet. Intriguingly, knockout mice exhibit a dramatic protection from liver
      injury, fibrosis, and atypical ductular proliferation, which coincides with
      significantly decreased total hepatic bile acids (BAs). This led to the discovery
      of a role for beta-catenin in regulating BA synthesis and transport through
      regulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation. We show that beta-catenin
      functions as both an inhibitor of nuclear translocation and a nuclear corepressor
      through formation of a physical complex with FXR. Loss of beta-catenin expedited 
      FXR nuclear localization and FXR/retinoic X receptor alpha association,
      culminating in small heterodimer protein promoter occupancy and activation in
      response to BA or FXR agonist. Conversely, accumulation of beta-catenin
      sequesters FXR, thus inhibiting its activation. Finally, exogenous suppression of
      beta-catenin expression during cholestatic injury reduces beta-catenin/FXR
      complex activation of FXR to decrease total BA and alleviate hepatic injury.
      CONCLUSION: We have identified an FXR/beta-catenin interaction whose modulation
      through beta-catenin suppression promotes FXR activation and decreases hepatic
      BAs, which may provide unique therapeutic opportunities in cholestatic liver
      diseases. (Hepatology 2018;67:955-971).

TI  - Intestine farnesoid X receptor agonist and the gut microbiota activate G-protein 
      bile acid receptor-1 signaling to improve metabolism.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29857 [doi]
AB  - Bile acids activate farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile acid
      receptor-1 (Gpbar-1, aka TGR5) to regulate bile acid metabolism and glucose and
      insulin sensitivity. FXR and TGR5 are co-expressed in the enteroendocrine L cells
      but their roles in integrated regulation of metabolism are not completely
      understood. We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and
      hepatic metabolism. In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist
      fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut
      microbiome, bile acid metabolism, and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study
      revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), increased
      fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) and FGF21 and GLP-1 secretion, improved
      insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in
      mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified
      the FEX-induced and LCA-producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides.
      Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced metabolic phenotypes and
      inhibited TLCA synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile acid synthesis 
      gene expression, but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX
      treatment effectively improved lipid profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion,
      improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning,
      while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial metabolic effects of FEX in
      obese and diabetic mice. This study uncovered a novel mechanism in which
      activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut microbiota to activate TGR5/GLP-1
      signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose
      tissue browning. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in bile acid metabolism
      and signaling to regulate metabolic homeostasis in health and disease. This

TI  - Transient elastography is useful in diagnosing biliary atresia and predicting
      prognosis after hepatoportoenterostomy.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29856 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the utility of transient elastography for diagnosing biliary
      atresia (BA) in cholestatic infants and predicting the outcome of BA. Forty-eight
      cholestatic infants (9-87 days of age) with direct bilirubin level > 1 mg/dL were
      enrolled. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography was
      performed during the cholestasis workup, and 15 subjects were diagnosed as BA. We
      assessed liver histology using liver biopsies from 36 subjects and graded
      fibrosis status using the METAVIR score. BA infants had significantly higher LSM 
      values and METAVIR scores than non-BA cholestatic infants. A receiver operating
      characteristic curve analysis showed that an LSM >7.7 kPa was predictive of BA
      among cholestatic infants (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 97%, area under the
      curve = 85.3%, P = 0.0001). Cholestatic infants with an LSM >7.7 kPa were more
      likely to be diagnosed with BA (odds ratio = 128, P < 0.001). Very early
      measurement of LSM after hepatoportoenterostomy is associated with occurrence of 
      thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and esophageal varices 6 months after
      hepatoportoenterostomy. Five of the BA subjects were awaiting or had received
      liver transplantation, and they had a significantly higher LSM measured 1 week
      after hepatoportoenterostomy than that in the other BA subjects (26.0 vs. 10.8
      kPa, P = 0.006). A Cox proportional analysis demonstrated that the need for liver
      transplantation was significantly higher in BA subjects with LSM > 16 kPa
      measured 1 week after hepatoportoenterostomy than other BA subjects (hazard ratio
      = 10.16, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: LSM assessment during the workup of cholestatic 
      infants may facilitate the diagnosis of BA. LSM after hepatoportoenterostomy may 
      predict complications and the need for early liver transplantation in infants
      with BA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Direct-acting Antivirals Do Not Increase the Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
      Recurrence after Local-Regional Therapy or Liver Transplant Waitlist Dropout.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29855 [doi]
AB  - Whether direct-acting antivirals (DAA) increase the risk of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after tumor-directed therapy is controversial. We
      sought to determine the impact of DAA therapy on HCC recurrence after
      local-regional therapy (LRT) and waitlist dropout among liver transplant (LT)
      candidates with HCC. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 149 LT
      candidates with HCV and HCC at a single center from 2014-2016. Cumulative
      incidence of HCC recurrence post-LRT and waitlist dropout was estimated by DAA
      group. Factors associated with each outcome were evaluated using competing risks 
      regression. A propensity score stabilized inverse probability weighting approach 
      was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics between groups.
      The no DAA group (n=87) had more severe cirrhosis and lower rates of complete
      radiologic tumor response after LRT than those treated with DAA (n=62), but had
      similar alpha-fetoprotein and tumor burden at listing. Cumulative incidence of
      HCC recurrence within 1-year of complete response after LRT was 47.0% in the DAA 
      group and 49.8% in the no DAA group (p=0.93). In adjusted competing risk analysis
      using weighted propensity score modeling, risk of HCC recurrence was similar in
      the DAA group compared to those without DAA (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58-1.42, p=0.67). 
      Patients treated with DAA had lower risk of waitlist dropout due to tumor
      progression or death compared to the no DAA group in adjusted weighted analysis
      (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.69, p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In LT candidates with HCV and 
      HCC with initial complete response to LRT, DAA use is not associated with
      increased risk of HCC recurrence, but rather is associated with reduced risk of
      waitlist dropout due to tumor progression or death. This article is protected by

TI  - Elbasvir/Grazoprevir and Sofosbuvir for HCV Genotype 3 Infection With Compensated
      Cirrhosis: A Randomized Trial.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29852 [doi]
AB  - Many direct-acting antiviral regimens have reduced activity in people with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT)3 infection and cirrhosis. The C-ISLE study 
      assessed the efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) plus
      sofosbuvir (SOF) with and without ribavirin (RBV) in compensated cirrhotic
      participants with GT3 infection. This was a phase 2, randomized, open-label
      study. Treatment-naive participants received EBR/GZR + SOF + RBV for 8 weeks or
      EBR/GZR + SOF for 12 weeks and peginterferon/RBV treatment-experienced
      participants received EBR/GZR + SOF +/- RBV for 12 weeks or EBR/GZR + SOF for 16 
      weeks. The primary end point was HCV RNA <15 IU/mL 12 weeks after end of
      treatment (SVR12). Among treatment-naive participants, SVR12 was 91% (21/23) in
      those treated with RBV for 8 weeks and 96% (23/24) in those treated for 12 weeks.
      Among treatment-experienced participants, SVR12 was 94% (17/18) and 100% (17/17) 
      in the 12-week arm, with and without RBV, respectively, and 94% (17/18) in the
      16-week arm. Five participants failed to achieve SVR: 2 relapsed (both in the
      8-week arm); 1 discontinued due to vomiting/cellulitis (16-week arm); and 2
      discontinued (consent withdrawn/lost to follow-up). SVR12 was not affected by the
      presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). There was no consistent
      change in insulin resistance, and 5 participants reported serious adverse events 
      (pneumonia, chest pain, opiate overdose, cellulitis, decreased creatinine).
      CONCLUSION: High efficacy was demonstrated in participants with HCV GT3 infection
      and cirrhosis. Treatment beyond 12 weeks was not required, and efficacy was
      maintained regardless of baseline RASs. Data from this study support the use of
      EBR/GZR plus SOF for 12 weeks without RBV for treatment-naive and
      peginterferon/RBV-experienced people with GT3 infection and cirrhosis.

TI  - Favorable response to mTOR inhibition in a young patient with unresectable
      fibrolamellar carcinoma of the liver.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29853 [doi]
AB  - Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a distinct and rare liver cancer typically
      occurring in young adults in the non-cirrhotic liver. Its rarity impedes
      evidence-based treatment guidelines derived from large clinical trials and thus
      case reports describing successful experimental treatments are an important
      instrument in improving FLC-patient care. We report one patient with end-stage
      FLC at time of diagnosis with a significant reduction in tumor mass and
      improvement of quality of life upon third-line palliative treatment with the mTOR
      inhibitor everolimus. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Long-term outcomes of patients undergoing simultaneous Liver Transplantation and 
      Sleeve Gastrectomy.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is increasingly common before and after liver transplantation
      (LT), yet optimal management remains unclear. AIM: To analyze the long term
      outcomes for obese patients undergoing LT including a non-invasive weight loss
      program and combined LT and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: Since 2006, all
      patients referred for LT with a body mass index (BMI) >/=35 kg/m(2) were
      enrolled. Patients who achieved weight loss (BMI<35) underwent LT alone, and
      those who did not underwent simultaneous LT+SG. Analysis of long-term outcomes
      for patients >/= 3 years after transplant was performed. RESULTS: Since 2006,
      there were 36 in the weight loss intervention (LT cohort) and 13 in the LT+SG
      cohort with > 3 years of follow-up, while overall, a total of 29 patients
      underwent LT+SG. Patients in the LT cohort had less severe obesity at enrollment 
      (40.0+/-2.7 vs. LT+SG cohort 46.0+/-4.5; p<0.001). In the LT cohort 83.3% (30/36)
      achieved >10% loss in total body weight (TBW) prior to LT. Three years after
      transplant, 29.4% of patients in LT cohort maintained >10% loss in TBW, while
      100% of the LT+SG patients did (p<0.001). Patients who underwent LT+SG maintained
      a significantly higher percentage of total body weight loss (%TBWL) after 3 years
      of follow-up (LT cohort 3.9+/-13.3% vs. LT+SG cohort 34.8+/-17.3%; p<0.001).
      Patients in the LT+SG also had a lower prevalence of hypertension, insulin
      resistance and hepatic steatosis and required fewer anti-hypertensive medications
      and lipid agents at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: While weight loss before
      transplantation was achieved by obese patients, weight regain was common in the
      LT cohort. Combined LT+SG resulted in more effective and more durable weight
      loss, as well as fewer metabolic complications at last follow-up. This article is

TI  - Bax Inhibitor-1 protects from Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis by limiting IRE1alpha
      signaling.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29847 [doi]
AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is activated in non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD), raising the possibility that ER stress-dependent metabolic
      dysfunction, inflammation and cell death underlie the transition from steatosis
      to steatohepatitis (NASH). Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), a negative regulator of the ER
      stress sensor IRE1alpha, has yet to be explored in NAFLD as a hepatoprotective
      agent. We hypothesized that the genetic ablation of BI-1 would render the liver
      vulnerable to NASH due to unrestrained IRE1alpha signaling. ER stress was induced
      in wild-type and BI-1(-/-) mice acutely by tunicamycin injection (1 mg/kg) or
      chronically by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to determine the NAFLD phenotype.
      Livers of tunicamycin-treated BI-1(-/-) mice showed IRE1alpha-dependent NLRP3
      inflammasome activation, hepatocyte death, fibrosis and dysregulated lipid
      homeostasis that led to liver failure within a week. The analysis of human NAFLD 
      liver biopsies revealed BI-1 downregulation parallel to the upregulation of
      IRE1alpha endoribonuclease (RNase) signaling. In HFD-fed BI-1(-/-) mice that
      presented NASH and type-2 diabetes, exaggerated hepatic IRE1alpha, XBP1 and CHOP 
      expression was linked to activated NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1/-11. Rises in
      IL-1beta, IL-6, MCP1, CXCL1 and ALT/AST levels revealed significant inflammation 
      and injury, respectively. The pharmacological inhibition of IRE1alpha RNase
      activity with the small molecules STF-083010 or 4micro8c was evaluated in
      HFD-induced NAFLD. In BI-1(-/-) mice, either treatment effectively counteracted
      IRE1alpha RNase activity, improving glucose tolerance and rescuing from NASH. The
      hepatocyte-specific role of IRE1alpha RNase activity in mediating NLRP3
      inflammasome activation and cell death was confirmed in primary mouse hepatocytes
      by IRE1alpha axis knockdown or its inhibition with STF-083010 or 4micro8c.
      CONCLUSION: Targeting IRE1alpha-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome signaling with
      pharmacological agents or via BI-1 may represent a tangible therapeutic strategy 
      for NASH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - DEPTOR Suppresses Lipogenesis and Ameliorates Hepatic Steatosis and
      Acute-on-Chronic Liver Injury in Alcoholic Liver Disease.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29849 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by lipid accumulation and liver
      injury. However, how chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic lipid
      accumulation remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that activation of
      the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a causal role in
      alcoholic steatosis, inflammation and liver injury. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol
      feeding led to hyperactivation of mTORC1, as evidenced by increased
      phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream kinase S6K1 in hepatocytes. Aberrant
      activation of mTORC1 was likely attributed to the defects of the DEP-domain
      containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) and the NAD(+) -dependent
      deacetylase SIRT1 in the liver of chronic-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice and in the 
      liver of patients with ALD. Conversely, adenoviral overexpression of hepatic
      DEPTOR suppressed mTORC1 signaling and ameliorated alcoholic hepatosteatosis,
      inflammation and acute-on-chronic liver injury. Mechanistically, the
      lipid-lowering effect of hepatic DEPTOR was attributable to decreased proteolytic
      processing, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of the lipogenic 
      transcription factor SREBP-1. DEPTOR-dependent inhibition of mTORC1 also
      attenuated alcohol-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of the lipogenic regulator
      lipin 1 and prevented alcohol-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.
      Pharmacological intervention with rapamycin alleviated the ability of alcohol to 
      upregulate lipogenesis, to downregulate fatty acid oxidation, and to induce
      steatogenic phenotypes. Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding led to activation of
      SREBP-1 and lipin 1 through S6K1-dependent and independent mechanisms.
      Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SIRT1 disrupted DEPTOR function,
      enhanced mTORC1 activity, and exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver, inflammation and
      liver injury in mice. CONCLUSION: the dysregulation of SIRT1-DEPTOR-mTORC1
      signaling is a critical determinant of ALD pathology. Targeting SIRT1 and DEPTOR 
      and selectively inhibiting mTORC1-S6K1 signaling may have therapeutic potential
      for treating ALD in humans. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - A comprehensive strategy to control HCV infection needs a vaccine. Our phase I
      study with recombinant HCV E1/E2 EnvGPs as a candidate vaccine did not induce a
      strong immune response in volunteers. We analyzed the interactions of HCV EnvGPs 
      with human monocyte derived macrophages as antigen presenting cells. HCV E2
      induced immune regulatory cytokine IL-10 and sCD163 protein expression in
      macrophages from 7 of 9 blood donors tested. Further, HCV E2 enhanced Stat3 and
      suppressed Stat1 activation, reflecting macrophage polarization towards M2
      phenotype. E2 associated macrophage polarization appeared to be dependent of its 
      interaction with CD81 leading EGFR activation. Additionally, E2 suppressed the
      expression of C3 complement, similar to HCV exposed dendritic cells, implying
      potential impairment of immune cell priming. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      E2 EnvGP may not be an ideal candidate for HCV vaccine development, and discrete 
      domains within E2 may prove to be more capable of elliciting a protective immune 
      response. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification of alpha-fetoprotein-specific T cell receptors for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma immunotherapy.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29844 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major form of liver cancer for which there 
      is no effective therapy. Genetic modification with T cell receptors (TCR)
      specific for HCC-associated antigens, such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), can
      potentially redirect human T cells to specifically recognize and kill HCC tumor
      cells to achieve antitumor effects. In this study, by using lentivector and
      peptide immunization, we identified a population of CD8-T cells in HLA-A2
      transgenic AAD mice that recognized AFP158 epitope on human HCC cells. Adoptive
      transfer of the AFP158 -specific mouse CD8-T cells eradicated HepG2 tumor
      xenografts as large as 2cm in diameter in immunocompromised NSG mice. We then
      established T cell hybridoma clones from the AFP158 -specific mouse CD8-T cells
      and identified three sets of paired TCR genes out of 5 hybridomas. Expression of 
      the murine TCR genes redirected primary human T cells to bind HLA-A2/AFP158
      tetramer. The TCR gene-engineered human T cells (TCR-T) also specifically
      recognized HLA-A2(+) AFP(+) HepG2 HCC tumor cells and produced effector
      cytokines. Importantly, the TCR-T cells could specifically kill HLA-A2(+) AFP(+) 
      HepG2 tumor cells without significant toxicity to normal primary hepatocytes in
      vitro. Adoptive transfer of the AFP-specific human TCR-T cells could eradicate
      HepG2 tumors in NSG mice. CONCLUSION: We have identified novel AFP-specific
      murine TCR genes that can redirect human T cells to specifically recognize and
      kill HCC tumor cells, and those AFP158 -specific TCRs have a great potential to
      engineer a patient's autologous T cells to treat HCC tumors. This article is

TI  - Cholangiocyte-derived exosomal long noncoding RNA H19 promotes cholestatic liver 
      injury in mouse and human.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29838 [doi]
AB  - Cholestatic liver injury is an important clinical problem with limited
      understanding of disease pathologies. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles
      released by a variety of cells including cholangiocytes. Exosome-mediated
      cell-cell communication can modulate various cellular functions by transferring a
      variety of intracellular components to target cells. Our recent studies indicate 
      that the long non-coding RNA H19 is mainly expressed in cholangiocytes and its
      aberrant expression is associated with significant down-regulation of small
      heterodimer partner (SHP) in hepatocytes and cholestatic liver injury in
      multidrug resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mice. However, how
      cholangiocyte-derived H19 suppresses SHP in hepatocytes remains unknown. Here, we
      report that cholangiocyte-derived exosomes mediate transfer of H19 into
      hepatocytes and promote cholestatic injury. The hepatic H19 level is correlated
      with the severity of cholestatic injury in both fibrotic mouse models, including 
      Mdr2(-/-) mice, a well-characterized model of primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (PSC), or carbon-tetrachloride (CCl4 )-induced cholestatic liver injury mouse
      models, and human PSC patients. Moreover, serum exosomal-H19 level is gradually
      upregulated during disease progression in Mdr2(-/-) mice and cirrhotic patients. 
      The H19-carrying exosomes from the primary cholangiocytes of wild type (WT) mice 
      suppress SHP expression in hepatocytes, but not the exosomes from the
      cholangiocytes of H19(-/-) mice. Furthermore, overexpression of H19 significantly
      suppressed SHP expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
      levels. Importantly, transplant of H19-carrying serum exosomes of old fibrotic
      Mdr2(-/-) mice significantly promoted liver fibrosis in young Mdr2(-/-) mice.
      CONCLUSION: Cholangiocyte-derived exosomal-H19 plays a critical role in
      cholestatic liver injury. Serum exosomal-H19 represents a novel non-invasive
      biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cholestatic diseases. This article

TI  - Resistance analysis of genotype 3 HCV indicates subtypes inherently resistant to 
      NS5A inhibitors.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29837 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: HCV genotype-3 (gt3) is highly prevalent globally, with
      non-gt3a subtypes common in Southeast Asia. Resistance-associated substitutions
      (RASs) have been shown to play a role in treatment failure. However, the role of 
      RASs in gt3 is not well understood. We report the prevalence of RASs in a cohort 
      of directly acting antivirals (DAA) treatment-naive gt3 infected patients,
      including those with rarer subtypes and evaluate the effect of these RAS on DAAs 
      in-vitro. METHODS: Baseline samples from 496 gt3 patients enrolled in the BOSON
      clinical trial were analysed by next-generation sequencing after probe-based
      enrichment for HCV. Whole viral genomes were analysed for the presence of RASs to
      approved DAAs. The resistance phenotype of RASs in combination to daclatasvir,
      velpatasvir, pibrentasvir, elbasvir and sofosbuvir was measured using the S52
      DeltaN gt3a replicon model. RESULTS: The NS5A A30K and Y93H substitutions were
      the most common at 8.8% (n=44) and 12.2% (n=61) respectively and showed a 10-fold
      and 11-fold increase in EC50 for daclatasvir compared to the unmodified replicon.
      Paired RASs (A30K + L31M and A30K + Y93H) were identified in 18 patients (9 of
      each pair); these combinations were shown to be highly resistant to daclatasvir, 
      velpatasvir, elbasvir and pibrentasvir. The A30K + L31M combination was found in 
      all gt3b and gt3g samples. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals high frequencies of RASs
      to NS5A Inhibitors in gt3 HCV. The paired A30K + L31M substitutions occur in all 
      patients with gt3b and gt3g virus. In vitro analysis suggests that these subtypes
      may be inherently resistant to all approved NS5A Inhibitors for gt3 HCV. This

TI  - Endothelial Notch activation reshapes the angiocrine of sinusoidal endothelia to 
      aggravate liver fibrosis and blunt regeneration.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29834 [doi]
AB  - Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) critically regulate liver homeostasis 
      and diseases through angiocrine factors. Notch is critical in endothelial cells
      (ECs). In the current study, Notch signaling was activated by inducible
      EC-specific expression of the Notch intracellular domain (NIC). We found that
      endothelial Notch activation damaged liver homeostasis. Notch activation resulted
      in decreased fenestration and increased basement membrane, and a gene expression 
      profile with decreased LSEC-associated genes and increased continuous
      EC-associated genes, suggesting LSEC dedifferentiation. Consistently, endothelial
      Notch activation enhanced hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 . Notch activation
      attenuated eNOS-sGC signaling, and activation of sGC by YC-1 reversed the
      dedifferentiation phenotype. In addition, Notch activation subverted the
      hepatocyte-supporting angiocrine profile of LSECs by downregulating critical
      hepatocyte mitogens including Wnt2a, Wnt9b, and HGF. This led to compromised
      hepatocyte proliferation under both quiescent and regenerating conditions. While 
      the expression of Wnt2a and Wnt9b was dependent on eNOS-sGC signaling, HGF
      expression was not rescued by the sGC activator, suggesting heterogeneous
      mechanisms of LSECs to maintain hepatocyte homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial 
      Notch activation results in LSEC dedifferentiation and accelerated liver
      fibrogenesis through the eNOS-sGC signaling, and alters the angiocrine profile of
      LSECs to compromise hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. This article

TI  - Expression of microRNA-155 in inflammatory cells modulates liver injury.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29833 [doi]
AB  - miR-155 is involved in immune and inflammatory diseases and is associated with
      liver fibrosis and steatohepatitis. However, the mechanisms involved in miR-155
      regulation of liver injury are largely unknown. The role of miR-155 in acute
      liver injury was assessed in wild type (WT), miR-155(-/-) and miR-155(-/-) mice
      transplanted with WT bone marrow. Additionally, miR-155 expression was evaluated 
      in liver tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with
      autoimmune hepatitis. Concanavalin A (ConA) but not acetaminophen (APAP)
      treatment increased the expression of miR-155 in liver tissue of WT mice. ConA
      induced an increase of cell death, liver transaminases and a higher expression of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cxcl1, 5, 9, 10, 11, Ccl2, 20 and Icam1) in
      miR-155(-/-) compared to WT mice. Importantly, these animals showed a significant
      decrease in CD4(+) CXCR3(+) and Foxp3(+) cells recruitment but no changes in
      other inflammatory cell populations. Mechanistically, miR-155 deficient Tregs
      showed increased Ship1 expression, a known target of miR-155. Inhibition of Ship1
      in miR-155(-/-) mice restored Foxp3 recruitment and reduced liver cytokine
      expression. Transplantation of bone marrow from WT animals into miR-155(-/-) mice
      partially reverted the effect of ConA on miR-155(-/-) mice as assessed by
      proinflammatory cytokines and cell death protein expression. Patients with
      autoimmune hepatitis showed a marked increase in miR-155 expression in the liver 
      but a reduced expression of miR-155 in PBMC. CONCLUSIONS: miR-155 expression is
      altered in both liver tissue and circulating inflammatory cells during liver
      injury, thus regulating inflammatory cell recruitment and liver damage. These
      results suggest that maintaining miR-155 expression in inflammatory cells might
      be a potential strategy to modulate liver injury. This article is protected by

TI  - MiR-433 and miR-22 dysregulations induce HDAC6 overexpression and ciliary loss in
      cholangiocarcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29832 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiocytes normally express primary cilia, a multisensory organelle that
      detects signals from the cellular environment. Cilia are significantly reduced in
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) by a mechanism involving overexpression of histone
      deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Despite HDAC6 overexpression in CCA, we found no
      differences in its mRNA level, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation,
      possibly involving miRNAs. Here we describe that at least two HDAC6-targeting
      miRNAs, miR-433 and miR-22, are downregulated in CCA both in vitro and in vivo.
      Experimental restoration of these miRNAs in CCA cells reduced HDAC6 expression,
      induced ciliary restoration, and decreased the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, 
      in contrast to the mature forms, levels of precursor forms of these miRNAs were
      higher in CCA compared to normal cholangiocytes and accumulated in the nuclei,
      suggesting a defective nuclear export. We assessed the expression of Exportin-5, 
      the protein responsible for transporting miRNA precursors out of the nucleus, and
      found it to be reduced by 50% in CCA compared to normal cholangiocytes.
      Experimental overexpression of Exportin-5 in CCA cells restored precursor and
      mature forms of these miRNAs to normal levels, inducing a decrease in the
      expression of HDAC6 and a decrease in the malignant phenotype. Conversely, shRNA 
      depletion of Exportin-5 in normal cholangiocytes resulted in increased nuclear
      retention of precursor miRNAs, decreased mature miRNAs, increased cell
      proliferation, and shorter cilia. CONCLUSION: these data suggest that
      downregulated Exportin-5 impairs the nuclear export of miR-433 and miR-22
      precursor forms, causing a decrease in levels of mature miR-433 and miR-22 forms,
      and leading to overexpression of HDAC6 and ciliary loss in CCA. This article is

TI  - Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Liver Biopsy in the Balance.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29831 [doi]
AB  - The use of liver biopsy to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma is governed by the
      balance of the risks of the procedure (morbidity, mortality, inadequate
      sampling), the relative utility of non-invasive techniques and the benefits of
      precise diagnosis, prognostic and theragnostic information and access to tissue
      for molecular analysis. In this issue of Hepatology, identification of the
      macrotrabecular subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma on liver biopsy is shown to
      add clinically useful prognostic information as well as molecular correlations.

TI  - Fluorescent peptide highlights micronodules in murine hepatocellular carcinoma
      models and human in vitro.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29829 [doi]
AB  - Early detection and clear delineation of microscopic lesions during surgery are
      critical to the prognosis and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), a devastating malignancy without effective treatments except for
      resection. Tools to specifically identify and differentiate micronodules from
      normal tissue in HCC patients can have a positive impact on survival. Here, we
      discovered a peptide that preferentially binds to HCC cells through phage
      display. Significant accumulation of the fluorescence-labeled peptide in tumor
      from ectopic and orthotopic HCC mice was observed within 2 h of systemic
      injection. Contrast between tumor and surrounding liver is up to 6.5-fold and
      useful contrast lasts for 30 h. Micronodules (0.03 cm in diameter) in liver and
      lung can clearly be distinguished from normal tissue with this
      fluorescence-labeled peptide in orthotopic HCC mice and HCC patients. Compared to
      indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA-approved imaging contrast agent, up to 8.7-fold
      higher differentiation ratio of tumor-to-fibrosis is achieved with this
      fluorescence-labeled peptide. Importantly, this peptide enables up to 10-fold
      differentiation between HCC-to-peritumoral tissue in human tissues and the
      complete removal of tumor in HCC mice with surgical navigation. No abnormalities 
      in behavior or activity are observed after systemic treatment, indicating the
      absence of overt toxicity. The peptide is metabolized with a half-life of
      approximately 4 h in serum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that
      micronodules can be specifically differentiated with high sensitivity from
      surrounding tissue with this molecule, opening clinical possibilities for early
      detection and precise surgery of HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway determines the predisposition- and the efficiency of
      liver to pancreas reprogramming.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29827 [doi]
AB  - Transdifferentiation (TD) is the direct reprogramming of adult cells into cells
      of alternate fate and function. We were the first to show that liver cells can be
      transdifferentiated into beta-like, insulin producing cells, by ectopic
      expression of pancreatic transcription factors (pTFs). However, the efficiency of
      the process was consistently limited to <15% of the human liver cells treated in 
      culture. The data in the current study suggest that liver to pancreas TD is
      restricted to a specific population of liver cells that is predisposed to undergo
      reprogramming. We isolated TD-predisposed subpopulation of liver cells from >15
      human donors using a lineage tracing system based on the wnt response element,
      part of the pericentral-specific promoter of Glutamine Synthetase (GLUL). The
      cells, that were propagated separately, consistently exhibited efficient fate
      switch and insulin production and secretion in >60% of the cells upon pTFs'
      expression. The rest of the cells, which originated from 85% of the culture,
      resisted TD. Both populations expressed the ectopic pTFs with similar
      efficiencies, followed by similar repression of hepatic genes. Our data suggest
      that the TD-predisposed cells originate from a distinct population of liver cells
      that are enriched for wnt signaling, which is obligatory for efficient TD. In
      TD-resistant population, wnt induction is insufficient to induce TD. An
      additional step of chromatin opening enables TD of these cells. CONCLUSION: Liver
      to pancreas TD occurs in defined predisposed cells. These cells' predisposition
      is maintained by WNT signaling that endows the cells with the plasticity needed
      to alter their transcriptional program and developmental fate, when triggered by 
      ectopic pTFs. These results may have clinical implications by drastically
      increasing the efficacy of TD in future clinical uses. This article is protected

TI  - Tumor progression locus 2 in hepatocytes potentiates both liver and systemic
      metabolic disorders.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29820 [doi]
AB  - Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2), a serine/threonine kinase, has been regarded as
      a potentially interesting target for the treatment of various diseases with an
      inflammatory component. However, the function of TPL2 in regulating hepatocyte
      metabolism and liver inflammation during the progression of non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD) is poorly understood. Here, we report that TPL2 protein
      expression was significantly increased in fatty liver from diverse species,
      including humans, monkeys and mice. Further investigations revealed that compared
      to wild-type littermates, hepatocyte-specific TPL2 knockout mice exhibited
      improved lipid and glucose imbalance, reserved insulin sensitivity and alleviated
      inflammation in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Overexpression of TPL2
      in hepatocytes led to the opposite phenotype. Regarding the mechanism, we found
      that MKK7 was the specific substrate of TPL2 for JNK activation. TPL2-MKK7-JNK
      signaling in hepatocytes represents a promising drugable target for treating
      NAFLD and associated metabolic disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In hepatocytes, TPL2 acts 
      as a key mediator that promotes both liver and systemic metabolic disturbances by
      specifically increasing MKK7-JNK activation. This article is protected by

TI  - Targeting Pin1 by inhibitor API-1 regulates microRNA biogenesis and suppresses
      hepatocellular carcinoma development.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29819 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, but 
      there are few effective treatments. Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is
      correlated with HCC development. We previously demonstrated that prolyl isomerase
      Pin1 participates in miRNA biogenesis and is a potential HCC treatment target.
      However, how Pin1 modulates miRNA biogenesis remains obscure. Here, we present in
      vivo evidence that Pin1 overexpression is directly linked to the development of
      HCC. Administration with Pin1 inhibitor API-1, a novel and specific small
      molecule targeting Pin1 PPIase domain and inhibiting Pin1 cis-trans isomerizing
      activity, suppresses in vitro cell proliferation and migration of HCC cells. But 
      API-1-induced Pin1 inhibition is insensitive to HCC cells with low Pin1
      expression and/or low XPO5 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Pin1 recognizes and 
      isomerizes the phosphorylated Serine-Proline (pS-P) motif of pXPO5 and passivates
      pXPO5. Pin1 inhibition by API-1 maintains the active conformation of pXPO5,
      restores XPO5-driven precursor miRNA nuclear-to-cytoplasm export, activating
      anticancer miRNA biogenesis, and leading to both in vitro HCC suppression and HCC
      suppression in xenograft mice. CONCLUSION: Experimental evidence suggests Pin1
      inhibition by API-1 upregulates miRNA biogenesis via retaining active XPO5
      conformation and suppresses HCC development, revealing the mechanism of
      Pin1-mediated miRNA biogenesis and unequivocally supports API-1 as a novel drug
      candidate for HCC therapy, especially for Pin1-overexpressing, ERK-activated HCC.

TI  - All-oral DAA therapy against HCV in HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects in real-world
      practice: Madrid-CoRe Findings.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29814 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated treatment outcomes in a prospective registry of HIV/HCV-coinfected
      patients treated with interferon-free direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA)-based
      therapy in hospitals from the region of Madrid between November 2014 and August
      2016. We assessed sustained viral response (SVR) at 12 weeks after completion of 
      treatment and used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of
      treatment failure. We evaluated 2,369 patients, of whom 59.5% were non-cirrhotic 
      (Non-C), 33.9% had compensated cirrhosis (Co-C), and 6.6% had decompensated
      cirrhosis (De-C). The predominant HCV genotypes were 1a (40.9%), 4 (22.4%), 1b
      (15.1%), and 3 (15.0%). Treatment regimens included sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir
      (LDV) (61.9%), SOF plus daclatasvir (DCV) (14.6%), dasabuvir plus
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (DSV+OBV/PTV/r) (13.2%), and other regimens
      (10.3%). Ribavirin was used in 30.6% of patients. Less than 1% of patients
      discontinued therapy owing to adverse events. The frequency of SVR by
      intention-to-treat analysis was 92.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-93.1%) 
      overall, 93.8% (95%CI: 92.4-95.0%) for Non-C, 91.0% (95%CI: 88.8-92.9%) for Co-C,
      and 80.8% (95%CI: 73.7-86.6%) for De-C. The factors associated with treatment
      failure were male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.75; 95%CI 1.14-2.69), Centers 
      for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) category C (aOR 1.65; 95%CI 1.12-2.41),
      a baseline CD4+ T-cell count <200/mm(3) (aOR 2.30; 95%CI 1.35-3.92), an HCV RNA
      load >/= 800,000 IU/mL (aOR 1.63; 95%CI 1.14-2.36), Co-C (aOR 1.35; 95%CI
      0.96-1.89), De-C (aOR 2.92; 95%CI 1.76-4.87), and the use of SOF plus simeprevir,
      SOF plus ribavirin, and SMV plus DCV. In conclusion, in this large real-world
      study, DAA-based therapy was safe and highly effective in coinfected patients.
      Predictors of failure included gender, HIV-related immunosuppression, HCV RNA
      load, severity of liver disease, and the use of suboptimal DAA-based regimens.

TI  - CEACAM1 controls IL-2-dependent regulatory T cell induction in immune-mediated
      hepatitis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29812 [doi]
AB  - A dysbalance between effector T cells (Tconv) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and 
      impaired Tregs function can cause autoimmune liver disease. Therefore, it is
      important to identify molecular mechanisms that control Treg homeostasis.
      Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1, CD66a) is an 
      immune co-receptor with dichotomous roles in T cell regulation: its short isoform
      (CEACAM1S) can activate T cells and induce Tregs, whereas its long isoform
      (CEACAM1L) containing two intracellular immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
      motifs (ITIMs), can inhibit activated T cell function. In the liver, CEACAM1 has 
      anti-fibrotic effects in models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, its
      role in immune-mediated hepatitis is unknown. In the mouse model of concanavalin 
      A (ConA)-induced CD4(+) T cell-dependent liver injury, liver damage was
      aggravated and persisted in Ceacam1(-/-) mice. Concomitantly, we observed
      hyperexpansion of Tconv, but reduction of IL-2 production and hepatic Foxp3(+)
      CD4(+) Treg numbers. CEACAM1(-/-) CD4(+) T cells showed impaired IL-2-mediated
      signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 phosphorylation, which
      correlated with a failure of naive CEACAM1(-/-) CD4(+) T cell to convert into
      Tregs in vitro. Furthermore, CEACAM1(-/-) Tregs expressed reduced levels of
      Foxp3, CD25 and Bcl-2. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that hepatic
      Treg expansion and suppressive activity required CEACAM1 expression on both
      CD4(+) T cells and Tregs. We identified predominant CEACAM1S expression on
      hepatic CD4(+) T cells and Tregs from mice with acute liver injury and expression
      of both isoforms in liver-derived CD4(+) T cell clones from patients with liver
      injury. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that CEACAM1S expression in CD4(+) T cells
      augments IL-2 production and STAT5 phosphorylation leading to enhanced Treg
      induction and stability which ultimately confers protection from T cell-mediated 
      liver injury. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      protein 1 (IRE1alpha/XBP1) pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a
      protective cellular signaling pathway activated in response to endoplasmic
      reticulum stress. We investigated the role of FXR signaling in the activation of 
      the hepatic XBP1 pathway. Mice were treated with deoxycholic acid (DCA),
      cholestyramine, GW4064 or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) and the hepatic UPR 
      activation was measured. Huh7-Ntcp and HepG2 cells were treated with FXR
      agonists, inhibitor, siRNA or SHP siRNA to determine the mechanisms of
      IRE1alpha/XBP1 pathway activation. DCA feeding and BDL increased and
      cholestyramine decreased expression of hepatic XBP1s. XBP1 pathway activation
      increased in Huh7-Ntcp and HepG2 cells treated with bile acids, 6-ECDCA or
      GW4064. This effect decreased with FXR knockdown and treatment with FXR inhibitor
      guggulsterone. FXR agonists increased XBP1 splicing and phosphorylated-IRE1alpha 
      expression. Overexpression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) similarly increased
      XBP1 splicing, XBP1s and phosphorylated-IRE1alpha protein expression. SHP
      knockdown attenuated FXR agonist-induced XBP1s and phosphorylated-IRE1alpha
      protein expression. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a physical
      interaction between overexpressed GFP-SHP and FLAG-IRE1alpha in HEK293T cells.
      Mice treated with GW4064 had increased, and FXR and SHP null mice had decreased, 
      basal Xbp1s gene expression. CONCLUSION: FXR signaling activates the
      IRE1alpha/XBP1 pathway in vivo and in vitro. FXR pathway activation increases
      XBP1 splicing and enhances phosphorylated-IRE1alpha expression. These effects are
      mediated, at least in part, by SHP. IRE1alpha/XBP1 pathway activation by bile
      acids and pharmacologic FXR agonists may be protective during liver injury and
      may have therapeutic implications for liver diseases. This article is protected

TI  - Direct-Acting Antiviral Sustained Virologic Response: Impact on Mortality in
      Patients without Advanced Liver Disease.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29811 [doi]
AB  - The impact of sustained virologic response (SVR) on mortality after direct-acting
      antiviral (DAA) treatment is not well documented in patients without advanced
      liver disease and affects access to treatment. This study evaluated the impact of
      SVR achieved with interferon-free DAA treatment on all-cause mortality in
      hepatitis C (HCV) infected patients without advanced liver disease. This
      observational cohort analysis was comprised of 103,346 genotype 1, 2 and 3,
      HCV-monoinfected patients without advanced liver disease, defined by FIB-4
      </=3.25 and no diagnosis of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular
      carcinoma or history of liver transplantation, identified from the Veterans
      Affairs Hepatitis C Clinical Case Registry. Among 40,664 patients treated with
      interferon-free DAA regimens, 39,374 (96.8%) achieved SVR and 1,290 (3.2%)
      patients were No SVR; 62,682 patients constituted the untreated cohort. The
      mortality rate for SVR patients of 1.18 deaths/100 patient years was
      significantly lower than both the rate for No SVR patients (2.84 deaths/100
      patient years)(p<0.001) and untreated patients (3.84 deaths/100 patient
      years)(p<0.001). SVR patients with FIB-4 <1.45 and 1.45-3.25 had a 46.0%
      (p=0.036) and 63.2% (p<0.001) reduction in mortality rates, respectively,
      compared to No SVR patients and a 66.7% (p<0.001) and 70.6% (p<0.001) reduction
      in mortality rates, respectively, compared to untreated patients. In multivariate
      Cox proportional hazard models controlling for baseline demographics, clinical
      characteristics and comorbidities, SVR was independently associated with reduced 
      risk of death compared to No SVR (hazard ratio (HR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 0.32-0.59, p<0.001) and compared to untreated patients (HR 0.32, 95%CI
      0.29-0.36, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Successfully treating HCV with DAAs in patients 
      without clinically apparent advanced liver disease translates into a significant 
      mortality benefit. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Khat chewing increases the risk for developing chronic liver disease: A
      hospital-based case-control study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29809 [doi]
AB  - The chewing of the leaves of Catha edulis (khat) has been implicated in the
      development of liver disease, but no controlled observations have been
      undertaken. The objective of the present study was to determine whether khat
      chewing is associated with development of chronic liver disease (CLD). A
      case-control study was conducted at two public hospitals in Harar, Ethiopia,
      between April 2015 and April 2016. A consecutive sample of 150 adult hospital
      attendees with CLD were included as cases, and 300 adult hospital attendees
      without clinical or laboratory evidence of CLD were included as controls. Khat
      consumption was quantified in khat years; one khat year was defined as daily use 
      of 200 grams of fresh khat for one year. A logistic regression model was used to 
      control for confounders. There was a significant association between chewing khat
      and the risk for developing CLD (crude odds ratio [OR] 2.64; 95% CI 1.56-4.58).
      In men, this risk, following adjustment for age, alcohol use, and chronic
      hepatitis B/C infection, increased with increasing khat exposure; thus, compared 
      to never users the adjusted OR for low khat exposure was 3.58 (95% CI
      1.05-12.21), moderate khat exposure 5.90 (95% CI 1.79-19.44), and high khat
      exposure 13.03 (95% CI 3.61-47.02). The findings were robust in a post-hoc
      sensitivity analysis in which individuals with identifiable risk factors for CLD 
      were excluded. CONCLUSION: A significant association was observed between chewing
      khat and the risk for developing CLD. In men, the association was strong and
      dose-dependent, suggesting a causal relationship. As the prevalence of khat
      chewing is increasing worldwide, these findings have major public health
      implications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bile acids stimulate cholangiocyte fluid secretion by activation of
      membraneTMEM16A Cl(-) channels.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29804 [doi]
AB  - Bile acids stimulate a bicarbonate-rich choleresis in part through effects on
      cholangiocytes. As Cl(-) channels in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes
      provide the driving force for secretion and TMEM16A has been identified as the
      Ca(2+) -activated Cl(-) channel in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes (1), the
      aim of the present study was to determine if TMEM16A is the target of bile
      acid-stimulated Cl(-) secretion and to identify the regulatory pathway involved. 
      In these studies of mouse, rat, and human biliary epithelium exposure to
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) rapidly
      increased the rate of exocytosis, ATP release, [Ca(2+) ]i , membrane Cl(-)
      permeability, and transepithelial secretion. Bile acid-stimulated Cl(-) currents 
      demonstrated biophysical properties consistent with TMEM16A and were inhibited by
      pharmacologic or molecular (siRNA) inhibition of TMEM16A. Bile acid-stimulated
      Cl(-) currents were not observed in the presence of apyrase, suramin, or
      2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), demonstrating that current activation
      requires extracellular ATP, P2Y, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)
      receptors. TUDCA did not activate Cl(-) currents during pharmacologic inhibition 
      of the apical Na(+) -dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), but direct
      intracellular delivery of TUDCA rapidly activated Cl(-) currents. CONCLUSION:
      Bile acids stimulate Cl(-) secretion in mouse and human biliary cells through
      activation of membrane TMEM16A channels in a process regulated by extracellular
      ATP and [Ca(2+) ]i . These studies suggest that TMEM16A channels may be targets
      to increase bile flow during cholestasis. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Hepatic stellate cell-derived PDGFRalpha-enriched extracellular vesicles promote 
      liver fibrosis in mice through SHP2.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29803 [doi]
AB  - Liver fibrosis is characterized by the activation and migration of hepatic
      stellate cells (HSCs) followed by matrix deposition. Recently, several studies
      have shown the importance of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from liver
      cells, such as hepatocytes and endothelial cells, in liver pathobiology. While
      most of the studies describe how liver cells modulate HSC behavior, an important 
      gap exists in the understanding of HSC-derived signals and more specifically
      HSC-derived EVs in liver fibrosis. Here, we investigated the molecules released
      through HSC-derived EVs, the mechanism of their release and the role of these EVs
      in fibrosis. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that platelet-derived growth
      factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) was enriched in EVs derived from
      PDGF-BB-treated HSCs. Moreover, patients with liver fibrosis had increased
      PDGFRalpha levels in serum EVs compared to healthy individuals. Mechanistically, 
      in vitro tyrosine720-to-phenylalanine mutation (Y720F) on PDGFRalpha sequence
      abolished enrichment of PDGFRalpha in EVs and redirected the receptor towards
      degradation. Congruently, the inhibition of Src homology 2 domain tyrosine
      phosphatase 2 (SHP2), the regulatory binding partner of phosphorylated Y720, also
      inhibited PDGFRalpha enrichment in EVs. EVs derived from
      PDGFRalpha-overexpressing cells promoted in vitro HSC migration and in vivo liver
      fibrosis. Finally, administration of SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, to carbon
      tetrachloride-administered mice inhibited PDGFRalpha enrichment in serum EVs and 
      reduced liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: PDGFRalpha is enriched in EVs derived from
      PDGF-BB-treated HSCs in an SHP2-dependent manner and these PDGFRalpha-enriched
      EVs participate in development of liver fibrosis. This article is protected by

TI  - cHCC-CCA: Consensus terminology for primary liver carcinomas with both
      hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentation.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29789 [doi]
AB  - Primary liver carcinomas with both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentiation
      have been referred to as "combined (or mixed) hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma."
      These tumors, although described over 100 years ago, have attracted greater
      attention recently because of interest in possible stem cell origin and perhaps
      because of greater frequency and clinical recognition. Currently, due to lack of 
      common terminology in the literature, effective treatment and predictable outcome
      data have been challenging to accrue. This paper represents a consensus document 
      from an international community of pathologists, radiologists, and clinicians who
      have studied and reported on these tumors and recommends a working terminology
      for diagnostic and research approaches for further study and evaluation. It is
      recommended that diagnosis is based on routine histopathology with hematoxylin
      and eosin; immunostains are supportive, but not essential for diagnosis. FOOTNOTE

TI  - Candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of drug-induced liver
      injury: An international collaborative effort.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29802 [doi]
AB  - Current blood biomarkers are suboptimal in detecting drug-induced liver injury
      (DILI) and predicting its outcome. We sought to characterize the natural
      variabilty and performance characteristics of fourteen promising DILI biomarker
      candidates. Serum or plasma from multiple cohorts of healthy volunteers (n=192
      and =81), subjects who safely took potentially hepatotoxic drugs without adverse 
      effects (n=55 and =92) and DILI patients (n=98, =28, and =143) were assayed for
      microRNA-122 (miR-122), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), total keratin 18 (K18),
      caspase cleaved K18 (ccK18), glutathione S-transferase alpha (GSTalpha), alpha
      fetoprotein (AFP), arginase-1 (ARG1), osteopontin (OPN), sorbitol dehydrogenase
      (SDH), fatty acid binding protein (FABP1), cadherin-5 (CDH5), macrophage colony
      stimulating factor receptor (MCSFR), paraoxonase 1 (PON1, normalized to
      prothrombin protein), and leucocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2). Most
      candidate biomarkers were significantly altered in DILI cases compared to healthy
      volunteers. GLDH correlated more closely with gold standard alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) than miR-122 and there was a surprisingly wide inter- and 
      intra-individual variability of miR-122 levels among the healthy volunteers.
      Serum K18, OPN, and MCSFR levels were most strongly associated with liver-related
      death or transplant within 6 months of DILI-onset. Prediction of prognosis among 
      DILI patients using Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) was improved by
      incorporation of K18 and MCSFR levels. CONCLUSION: GLDH appears to be more useful
      than miR-122 in identifying DILI patients. K18, OPN and MCSFR are promising
      candidates for prediction of prognosis during an acute DILI event. Serial
      assessment of these biomarkers in large prospective studies will help further
      delineate their role in DILI diagnosis and management. This article is protected

TI  - Cyclophilin D Deficiency Attenuates Mitochondrial Perturbation and Ameliorates
      Hepatic Steatosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29788 [doi]
AB  - Physiological opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is
      indispensable for maintaining mitochondrial function and cell homeostasis, but
      the role of mPTP and its initial factor, cyclophilin D (CypD) in hepatic
      steatosis is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that excess mPTP opening mediated by 
      the increase of CypD expression induced hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction.
      Notably, such mitochondrial perturbation occurred before detectable triglyceride 
      (TG) accumulation in the liver of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, either genetic knockout
      or pharmacological inhibition of CypD could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction,
      including excess mPTP opening and stress, and downregulate the transcription of
      sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a key factor of
      lipogenesis. In contrast, the hepatic steatosis in adenoviral overexpression of
      CypD (AdPPIF)-infected mice were aggravated relative to control group. Blocking
      p38 MAPK or liver-specific Ire1alpha knockout could resist CypD-induced SREBP-1c 
      expression and steatosis. Importantly, CypD inhibitor applied prior to or after
      the onset of TG deposition substantially prevented or ameliorated fatty liver.
      CONCLUSION: CypD stimulates mPTP excessive opening, subsequently causing
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via p38 MAPK activation, and resultes in
      enhanced SREBP-1c transcription and hepatic steatosis. This article is protected

TI  - Basolateral CD147 induces hepatocyte polarity loss by E-cadherin ubiquitination
      and degradation in hepatocellular carcinoma progress.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29798 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocytes are epithelial cells with highly specialized polarity. The disorder
      and loss of hepatocyte polarity leads to a weakness of cell adhesion and
      connection, the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and eventually
      the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cluster of differentiation 147 
      (CD147), a tumor-related glycoprotein, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition
      and the invasion of HCC. However, the function of CD147 in hepatocyte
      depolarization is unknown. Here we identified that CD147 was basolaterally
      polarized in hepatocyte membrane of liver tissues and HepG2 cells. CD147 not only
      promoted transforming growth factor-beta1-mediated hepatocyte polarity loss but
      also directly induced endocytosis and down-regulation of E-cadherin which
      contributed to hepatocyte depolarization. Overexpression of CD147 induced Src
      activation and subsequently recruited ubiquitin ligase Hakai for E-cadherin
      ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation, leading to decreases of partitioning
      defective 3 expression and beta-catenin nuclear translocation. This signal
      transduction was initiated by competitive binding of CD147 with integrin beta1
      that interrupted the interaction between the Arg-Gly-Asp motif of fibronectin and
      integrin beta1. The specific antibodies targeting integrin alpha5 and beta1
      reversed the decrease of E-cadherin and partitioning defective 3 levels induced
      by CD147 overexpression. In human liver tissues, CD147 polarity rates
      significantly declined from liver cirrhosis (71.4%) to HCC (10.4%).
      CD147-polarized localization negatively correlated with Child-Pugh scores in
      human liver cirrhosis (r = -0.6092, P < 0.0001) and positively correlated with
      differentiation grades in HCC (r = 0.2060, P = 0.004). HCC patients with
      CD147-polarized localization had significantly better overall survival than
      patients with CD147 nonpolarity (P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: The ectopic
      CD147-polarized distribution on basolateral membrane promotes hepatocyte
      depolarization by activation of the CD147-integrin alpha5beta1-E-cadherin
      ubiquitination-partitioning defective 3 decrease and beta-catenin translocation
      signaling cascade, replenishing a molecular pathway in hepatic carcinogenesis.

TI  - Non-invasive, quantitative assessment of liver fat by MRI-PDFF as an endpoint in 
      NASH trials.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29797 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of chronic 
      liver disease worldwide, and the progressive form of this condition, nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH), has become one of the leading indications for liver
      transplant. Despite intensive investigations, there are currently no FDA approved
      therapies for treating NASH. A major barrier for drug development in NASH is that
      treatment response assessment continues to require liver biopsy, which is
      invasive and interpreted subjectively. Therefore, there is a major unmet need for
      developing non-invasive, objective and quantitative biomarkers for diagnosis and 
      assessment of treatment response. Emerging data support the use of magnetic
      resonance imaging derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as a
      non-invasive, quantitative, and accurate measure of liver fat content to assess
      treatment response in early-phase of NASH trials. In this review, we will discuss
      the role and utility, including potential sample-size reduction, of using
      MRI-PDFF as a quantitative and non-invasive imaging-based biomarker in
      early-phase NASH trials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Identification and therapeutic intervention of coactivated anaplastic lymphoma
      kinase, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, and ephrin type-A receptor 5 kinases
      in hepatocellular carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29792 [doi]
AB  - Though kinase inhibitors have been heavily investigated in the clinic to combat
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), clinical outcomes have been
      disappointing overall, which may be due to the absence of kinase-addicted subsets
      in HCC patients. Recently, strategies that simultaneously inhibit multiple
      kinases are increasingly appreciated in HCC treatment, yet they are challenged by
      the dynamic nature of the kinase networks. This study aims to identify clustered 
      kinases that may cooperate to drive the malignant growth of HCC. We show that
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, and ephrin
      type-A receptor 5 are the essential kinases that assemble into a functional
      cluster to sustain the viability of HCC cells through downstream protein kinase
      B-dependent, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent, and p38-dependent
      signaling pathways. Their coactivation is associated with poor prognosis for
      overall survival in about 13% of HCC patients. Moreover, their activities are
      tightly regulated by heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Thereby Combined kinase
      inhibition or targeting of heat shock protein 90 led to significant therapeutic
      responses both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our findings established a
      paradigm that highlights the cooperation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase,
      fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, and ephrin type-A receptor 5 kinases in
      governing the growth advantage of HCC cells, which might offer a conceptual
      "combined therapeutic target" for diagnosis and subsequent intervention in a
      subgroup of HCC patients. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Hepatitis B virus surface gene pre-S2 mutant as a high-risk serum marker for
      hepatoma recurrence after curative hepatic resection.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29790 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). The pre-S2 mutant large HBV surface antigen (LHBS) is highly
      associated with HCC. This study aimed to analyze the expression of the large form
      of surface protein in tumors and to evaluate the LHBS with mutations within the
      pre-S2 region as a high-risk recurrence marker in HCC patients after curative
      hepatic resection. By the analyses of immunohistochemical staining (N = 12) and
      Western Blotting (N = 22), the HBV surface protein, which is mainly comprised of 
      the major form of HBS, was greatly diminished in the tumors. However, LHBS was
      not significantly decreased in tumorous regions, suggesting that LHBS maintains
      its expression in cancer development. A cohort of 175 patients with HBV-related
      HCC who underwent curative hepatic resection was analyzed for pre-S gene
      mutations by using Pre-S Gene Chip. Results of the multivariate regression
      analysis showed that the serum pre-S2 mutant level and the AJCC stage were the
      two main independent high-risk factors for recurrence. A Cox proportional hazards
      analysis also revealed a prediction model, which indicated the recurrence-free
      survival rate along with the time after surgery, was developed and further
      validated in an independent HCC cohort. Receiver operating characteristic curve
      analysis revealed that the model showed close sensitivities in the main and
      validation cohorts (AUC values: 0.741 and 0.704, respectively). CONCLUSION:
      Unlike the major HBS, LHBS is mostly expressed in the tumorous regions of
      HBV-induced HCC, indicating that it plays a unique role in tumor progression. The
      relative level of pre-S2 mutant in serum is, independently of tumor stage, an
      important high-risk marker for HCC recurrence after primary hepatic resection.

TI  - Recombinant Relaxin Protects Liver Transplants from Ischemia Damage via
      Hepatocyte Glucocorticoid Receptor: From Bench-to-Bedside.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29787 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major risk factor of early
      graft dysfunction and acute/chronic rejection as well as a key obstacle to
      expanding the donor pool in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Although
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling may enhance cytoprotective programs,
      clinical use of glucocorticoid is limited due to adverse effects, while clinical 
      relevance of GR-facilitated cytoprotection in OLT remains unknown. We aimed to
      evaluate the significance of hepatic GR in clinical OLT and verify the impact of 
      recombinant human relaxin (rhRLX), which may function as GR agonist in
      tissue/disease-specific manner. Fifty-one liver transplant patients were
      recruited under IRB protocol. Liver biopsies were collected after cold storage
      (prior to the surgery) and 2h post-reperfusion (prior to the abdominal closure), 
      followed by Western blot-assisted hepatic analyses. Forty-three percent of OLTs
      failed to increase GR peri-operatively under surgical stress. Post-/pre-GR ratios
      at post-operative day 1 correlated negatively with serum AST/cleaved caspase-3
      and positively with Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 levels. In a murine OLT model with extended
      (18h) cold storage, treatment with rhRLX ameliorated IR-damage and improved
      survival while upregulating hepatocyte GR and Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 expression in OLT.
      rhRLX-induced GR suppressed hepatocyte HMGB1 translocation/release, accompanied
      by decreased TLR4/RAGE, suppressed IL1beta, CCL2, CXCL10, TNFalpha, CXCL1 and
      CXCL2 levels and attenuated neutrophil/macrophage accumulation in OLT. Inhibition
      of GR in hepatocyte culture and in OLT diminished rhRLX-mediated cytoprotection. 
      CONCLUSION: This translational study underscores the role of rhRLX - GR signaling
      as a novel regulator of hepatocellular protection against IR-stress in OLT. In
      the context of a recent phase III clinical trial demonstrating positive outcomes 
      of rhRLX in patients with acute heart failure, studies on rhRLX for the
      management of IRI in liver transplant recipients are warranted. This article is

TI  - Diet Affects Gut Microbiota and Modulates Hospitalization Risk Differentially In 
      an International Cirrhosis Cohort.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29791 [doi]
AB  - The relative ranking of cirrhosis-related deaths differs between
      high/middle-income countries. Gut microbiome is affected in cirrhosis and related
      to diet. Our aim was to determine the effect of differing dietary habits on gut
      microbiota and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Outpatient compensated/decompensated
      cirrhotics and controls from Turkey and USA underwent dietary and stool
      microbiota analysis. Cirrhotics were followed till 90-day hospitalizations.
      Shannon diversity and multi-variable determinants (Cox and binary logistic) of
      microbial diversity and hospitalizations were studied within/between groups.
      RESULTS: 296 subjects (157 USA:48 controls, 59 compensated, 50 decompensated, 139
      Turkey:46 controls, 50 compensated, 43 decompensated) were included. Cirrhotics
      between cohorts had similar MELD scores. American cirrhotics had more men,
      greater rifaximin/lactulose use and higher hepatitis C/alcohol etiologies. Coffee
      intake was higher in Americans while tea, fermented milk and chocolate intake
      were higher in Turkey. The entire Turkish cohort had a significantly higher
      diversity than Americans, which did not change between their controls and
      cirrhotics. In contrast, diversity changed in the US-based cohort and was the
      lowest in decompensated patients. Coffee, tea, vegetable, chocolate and fermented
      milk intake predicted a higher diversity while MELD score, lactulose use and
      carbonated beverage use predicted a lower microbial diversity. The Turkish cohort
      had a lower risk of 90-day hospitalizations. On Cox and binary logistic
      regression, microbial diversity was protective against 90-day hospitalizations,
      along with coffee/tea, vegetable and cereal intake. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of
      cirrhotic patients and healthy controls from USA and Turkey, a diet rich in
      fermented milk, vegetables, cereals, coffee and tea, is associated with a higher 
      microbial diversity. Microbial diversity was associated with an independently
      lower risk of 90-day hospitalizations. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Hepatic PPARalpha function is controlled by polyubiquitination and
      proteasome-mediated degradation via the coordinated actions of PAQR3 and HUWE1.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29786 [doi]
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a key
      transcriptional factor that regulates hepatic lipid catabolism by stimulating
      fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in an adaptive response to nutrient
      starvation. However, how PPARalpha is regulated by post-translational
      modification is poorly understood. Here, we identified that PAQR3 promotes
      PPARalpha ubiquitination through the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, thereby
      negatively modulating PPARalpha functions both in vitro and in vivo.
      Adenovirus-mediated Paqr3 knockdown and liver-specific deletion of the Paqr3 gene
      reduced hepatic triglyceride levels while increasing fatty acid oxidation and
      ketogenesis upon fasting. PAQR3 deficiency enhances the fasting-induced
      expression of PPARalpha target genes, including those involved in fatty acid
      oxidation and FGF21, a key molecule that mediates the metabolism-modulating
      effects of PPARalpha. PAQR3 directly interacts with PPARalpha and increases the
      polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of PPARalpha. Furthermore,
      the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 was identified to mediate PPARalpha
      polyubiquitination. Additionally, PAQR3 enhances the interaction between HUWE1
      and PPARalpha. Collectively, this study revealed that ubiquitination modification
      through the coordinated action of PAQR3 with HUWE1 plays a crucial role in
      regulating the activity of PPARalpha in response to starvation. This article is

TI  - Cellular membrane trafficking machineries utilized by the hepatitis viruses.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29785 [doi]
AB  - While the life cycles of hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses) 
      have been modestly characterized, recent intensive studies have provided new
      insights. Because these viruses 'hijack' the membrane trafficking of the host
      cell machinery during replicative propagation, it is essential to determine and
      understand these specific cellular pathways. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) are well known as a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. While substantial inroads toward treating HCV patients 
      have recently been made, patients with HBV continue to require life-long
      treatment, which makes a thorough understanding of the HBV life cycle essential. 
      Importantly, these viruses have been observed to "hijack" the secretory and
      endocytic membrane trafficking machineries of the hepatocyte. These can include
      the canonical clathrin-mediated endocytic process that internalizes virus through
      cell surface receptors. While these receptors are encoded by the host genome for 
      normal hepatocellular functions, they also exhibit viral-specific recognition.
      Further, functions provided by the multivesicular body (MVB), that include
      endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), are now known to
      envelope a variety of different hepatitis viruses. In this review, we summarize
      the recent findings regarding the cellular membrane trafficking machineries
      utilized by HBV in the context of other hepatitis viruses. This article is

TI  - Serologic Responses and Effectiveness of Hepatitis A Vaccination Among
      HIV-Positive Individuals During the Outbreak of Acute Hepatitis A.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29780 [doi]
AB  - Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection have been occurring among men who 
      have sex with men (MSM) in Asia-Pacific region, the United States, and several
      European countries since June 2015, and recently among persons who are homeless
      and use illicit drugs in the US. We evaluated the serologic responses and
      effectiveness of HAV vaccination in HIV-positive individuals during the outbreak 
      in Taiwan. From June 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016, anti-HAV IgG was
      prospectively determined among all HIV-positive individuals. We prospectively
      observed 1533 HAV-seronegative, HIV-positive individuals (94.1% being MSM and a
      median CD4 count of 550 cells/microL) who were advised to receive two doses of
      HAV vaccines administered at six months apart. Of them, 1001 individuals (65.3%) 
      received at least one dose of HAV vaccine during the study period and 532 (34.7%)
      declined to receive vaccine. The primary endpoints were serologic response at
      weeks 28-36 and acquisition of HAV infection during follow-up. The incidence rate
      of acute HAV infection was 3.7 and 99.3 per 1000 person-years of follow-up in
      vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, respectively, resulting in vaccine
      effectiveness of 96.3%. At weeks 28-36, the seroconversion rate was 63.8% and
      93.7% in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, respectively. The
      factors associated with seroconversion at weeks 28-36 were younger age (per
      one-year decrease, AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12) and undetectable plasma HIV RNA 
      load (AOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.32-7.68). CONCLUSION: During the outbreak of acute
      hepatitis A, two-dose HAV vaccination is effective in preventing HAV infection
      among HIV-positive individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Our 
      data highlights the importance of HAV serologic screening and vaccination to
      prevent outbreaks of acute hepatitis A in the at-risk populations. This article

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma-related cyclin D1 is selectively regulated by autophagy 
      degradation system.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29781 [doi]
AB  - Dysfunction of degradation machineries causes cancers, including hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of cyclin D1 in HCC has been reported. We
      previously reported that autophagy preferentially recruits and degrades the
      oncogenic microRNA (miR)-224 to prevent HCC. Therefore, in the present study, we 
      attempted to clarify whether cyclin D1 is another oncogenic factor selectively
      regulated by autophagy in HCC tumorigenesis. Initially, we found an inverse
      correlation between low autophagic activity and high cyclin D1 expression in
      tumors of 147 HCC patients and three murine models, and these results taken
      together revealed a correlation with poor overall survival of HCC patients,
      indicating the importance of these two events in HCC development. We found that
      increased autophagic activity leads to cyclin D1 ubiquitination and selective
      recruitment to the autophagosome (AP) mediated by a specific receptor,
      sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), followed by fusion with lysosome and degradation.
      Autophagy-selective degradation of ubiquitinated cyclin D1 through SQSTM1 was
      confirmed using cyclin D1/ubiquitin binding site (K33-238 R) and phosphorylation 
      site (T286A) mutants, lentivirus-mediated silencing autophagy-related 5 (ATG5),
      autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), and Sqstm1 knockout cells. Functional studies
      revealed that autophagy-selective degradation of cyclin D1 plays suppressive
      roles in cell proliferation, colony, and liver tumor formation. Notably, an
      increase of autophagic activity by pharmacological inducers (amiodarone and
      rapamycin) significantly suppressed tumor growth in both the orthotopic liver
      tumor and subcutaneous tumor xenograft models. Our findings provide evidence of
      the underlying mechanism involved in the regulation of cyclin D1 by selective
      autophagy to prevent tumor formation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data
      demonstrate that autophagic degradation machinery and the cell-cycle regulator,
      cyclin D1, are linked to HCC tumorigenesis. We believe these findings may be of
      value in the development of alternative therapeutics for HCC patients.

TI  - MAIT cells are chronically activated in patients with autoimmune liver disease
      and promote pro-fibrogenic hepatic stellate cell activation.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29782 [doi]
AB  - Autoimmune liver diseases (AILD) are chronic liver pathologies characterised by
      fibrosis and cirrhosis due to immune-mediated liver damage. In this study, we
      addressed the question whether mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells,
      innate-like T cells, are functionally altered in patients with AILD and whether
      MAIT cells can promote liver fibrosis through activation of hepatic stellate
      cells. We analysed the phenotype and function of MAIT cells from AILD patients
      and healthy controls by multi-colour flow cytometry and investigated the
      interaction between human MAIT cells and primary human hepatic stellate cells
      (hHSCs). We show that MAIT cells are significantly decreased in peripheral blood 
      and liver tissue of patients with AILD. Notably, MAIT cell frequency tended to
      decrease with increasing fibrosis stage. MAIT cells from AILD patients showed
      signs of exhaustion, such as impaired IFNgamma production and high ex vivo
      expression of the activation and exhaustion markers CD38, HLA-DR and CTLA-4.
      Mechanistically, this exhausted state could be induced by repetitive stimulation 
      of MAIT cells with the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, leading to decreased IFNgamma
      and increased exhaustion marker expression. Of note, repetitive stimulation with 
      IL-12 further resulted in expression of the pro-fibrogenic cytokine IL-17A by
      otherwise exhausted MAIT cells. Accordingly, MAIT cells from both healthy
      controls and AILD patients were able to induce an activated, pro-inflammatory and
      pro-fibrogenic phenotype in hHSCs in vitro, which was partly mediated by IL-17.
      CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that MAIT cells in AILD patients have
      evolved towards an exhausted, pro-fibrogenic phenotype and can contribute to the 
      development of HSC-mediated liver fibrosis. These findings reveal a cellular and 
      molecular pathway for fibrosis development in AILD that could be exploited for
      anti-fibrotic therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Disruption of Adenosine 2A Receptor Exacerbates NAFLD through Increasing
      Inflammatory Responses and SREBP1c Activity.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29777 [doi]
AB  - Adenosine 2A receptor (A2A R) exerts protective roles in endotoxin- and/or
      ischemia-induced tissue damages. However, the role for A2A R in non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely unknown. We sought to examine the
      effects of global and/or myeloid cell-specific A2A R disruption on the aspects of
      obesity-associated NAFLD and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Global
      and/or myeloid cell-specific A2A R-disrupted mice, as well as control mice were
      fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD. Also, bone marrow-derived macrophages 
      and primary mouse hepatocytes were examined for inflammatory and metabolic
      responses. Upon feeding an HFD, both global A2A R-disrupted mice and myeloid
      cell-specific A2A R-defcient mice revealed increased severity of HFD-induced
      hepatic steatosis and inflammation compared with their respective control mice.
      In in vitro experiments, A2A R-deficient macrophages exhibited increased
      proinflammatory responses, and enhanced fat deposition of wild-type primary
      hepatocytes in macrophage-hepatocyte co-cultures. In primary hepatocytes, A2A R
      deficiency increased the proinflammatory responses and enhanced the effect of
      palmitate on stimulating fat deposition. Moreover, A2A R deficiency significantly
      increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) abundance in
      livers of fasted mice and in hepatocytes upon nutrient deprivation. In the
      absence of A2A R, SREBP1c transcription activity was significantly increased in
      mouse hepatocytes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that disruption of
      A2A R in both macrophage and hepatocytes accounts for increased severity of
      NAFLD, likely through increasing inflammation and through elevating lipogenic
      events due to stimulation of SREBP1c expression and transcription activity. This

TI  - Single cell analysis reveals cancer stem cell heterogeneity in hepatocellular
      carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29778 [doi]
AB  - Intratumor molecular heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is partly
      attributed to the presence of hepatic cancer stem cells (CSCs). Different CSC
      populations defined by various cell surface markers may contain different
      oncogenic drivers, posing a challenge in defining molecular-targeted
      therapeutics. We combined transcriptomic and functional analyses of HCC cells at 
      the single cell level to assess the degree of CSC heterogeneity. We provide
      evidence that hepatic CSCs at the single-cell level are phenotypically,
      functionally and transcriptionally heterogeneous. We found that different CSC
      subpopulations contain distinct molecular signatures. Interestingly, distinct
      genes within different CSC subpopulations are independently associated with HCC
      prognosis, suggesting that a diverse hepatic CSC transcriptome affects intratumor
      heterogeneity and tumor progression. CONCLUSION: Our work provides unique
      perspectives into the previously unappreciated diversity of CSC subpopulations,
      whose molecular heterogeneity further highlights their role in tumor
      heterogeneity, prognosis and hepatic CSC therapy. This article is protected by

TI  - Fractional excretion of urea: A simple tool for the differential diagnosis of
      acute kidney injury in cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29772 [doi]
AB  - Current approaches to determine the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in
      patients with cirrhosis are suboptimal. The aim of this study was to determine
      the utility of fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) for the differential
      diagnosis of AKI in cirrhotic patients. A retrospective analysis was performed in
      patients (n=50) with cirrhosis and ascites admitted with AKI. Using adjudicated
      etiology assessment as the reference standard, receiver operating curves (ROC)
      and optimal cutoff, sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) for the diagnosis of
      prerenal azotemia (PRA), type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and acute tubular
      necrosis (ATN) was derived. Validation was performed in an independent cohort
      (n=50) and by bootstrap analysis. The causes of AKI (derivation:validation
      cohorts) were: PRA 21:21, HRS 18:15, ATN: 11:14. Median FEUrea were statistically
      different across all etiologies of AKI in the derivation cohort (PRA 30.1 vs HRS 
      20.2 vs ATN 43.6, p=<0.001) and validation cohort (PRA 23.1 vs HRS 13.3 vs ATN
      44.7, p=<0.001). The AUC (cutoff, Sn/Sp) for FEUrea was 0.96 (33.4, 85/100) for
      ATN vs non-ATN, 0.87 (28.7, 75/83) for HRS vs non-HRS, and 0.81 (21.6, 90/61) for
      PRA vs HRS. When applied to the validation cohort, the Sn/Sp were maintained for 
      ATN vs non-ATN (93/97), HRS vs non-HRS (100/63), and for PRA vs HRS (67/80).
      After bootstrapping, the Sn/Sp for FEUrea in the ATN vs non-ATN, HRS vs non-HRS, 
      and PRA vs HRS was 88/96, 63/97, and 55/87 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FEUrea is a
      promising tool for the differential diagnosis of AKI in patients with cirrhosis.

TI  - NACSELD Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (NACSELD-ACLF) Score Predicts 30-Day
      Survival in Hospitalized Patients with Cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29773 [doi]
AB  - NACSELD (North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease)
      definition of acute-on-chronic liver failure (NACSELD-ACLF) as >/=2 extra-hepatic
      organ failures has been proposed as a simple bedside tool to assess risk of
      mortality in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We validated NACSELD-ACLF's
      ability to predict 30-day survival (defined as in-hospital death or hospice
      discharge) in a separate multicenter prospectively enrolled cohort of both
      infected and uninfected hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We utilized the
      NACSELD database of 14 tertiary care hepatology centers that prospectively
      enrolled non-elective hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (N=2675). The cohort
      was randomly split 60%/40% into training (N=1605) and testing (N=1070) groups.
      Organ failures assessed were: 1) shock, 2) hepatic encephalopathy (grade III/IV),
      3) renal (need for dialysis), and 4) respiratory (mechanical ventilation).
      Patients were most commonly Caucasian (79%) men (62%) with a mean age of 57 years
      with a diagnosis of alcohol-induced cirrhosis (45%). 1079 patients had an
      infection during hospitalization. Mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
      was 19 and median Child score was 10. No demographic differences were present
      between the 2 split groups. Multivariable modeling revealed NACSELD-ACLF score,
      as determined by number of organ failures, was the strongest predictor of
      decreased survival after controlling for admission age, white blood cell count,
      serum albumin, MELD score, and presence of infection. The c-statistic for the
      training set was 0.8073 and was 0.8532 for the validation set. CONCLUSION:
      Although infection status remains an important predictor of death, NACSELD-ACLF
      was independently validated in a separate large multinational prospective cohort 
      as a simple reliable bed-side tool to predict 30-day survival in both infected
      and uninfected patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. This article

TI  - Patterning of the hepato-pancreatobiliary boundary by BMP reveals heterogeneity
      within the murine liver bud.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29769 [doi]
AB  - During development, the endoderm initiates organ-restricted gene expression
      patterns in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. This process, termed induction,
      requires signals from adjacent mesodermal derivatives. Fibroblast Growth Factor
      (FGF) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) emanating from the cardiac mesoderm
      and the septum transversum mesenchyme (STM), respectively, are believed to be
      simultaneously and uniformly required to directly induce hepatic gene expression 
      from the murine endoderm. Using small molecule inhibitors of BMP signals during
      liver bud induction in the developing mouse embryo, we find that BMP signaling is
      not uniformly required to induce hepatic gene expression. Although BMP inhibition
      causes an overall reduction in the number of induced hepatoblasts, the
      STM-bounded posterior liver bud demonstrates the most severe loss of the
      essential hepatic transcription factor Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha
      (HNF4alpha) while the sinus venosus (SV)-lined anterior liver bud is less
      affected. We find that the posterior liver bud progenitors are anteriorly
      displaced and aberrantly activate pancreatobiliary markers including SOX9.
      Additionally, we find that ectopically expressed SOX9 inhibits HNF4alpha and that
      BMP is indirectly required for hepatoblast induction. Finally, because previous
      work demonstrated that FGF signals were essential for anterior but not posterior 
      liver bud induction, we examined synchronous BMP and FGF inhibition and find that
      this leads to a massive loss of induced hepatoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: BMP signaling 
      is required to maintain the hepato-pancreatobiliary boundary, at least in part,
      by indirectly repressing SOX9 in the hepatic endoderm. BMP and FGF signals are
      each required for the induction of spatially complementary subsets of
      hepatoblasts. These results highlight the importance of studying early inductive 
      processes in the whole embryo. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease most commonly arising in the 
      background of chronic liver disease. In the past two decades, there has been a
      significant increase in our understanding of both the clinical and molecular
      heterogeneity of HCC. There has been a robust increase in clinical trial activity
      in patients with poor prognostic factors, such as macrovascular invasion and
      extrahepatic spread (EHS). We aimed to synthesize the evidence for the treatment 
      of patients with advanced HCC based on these baseline characteristics, including 
      patients with both Child-Pugh (CP) scores of A and B. A comprehensive search of
      several databases from each database inception to February 15, 2016 any language 
      was conducted. We included 14 studies (three randomized controlled studies [RCTs]
      and 11 observational studies). We included studies that compared sorafenib,
      transarterial bland embolization/transarterial chemoembolization,
      yttrium-90/radiation therapy, ablation (or combination), and no therapy. Two RCTs
      comparing sorafenib to best supportive care demonstrated a consistent improvement
      in overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced HCC and metastatic vascular
      invasion (MVI) and/or EHS and CP A liver disease (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95%
      confidence interval, 0.51-0.87]; I(2) = 0%). Several observational studies
      evaluated locoregional therapies alone or in combination with other treatments
      and were limited by very-low-quality of evidence. This was true for both patients
      with EHS and MVI. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced HCC and CP A liver
      function, sorafenib is the only treatment that has been shown to improve OS in
      randomized studies. High-quality data supporting the use of other treatment
      modalities in this setting, or in the setting of patients with less compensated
      (CP B) liver disease, are lacking. (Hepatology 2018;67:422-435).

TI  - Cystathionine beta-synthase is required for body iron homeostasis.
PG  - 21-35
LID - 10.1002/hep.29499 [doi]
AB  - Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the transsulfuration pathway and
      contributes, among other functions, to the generation of hydrogen sulfide. In
      view of the exceptionally high expression of CBS in the liver and the common
      interleukin-6 pathway used in the regulatory systems of hydrogen sulfide and
      hepcidin, we speculate that CBS is involved in body iron homeostasis. We found
      that CBS knockout (CBS(-/-) ) mice exhibited anemia and a significant increase in
      iron content in the serum, liver, spleen, and heart, along with severe damage to 
      the liver, displaying a hemochromatosis-like phenotype. A high level of hepatic
      and serum hepcidin was also found. A major cause of the systemic iron overload is
      the reduced iron usage due to suppressed erythropoiesis, which is consistent with
      an increase in interleukin-6 and reduced expression of erythropoietin.
      Importantly, in the liver, absence of CBS caused both a reduction in the
      transcriptional factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 and an
      up-regulation of hepcidin that led to a decrease in the iron export protein
      ferroportin 1. The resulting suppression of iron export exacerbates iron
      retention, causing damage to hepatocytes. Finally, administration of
      CBS-overexpressing adenovirus into CBS mutant mice could partially reverse the
      iron-related phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings point to a critical role of CBS 
      in iron homeostasis of the body, and the liver in particular; it is likely that a
      hemochromatosis-like phenotype in patients can be induced by aberration not only 
      in the expression of key molecules in the hepcidin pathway but also of those
      related to CBS. (Hepatology 2018;67:21-35).

TI  - Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 401-421
LID - 10.1002/hep.29487 [doi]
AB  - Multiphasic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are
      both used for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients
      with cirrhosis. To determine if there is a relative diagnostic benefit of one
      over the other, we synthesized evidence regarding the relative performance of CT,
      extracellular contrast-enhanced MRI, and gadoxetate-enhanced MRI for diagnosis of
      HCC in patients with cirrhosis. We also assessed whether liver biopsy versus
      follow-up with the same versus alternative imaging is best for CT-indeterminate
      or MRI-indeterminate liver nodules in patients with cirrhosis. We searched
      multiple databases from inception to April 27, 2016, for studies comparing CT
      with extracellular contrast-enhanced MRI or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI in adults
      with cirrhosis and suspected HCC. Two reviewers independently selected studies
      and extracted data. Of 33 included studies, 19 were comprehensive, while 14
      reported sensitivity only. For all tumor sizes, the 19 comprehensive comparisons 
      showed significantly higher sensitivity (0.82 versus 0.66) and lower negative
      likelihood ratio (0.20 versus 0.37) for MRI over CT. The specificities of MRI
      versus CT (0.91 versus 0.92) and the positive likelihood ratios (8.8 versus 8.1) 
      were not different. All three modalities performed better for HCCs >/=2 cm.
      Performance was poor for HCCs <1 cm. No studies examined whether adults with
      cirrhosis and an indeterminate nodule are best evaluated using biopsy, repeated
      imaging, or alternative imaging. Concerns about publication bias, inconsistent
      study results, increased risk of bias, and clinical factors precluded support for
      exclusive use of either gadoxetate-enhanced or extracellular contrast-enhanced
      MRI over CT. CONCLUSION: CT, extracellular contrast-enhanced MRI, or
      gadoxetate-enhanced MRI could not be definitively preferred for HCC diagnosis in 
      patients with cirrhosis; in patients with cirrhosis and an indeterminate mass,
      there were insufficient data comparing biopsy to repeat cross-sectional imaging
      or alternative imaging. (Hepatology 2018;67:401-421).

TI  - Performance characteristics of vibration-controlled transient elastography for
      evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 134-144
LID - 10.1002/hep.29489 [doi]
AB  - Vibration-controlled transient elastography estimates liver stiffness measurement
      (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), which are noninvasive
      assessments of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively. However, prior
      vibration-controlled transient elastography studies reported high failure rates
      in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We examined the performance
      characteristics of the FibroScan 502 Touch with two probes, medium (M+) and extra
      large (XL+), in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in a multicenter
      setting. A total of 1,696 exams were attempted in 992 patients (body mass index, 
      33.6 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2) ) with histologically confirmed nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease. Simultaneous assessment of LSM and CAP was performed using the FibroScan
      502 Touch with an automatic probe selection tool. Testing was conducted twice in 
      patients by either a single operator (87%) or two operators (13%). Failure was
      defined as the inability to obtain a valid examination. An examination was
      considered unreliable if LSM interquartile range/median was >30%. Significant
      disagreement between two readings was defined as >95% limits of agreement between
      two readings. A total of 1,641 examinations yielded valid results with a failure 
      rate of 3.2% (55/1,696). The proportion of unreliable scans for LSM was 3.9%. The
      proportion of unreliable scans with operator experience in the top quartile
      (>/=59 procedures) was significantly lower than that in the lower three quarters 
      combined (1.6% versus 4.7%, P = 0.02 by Fisher's exact test). The significant
      disagreement between first and second readings for LSM and CAP when obtained back
      to back was 18% and 11%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vibration-controlled transient
      elastography for estimation of LSM and CAP can be successfully deployed in a
      multicenter setting with low failure (3.2%) and high reliability (>95%) rates and
      high reproducibility. (Hepatology 2018;67:134-144).

TI  - Therapies for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma awaiting liver
      transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 381-400
LID - 10.1002/hep.29485 [doi]
AB  - Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are listed for liver
      transplantation (LT) are often treated while on the waiting list with
      locoregional therapy (LRT), which is aimed at either preventing progression of
      HCC or reducing the measurable disease burden of HCC in order to receive
      increased allocation priority. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the
      effectiveness of LRT in the management of patients with HCC who were on the LT
      waitlist. We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases from 1996 to 
      April 25, 2016, for studies that enrolled adults with cirrhosis awaiting LT and
      treated with bridging or down-staging therapies before LT. Therapies included
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, transarterial radioembolization,
      ablation, and radiotherapy. We included both comparative and noncomparative
      studies. There were no randomized controlled trials identified. For adults with
      T1 HCC and waiting for LT, there were only two nonrandomized comparative studies,
      both with a high risk of bias, which reported the outcome of interest. In one
      series, the rate of dropout from all causes at 6 months in T1 HCC patients who
      underwent LRT was 5.3%, while in the other series of T1 HCC patients who did not 
      receive LRT, the dropout rate at median follow-up of 2.4 years and the
      progression rate to T2 HCC were 30% and 88%, respectively. For adults with T2 HCC
      awaiting LT, transplant with any bridging therapy showed a nonsignificant
      reduction in the risk of waitlist dropout due to progression (relative risk [RR],
      0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-1.85; I(2) = 0%) and of waitlist dropout
      from all causes (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.060-2.370; I(2) = 85.7%) compared to no
      therapy based on three comparative studies. The quality of evidence is very low
      due to high risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. There were five
      comparative studies which reported on posttransplant survival rates and 10
      comparative studies which reported on posttransplant recurrence, and there was no
      significant difference seen in either of these endpoints. For adults initially
      with stage T3 HCC who received LRT, there were three studies reporting on
      transplant with any down-staging therapy versus no downstaging, and this showed a
      significant increase in 1-year (two studies, RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23) and
      5-year (1 study, RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32) post-LT survival rates for patients
      who received LRT. The quality of evidence is very low due to serious risk of bias
      and imprecision. CONCLUSION: In patients with HCC listed for LT, the use of LRT
      is associated with a nonsignificant trend toward improved waitlist and
      posttransplant outcomes, though there is a high risk of selection bias in the
      available evidence. (Hepatology 2018;67:381-400).

TI  - A microRNA-7/growth arrest specific 6/TYRO3 axis regulates the growth and
      invasiveness of sorafenib-resistant cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 216-231
LID - 10.1002/hep.29478 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib remains the only approved drug for treating patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the therapeutic effect of sorafenib is
      transient, and patients invariably develop sorafenib resistance (SR). Recently,
      TYRO3, a member of the TYRO3-AXL-MER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, was
      identified as being aberrantly expressed in a significant proportion of HCC;
      however, its role in SR is unknown. In this study, we generated two functionally 
      distinct sorafenib-resistant human Huh-7 HCC cell lines in order to identify new 
      mechanisms to abrogate acquired SR as well as new potential therapeutic targets
      in HCC. Initially, we investigated the effects of a microRNA (miR), miR-7-5p
      (miR-7), in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models of human HCC and
      identified miR-7 as a potent tumor suppressor of human HCC. We identified TYRO3
      as a new functional target of miR-7, which regulates proliferation, migration,
      and invasion of Huh-7 cells through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase 
      B pathway and is markedly elevated with acquisition of SR. Furthermore, miR-7
      effectively silenced TYRO3 expression in both sorafenib-sensitive and
      sorafenib-resistant Huh-7 cells, inhibiting TYRO3/growth arrest specific
      6-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: We identified a
      mechanism for acquiring SR in HCC that is through the aberrant expression of the 
      TYRO3/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transduction pathway, and
      that can be overcome by miR-7 overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest 
      a potential role for miR-7 as an RNA-based therapeutic to treat refractory and
      drug-resistant HCC. (Hepatology 2018;67:216-231).

      cholangiocyte gene expression are determined during differentiation remains
      poorly understood. Here, we identify microRNA (miR)-337-3p as a regulator of
      liver development. miR-337-3p stimulates expression of cholangiocyte genes and
      represses hepatocyte genes in undifferentiated progenitor cells in vitro and in
      embryonic mouse livers. Beyond the stage of lineage segregation, miR-337-3p
      controls the transcriptional network dynamics of developing hepatocytes and
      balances both cholangiocyte populations that constitute the ductal plate.
      miR-337-3p requires Notch and transforming growth factor-beta signaling and
      exerts a biphasic control on the hepatocyte transcription factor hepatocyte
      nuclear factor 4alpha by modulating its activation and repression. With the help 
      of an experimentally validated mathematical model, we show that this biphasic
      control results from an incoherent feedforward loop between miR-337-3p and
      hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha. CONCLUSION: Our results identify miR-337-3p as 
      a regulator of liver development and highlight how tight quantitative control of 
      hepatic cell differentiation is exerted through specific gene regulatory network 
      motifs. (Hepatology 2018;67:313-327).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29468 [doi]
AB  - The salvage liver transplantation (SLT) strategy was conceived for initially
      resectable and transplantable (R&T) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, to
      try to obviate upfront liver transplantation, with the "safety net" of SLT in
      case of postresection recurrence. The SLT strategy is successful or curative when
      patients are recurrence free following primary resection alone, or after SLT for 
      recurrence. The aim of the current study was to determine the SLT strategy's
      potential for cure in R&T HCC patients, and to identify predictors for its
      success. From 1994 to 2012, all R&T HCC patients with cirrhosis were enrolled in 
      the SLT strategy. An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used to determine this
      strategy's outcomes and predictors of success according to the above definition. 
      In total, 110 patients were enrolled in the SLT strategy. Sixty-three patients
      (57%) had tumor recurrence after initial resection, and in 30 patients SLT could 
      be performed (recurrence transplantability rate = 48%). From the time of initial 
      resection, ITT 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 69% and 60%,
      respectively. The SLT strategy was successful in 60 patients (56%), either by
      resection alone (36%), or by SLT for recurrence (19%). Preresection predictors of
      successful SLT strategy at multivariate analysis included Model for End-Stage
      Liver Disease (MELD) score >10, and absence of neoadjuvant transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE). Additional postresection predictive factors were
      absence of postresection morbidity, and T-stage 1-2 at the resection specimen.
      CONCLUSION: The SLT strategy is curative in only 56% of cases. Higher MELD score 
      at inception of the strategy and no pre-resection TACE are predictors of
      successful SLT strategy. (Hepatology 2018;67:204-215).

TI  - Altered amino acid concentrations in NAFLD: Impact of obesity and insulin
      resistance.
PG  - 145-158
LID - 10.1002/hep.29465 [doi]
AB  - Plasma concentrations of amino acids (AAs), in particular, branched chain AAs
      (BCAAs), are often found increased in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD);
      however, if this is due to increased muscular protein catabolism, obesity, and/or
      increased insulin resistance (IR) or impaired tissue metabolism is unknown. Thus,
      we evaluated a) if subjects with NAFLD without obesity (NAFLD-NO) compared to
      those with obesity (NAFLD-Ob) display altered plasma AAs compared to controls
      (CTs); and b) if AA concentrations are associated with IR and liver histology.
      Glutamic acid, serine, and glycine concentrations are known to be altered in
      NAFLD. Because these AAs are involved in glutathione synthesis, we hypothesized
      they might be related to the severity of NAFLD. We therefore measured the AA
      profile of 44 subjects with NAFLD without diabetes and who had a liver biopsy (29
      NAFLD-NO and 15 NAFLD-Ob) and 20 CTs without obesity, by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, hepatic IR
      (Hep-IR; Hep-IR = endogenous glucose production x insulin), and the new
      glutamate-serine-glycine (GSG) index (glutamate/[serine + glycine]) and tested
      for an association with liver histology. Most AAs were increased only in NAFLD-Ob
      subjects. Only alanine, glutamate, isoleucine, and valine, but not leucine, were 
      increased in NAFLD-NO subjects compared to CTs. Glutamate, tyrosine, and the
      GSG-index were correlated with Hep-IR. The GSG-index correlated with liver
      enzymes, in particular, gamma-glutamyltransferase (R = 0.70), independent of body
      mass index. Ballooning and/or inflammation at liver biopsy were associated with
      increased plasma BCAAs and aromatic AAs and were mildly associated with the
      GSG-index, while only the new GSG-index was able to discriminate fibrosis F3-4
      from F0-2 in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Increased plasma AA concentrations were
      observed mainly in subjects with obesity and NAFLD, likely as a consequence of
      increased IR and protein catabolism. The GSG-index is a possible marker of
      severity of liver disease independent of body mass index. (Hepatology
      2018;67:145-158).

TI  - Targeting senescent cholangiocytes and activated fibroblasts with B-cell
      lymphoma-extra large inhibitors ameliorates fibrosis in multidrug resistance 2
      gene knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mice.
PG  - 247-259
LID - 10.1002/hep.29464 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiocyte senescence has been linked to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
      Persistent secretion of growth factors by senescent cholangiocytes leads to the
      activation of stromal fibroblasts (ASFs), which are drivers of fibrosis. The
      activated phenotype of ASFs is characterized by an increased sensitivity to
      apoptotic stimuli. Here, we examined the mechanisms of apoptotic priming in ASFs 
      and explored a combined targeting strategy to deplete senescent cholangiocytes
      and ASFs from fibrotic tissue to ameliorate liver fibrosis. Using a coculture
      system, we determined that senescent cholangiocytes promoted quiescent
      mesenchymal cell activation in a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent 
      manner. We also identified B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) as a key survival
      factor in PDGF-activated human and mouse fibroblasts. Bcl-xL was also
      up-regulated in senescent cholangiocytes. In vitro, inhibition of Bcl-xL by the
      small molecule Bcl-2 homology domain 3 mimetic, A-1331852, or Bcl-xL-specific
      small interfering RNA induced apoptosis in PDGF-activated fibroblasts, but not in
      quiescent fibroblasts. Likewise, inhibition of Bcl-xL reduced the survival and
      increased apoptosis of senescent cholangiocytes, compared to nonsenescent cells. 
      Treatment of multidrug resistance 2 gene knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mice with
      A-1331852 resulted in an 80% decrease in senescent cholangiocytes, a reduction of
      fibrosis-inducing growth factors and cytokines, decrease of alpha-smooth muscle
      actin-positive ASFs, and finally in a significant reduction of liver fibrosis.
      CONCLUSION: Bcl-xL is a key survival factor in ASFs as well as in senescent
      cholangiocytes. Treatment with the Bcl-xL-specific inhibitor, A-1331852, reduces 
      liver fibrosis, possibly by a dual effect on activated fibroblasts and senescent 
      cholangiocytes. This mechanism represents an attractive therapeutic strategy in
      biliary fibrosis. (Hepatology 2018;67:247-259).

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      However, very little is known about the replication of HBV in HCC tissues. We
      analyzed viral and cellular parameters in HCC (T) and nontumor liver (NT) samples
      from 99 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive, virologically suppressed
      patients treated by tumor resection or liver transplantation. We examined total
      HBV DNA and RNA as well as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and pregenomic
      RNA (pgRNA), which are considered as markers of active HBV replication. Total HBV
      DNA and RNA were detected in both T and NT samples in a majority of cases, but
      only a subset of tumors harbored detectable levels of HBV cccDNA and pgRNA (39%
      and 67%) compared to NT livers (66% and 90%; P < 0.01). Further evidence for HBV 
      replication in tumor tissues was provided by sequencing of the X gene derived
      from episomal forms, showing that HBV genotypes differed between T and matched NT
      samples in 11 cases. The detection of pgRNA and cccDNA in tumors was correlated
      to the absence of tumorous microvascular invasion and to better patient survival.
      Analysis of gene expression profiles by Agilent microarrays revealed that
      pgRNA-positive HCCs were characterized by low levels of cell cycle and DNA repair
      markers and expression of the HBV receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting
      polypeptide, indicating well-differentiated tumors. CONCLUSION: HCC replicating
      HBV represents a subtype of weakly invasive HCC with a transcriptomic signature. 
      pgRNA originating from nonintegrated, complete HBV genomes is a sensitive marker 
      for viral replication and prognosis. (Hepatology 2018;67:86-96).

TI  - Modeling the epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease demonstrates an
      exponential increase in burden of disease.
PG  - 123-133
LID - 10.1002/hep.29466 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in the United States, where they are 
      a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increasingly 
      an indicator for liver transplantation. A Markov model was used to forecast NAFLD
      disease progression. Incidence of NAFLD was based on historical and projected
      changes in adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
      Assumptions were derived from published literature where available and validated 
      using national surveillance data for incidence of NAFLD-related HCC. Projected
      changes in NAFLD-related cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, and liver-related
      mortality were quantified through 2030. Prevalent NAFLD cases are forecasted to
      increase 21%, from 83.1 million (2015) to 100.9 million (2030), while prevalent
      NASH cases will increase 63% from 16.52 million to 27.00 million cases. Overall
      NAFLD prevalence among the adult population (aged >/=15 years) is projected at
      33.5% in 2030, and the median age of the NAFLD population will increase from 50
      to 55 years during 2015-2030. In 2015, approximately 20% of NAFLD cases were
      classified as NASH, increasing to 27% by 2030, a reflection of both disease
      progression and an aging population. Incidence of decompensated cirrhosis will
      increase 168% to 105,430 cases by 2030, while incidence of HCC will increase by
      137% to 12,240 cases. Liver deaths will increase 178% to an estimated 78,300
      deaths in 2030. During 2015-2030, there are projected to be nearly 800,000 excess
      liver deaths. CONCLUSION: With continued high rates of adult obesity and DM along
      with an aging population, NAFLD-related liver disease and mortality will increase
      in the United States. Strategies to slow the growth of NAFLD cases and
      therapeutic options are necessary to mitigate disease burden. (Hepatology

TI  - Taurine up-regulated gene 1 functions as a master regulator to coordinate
      glycolysis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 188-203
LID - 10.1002/hep.29462 [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference for
      aerobic glycolysis. The aerobic glycolytic phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) is often correlated with tumor progression and poorer clinical outcomes.
      However, the issue of whether glycolytic metabolism influences metastasis in HCC 
      remains unclear. In the current study, we showed that knockdown of taurine
      up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) induces marked inhibition of cell migration, invasion,
      and glycolysis through suppression of microRNA (miR)-455-3p. MiR-455-3p, which is
      transcriptionally repressed by p21, directly targets the 3' untranslated region
      of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase subunit beta 2 (AMPKbeta2).
      The TUG1/miR-455-3p/AMPKbeta2 axis regulates cell growth, metastasis, and
      glycolysis through regulation of hexokinase 2 (HK2). TUG1 is clearly associated
      with HK2 overexpression and unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSION:
      Our data collectively highlight that novel regulatory associations among TUG1,
      miR-455-3p, AMPKbeta2, and HK2 are an important determinant of glycolytic
      metabolism and metastasis in HCC cells and support the potential utility of
      targeting TUG1/HK2 as a therapeutic strategy for HCC. (Hepatology

TI  - Oncostatin M causes liver fibrosis by regulating cooperation between hepatic
      stellate cells and macrophages in mice.
PG  - 296-312
LID - 10.1002/hep.29421 [doi]
AB  - Fibrosis is an important wound-healing process in injured tissues, but excessive 
      fibrosis is often observed in patients with chronic inflammation. Although
      oncostatin M (OSM) has been reported to play crucial roles for recovery from
      acute liver injury by inducing tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1)
      expression, the role of OSM in chronic liver injury (CLI) is yet to be
      elucidated. Here, we show that OSM exerts powerful fibrogenic activity by
      regulating macrophage activation during CLI. Genetic ablation of the OSM gene
      alleviated fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic hepatitis. Conversely, continuous
      expression of OSM in a normal mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection
      (HTVi) induced severe fibrosis without necrotic damage of hepatocytes, indicating
      that OSM is involved in the fundamental process of liver fibrosis (LF) after
      hepatitis. In a primary coculture of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic
      macrophages (HMs), OSM up-regulated the expression of fibrogenic factors, such as
      transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor in HMs, while 
      inducing Timp1 expression in HSCs, suggesting the synergistic roles of OSM for
      collagen deposition in the liver. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses
      using OSM-HTVi and OSM knockout mice have revealed that bone-marrow-derived
      monocyte/macrophage are responsive to OSM for profibrotic activation.
      Furthermore, depletion or blocking of HMs by administration of clodronate
      liposome or chemokine inhibitor prevented OSM-induced fibrosis. CONCLUSION: OSM
      plays a crucial role in LF by coordinating the phenotypic change of HMs and HSCs.
      Our data suggest that OSM is a promising therapeutic target for LF. (Hepatology
      2018;67:296-312).

TI  - The contribution of health risk behaviors to excess mortality in American adults 
      with chronic hepatitis C: A population cohort-study.
PG  - 97-107
LID - 10.1002/hep.29419 [doi]
AB  - In resource-rich countries, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is associated
      with a sizeable excess mortality risk. The extent to which this is due to (1) the
      biological sequelae of CHC infection versus (2) a high concomitant burden of
      health risk behaviors (HRBs) is unclear. We used data from the 1999-2010 U.S.
      National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES), which include
      detailed information on HRBs and CHC infection status. We calculated the
      prevalence of the five major HRBs-alcohol use; cigarette smoking, physical
      inactivity, unhealthy diet, and illicit drug use-according to CHC after adjusting
      for sociodemographic differences. Mortality status after survey interview was
      ascertained by linkage to the U.S. National Death Index. To assess the
      contribution of HRBs to the excess mortality risk, we determined the all-cause
      mortality rate ratio (MRR) for individuals with CHC relative to individuals
      without, and then calculated the attenuation in this MRR following adjustment for
      HRBs. This analysis included 27,468 adult participants of NHANES of which 363
      tested positive for CHC. All HRBs were markedly more prevalent among individuals 
      with CHC versus individuals without. CHC was associated with a 2.4-fold higher
      mortality rate after adjustment for sociodemographic factors (MRR, 2.36; 95% CI, 
      1.60-3.49). Subsequent adjustment for all five HRBs attenuated this ratio by
      50.7% to MRR 1.67 (95% CI, 1.14-2.44). Higher levels of attenuation (69.1%) were 
      observed among individuals aged 45-70 years, who form the target demographic for 
      U.S. birth cohort screening. CONCLUSION: At least half the excess mortality risk 
      for individuals with CHC in the United States may be attributed to HRBs rather
      than CHC. The remedial response to hepatitis C must not neglect action on HRBs if
      it is to fully resolve the high mortality problem in this population. (Hepatology
      2018;67:97-107).

TI  - A functional characteristic of cysteine-rich protein 61: Modulation of
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells in liver inflammation.
PG  - 232-246
LID - 10.1002/hep.29418 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing awareness of the immunologic roles of liver mononuclear
      populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We took
      advantage of a large well-defined cohort of 148 patients with liver inflammation 
      and 45 healthy controls to focus on the qualitative and quantitative
      characteristics of MDSCs. We investigated the frequency, phenotype, and
      functional capacities of MDSCs by using peripheral blood MDSCs in a cohort of 55 
      patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 40 with autoimmune hepatitis, 39
      with chronic hepatitis B, 14 with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 45
      healthy controls. This was followed by a liver-targeted determination in 27
      patients with PBC, 27 with autoimmune hepatitis, 20 with chronic hepatitis B, 14 
      with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 6 controls. We then focused on
      mechanisms of this expansion with PBC as an example, using both ursodeoxycholic
      acid-naive and treated patients. HLA-DR(-/low) CD33(+) CD11b(+) CD14(+) CD15(-)
      monocytic MDSCs were elevated in diseases characterized by liver inflammation
      compared to healthy controls. Using PBC as a focus, there was a significant
      correlation between levels of circulating MDSCs and disease-related biochemical
      markers (alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin). We found higher amounts of MDSCs
      in patients with PBC who were responsive to ursodeoxycholic acid. MDSCs from PBC 
      were found to manifest a potent immunosuppressive function. There was a
      significant correlation in the accumulation of hepatic MDSCs in the inflamed
      lesions of PBC with histologic changes, such as fibrosis. We also found that
      cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1), a highly expressed protein in impaired
      cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, contributes to MDSC expansion and MDSC inducible 
      nitric oxide synthase-associated immune suppression. CONCLUSION: CCN1 modulates
      expansion and a suppressive function of MDSCs. Our data highlight the potential
      functions of CCN1 on MDSCs and suggest therapeutic implications in inflammatory
      liver diseases. (Hepatology HEPATOLOGY 2018;67:232-246).

TI  - Hepatocyte-derived exosomes promote T follicular regulatory cell expansion during
      hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 71-85
LID - 10.1002/hep.29409 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health concern that can cause severe liver
      disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Control of HCV requires 
      vigorous T-cell responses, yet CD4(+) T cells in chronic HCV patients are
      dysfunctional. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells are a subset of regulatory T
      cells that suppress T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and the generation of high
      affinity antibody-producing B cells. In this study, we examined the accumulation 
      of Tfr cells in the liver compartment during chronic HCV infection and defined
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their expansion. Our analysis
      revealed a substantial population of Tfr cells in livers of chronic HCV patients 
      that is absent in liver tissues from nonviral hepatitis or healthy subjects.
      Coculture of PBMCs from healthy subjects with HCV-infected hepatoma cells
      resulted in preferential expansion of circulating Tfr cells, leading to
      suppression of Tfh cells. Additionally, coculture of tonsillar cells with
      infected hepatoma cells lead to an expansion of germinal center Tfr. Notably,
      expansion was mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-containing
      exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes given that blockade of
      exosome-associated TGF-beta or inhibition of exosome release abrogated Tfr
      expansion. CONCLUSION: These results show that liver-derived exosomes play a

TI  - Recombinant covalently closed circular DNA of hepatitis B virus induces long-term
      viral persistence with chronic hepatitis in a mouse model.
PG  - 56-70
LID - 10.1002/hep.29406 [doi]
AB  - Covalently closed circular DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is critical for viral
      persistence in vivo. We recently reported a technique involving recombinant
      covalently closed circular DNA (rcccDNA) of HBV by site-specific DNA
      recombination. Using hydrodynamic injection, rcccDNA induces a temporarily
      prolonged HBV antigenemia in immunocompetent mice, similar to acute resolving HBV
      infection. In this study, we simulated the pathophysiological impact of chronic
      hepatitis to reproduce rcccDNA persistence in mouse models. We showed that
      rcccDNA achieved long-lasting persistence in the presence of a compromised immune
      response or when transcriptional activity was repressed. To closely mimic chronic
      hepatitis, we used a replication-defective recombinant adenoviral vector to
      deliver rcccDNA to the liver, which led to prominent HBV persistence throughout
      the experiment duration (>62 weeks) in transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase
      under the albumin promoter. A sustained necroinflammatory response and fibrosis
      were identified in mouse livers, with dysplastic lesions commonly seen during the
      late stage of viral persistence, analogous to the progressive pathology of
      clinical chronic hepatitis. CONCLUSION: rcccDNA was intrinsically stable in vivo,
      enabling long-term persistence in the context of chronic hepatitis, and viral
      persistence, in turn, may promote progression of chronic liver disease; our study
      also presented a surrogate model of HBV cccDNA persistence in mice that could
      advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B. (Hepatology
      2018;67:56-70).

TI  - Long noncoding RNA TSLNC8 is a tumor suppressor that inactivates the
      interleukin-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.
PG  - 171-187
LID - 10.1002/hep.29405 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs can serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in human cancer; 
      however, their biological functions and underlying mechanism in
      hepatocarcinogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we report a novel tumor
      suppressor long noncoding RNA on chromosome 8p12 (termed TSLNC8) that is
      frequently deleted and down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. 
      The loss of TSLNC8 is highly associated with the malignant features of HCC and
      serves as a prognostic indicator for HCC patients. TSLNC8 significantly
      suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.
      TSLNC8 exerts its tumor suppressive activity by competitively interacting with
      transketolase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and 
      modulating the STAT3-Tyr705 and STAT3-Ser727 phosphorylation levels and STAT3
      transcriptional activity, thus resulting in inactivation of the
      interleukin-6-STAT3 signaling pathway in HCC cells. CONCLUSION: TSLNC8 is a
      promising prognostic predictor for patients with HCC, and the
      TSLNC8-transketolase-STAT3 axis is a potential therapeutic target for HCC
      treatment. (Hepatology 2018;67:171-187).

TI  - An endogenous DNA adduct as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocarcinogenesis and
      its prevention by Theaphenon E in mice.
PG  - 159-170
LID - 10.1002/hep.29380 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related
      deaths worldwide, mainly because of its poor prognosis. A valid mechanism-based
      prognostic biomarker is urgently needed. gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)
      -propanodeoxyguanosine (gamma-OHPdG) is an endogenously formed mutagenic DNA
      adduct derived from lipid peroxidation. We examined the relationship of
      gamma-OHPdG with hepatocarcinogenesis in two animal models and its potential role
      as a prognostic biomarker for recurrence in HCC patients. Bioassays were
      conducted in xeroderma pigmentosum group A knockout mice and
      diethylnitrosamine-injected mice, both prone to HCC development. gamma-OHPdG
      levels in the livers of these animals were determined. The effects of antioxidant
      treatments on gamma-OHPdG and hepatocarcinogenesis were examined. Using two
      independent sets of HCC specimens from patients, we examined the relationship
      between gamma-OHPdG and survival or recurrence-free survival. gamma-OHPdG levels 
      in liver DNA showed an age-dependent increase and consistently correlated with
      HCC development in all three animal models. Theaphenon E treatment significantly 
      decreased gamma-OHPdG levels in the liver DNA of xeroderma pigmentosum group A
      knockout mice and remarkably reduced HCC incidence in these mice to 14% from 100%
      in the controls. It also effectively inhibited HCC development in the
      diethylnitrosamine-injected mice. Using clinical samples from two groups of
      patients, our study revealed that higher levels of gamma-OHPdG are strongly
      associated with low survival (P < 0.0001) and low recurrence-free survival (P =
      0.007). CONCLUSION: These results support gamma-OHPdG as a mechanism-based,
      biologically relevant biomarker for predicting the risk of HCC and its
      recurrence. (Hepatology 2018;67:159-170).

TI  - Efficacy and safety of new direct antiviral agents in hepatitis C virus-infected 
      patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
PG  - 48-55

AB  - The association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has 
      been demonstrated throughout the world. The new interferon-free direct antiviral 
      agents (DAAs) showed high efficacy and safety, and preliminary data seem to
      confirm their activity on low-grade NHL. The question arises as whether or
      not-and how-to treat the HCV-positive patients suffering from diffuse large
      B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). The aim of this observational study was to evaluate
      whether DAA antiviral treatment of DLBCL/HCV-infected patients in concomitance
      with chemotherapy is a safe and effective option. Twenty (13 males and 7 females)
      HCV genotype 1b-positive subjects, undergoing chemotherapy for DLBCL, were
      enrolled between June 2015 and December 2015. After informed consent, all
      patients underwent antiviral therapy (AVT) with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and
      chemotherapy (14 rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      prednisone and 6 cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) for 
      DLBCL. Complete hematological (Revised European-American Lymphoma classification,
      Ann Arbor, and International Prognostic Index [IPI] scores) and hepatological
      (viral markers, liver stiffness, and biochemical parameters) evaluations were
      made. A historical retrospective cohort of 101 DLBCL/HCV-positive patients not
      undergoing AVT was enrolled for comparison. DAA-treated and untreated patients
      were similar for sex distribution, IPI score, and NHL stage, and differed for age
      (older in treated), chemotherapy and use of AVT. Overall survival (OS) and
      disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated among a 52-week of follow-up. No
      statistical difference was found in OS after 52 weeks (P = 0.122), whereas a
      statistically significant higher DFS was achieved in treated patients (P =
      0.036). At the multivariate analysis, only IPI score and AVT were independently
      correlated with a better DFS. No differences in adverse events were reported.
      CONCLUSION: DAA treatment in concomitance with chemotherapy was shown to be safe 
      and effective in influencing remission of aggressive lymphomas in HCV patients.

TI  - Sex differences between parental pregnancy characteristics and nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease in adolescents.
PG  - 108-122
LID - 10.1002/hep.29347 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complex chronic liver disorder.
      Examination of parental pregnancy-related characteristics may provide insights
      into the origins of risk of NAFLD in offspring. We examined relationships between
      parental pregnancy-related characteristics and NAFLD in 1,170 adolescent
      offspring aged 17 years participating in the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine)
      Cohort Study. Fatty liver was diagnosed using liver ultrasound. NAFLD was
      diagnosed in 15.2% of adolescents at age 17 years. In univariate analysis,
      maternal factors associated with NAFLD in female offspring were younger maternal 
      age (P = 0.02), higher maternal prepregnancy BMI (P < 0.001), higher maternal
      weight gain by 18 weeks' gestation (P < 0.001), and maternal smoking during
      pregnancy (P = 0.04). Paternal age or body mass index (BMI) were not associated
      with NAFLD in female offspring. In contrast, higher paternal BMI (P < 0.001),
      maternal prepregnancy BMI (P < 0.001), and lower family socioeconomic status
      (SES) at time of birth (P = 0.001), but not parental age nor maternal gestational
      weight gain, were associated with NAFLD in male offspring. Using multivariate
      logistic regression, factors independently associated with NAFLD after adjusting 
      for obesity in adolescent females included maternal obesity (odds ratio [OR],
      3.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-8.05; P = 0.004) and maternal weight
      gain >/=6.0 kg by the 18th week of gestation (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15; P <
      0.001). In adolescent males, family SES at the time of birth (OR, 9.07; 95% CI,
      1.54-53.29; P = 0.02) remained significantly associated with NAFLD after
      multivariate modeling adjusted for adolescent obesity. CONCLUSION: Early-life
      contributors to NAFLD show considerable sexual dimorphism. Maternal obesity and
      higher early-mid gestational weight gain were associated with NAFLD in female
      offspring, whereas lower family SES at birth was associated with NAFLD in male
      offspring independent of adolescent obesity. (Hepatology 2018;67:108-122).

TI  - Hepatitis C virus reactivation in patients receiving cancer treatment: A
      prospective observational study.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1002/hep.29344 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation in patients receiving cancer treatment has
      been reported in retrospective studies. We sought to determine prospectively the 
      incidence, predictors, and clinical significance of HCV reactivation during
      cancer treatment. HCV-infected patients receiving cancer treatment at our
      institution between November 2012 and July 2016 were studied. Reactivation was
      defined as an increase in HCV-RNA >/=1 log10 IU/mL over baseline and hepatitis
      flare as an increase in alanine aminotransferase to >/=3 times the upper limit of
      normal. One hundred patients were studied, 50 with hematologic malignancies and
      50 with solid tumors. Reactivation occurred in 23 (23%) patients, including 18
      (36%) patients with hematologic malignancies and 5 (10%) patients with solid
      tumors. In univariate analysis, patients with reactivation were more likely than 
      those without reactivation to have prolonged lymphopenia (median, 95 versus 22
      days; P = 0.01) and to have received rituximab (44% versus 9%; P < 0.0001),
      bendamustine (22% versus 0%; P < 0.001), high-dose steroids (57% versus 21%; P = 
      0.001), or purine analogs (22% versus 5%; P = 0.02). Rituximab (odds ratio =
      9.52; P = 0.001), and high-dose steroids (odds ratio = 5.05; P = 0.01) retained
      significance in multivariable analysis. Of the 23 patients with reactivation, 10 
      (43%) had hepatitis flare. No patient with reactivation experienced liver failure
      or liver-related death within 36 weeks after initiation of cancer treatment.
      Fourteen patients with hepatitis flare, six of whom had reactivation, required
      discontinuation or dose reduction of cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: HCV
      reactivation occurred in 23% of HCV-infected patients receiving cancer treatment,
      and most had an unremarkable clinical course. However, reactivation can affect
      the cancer treatment plan. Our findings suggest that HCV infection should not
      contraindicate cancer therapy and infected patients should have access to
      multiple cancer treatments with close monitoring while receiving regimens
      associated with HCV reactivation. (Hepatology 2018;67:36-47).

TI  - The liver-gut microbiota axis modulates hepatotoxicity of tacrine in the rat.
PG  - 282-295
LID - 10.1002/hep.29327 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota possesses diverse metabolic activities, but its contribution
      toward heterogeneous toxicological responses is poorly understood. In this study,
      we investigated the role of the liver-gut microbiota axis in underpinning the
      hepatotoxicity of tacrine. We employed an integrated strategy combining
      pharmacokinetics, toxicology, metabonomics, genomics, and metagenomics to
      elucidate and validate the mechanism of tacrine-induced hepatotoxicity in Lister 
      hooded rats. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats demonstrated 3.3-fold higher
      systemic exposure to tacrine in strong responders that experienced transaminitis,
      revealing enhanced enterohepatic recycling of deglucuronidated tacrine in this
      subgroup, not attributable to variation in hepatic disposition gene expression.
      Metabonomic studies implicated variations in gut microbial activities that mapped
      onto tacrine-induced transaminitis. Metagenomics delineated greater
      deglucuronidation capabilities in strong responders, based on differential gut
      microbial composition (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterobacteriaceae) 
      and approximately 9% higher beta-glucuronidase gene abundance compared with
      nonresponders. In the validation study, coadministration with oral
      beta-glucuronidase derived from Escherichia coli and pretreatment with vancomycin
      and imipenem significantly modulated the susceptibility to tacrine-induced
      transaminitis in vivo. CONCLUSION: This study establishes pertinent gut microbial
      influences in modifying the hepatotoxicity of tacrine, providing insights for
      personalized medicine initiatives. (Hepatology 2018;67:282-295).

TI  - Improved posttransplant mortality after share 35 for liver transplantation.
PG  - 273-281

AB  - The Share 35 policy was implemented in June 2013 to improve equity in access to
      liver transplantation (LT) between patients with fulminant liver failure and
      those with cirrhosis and severe hepatic decompensation. The aim of this study was
      to assess post-LT outcomes after Share 35. Relevant donor, procurement, and
      recipient data were extracted from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
      Network/United Network for Organ Sharing database. All adult deceased donor LTs
      from January 1, 2010, to March 31, 2016, were included in the analysis. One-year 
      patient survival before and after Share 35 was assessed by multivariable Cox
      proportional hazards analysis, with adjustment for variables known to affect
      graft survival. Of 34,975 adult LT recipients, 16,472 (47.1%) were transplanted
      after the implementation of Share 35, of whom 4,599 (27.9%) had a Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score >/=35. One-year patient survival improved
      from 83.9% to 88.4% after Share 35 (P < 0.01) for patients with MELD >/=35. There
      was no significant impact on survival of patients with MELD <35 (P = 0.69).
      Quality of donor organs, as measured by a donor risk index without the regional
      share component, improved for patients with MELD >/=35 (P < 0.01) and worsened
      for patients with lower MELD (P < 0.01). In multivariable Cox regression
      analysis, Share 35 was associated with improved 1-year patient survival (hazard
      ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.80) in recipients with MELD >/=35.
      CONCLUSION: Share 35 has had a positive impact on survival after transplantation 
      in patients with MELD >/=35, without a reciprocal detriment in patients with
      lower acuity; this was in part a result of more favorable donor-recipient
      matching. (Hepatology 2018;67:273-281).

TI  - Assessment of biopsy-proven liver fibrosis by two-dimensional shear wave
      elastography: An individual patient data-based meta-analysis.
PG  - 260-272
LID - 10.1002/hep.29179 [doi]
AB  - Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) has proven to be efficient for
      the evaluation of liver fibrosis in small to moderate-sized clinical trials. We
      aimed at running a larger-scale meta-analysis of individual data. Centers which
      have worked with Aixplorer ultrasound equipment were contacted to share their
      data. Retrospective statistical analysis used direct and paired receiver
      operating characteristic and area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUROC) analyses, accounting for random effects. Data on both 2D-SWE and
      liver biopsy were available for 1,134 patients from 13 sites, as well as on
      successful transient elastography in 665 patients. Most patients had chronic
      hepatitis C (n = 379), hepatitis B (n = 400), or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (n = 156). AUROCs of 2D-SWE in patients with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were 86.3%, 90.6%, and 85.5% for diagnosing
      significant fibrosis and 92.9%, 95.5%, and 91.7% for diagnosing cirrhosis,
      respectively. The AUROC of 2D-SWE was 0.022-0.084 (95% confidence interval)
      larger than the AUROC of transient elastography for diagnosing significant
      fibrosis (P = 0.001) and 0.003-0.034 for diagnosing cirrhosis (P = 0.022) in all 
      patients. This difference was strongest in hepatitis B patients. CONCLUSION:
      2D-SWE has good to excellent performance for the noninvasive staging of liver
      fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B; further prospective studies are needed for
      head-to-head comparison between 2D-SWE and other imaging modalities to establish 
      disease-specific appropriate cutoff points for assessment of fibrosis stage.

TI  - Macrotrabecular-massive hepatocellular carcinoma: A distinctive histological
      subtype with clinical relevance.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29762 [doi]
AB  - We recently identified a novel histological subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma, 
      designated as "macrotrabecular-massive" (MTM-HCC) and associated with specific
      molecular features. In order to assess the clinical relevance of this novel
      variant, we aimed to investigate its prognostic value in two large series of
      patients with HCC treated either by surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA). We retrospectively included 237 HCC surgical samples and 284 HCC liver
      biopsies from patients treated by surgical resection and RFA, respectively.
      Histological slides were reviewed by pathologists specialized in liver disease,
      and the MTM-HCC subtype was defined by the presence of a predominant (>50%)
      macrotrabecular architecture (more than 6 cells thick). The main clinical and
      biological features were recorded at baseline. Clinical endpoints were early and 
      overall recurrence. The MTM-HCC subtype was identified in 12% of the whole cohort
      (16% of surgically resected samples, 8.5% of liver biopsy samples). It was
      associated at baseline with known poor prognostic factors (tumor size, AFP level,
      satellite nodules and vascular invasion). Multivariate analysis showed that
      MTM-HCC subtype was an independent predictor of early and overall recurrence
      (surgical series: OR 3.03 (1.38-6.65), p=0.006 and 2.76 (1.63-4.67), p<0.001);
      RFA series: 2.37 (1.36-4.13), p=0.002 and 2.19 (1.35-3.54), p=0.001,
      respectively). Its prognostic value was retained even after patients
      stratification according to common clinical, biological and pathological features
      of aggressiveness. No other baseline parameter was independently associated to
      recurrence in the RFA series. CONCLUSION: The MTM-HCC subtype, reliably observed 
      in 12% of patients eligible for a curative treatment, represents an aggressive
      form of HCC that may require more specific therapeutic strategies. This article

TI  - Outcomes after Multiple courses of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor and
      Growth Hormone in Decompensated Cirrhosis: Randomized Trial.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29763 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Decompensated cirrhosis carries a high mortality. Liver
      transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice; however, the limited
      availability of donor organs has resulted in high waitlist mortality. The present
      study investigated the impact of multiple courses of granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without growth hormone (GH) in these patients.
      METHODS: Sixty-five patients with decompensated cirrhosis were randomized to
      standard medical therapy (SMT) plus G-CSF 3 monthly plus GH daily (group A; n=23)
      or SMT plus G-CSF (group B; n=21) or SMT alone (group C; n=21). The primary
      outcome was the transplant free survival (TFS) at 12 months. The secondary
      outcomes were mobilization of CD34+ cells at day 6; the improvement in clinical
      scores, liver stiffness, nutrition, episodes of infection and quality of life
      (QOL) at 12 months. RESULTS: There was significantly better 12-month TFS in
      groups A and B than in group C (p=0.001). At day 6 of therapy, CD34+ cells
      increased in groups A and B compared to baseline (p<0.001). There was a
      significant decrease in clinical scores, improvement in nutrition, better control
      of ascites, reduction in liver stiffness, lesser infection episodes and
      improvement in QOL scores in groups A and B, at 12 months as compared to baseline
      (p<0.05). The therapies were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple courses of
      G-CSF improved 12-month TFS, mobilized hematopoietic stem cells, improved disease
      severity scores, nutrition, fibrosis, QOL scores, ascites control, reduced
      infections, and the need for LT in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
      However, the use of GH was not found to have any additional benefit.

TI  - Genomic Perturbations Reveal Distinct Regulatory Networks in Intrahepatic
      Cholangiocarcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29764 [doi]
AB  - Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) remains a highly heterogeneous malignancy 
      that has eluded effective patient stratification to date. The extent to which
      such heterogeneity can be influenced by individual driver mutations remains to be
      evaluated. Here, we analyzed genomic (whole-exome sequencing, targeted exome
      sequencing) and epigenomic data from 496 patients, and used the three most
      recurrently mutated genes to stratify patients (IDH, KRAS, TP53, 'undetermined').
      Using this molecular dissection approach, each subgroup was determined to possess
      unique mutational signature preferences, co-mutation profiles and enriched
      pathways. High-throughput drug repositioning in seven patient-matched cell lines,
      chosen to reflect the genetic alterations specific for each patient group,
      confirmed in silico predictions of subgroup-specific vulnerabilities linked to
      enriched pathways. Intriguingly, patients lacking all 3 mutations
      ('undetermined') harbored the most extensive structural alterations while IDH
      mutant tumors displayed the most extensive DNA methylome dysregulation,
      consistent with previous findings. CONCLUSION: Stratification of iCCA patients
      based on occurrence of mutations in three classifier genes (IDH, KRAS, TP53)
      revealed unique oncogenic programs (mutational, structural, epi-mutational) that 
      influence pharmacologic response in drug repositioning protocols. This genome
      dissection approach highlights the potential of individual mutations to induce
      extensive molecular heterogeneity and could facilitate advancement of therapeutic
      response in this dismal disease. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Dual ablation of beta- and gamma-catenin: Critical regulators of junctions and
      their functions.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29761 [doi]
AB  - The duality of beta- and gamma-catenin during liver injury has not been defined. 
      It's well known that loss of beta-catenin plays a critical role in overall liver 
      health and is a major component of adherens junctions (AJ). Further,
      gamma-catenin has been shown to regulate beta-catenin and vice-versa. In this
      excellent manuscript, the authors investigated the effects of knocking out both
      beta- and gamma-catenin creating a beta-;gamma-catenin-double knockout (DKO). The
      result of this interbreeding revealed a model that is reminiscent of early
      childhood cholestatic liver diseases (CLD) like Progressive Familial Intrahepatic
      Cholestasis (PFIC). The authors provide both in vivo and in vitro data to
      demonstrate the important role of these catenin genes in the regulation of
      hepatocyte-junctions. The experiments show partially redundant function of
      catenin's at hepatocyte AJ in regulating tight junctions (TJ) and contributing to
      a disrupted blood-bile barrier. Further, concomitant hepatic loss of beta- and
      gamma-catenin disrupts structural and functional integrity of AJ and TJ via
      transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. Overall, these studies shed
      important light on junctional protein dysregulation during CLD. This article is

TI  - Patient Reported Outcomes in Cirrhosis: A Scoping Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29756 [doi]
AB  - Patients with cirrhosis seek improvement in their symptoms, functioning, quality 
      of life, and satisfaction with the care they receive. However, these patient
      reported outcomes (PROs) are not routinely measured for clinical care, research, 
      or quality improvement. The members of the American Association for the Study of 
      Liver Disease Practice Metrics Committee, charged with developing quality
      indicators for clinical practice, performed a scoping review of PROs in
      cirrhosis. The aim is to synthesize a comprehensive set of PROs for inclusion
      into a standard patient-centered outcome set. We searched Medline, EMBASE,
      CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Trial Library since inception, with final
      searches run between 4/20/2017-6/1/2017. Studies were included if they reported
      the construction and/or validation of a PRO instrument for patients with
      cirrhosis or if they assessed the clinical (case mix) variables determining
      responses to established PRO scales.). Eleven studies were selected that yielded 
      259 items specific to patients with cirrhosis. After removing duplicates, 152
      unique items were isolated. These items were consolidated into 7 domains:
      physical symptoms, physical function, mental health, general function, cognition,
      social life, and satisfaction with care. The 7 domains included 52 sub-domains
      (e.g.,physical domain; abdominal pain subdomain). Twelve variables were
      identified that independently modified established PRO scales. These included
      clinical factors (severity of liver disease and its complications, medication
      burden, and comorbidities), specific PROs (cramps, pruritis), and surrogate
      outcome measures (falls, hospitalization). CONCLUSION: This scoping review
      identified and categorized a large existing set of PRO concepts that matter to
      patients with cirrhosis. These outcomes may now be translated into usable
      measures for both the assessment of the quality of cirrhosis care in clinical
      practice and to perform research from the patient's perspective. This article is

TI  - Liver-specific deficiency of unc-51 like kinase 1 and 2 protects mice from
      acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29759 [doi]
AB  - The unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 and 2 (Ulk1/2) regulate autophagy
      initiation under various stress conditions. However, the physiology functions of 
      these Ser/Thr kinases are not well-characterized. Here, we show that mice with
      liver-specific double knockout of Ulk1 and Ulk2 (Ulk1/2 LDKO) are viable but
      exhibit overt hepatomegaly phenotype. Surprisingly, Ulk1/2 LDKO mice display
      normal autophagic activity in hepatocytes upon overnight fasting but are strongly
      resistant to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. Further studies revealed 
      that Ulk1/2 are also dispensable for APAP-induced autophagy process, but are
      essential for the maximum activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling
      both in vivo and in isolated primary hepatocytes during APAP treatment.
      Mechanistically, APAP-induced inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin
      complex 1 (mTORC1) releases Ulk1 from an inactive state. The activated Ulk1 then 
      directly phosphorylates and increases the kinase activity of mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinase 4 and 7 (MKK4/7), the upstream kinases and activator of
      JNK, and mediates APAP-induced liver injury. Ulk1-dependent phosphorylation of
      MKK7 was further confirmed by a context-dependent phosphorylation antibody.
      Moreover, the activation of JNK and APAP-induced cell death were markedly
      attenuated in Mkk4/7 double knockdown hepatocytes reconstituted with an
      Ulk1-unphosphorylatable mutant of MKK7 compared to those in cells rescued with
      wild-type MKK7. CONCLUSION: Together, these findings reveal an important role of 
      Ulk1/2 for APAP-induced JNK activation and liver injury, and understanding of
      this regulatory mechanism may offer us new strategies for prevention and
      treatment of human APAP hepatotoxicity. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Relationship between Genetic Variation at PPP1R3B and Liver Glycogen and
      Triglyceride Levels.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29751 [doi]
AB  - Genetic variation at rs4240624 on chromosome 8 is associated with an attenuated
      signal on hepatic computerized tomography (CT), which has been attributed to
      changes in hepatic fat. The closest coding gene to rs4240624, PPP1R3B, encodes a 
      protein that promotes hepatic glycogen synthesis. Here we performed studies to
      determine if the X-ray attenuation associated with rs4240624 is due to changes in
      hepatic glycogen or hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC). A sequence variant in
      complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs4240624, rs4841132, was genotyped in 
      the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), the Dallas Liver Study, and the Copenhagen Cohort
      (n=112,428) of whom 1,539 had non-viral liver disease. The minor A-allele of
      rs4841132 was associated with increased hepatic X-ray attenuation (n=1,572, P=4 x
      10(-5) ), but not with HTGC (n=2,674, P=0.58). Rs4841132-A was associated with
      modest, but significant elevations in serum ALT in the Copenhagen Cohort
      (P=3x10(-4) ) and the DHS (P=0.004), and with odds ratios for liver disease of
      1.13 (95% CI, 0.97-1.31) and 1.23 (1.01-1.51), respectively. Mice lacking PPP1R3B
      were deficient in hepatic glycogen, whereas HTGC was unchanged. Hepatic
      overexpression of PPP1R3B caused accumulation of hepatic glycogen and elevated
      plasma levels of ALT, but did not change HTGC. CONCLUSION: These observations are
      consistent with the notion that the minor allele of rs4841132 promotes a mild
      form of hepatic glycogenosis that is associated with hepatic injury. This article

TI  - Hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha drives nonalcoholic fatty liver progression by
      triggering hepatocyte release of histidine rich glycoprotein.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29754 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms underlying progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      are still incompletely characterized. Hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factors
      (HIFs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases but the
      actual role of HIF-2alpha in the evolution of NAFLD has never been investigated
      in detail. In this study, we show that HIF-2alpha is selectively overexpressed in
      the cytosol and the nuclei of hepatocytes in a very high percentage (> 90%) of
      liver biopsies from a cohort of NAFLD patients at different stage of the disease 
      evolution. Similar features were also observed in mice with steatohepatitis
      induced by feeding a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Experiments
      performed in mice carrying hepatocyte-specific deletion of HIF-2alpha and related
      control littermates fed with either choline-deficient L-amino acid-refined (CDAA)
      or MCD diets showed that HIF-2alpha deletion ameliorated the evolution of NAFLD
      by decreasing parenchymal injury, fatty liver, lobular inflammation and the
      development of liver fibrosis. The improvement in NAFLD progression in HIF-2alpha
      deficient mice was related to a selective down-regulation in the hepatocyte
      production of Histidine-Rich Glycoprotein (HRGP), recently proposed to sustain
      macrophage M1 polarization. In vitro experiments confirmed that the up-regulation
      of hepatocyte HRGP expression was hypoxia- and HIF-2alpha-dependent. Finally,
      analyses performed on specimens from NAFLD patients indicated that HRGP was
      overexpressed in all patients showing hepatocyte nuclear staining for HIF-2alpha 
      and revealed a significant positive correlation between HIF-2alpha and HRGP liver
      transcripts levels in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that
      hepatocyte HIF-2alpha activation is a key feature in both human and experimental 
      NAFLD and significantly contributes to the disease progression through the
      up-regulation of HRGP production. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls intrahepatic biliary network formation in
      zebrafish by regulating Notch activity.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29752 [doi]
AB  - Malformations of the intrahepatic biliary structure cause cholestasis, a liver
      pathology that corresponds to poor bile flow, which leads to inflammation,
      fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Although the specification of biliary epithelial cells
      (BECs) that line the bile ducts is fairly well understood, the molecular
      mechanisms underlying intrahepatic biliary morphogenesis remain largely unknown. 
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays multiple roles in liver biology; however, its
      role in intrahepatic biliary morphogenesis remains unclear. Using pharmacological
      and genetic tools that allow one to manipulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we
      show here that in zebrafish, both the suppression and overactivation of
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling impaired intrahepatic biliary morphogenesis.
      Hepatocytes, but not BECs, exhibited Wnt/beta-catenin activity, and the global
      suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling reduced Notch activity in BECs.
      Hepatocyte-specific suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling also reduced Notch 
      activity in BECs, indicating a cell non-autonomous role for Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling in regulating hepatic Notch activity. Reducing Notch activity to the
      same level as that observed in Wnt-suppressed livers also impaired biliary
      morphogenesis. Intriguingly, the expression of the Notch ligand genes, jag1b and 
      jag2b, in hepatocytes was reduced in Wnt-suppressed livers and enhanced in
      Wnt-overactivated livers, revealing their regulation by Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling. Importantly, restoring Notch activity rescued the biliary defects
      observed in Wnt-suppressed livers. CONCLUSION: Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cell
      non-autonomously controls Notch activity in BECs by regulating the expression of 
      Notch ligand genes in hepatocytes, thereby regulating biliary morphogenesis. This

TI  - Increased expression of GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 through gene
      amplification promotes liver cancer by directly inducing phosphatase of
      regenerating liver 3.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29750 [doi]
AB  - We identified that GATA zinc finger domain containing 1 (GATAD1), a
      transcriptional factor, was significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) through gene amplification. We demonstrated the critical role,
      molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications of GATAD1 as a novel oncogenic
      factor in HCC. We found that GATAD1 protein was expressed in 76.6% of primary
      HCCs (85/111) but silenced in normal liver tissues. Gene amplification of GATAD1 
      was positively correlated with its overexpression in primary HCCs (R = 0.629, P <
      0.0001). GATAD1 significantly increased cell proliferation, G1 -S cell cycle
      transition, and migration/invasion but suppressed apoptosis in liver cell lines
      and promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis in both xenograft and orthotopic
      mouse models. Mechanistically, GATAD1 induced the transcriptional expression of
      phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL3) by binding to its promoter identified 
      by RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analyses. PRL3 played an 
      oncogenic role in HCC. Knockdown of PRL3 blunted the tumorigenic effect of
      GATAD1. In addition, GATAD1 activated Akt signaling, evidenced by increased
      phosphorylation levels of total Akt, Akt1, Akt2, and Akt target glycogen synthase
      kinase 3beta, while knockdown of PRL3 abolished this effect of GATAD1. We further
      unveiled that PRL3 activated Akt signaling by dephosphorylating phosphatase and
      tensin homolog at tyrosine residue, thus reducing phosphatase and tensin homolog 
      protein. The PRL3 inhibitor
      5-[[5-bromo-2-[(2-bromophenyl)methoxy]phenyl]methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone
      significantly suppressed HCC growth by inhibiting Akt activation. Moreover, high 
      GATAD1 nuclear protein expression was associated with poor survival of HCC
      patients as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: GATAD1 plays a pivotal 
      oncogenic role in HCC by directly inducing PRL3 transcription to activate the Akt
      signaling pathway. GATAD1 may serve as an independent poor prognostic factor for 
      HCC patients. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Lipotoxicity induces hepatic protein inclusions through TBK1-mediated p62/SQSTM1 
      phosphorylation.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29742 [doi]
AB  - Obesity commonly leads to hepatic steatosis, which often provokes lipotoxic
      injuries to hepatocytes that cause non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH in 
      turn is associated with the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates that are
      composed of ubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitin adaptor p62/sequestosome 1
      (SQSTM1). The formation of p62 inclusions in hepatocytes is the critical marker
      that distinguishes simple fatty liver from NASH and predicts a poor prognostic
      outcome for subsequent liver carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism by 
      which lipotoxicity induces protein aggregation is currently unknown. Here we show
      that upon saturated fatty acid-induced lipotoxicity, Tank-binding protein kinase 
      1 (TBK1) is activated and phosphorylates p62. The TBK1-mediated p62
      phosphorylation is important for lipotoxicity-induced aggregation of
      ubiquitinated proteins and the formation of large protein inclusions in
      hepatocytes. In addition, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of
      interferon genes (STING), upstream regulators of TBK1, are involved in the
      lipotoxic activation of TBK1 and subsequent p62 phosphorylation in hepatocytes.
      Furthermore, TBK1 inhibition prevented formation of the ubiquitin-p62 aggregates,
      not only in cultured hepatocytes, but also in mouse models of obesity and NASH.
      These results suggest that lipotoxic activation of TBK1 and subsequent p62
      phosphorylation are critical steps in the NASH pathology of protein inclusion
      accumulation in hepatocytes. This mechanism can provide an explanation for how
      hypernutrition and obesity promote the development of severe liver pathologies,
      such as steatohepatitis and liver cancer, by facilitating the formation of p62
      inclusions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - 11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 deficiency or inhibition enhances hepatic
      myofibroblast activation in murine liver fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29734 [doi]
AB  - A hallmark of chronic liver injury is fibrosis, with accumulation of
      extracellular matrix orchestrated by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).
      Glucocorticoids limit HSC activation in vitro, and tissue glucocorticoid levels
      are amplified by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11betaHSD1). Although
      11betaHSD1 inhibitors have been developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      improve diet-induced fatty liver in various mouse models, effects on the
      progression and/or resolution of liver injury and consequent fibrosis have not
      been characterized. We have used the reversible carbon tetrachloride-induced
      model of hepatocyte injury and liver fibrosis to show that in two models of
      genetic 11betaHSD1 deficiency (global, Hsd11b1(-/-) , and hepatic
      myofibroblast-specific, Hsd11b1(fl/fl) /Pdgfrb-cre) 11betaHSD1 pharmacological
      inhibition in vivo exacerbates hepatic myofibroblast activation and liver
      fibrosis. In contrast, liver injury and fibrosis in hepatocyte-specific
      Hsd11b1(fl/fl) /albumin-cre mice did not differ from that of controls, ruling out
      11betaHSD1 deficiency in hepatocytes as the cause of the increased fibrosis. In
      primary HSC culture, glucocorticoids inhibited expression of the key profibrotic 
      genes Acta2 and Col1alpha1, an effect attenuated by the 11betaHSD1 inhibitor
      [4-(2-chlorophenyl-4-fluoro-1-piperidinyl][5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3-thienyl]-methano
      ne. HSCs from Hsd11b1(-/-) and Hsd11b1(fl/fl) /Pdgfrb-cre mice expressed higher
      levels of Acta2 and Col1alpha1 and were correspondingly more potently activated. 
      In vivo
      [4-(2-chlorophenyl-4-fluoro-1-piperidinyl][5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3-thienyl]-methano
      ne administration prior to chemical injury recapitulated findings in Hsd11b1(-/-)
      mice, including greater fibrosis. CONCLUSION: 11betaHSD1 deficiency enhances
      myofibroblast activation and promotes initial fibrosis following chemical liver
      injury; hence, the effects of 11betaHSD1 inhibitors on liver injury and repair
      are likely to be context-dependent and deserve careful scrutiny as these
      compounds are developed for chronic diseases including metabolic syndrome and
      dementia. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Extracellular vesicles from mice with alcoholic liver disease carry a distinct
      protein cargo and induce macrophage activation via Hsp90.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29732 [doi]
AB  - A salient feature of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is Kupffer cell (KC)
      activation and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages (Mo/MO). These
      key cellular events of ALD pathogenesis may be mediated by extracellular vesicles
      (EVs). EVs transfer biomaterials, including proteins and miRNAs, and have
      recently emerged as important effectors of intercellular communication. We
      hypothesized that circulating EVs from mice with ALD have a protein cargo
      characteristic of the disease and mediate biological effects by activating immune
      cells. The total number of circulating EVs was increased in mice with ALD
      (ALD-EV) compared to pair-fed controls (control-EV). Mass spectrometry analysis
      of circulating EVs revealed a distinct signature for proteins involved in
      inflammatory responses, cellular development and cellular movement between
      ALD-EVs and control-EVs. We also identified uniquely important proteins in
      ALD-EVs that were not present in control-EVs. When ALD-EVs were injected
      intravenously into alcohol-naive mice, we found evidence of uptake of ALD-EVs in 
      recipient livers in hepatocytes and MOs. Hepatocytes isolated from mice after
      transfer of ALD-EVs, but not control-EVs, showed increased MCP-1 mRNA and protein
      expression suggesting a biological effect of ALD-EVs. Compared to control-EV
      recipient mice, ALD-EV recipient mice had increased numbers of F4/80(hi)
      CD11b(lo) KCs and increased percentages of TNFalpha(+) IL-12/23(+)
      (inflammatory/M1) KCs and infiltrating monocytes (F4/80(int) CD11b(hi) ) while
      the percentage of CD206(+) CD163(+) (anti-inflammatory/M2) KCs was decreased. In 
      vitro, ALD-EVs increased TNFalpha and IL-1beta production in MO and reduced CD163
      and CD206 expression. We identified Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in ALD-EVs as
      the mediator of ALD-EV-induced MO activation. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates a
      specific protein signature of ALD-EVs and demonstrates a functional role of
      circulating EVs containing Hsp90 in mediating KC/MO activation in the liver. This

TI  - Chitinase 3-like-1 Promotes Intrahepatic Activation of Coagulation Through
      Induction of Tissue Factor in Mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29733 [doi]
AB  - Coagulation is a critical component in the progression of liver disease.
      Identification of key molecules involved in the intrahepatic activation of
      coagulation (IAOC) will be instrumental in the development of effective therapies
      against liver disease. Using a mouse model of concanavalin A (Con A)-induced
      hepatitis, in which IAOC plays an essential role in causing liver injury, we
      uncovered a previously unknown procoagulant function of chitinase 3 like 1
      (Chi3l1). Chi3l1 expression is dramatically elevated after Con A challenge, which
      is dependent on Con A-induced T cell activation, and the resulting IFN-gamma and 
      TNF-alpha productions. Compared to wild type mice, Chi3l1(-/-) mice show less
      IAOC, reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and attenuated liver injury.
      Reconstituting Chi3l1(-/-) mice with recombinant TF triggers IAOC and augments
      liver injury. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that Chi3l1, through induction of 
      TF via MAPK activation, promotes IAOC and tissue injury. This article is

TI  - Capicua suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by controlling ETV4-MMP1 
      axis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29738 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is developed by multiple steps accompanying
      progressive alterations of gene expression, which leads to increased cell
      proliferation and malignancy. Although environmental factors and intracellular
      signaling pathways that are critical for HCC progression have been identified,
      gene expression changes and the related genetic factors contributing to HCC
      pathogenesis are still insufficiently understood. In this study, we identify a
      transcriptional repressor Capicua/CIC as a suppressor of HCC progression and a
      potential therapeutic target. Expression of CIC is posttranscriptionally reduced 
      in HCC cells. CIC levels are correlated with survival rates in patients with HCC.
      CIC overexpression suppresses HCC cell proliferation and invasion, whereas loss
      of CIC exerts opposite effects in vivo as well as in vitro. The levels of PEA3
      group genes, the best-known CIC target genes, are correlated with lethality in
      patients with HCC. Among the PEA3 group genes, ETV4 is the most significantly
      upregulated gene in CIC-deficient HCC cells, consequently promoting HCC
      progression. Furthermore, ETV4 induces expression of MMP1, the MMP gene highly
      relevant to HCC progression, in HCC cells, and knockdown of MMP1 completely
      blocks the CIC deficiency-induced HCC cell proliferation and invasion.
      CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the CIC-ETV4-MMP1 axis is a novel
      regulatory module controlling HCC progression. This article is protected by

TI  - Nucleic acid polymer REP 2139 and nucleos(T)ide analogues act synergistically
      against chronic hepadnaviral infection in vivo in Pekin ducks.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29737 [doi]
AB  - Nucleic acid polymer (NAP) REP 2139 treatment was shown to block the release of
      viral surface antigen in duck HBV (DHBV)-infected ducks and in patients with
      chronic HBV or HBV/hepatitis D virus infection. In this preclinical study, a
      combination therapy consisting of REP 2139 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) was evaluated in vivo in the chronic DHBV infection
      model. DHBV-infected duck groups were treated as follows: normal saline
      (control); REP 2139 TDF; REP 2139 + TDF; and REP 2139 + TDF + ETV. After 4 weeks 
      of treatment, all animals were followed for 8 weeks. Serum DHBsAg and anti-DHBsAg
      antibodies were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and viremia by
      qPCR. Total viral DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) were quantified
      in autopsy liver samples by qPCR. Intrahepatic DHBsAg was assessed at the end of 
      follow-up by immunohistochemistry. On-treatment reduction of serum DHBsAg and
      viremia was more rapid when REP 2139 was combined with TDF or TDF and ETV, and,
      in contrast to TDF monotherapy, no viral rebound was observed after treatment
      cessation. Importantly, combination therapy resulted in a significant decrease in
      intrahepatic viral DNA (>3 log) and cccDNA (>2 log), which were tightly
      correlated with the clearance of DHBsAg in the liver. CONCLUSION: Synergistic
      antiviral effects were observed when REP 2139 was combined with TDF or TDF + ETV 
      leading to control of infection in blood and liver, associated with intrahepatic 
      viral surface antigen elimination that persisted after treatment withdrawal. Our 
      findings suggest the potential of developing such combination therapy for
      treatment of chronically infected patients in the absence of pegylated
      interferon. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Advance Care Planning (ACP) for specialists managing cirrhosis: a focus on
      patient-centered care.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29731 [doi]
AB  - Advance care planning (ACP) and goals of care designation (GCD) are being
      integrated into modern health care. In cirrhosis, uptake and adoption of these
      practices have been limited with physicians citing many perceived barriers and
      limitations. Recognizing the many tangible benefits of ACP and GCD processes in
      patients with life-limiting chronic diseases, the onus is on health practitioners
      to initiate and direct these conversations with their patients and surrogates.
      Drawing upon the literature and our experiences in palliative care and cirrhosis,
      we provide an actionable framework that can be readily implemented into a busy
      clinic setting by a practitioner. Conversation starters, visual aids, educational
      resources (for patients and practitioners), and videos of mock physician-patient 
      scenarios are presented and discussed. Importantly, we have customized each of
      these tools to meet the unique health care needs of patients with cirrhosis. The 
      inherent flexibility of our approach to ACP discussions and GCD can be further
      modified to accommodate practitioner preferences. CONCLUSION: In our clinics,
      this assemblage of "best practice tools" has been well received by patients and
      surrogates enabling us to increase the number of outpatients with cirrhosis who
      have actively contributed to their GCD prior to acute health events and are
      supported by well-informed surrogates. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Surveillance for Hepatobiliary Cancers in Patients with Primary Sclerosing
      Cholangitis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a risk factor for
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder carcinoma (GBCa). Surveillance for GBCa 
      is recommended, but the clinical utility of surveillance for other hepatobiliary 
      cancers (HBCa) in PSC, namely CCA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is unclear.
      We aimed to determine whether surveillance is associated with better survival
      after diagnosis of HBCa in patients with PSC. METHODS: Medical records of PSC
      patients seen at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1995-2015 were reviewed. Patients
      were included if they had >/=1 year of follow-up and developed HBCa. Patients
      were categorized according to their surveillance status (abdominal imaging and
      carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and alpha-fetoprotein). The primary endpoints were HBCa
      recurrence, HBCa-related death, and all-cause mortality. Overall survival was
      assessed by the Kaplan-Meier survival method. HBCa-related survival was assessed 
      using the competing risks regression model. Tests of significance were 2-tailed, 
      and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: From
      1995-2015, a total of 79 of 830 PSC patients were diagnosed with HBCa. Cumulative
      follow-up was 712 and 283 person-years pre- and post-HBCa diagnosis,
      respectively. Seventy-eight percent (54/79) developed CCA, 21% (17/79) HCC, 6%
      (5/79) GBCa, 3% (2/79) both CCA and HCC, and 1% (1/79) both HCC and GBCa.
      Fifty-one percent (40/79) were under surveillance and 49% (39/79) were not.
      Patients in the surveillance group had significantly higher 5-year overall
      survival (68% vs. 20%, respectively; p<0.001) and significantly lower 5-year
      probability of experiencing an HBCa-related adverse event (32% versus 75%,
      respectively; p<0.001), compared with the no-surveillance group. CONCLUSION: This
      study demonstrates that surveillance for HBCa significantly improves outcomes,
      including survival, in patients with PSC. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Diagnostic Modalities for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),
      Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and Associated Fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29721 [doi]
AB  - NAFLD is a spectrum comprised of isolated steatosis, NASH, advanced fibrosis, and
      cirrhosis. The majority of NAFLD subjects do not have NASH and don't carry a
      significant risk for adverse outcomes (cirrhosis and mortality). Globally, the
      prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%. In Asia, a gradient of high prevalence 
      rates to low rates are noted from urban to rural areas. Given the prevalence of
      NAFLD, the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD and NASH can be substantial.
      With increasing recognition as an important liver disease, the diagnosis of NASH 
      still requires a liver biopsy which is suboptimal. Although liver biopsy is the
      most accurate modality to diagnose and stage the severity of NASH, it suffers
      from being invasive, costly, associated with potential complications, and plagued
      with interobserver variability of individual pathologic features. A number of
      non-invasive modalities to diagnose NASH and stage liver fibrosis are being
      developed. These include predictive models (NAFLD fibrosis score) and serum
      biomarkers such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, (ELF). Other tests are based on
      radiologic techniques such as transient or MR elastography (MRE) which are used
      to estimate liver stiffness as a potential surrogate of hepatic fibrosis.
      Although a dynamic field of research, most of these diagnostic modalities have
      AUROC between 0.76 to 0.90% with MRE having the best predictive performance. In
      summary, developing accurate, safe and easily accessible non-invasive modalities 
      to accurately diagnose and monitor NASH and associated fibrosis is of utmost
      importance in clinical practice and clinical research. These tests are not only
      important to risk stratify subjects at the greatest risk for progressive liver
      disease but to serve as appropriate surrogate endpoints for therapeutic clinical 
      trials of NASH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transplanting HCV-positive livers into HCV-negative patients with preemptive
      antiviral treatment: A modeling study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29723 [doi]
AB  - Under current guidelines hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive livers are not
      transplanted into HCV-negative recipients because of adverse post-transplant
      outcomes associated with allograft HCV infection. However, HCV can now be cured
      post liver transplant (LT) using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with >90%
      success; therefore, HCV-negative patients on the liver transplant (LT) waiting
      list may benefit from accepting HCV-positive organs with preemptive treatment.
      Our objective was to evaluate if and in which HCV-negative patients the potential
      benefit of accepting an HCV-positive (i.e., viremic) organ outweighed the risks
      associated with HCV allograft infection. We developed a Markov-based mathematical
      model that simulated a virtual trial of HCV-negative patients on the LT waiting
      list to compare long-term outcomes in patients: 1) willing to accept any
      (HCV-negative or HCV-positive) liver versus 2) those willing to accept only
      HCV-negative livers. Patients receiving HCV-positive livers were treated
      preemptively with 12 weeks of DAA therapy and had a higher risk of graft failure 
      than those receiving HCV-negative livers. The model incorporated data from
      published studies and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We found that 
      accepting any liver regardless of HCV status versus accepting only HCV-negative
      livers resulted in an increase in life expectancy when MELD was >/= 20, and the
      benefit was highest at MELD 28 (0.172 additional life years). The magnitude of
      clinical benefit was greater in UNOS regions with higher HCV-positive donor organ
      rates, i.e. Regions 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that
      model outcomes were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Transplanting HCV-positive livers into
      HCV-negative patients with preemptive DAA therapy could improve patient survival 
      on the LT waiting list. Our analysis can help inform clinical trials and minimize
      patient harm. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fibrolamellar Carcinoma in the Carney Complex: PRKAR1A Loss Instead of the
      Classic DNAJB1-PRKACA Fusion.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29719 [doi]
AB  - Fibrolamellar carcinomas are characterized by activation of protein kinase A, a
      kinase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. PRKACA encodes a catalytic 
      subunit of protein kinase A and almost all fibrolamellar carcinomas have a
      heterozygous 400kb deletion that leads to the fusion of DNAJB1 and PRKACA. The
      resulting DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript is believed to activate protein kinase 
      A by dysregulation of the catalytic portion of the protein. In contrast, PRKAR1A 
      encodes one of the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A. We hypothesized that 
      loss of function of this regulatory unit could also lead to protein kinase A
      activation and thus to fibrolamellar carcinoma. Since PRKAR1A mutations underlie 
      the Carney complex, we searched for liver tumors in individuals with the Carney
      complex. We identified 3 individuals with fibrolamellar carcinomas and a personal
      history of the Carney complex. All 3 tumors displayed the typical morphology of
      fibrolamellar carcinoma and were positive for Arginase, CK7 and CD68. FISH was
      negative for PRKACA rearrangements. However, PRKAR1A sequencing identified
      pathogenic mutations in two of two cases with successful sequencing. In addition,
      all 3 cases were negative for PRKAR1A protein expression, consistent with
      inactivation of this key regulatory unit of Protein kinase A. We also identified 
      one additional fibrolamellar carcinoma in an individual without a documented
      history of the Carney Complex that was negative for PRKACA rearrangements but had
      loss of PRKAR1A protein expression as well as PRKAR1A mutations. In conclusion,
      fibrolamellar carcinoma can be part of the Carney complex. In this setting,
      fibrolamellar carcinomas have inactivating PRKAR1A mutations instead of the
      DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene found in sporadic fibrolamellar carcinomas, providing
      an alternate means for activation of protein kinase A. This article is protected

TI  - Current and Future Therapeutic Regimens for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
      (NAFLD) and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).
LID - 10.1002/hep.29724 [doi]
AB  - NASH/NAFLD is rapidly becoming one of top causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular
      carcinoma and indication for liver transplantation. Except for life style
      modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no other approved
      treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is hard to
      achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic
      conditions associated with NAFLD and has been shown to improve liver histology.
      In order to have approved regimens for treatment of NASH/NAFLD, a number of
      issues that must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most
      appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH
      (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening
      NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important
      to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. In this
      context, although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced stage of
      fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long term mortality. In contrast,
      there is significant data to suggest that stage of fibrosis is the only robust
      and independent predictor of liver-related mortality. In addition to the primary 
      endpoints, a number of important secondary endpoints, including non-invasive
      biomarkers, long term outcomes, and patient reported outcomes, must be
      considered. In 2017, a few phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of NASH are in
      progress. Additionally, a number of phase 2a and 2b clinical trials targeting
      different pathogenic pathways in NASH enriches the pipeline of emerging
      therapies. CONCLUSION: Over the next 5 years, some of these regimens are expected
      to provide potential new treatment options for patients with NASH/NAFLD. This

TI  - Significance and Mechanism of Androgen Receptor (AR) Overexpression and AR-mTOR
      Crosstalk in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29715 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a male-dominant cancer and androgen receptor
      (AR) has been linked to the pathogenesis of HCC. However, AR expression and its
      precise role in HCC remain controversial. Moreover, previous anti-androgen and
      -AR clinical trials in HCC failed to demonstrate clinical benefits. In this
      study, we found that AR is overexpressed in the nucleus of approximately 37% HCC 
      tumors, which is significantly associated with advanced disease stage and poor
      survival. AR overexpression in HCC cells markedly alters AR-dependent
      transcriptome, stimulates oncogenic growth and determines therapeutic response to
      enzalutamide, a second generation of AR antagonist. However, AR inhibition evokes
      feedback activation of AKT-mTOR signaling, a central regulator for cell growth
      and survival. On the other hand, mTOR promotes nuclear AR protein expression by
      restraining ubiquitin-dependent AR degradation and enhancing AR nuclear
      localization, providing a mechanistic explanation for nuclear AR overexpression
      in HCC. Finally, co-targeting AR and mTOR shows significant synergistic anti-HCC 
      activity and decreases tumor burden by inducing apoptosis in vivo. CONCLUSION:
      Nuclear AR overexpression is associated with the progression and prognosis of
      HCC. However, enzalutamide alone has limited therapeutic utility due to feedback 
      activation of AKT-mTOR pathway. Moreover, mTOR drives nuclear AR overexpression. 
      Co-targeting AR and mTOR is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC. This

TI  - Milder disease stage in patients with primary biliary cholangitis over a 44-year 
      period: A changing natural history.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29717 [doi]
AB  - Changes over time in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with
      primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) are poorly described. We sought to describe
      temporal trends in patient and disease characteristics over a 44-year period
      across a large international PBC cohort of 4805 patients diagnosed between 1970
      and 2014, from 17 centers across Europe and North America. Patients were divided 
      into five cohorts according to their year of diagnosis: 1970-1979 (n=143),
      1980-1989 (n=858), 1990-1999 (n=1754), 2000-2009 (n=1815), >/=2010 (n=235). Age
      at diagnosis, disease stage, response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and
      clinical outcomes were compared. Mean age at diagnosis increased incrementally by
      2-3 years per decade from 46.9+/-10.1 years in the 1970s to 57.0+/-12.1 years
      from 2010 onward (p<0.001). The female to male ratio (9:1) and anti-mitochondrial
      antibody positivity (90%) were not significantly variable. The proportion of
      patients presenting with mild biochemical disease (according to Rotterdam
      staging) increased from 41.3% in the 1970s to 72.2% in the 1990s (p<0.001), and
      remained relatively stable thereafter. Patients with a mild histological stage at
      diagnosis increased from 60.4% (1970-1989) to 76.5% (1990-2014) (p<0.001).
      Correspondingly, response to UDCA according to Paris-I criteria increased; 51.7% 
      in the 1970s and 70.5% in the 1990s (p<0.001). Recent decades were also
      characterized by lower decompensation rates (18.5% in the 1970s to 5.8% in the
      2000s, p<0.001) and higher 10-year transplant-free survival (48.4%, 68.7%, 79.7%,
      and 80.1% for each respective cohort, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Over the last
      decades, there is a pattern of PBC presentation consistent with an older age at
      diagnosis alongside reduced disease severity. The observed trends may be
      explained by an increase in routine testing of liver function and/or a changing
      environmental trigger. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - CD36 deficiency attenuates immune-mediated hepatitis in mice by modulating the
      proapoptotic effects of CXC chemokine ligand 10.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29716 [doi]
AB  - The scavenger receptor CD36 recognizes a diverse set of ligands and has been
      implicated in a wide variety of normal and pathological processes, including
      lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and phagocytosis. In particular,
      recent findings have demonstrated its crucial functions in sterile inflammation
      and tumor metastasis. However, the role of CD36 in immune-mediated hepatitis
      remains unclear. Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced liver injury is a well-established
      experimental T cell-mediated hepatitis. To understand the role of CD36 in
      hepatitis, we tested the susceptibility of CD36-deficient (CD36(-/-) ) mice to
      this model, evaluated by a liver enzyme test, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, histological analysis,
      mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration, and hepatic proinflammatory factor
      production. CD36(-/-) mice were less sensitive to ConA-induced hepatitis and had 
      a significantly lower number of liver MNCs (LMNCs), including CD4(+) cells,
      CD8(+) T cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, infiltrating
      macrophages, and neutrophils, as well as reduced expression of inflammatory
      mediators (tumor necrosis factor alpha, CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 10,
      interleukin (IL)-1alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and IL-6) compared with 
      controls. Notably, we used bone marrow chimeric mice to demonstrate that CD36
      expression on nonhematopoietic cells was required to drive ConA-induced liver
      injury. Furthermore, our data show that the CD36 receptor was essential for
      CXCL10-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and activation of IkappaB kinase, Akt, and
      Jun N-terminal kinase. Moreover, treatment of wild-type mice with genistein, a
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks CD36-Lyn signaling, attenuated ConA-induced
      liver injury and reduced the number of MNCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest
      that CD36 plays an important proinflammatory role in ConA-induced liver injury by
      promoting hepatic inflammation and mediating the proapoptotic effect of chemokine
      CXCL10, and therefore, may be a potential therapeutic target for immune-mediated 
      hepatitis. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Decellularized human placenta supports hepatic tissue and allows rescue in acute 
      liver failure.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29713 [doi]
AB  - Tissue engineering with scaffolds to form transplantable organs is of wide
      interest. Decellularized tissues have been tested for this purpose, although
      supplies of healthy donor tissues, vascular recellularization for perfusion, and 
      tissue homeostasis in engineered organs pose challenges. We hypothesized that
      decellularized human placenta will be suitable for tissue engineering. The
      universal availability and unique structures of placenta for accommodating
      tissue, including presence of embedded vessels, were major attractions. We found 
      decellularized placental vessels were reendothelialized by adjacent native cells 
      and bridged vessel defects in rats. In addition, implantation of liver fragments 
      containing all cell types successfully hepatized placenta with maintenance of
      albumin and urea synthesis, as well as hepatobiliary transport of (99m)
      Tc-mebrofenin, up to 3 days in vitro. After hepatized placenta containing
      autologous liver was transplanted into sheep, tissue units were well-perfused and
      self-assembled. Histological examination indicated transplanted tissue retained
      hepatic cord structures with characteristic hepatic organelles, such as gap
      junctions, and hepatic sinusoids lined by endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and
      other cell types. Hepatocytes in this neo-organ expressed albumin and contained
      glycogen. Moreover, transplantation of hepatized placenta containing autologous
      tissue rescued sheep in extended partial hepatectomy-induced acute liver failure.
      This rescue concerned amelioration of injury and induction of regeneration in
      native liver. The grafted hepatized placenta was intact with healthy tissue that 
      neither proliferated nor was otherwise altered. CONCLUSION: The unique anatomic
      structure and matrix of human placenta were effective for hepatic tissue
      engineering. This will advance applications ranging from biological studies, drug
      development, and toxicology to patient therapies. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Hepatitis C transmission from seropositive, nonviremic donors to non-hepatitis C 
      liver transplant recipients.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29704 [doi]
AB  - Breakthroughs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment and rising rates of
      intravenous drug use have led to an increase in the number of organ donors who
      are HCV antibody-positive but serum nucleic acid test (NAT)-negative. The risk of
      HCV transmission from the liver grafts of these donors to recipients is unknown. 
      To estimate the incidence of HCV transmission, we prospectively followed 26
      consecutive HCV antibody-negative (n = 25) or NAT-negative (n = 1) transplant
      recipients who received a liver graft from donors who were HCV antibody-positive 
      but serum NAT-negative between March 2016 and March 2017. HCV transmission was
      considered to have occurred if recipients exhibited a positive HCV PCR test by 3 
      months following transplantation. Drug overdose was listed as the cause of death 
      in 15 (60%) of the donors. One recipient died 18 days after transplantation from 
      primary graft nonfunction and was excluded. Of the remaining 25 recipients, HCV
      transmission occurred in 4 (16%), at a median follow-up of 11 months, all from
      donors who died of drug overdose. Three of these patients were treated with
      direct-acting antiviral therapy, with two achieving a sustained virologic
      response and one an end-of-treatment response. One patient with HCV transmission 
      died after a complicated postoperative course and did not receive antiviral
      therapy. CONCLUSION: In this prospective cohort of non-HCV liver recipients
      receiving grafts from HCV antibody-positive/NAT-negative donors, the incidence of
      HCV transmission was 16%, with the highest risk conferred by donors who died of
      drug overdose; given the availability of safe and highly effective antiviral
      therapies, use of such organs could be considered to expand the donor pool.

      hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals: An ERCHIVES study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29707 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have reported higher rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
      individuals treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, making
      definitive conclusions has been challenging due to the heterogeneous populations 
      and methodologies of these reports. We investigated whether DAA use is associated
      with higher rates of incident HCC compared to treatment with interferon-based
      regimens. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study using the
      Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES) database. In 
      a cohort of 17,836 persons, SVR was achieved by 66.6% and 96.2% of the IFN and
      DAA groups, respectively. Among all treated persons, the risk of HCC was not
      higher in the DAA group compared to the IFN group (HR 1.07; [95% CI: 0.55,
      2.08]). Among persons with cirrhosis who achieved SVR, neither the HCC incidence 
      rate nor HCC-free survival were significantly different in the DAA group compared
      to the IFN group (21.2 vs. 22.8 per 1000 person years; p=0.78; and log-rank
      p=0.17, respectively). Untreated persons with cirrhosis had a significantly
      higher HCC incidence rate (45.3 per 1000 person years) compared to those treated 
      with either IFN or DAAs (p=0.03). Both groups of treated persons had
      significantly lower probability of HCC development compared to untreated persons 
      (log-rank p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: DAA treatment is not associated with a higher
      risk of HCC in cirrhotics with chronic HCV infection in the short-term.
      Previously reported higher rates of HCC associated with DAA treatment may be
      explained by both the presence of relatively fewer baseline HCC risk factors in
      persons treated with IFN as well as selection bias, as DAA regimens were used to 
      treat persons at higher risk for developing HCC. This article is protected by

TI  - The RNA genome of hepatitis E virus robustly triggers antiviral interferon
      response.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29702 [doi]
AB  - The outcomes of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection are diverse, ranging from
      asymptomatic carrier, self-limiting acute infection, fulminant hepatitis to
      persistent infection. This is closely associated with the immunological status of
      the host. This study aims to understand the innate cellular immunity as the
      first-line defense mechanisms in response to HEV infection. Phosphorylation of
      STAT1, a hallmark of the activation of antiviral interferon (IFN) response, was
      observed in the liver tissues of majority of HEV infected patients, but not in
      the liver of uninfected individuals. In cultured cell lines and primary liver
      organoids, we found that HEV RNA genome potently induced IFN production and
      antiviral response. This mechanism is conserved among different HEV strains,
      including genotype 1, 3 and 7 as tested. Interestingly, the single-stranded HEV
      RNA (ssRNA) is sufficient to trigger the antiviral response, without requirement 
      of viral RNA synthesis and the generation of RNA replicative form or replicative 
      intermediate. Surprisingly, the m(7) G cap and poly A tail are not required,
      although both are the key features of HEV genome. Mechanistically, this antiviral
      response occurs in a RIG-I-, MDA5-, MAVS- and beta-catenin-independent, but IRF3 
      and IRF7-dependent manner. Furthermore, the integrity of the JAK-STAT pathway is 
      essentially required. In conclusion, HEV infection elicits an active IFN-related 
      antiviral response in vitro and in patients. It is triggered by the viral RNA and
      mediated by IRF3/7 and the JAK-STAT cascade. These findings have revealed new
      insights on HEV-host interactions and provided the basis for understanding the
      pathogenesis and outcome of HEV infection. This article is protected by

LID - 10.1002/hep.29691 [doi]
AB  - Yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a locoregional therapy (LRT)
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we present overall survival
      (OS) outcomes in a 1,000-patient cohort acquired over a 15-year period. Between
      December 1, 2003 and March 31, 2017, 1,000 patients with HCC were treated with
      TARE as part of a prospective cohort study. A comprehensive review of toxicity
      and survival outcomes was performed. Outcomes were stratified by baseline
      Child-Pugh (CP) class, United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and Barcelona
      Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging systems. Albumin and bilirubin laboratory
      toxicities were compared to baseline. OS outcomes were reported using censoring
      and intention-to-treat methodologies. All treatments were outpatient, with a
      median one treatment per patient. Five hundred six (51%) were CP A, 450 (45%) CP 
      B, and 44 (4%) CP C. Two hundred sixty-three (26%) patients were BCLC A, 152
      (15%) B, 541 (54%) C, and 44 (4%) D. Three hundred sixty-eight (37%) were UNOS
      T1/T2, 169 (17%) T3, 147 (15%) T4a, 223 (22%) T4b, and 93 (9%) N/M. In CP A
      patients, censored OS for BCLC A was 47.3 (confidence interval [CI], 39.5-80.3)
      months, BCLC B 25.0 (CI, 17.3-30.5) months, and BCLC C 15.0 (CI, 13.8-17.7)
      months. In CP B patients, censored OS for BCLC A was 27 (CI, 21-30.2) months,
      BCLC B 15.0 (CI, 12.3-19.0) months, and BCLC C 8.0 (CI, 6.8-9.5) months.
      Forty-nine (5%) and 110 (11%) patients developed grade 3/4 albumin and bilirubin 
      toxicities, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience with 1,000 patients
      over 15 years, we have made a decision to adopt TARE as the first-line
      transarterial LRT for patients with HCC. Our decision was informed by prospective
      data and incrementally reported demonstrating outcomes stratified by BCLC,
      applied as either neoadjuvant or definitive treatment. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Impact of Hepatitis C Virus Polymorphisms on Direct-Acting Antiviral Treatment
      Efficacy: Regulatory Analyses and Perspectives.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29693 [doi]
AB  - Several highly effective, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based
      regimens are available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. Despite impressive efficacy overall, a small proportion of patients in
      registrational trials experienced treatment failure, which in some cases was
      associated with the detection of HCV resistance-associated substitutions (RASs)
      at baseline. In this article, we describe methods and key findings from
      independent regulatory analyses investigating the impact of baseline NS3 Q80K and
      NS5A RASs on the efficacy of current FDA-approved regimens for patients with HCV 
      genotype (GT) 1 or GT3 infection. These analyses focused on clinical trials that 
      included patients who were previously naive to the DAA class(es) in their
      investigational regimen and characterized the impact of baseline RASs that were
      enriched in the viral population as natural or transmitted polymorphisms (i.e.,
      not drug-selected RASs). We used a consistent approach to optimize comparability 
      of results across different DAA regimens and patient populations, including the
      use of a 15% sensitivity cutoff for next generation sequencing results and
      standardized lists of NS5A RASs. These analyses confirmed that detection of NS3
      Q80K or NS5A baseline RASs was associated with reduced treatment efficacy for
      multiple DAA regimens, but their impact was often minimized with the use of an
      intensified treatment regimen, such as a longer treatment duration and/or
      addition of ribavirin. We discuss the drug resistance-related considerations that
      contributed to pretreatment resistance testing and treatment recommendations in
      drug labeling for FDA-approved DAA regimens. CONCLUSION: Independent regulatory
      analyses confirmed that baseline HCV RASs can reduce the efficacy of certain
      DAA-based regimens in selected patient groups. However, highly effective
      treatment options are available for patients with or without baseline RASs. This

TI  - Bleeding complications in acute liver failure.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29694 [doi]
AB  - In patients with acute liver failure (ALF), elevated prothrombin time and
      thrombocytopenia can fuel a perception of a bleeding tendency. However, the
      incidence, site, risk factors, and clinical significance of bleeding
      complications have not been quantified in a large cohort of patients with ALF. We
      studied 1,770 adult patients enrolled in the ALF Study Group Registry between
      1998 and 2016. Bleeding complications and blood component transfusions were
      collected for 7 days after admission. The relationship of bleeding complications 
      to 21-day mortality was assessed. Despite a median international normalized ratio
      of 2.7 and platelet count of 96 x 10(9) /L on admission, bleeding complications
      were observed in only 187 patients (11%), including 173 spontaneous and 22
      postprocedural bleeding episodes. Eighty-four percent of spontaneous bleeding
      episodes were from an upper gastrointestinal source and rarely resulted in red
      blood cell transfusion. Twenty patients experienced an intracranial bleed; half
      of these occurred spontaneously and half after intracranial pressure monitor
      placement, and this was the proximate cause of death in 20% and 50%,
      respectively. Bleeders and patients who received red blood cell transfusions were
      more acutely ill from extrahepatic organ system failure but not from
      hepatocellular failure. Consistent with this observation, bleeding complications 
      were associated with lower platelet counts but not higher international
      normalized ratio. Transfusion of any blood component was associated with nearly
      2-fold increased death or need for liver transplantation at day 21, but bleeding 
      complications were the proximate cause of death in only 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS:
      Despite a perceived bleeding diathesis, clinically significant bleeding is
      uncommon in patients with ALF; bleeding complications in patients with ALF are
      markers of severe systemic inflammation rather than of coagulopathy and so
      portend a poor prognosis. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Genetic diversity and worldwide distribution of the deltavirus genus: A study of 
      2,152 clinical strains.
PG  - 1826-1841
LID - 10.1002/hep.29574 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is responsible for the most severe form of acute and 
      chronic viral hepatitis. We previously proposed that the Deltavirus genus is
      composed of eight major clades. However, few sequences were available to confirm 
      this classification. Moreover, little is known about the structural and
      functional consequences of HDV variability. One practical consequence is the
      failure of most quantification assays to properly detect or quantify plasmatic
      HDV RNA. Between 2001 and 2014, 2,152 HDV strains were prospectively collected
      and genotyped in our reference laboratory by means of nucleotide sequencing and
      extensive phylogenetic analyses of a 400-nucleotide region of the genome (R0)
      from nucleotides 889 to 1289 encompassing the 3' end of the delta protein-coding 
      gene. In addition, the full-length genome sequence was generated for 116 strains 
      selected from the different clusters, allowing for in-depth characterization of
      the HDV genotypes and subgenotypes. This study confirms that the HDV genus is
      composed of eight genotypes (HDV-1 to HDV-8) defined by an intergenotype
      similarity >85% or >80%, according to the partial or full-length genome sequence,
      respectively. Furthermore, genotypes can be segregated into two to four
      subgenotypes, characterized by an intersubgenotype similarity >90% (>84% for
      HDV-1) over the whole genome sequence. Systematic analysis of genome and protein 
      sequences revealed highly conserved functional nucleotide and amino acid motifs
      and positions across all (sub)genotypes, indicating strong conservatory
      constraints on the structure and function of the genome and the protein.
      CONCLUSION: This study provides insight into the genetic diversity of HDV and a
      clear view of its geographical localization and allows speculation as to the
      worldwide spread of the virus, very likely from an initial African origin.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA:
      Implications for epigenetic therapy against chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 2066-2077
LID - 10.1002/hep.29479 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a significant public health burden
      worldwide. Although current therapeutics manage to control the disease
      progression, lifelong treatment and surveillance are required because drug
      resistance develops during treatment and reactivations frequently occur following
      medication cessation. Thus, the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma is
      decreased, but not eliminated. One major reason for failure of HBV treatment is
      the inability to eradicate or inactivate the viral covalently closed circular DNA
      (cccDNA), which is a stable episomal form of the viral genome decorated with host
      histones and nonhistone proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic 
      modifications of cccDNA contribute to viral replication and the outcome of
      chronic HBV infection. Here, we summarize current progress on HBV epigenetics
      research and the therapeutic implications for chronic HBV infection by learning
      from the epigenetic therapies for cancer and other viral diseases, which may open
      a new venue to cure chronic hepatitis B. (Hepatology 2017;66:2066-2077).

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic
      liver disease worldwide. Up to one third of individuals with NAFLD will develop
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with progression to
      cirrhosis and is rapidly becoming the leading indication for liver
      transplantation. Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized loss of
      skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function. It is observed in up to 60% of
      patients with end-stage liver disease and portends a poor prognosis. Recent
      studies have shown that sarcopenia is a novel risk factor for developing NAFLD.
      Pathophysiological mechanisms relating sarcopenia and NASH may include insulin
      resistance (IR) and increased inflammation. IR leads to accumulation of
      triglycerides in both muscle tissue and the liver. It also exacerbates
      proteolysis and leads to muscle depletion. Chronic inflammation leads to liver
      injury and progression of fibrosis. The inflammatory milieu also stimulates
      protein catabolism. Viewing skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ that secretes
      various salutary myokines may help us understand its role in the development of
      steatosis. A better understanding of the pathophysiology will aid in developing
      physical and pharmacological therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will
      explore the complex inter-relationships between sarcopenia and NASH. We will
      discuss the impact of sarcopenia in patients with NASH and therapeutic options
      for the management of sarcopenia. (Hepatology 2017;66:2055-2065).

TI  - Modeling cost-effectiveness and health gains of a "universal" versus
      "prioritized" hepatitis C virus treatment policy in a real-life cohort.
PG  - 1814-1825
LID - 10.1002/hep.29399 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two alternative direct-acting antiviral
      (DAA) treatment policies in a real-life cohort of hepatitis C virus-infected
      patients: policy 1, "universal," treat all patients, regardless of fibrosis
      stage; policy 2, treat only "prioritized" patients, delay treatment of the
      remaining patients until reaching stage F3. A liver disease progression Markov
      model, which used a lifetime horizon and health care system perspective, was
      applied to the PITER cohort (representative of Italian hepatitis C virus-infected
      patients in care). Specifically, 8,125 patients naive to DAA treatment, without
      clinical, sociodemographic, or insurance restrictions, were used to evaluate the 
      policies' cost-effectiveness. The patients' age and fibrosis stage, assumed DAA
      treatment cost of euro15,000/patient, and the Italian liver disease costs were
      used to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of policy 1 versus policy 2. To generalize the
      results, a European scenario analysis was performed, resampling the study
      population, using the mean European country-specific health states costs and mean
      treatment cost of euro30,000. For the Italian base-case analysis, the
      cost-effective ICER obtained using policy 1 was euro8,775/QALY. ICERs remained
      cost-effective in 94%-97% of the 10,000 probabilistic simulations. For the
      European treatment scenario the ICER obtained using policy 1 was
      euro19,541.75/QALY. ICER was sensitive to variations in DAA costs, in the utility
      value of patients in fibrosis stages F0-F3 post-sustained virological response,
      and in the transition probabilities from F0 to F3. The ICERs decrease with
      decreasing DAA prices, becoming cost-saving for the base price (euro15,000)
      discounts of at least 75% applied in patients with F0-F2 fibrosis. CONCLUSION:
      Extending hepatitis C virus treatment to patients in any fibrosis stage improves 
      health outcomes and is cost-effective; cost-effectiveness significantly increases
      when lowering treatment prices in early fibrosis stages. (Hepatology

AB  - The interferon (IFN) lambda 3/4 (IFNL3/4) locus, influencing innate immunity
      regulation, has been associated with the severity of hepatitis and fibrosis
      progression during chronic hepatitis C infection, while contrasting results were 
      reported in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In this study, we examined whether 
      rs12979860 and the linked causal rs368234815 variant encoding for the alternative
      IFNL4 protein variant are associated with liver fibrosis and damage in a large
      multicenter cohort of patients at risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To
      clarify the mechanism, we also evaluated the impact on IFN-stimulated gene
      hepatic expression in a subset of patients. We considered 946 consecutive Italian
      individuals at risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with liver histology
      evaluated according to Kleiner. The rs368234815 TT>deltaG, rs12979860 C>T, and
      patatin-like phospholipase-3 rs738409 C>G polymorphisms were genotyped; and
      IFN-stimulated gene hepatic expression (n = 16) was tested by TaqMan assays. We
      found that the rs368234815 TT allele was independently associated with severe
      F3-F4 fibrosis (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.31; P = 0.005) 
      and with severe (grade 2-3) lobular necroinflammation (odds ratio, 1.47; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.14-1.88; P = 0.002). The impact of rs368234815 on liver
      damage was generally more marked in nonobese individuals, where association with 
      severe fibrosis, necroinflammation, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was observed
      (P < 0.05). IFN-stimulated genes were hypo-expressed in the liver of patients
      carrying the IFNL4 rs368234815 TT/TT genotype (P < 0.05). Similar results were
      observed when considering the rs12979860 polymorphism, which was in high linkage 
      disequilibrium with rs368234815 (R(2) = 0.87). CONCLUSION: The IFNL4 genotype is 
      associated with severity of fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients
      of European ancestry, likely by modulating the activation of innate immunity and 
      necroinflammation. (Hepatology 2017;66:1885-1893).

AB  - Inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) administered as single agents have
      resulted in durable tumor regression in advanced cancer patients. However, only a
      minority of cancer patients respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Here, we show
      that PD-1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor growth
      independently of adaptive immunity. Knockdown of PD-1 suppresses tumor growth,
      whereas PD-1 overexpression enhances tumorigenesis in immunodeficient xenografted
      mice. Mechanistically, PD-1 binds the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin
      effectors eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and ribosomal protein S6, thus
      promoting their phosphorylation. Moreover, combining mammalian target of
      rapamycin inhibition with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment results in more durable
      and synergistic tumor regression than either single agent alone, each of which
      presents only modest efficacy. CONCLUSION: Targeting mammalian target of
      rapamycin pathways in combination with PD-1 may result in increased antitumor
      efficacy in cancer patients. (Hepatology 2017;66:1920-1933).

TI  - Hepatocytes contribute to residual glucose production in a mouse model for
      glycogen storage disease type Ia.
PG  - 2042-2054
LID - 10.1002/hep.29389 [doi]
AB  - It is a long-standing enigma how glycogen storage disease (GSD) type I patients
      retain a limited capacity for endogenous glucose production despite the loss of
      glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Insight into the source of residual endogenous
      glucose production is of clinical importance given the risk of sudden death in
      these patients, but so far contradictory mechanisms have been proposed. We
      investigated glucose-6-phosphatase-independent endogenous glucose production in
      hepatocytes isolated from a liver-specific GSD Ia mouse model (L-G6pc(-/-) mice) 
      and performed real-time analysis of hepatic glucose fluxes and glycogen
      metabolism in L-G6pc(-/-) mice using state-of-the-art stable isotope
      methodologies. Here we show that G6pc-deficient hepatocytes are capable of
      producing glucose. In vivo analysis of hepatic glucose metabolism revealed that
      the hepatic glucokinase flux was decreased by 95% in L-G6pc(-/-) mice. It also
      showed increased glycogen phosphorylase flux in L-G6pc(-/-) mice, which is
      coupled to the release of free glucose through glycogen debranching. Although the
      ex vivo activities of debranching enzyme and lysosomal acid maltase, two major
      hepatic alpha-glucosidases, were unaltered in L-G6pc(-/-) mice, pharmacological
      inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity almost completely abolished residual
      glucose production by G6pc-deficient hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate
      that hepatocytes contribute to residual glucose production in GSD Ia. We show
      that alpha-glucosidase activity, i.e. glycogen debranching and/or lysosomal
      glycogen breakdown, contributes to residual glucose production by GSD Ia
      hepatocytes. A strong reduction in hepatic GCK flux in L-G6pc-/- mice furthermore
      limits the phosphorylation of free glucose synthesized by G6pc-deficient
      hepatocytes, allowing the release of glucose into the circulation. The almost
      complete abrogation of GCK flux in G6pc-deficient liver also explains the
      contradictory reports on residual glucose production in GSD Ia patients.

TI  - USP18 protects against hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance through its
      deubiquitinating activity.
PG  - 1866-1884
LID - 10.1002/hep.29375 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis,
      impaired insulin sensitivity, and chronic low-grade inflammation. However, the
      pathogenic mechanism of NAFLD is poorly understood, which hinders the exploration
      of possible treatments. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 18
      (USP18), a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, plays regulatory roles
      in NAFLD progression. Expression of USP18 was down-regulated in the livers of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced or
      genetically obese mice. When challenged with HFD, hepatocyte-specific USP18
      transgenic mice exhibited improved lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity,
      whereas mice knocked out of USP18 expression showed adverse trends regarding
      hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolic disorders. Furthermore, the concomitant
      inflammatory response was suppressed in USP18-hepatocyte-specific transgenic mice
      and promoted in USP18-hepatocyte-specific knockout mice treated with HFD.
      Mechanistically, hepatocyte USP18 ameliorates hepatic steatosis by interacting
      with and deubiquitinating transforming growth factorbeta-activated kinase 1
      (TAK1), which inhibits TAK1 activation and subsequently suppresses the downstream
      c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways. This is
      further validated by alleviated steatotic phenotypes and highly activated insulin
      signaling in HFD-fed USP18-hepatocyte-specific knockout mice administered a TAK1 
      inhibitor. The therapeutic effect of USP18 on NAFLD relies on its
      deubiquitinating activity because HFD-fed mice injected with active-site mutant
      USP18 failed to inhibit hepatic steatosis. CONCLUSION: USP18 associates with and

AB  - Despite effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C, deficiencies in diagnosis
      and access to care preclude disease elimination. Screening of baby boomers
      remains low. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of an electronic
      health record-based prompt on hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening rates in baby
      boomers in primary care and access to specialty care and treatment among those
      newly diagnosed. We implemented an electronic health record-based "best practice 
      advisory" (BPA) that prompted primary care providers to perform HCV screening for
      patients seen in primary care clinic (1) born between 1945 and 1965, (2) who
      lacked a prior diagnosis of HCV infection, and (3) who lacked prior documented
      anti-HCV testing. The BPA had associated educational materials, order set, and
      streamlined access to specialty care for newly diagnosed patients. Pre-BPA and
      post-BPA screening rates were compared, and care of newly diagnosed patients was 
      analyzed. In the 3 years prior to BPA implementation, 52,660 baby boomers were
      seen in primary care clinics and 28% were screened. HCV screening increased from 
      7.6% for patients with a primary care provider visit in the 6 months prior to BPA
      to 72% over the 1 year post-BPA. Of 53 newly diagnosed patients, all were
      referred for specialty care, 11 had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, 20 started
      treatment, and 9 achieved sustained virologic response thus far. CONCLUSION:
      Implementation of an electronic health record-based prompt increased HCV
      screening rates among baby boomers in primary care by 5-fold due to efficiency in
      determining needs for HCV screening and workflow design. Streamlined access to
      specialty care enabled patients with previously undiagnosed advanced disease to
      be cured. This intervention can be easily integrated into electronic health
      record systems to increase HCV diagnosis and linkage to care. (Hepatology

TI  - YAP suppresses gluconeogenic gene expression through PGC1alpha.
PG  - 2029-2041
LID - 10.1002/hep.29373 [doi]
AB  - Cell growth and proliferation are tightly coupled to metabolism, and dissecting
      the signaling molecules which link these processes is an important step toward
      understanding development, regeneration, and cancer. The transcriptional
      regulator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a key regulator of liver size,
      development, and function. We now show that YAP can also suppress gluconeogenic
      gene expression. Yap deletion in primary hepatocytes potentiates the
      gluconeogenic gene response to glucagon and dexamethasone, whereas constitutively
      active YAP suppresses it. The effects of YAP are mediated by the transcriptional 
      coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1. YAP
      inhibits its ability to bind to and activate transcription from the promoters of 
      its gluconeogenic targets, and the effects of YAP are blunted upon its knockdown.
      In vivo, constitutively active YAP lowers plasma glucose levels and increases
      liver size. CONCLUSION: YAP appears to reprogram cellular metabolism, diverting
      substrates away from the energy-consuming process of gluconeogenesis and toward
      the anabolic process of growth. (Hepatology 2017;66:2029-2041).

TI  - Chronic inflammation-elicited liver progenitor cell conversion to liver cancer
      stem cell with clinical significance.
PG  - 1934-1951
LID - 10.1002/hep.29372 [doi]
AB  - The substantial heterogeneity and hierarchical organization in liver cancer
      support the theory of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs). However, the relationship 
      between chronic hepatic inflammation and LCSC generation remains obscure. Here,
      we observed a close correlation between aggravated inflammation and liver
      progenitor cell (LPC) propagation in the cirrhotic liver of rats exposed to
      diethylnitrosamine. LPCs isolated from the rat cirrhotic liver initiated
      subcutaneous liver cancers in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
      mice, suggesting the malignant transformation of LPCs toward LCSCs.
      Interestingly, depletion of Kupffer cells in vivo attenuated the LCSC properties 
      of transformed LPCs and suppressed cytokeratin 19/Oval cell 6-positive tumor
      occurrence. Conversely, LPCs cocultured with macrophages exhibited enhanced LCSC 
      properties. We further demonstrated that macrophage-secreted tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha triggered chromosomal instability in LPCs through the deregulation
      of ubiquitin D and checkpoint kinase 2 and enhanced the self-renewal of LPCs
      through the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1/Src/signal transducer and activator 
      of transcription 3 pathway, which synergistically contributed to the conversion
      of LPCs to LCSCs. Clinical investigation revealed that cytokeratin 19/Oval cell
      6-positive liver cancer patients displayed a worse prognosis and exhibited
      superior response to sorafenib treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results not only
      clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
      inflammation-mediated LCSC generation but also provide a molecular classification
      for the individualized treatment of liver cancer. (Hepatology 2017;66:1934-1951).

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, and
      therapeutic agents for this malignancy are lacking. MicroRNAs play critical roles
      in carcinogenesis and present tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report
      that microRNA-206 is a robust tumor suppressor that plays important roles in the 
      development of HCC by regulating cell-cycle progression and the cMet signaling
      pathway. MicroRNA-206 was underexpressed in livers of two HCC mouse models, human
      individuals bearing HCC, and human HCC cell lines. Combining bioinformatic
      prediction and molecular and cellular approaches, we identified cMET (Met
      proto-oncogene), cyclin D1 (CCND1), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) as
      functional targets of microRNA-206. By inhibiting expression of cMET, CCND1, and 
      CDK6, microRNA-206 delayed cell-cycle progression, induced apoptosis, and
      impaired proliferation of three distinct human HCC cell lines. Systemic
      administration of microRNA-206 completely prevented HCC development in both cMyc 
      and V-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1/neuroblastoma RAS viral
      oncogene homolog (AKT/Ras) HCC mice, whereas 100% of control mice died from
      lethal tumor burdens. Conversely, reintroduction of cMet or Cdk6 into livers of
      cMyc and AKT/Ras HCC mice recovered growth of HCC inhibited by microRNA-206.
      These results strongly suggested that cMet and Cdk6 were two functional targets
      that mediated the inhibitory effect of microRNA-206 on the development of HCC.
      MicroRNA-206 overexpression demonstrated a profound therapeutic effect on HCC in 
      xenograft and cMyc HCC mice. CONCLUSION: In summary, this study defines a
      potentially critical role of microRNA-206 in preventing the growth of HCC and
      suggests its use as a potential therapeutic strategy for this malignancy.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications are important causes of morbidity and 
      mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). There is currently no
      preoperative risk-assessment tool that allows physicians to estimate the risk for
      CVD events following OLT. We sought to develop a point-based prediction model
      (risk score) for CVD complications after OLT, the Cardiovascular Risk in
      Orthotopic Liver Transplantation risk score, among a cohort of 1,024 consecutive 
      patients aged 18-75 years who underwent first OLT in a tertiary-care teaching
      hospital (2002-2011). The main outcome measures were major 1-year CVD
      complications, defined as death from a CVD cause or hospitalization for a major
      CVD event (myocardial infarction, revascularization, heart failure, atrial
      fibrillation, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and/or stroke). The bootstrap
      method yielded bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals for the regression
      coefficients of the final model. Among 1,024 first OLT recipients, major CVD
      complications occurred in 329 (32.1%). Variables selected for inclusion in the
      model (using model optimization strategies) included preoperative recipient age, 
      sex, race, employment status, education status, history of hepatocellular
      carcinoma, diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary or systemic
      hypertension, and respiratory failure. The discriminative performance of the
      point-based score (C statistic = 0.78, bias-corrected C statistic = 0.77) was
      superior to other published risk models for postoperative CVD morbidity and
      mortality, and it had appropriate calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.33).
      CONCLUSION: The point-based risk score can identify patients at risk for CVD
      complications after OLT surgery (available at www.carolt.us); this score may be
      useful for identification of candidates for further risk stratification or other 
      management strategies to improve CVD outcomes after OLT. (Hepatology

TI  - Expanding the Baveno VI criteria for the screening of varices in patients with
      compensated advanced chronic liver disease.
PG  - 1980-1988
LID - 10.1002/hep.29363 [doi]
AB  - Patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) can safely avoid
      screening endoscopy with a platelet count >150 x 10(9) cells/L and a liver
      stiffness measurement (LSM) <20 kPa (Baveno VI criteria). However, the total
      number of avoided endoscopies using this rule is relatively low. We aimed at
      expanding the Baveno VI criteria and validating them in additional cohorts.
      Patients from the Anticipate cohort (499 patients with cACLD of different
      etiologies) were used to study the performance of different thresholds of
      platelets and LSM for the identification of patients at very low risk (<5%) of
      having varices needing treatment (VNT). The new criteria (Expanded-Baveno VI)
      were validated in two additional cohorts from London (309 patients) and Barcelona
      (117 patients). The performance of the new criteria by etiology of cACLD was also
      assessed. The best new expanded classification rule was platelet count >110 x
      10(9) cells/L and LSM <25 kPa. This was validated in the two additional cohorts. 
      Overall, the Expanded-Baveno VI criteria would potentially spare 367 (40%)
      endoscopies (21% with Baveno VI criteria) with a risk of missing VNT of 1.6% (95%
      confidence interval, 0.7%-3.5%) in patients within the criteria and 0.6% (95%
      confidence interval, 0.3%-1.4%) in the overall population of 925 patients
      evaluated. The Expanded-Baveno VI criteria performed well in patients with cACLD 
      with hepatitis C virus and alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
      CONCLUSION: The new Expanded-Baveno VI criteria spare more endoscopies than the
      original criteria with a minimal risk of missing VNT in most of the main
      etiologies of cACLD. (Hepatology 2017;66:1980-1988).

      treatment failure.
PG  - 1794-1804
LID - 10.1002/hep.29358 [doi]
AB  - People with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have failed treatment with an
      all-oral regimen represent a challenging treatment population. The present
      studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of grazoprevir, ruzasvir, and
      uprifosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, in participants who had failed an NS5A
      inhibitor-containing regimen. C-SURGE (PN-3682-021) and C-CREST Part C
      (PN-3682-011 and -012) were open-label, multicenter studies. Participants who had
      previously relapsed following an NS5A inhibitor-containing all-oral regimen were 
      retreated with grazoprevir 100 mg, ruzasvir 60 mg, and uprifosbuvir 450 mg alone 
      for 24 weeks or with ribavirin for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      sustained virologic response (HCV RNA below the limit of quantitation [<15
      IU/mL]) 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12). In C-SURGE, SVR12 was
      achieved by 49/49 (100%) and 43/44 (98%) genotype (GT)1 participants in the
      24-week no ribavirin arm and the 16-week plus ribavirin arm (lost to follow-up, n
      = 1), respectively. In C-CREST Part C, SVR12 was achieved by 23/24 (96%)
      participants treated for 16 weeks with ribavirin (GT1, 2/2 [100%]; GT2, 13/14
      [93%]; GT3, 8/8 [100%]). One participant with GT2 infection discontinued study
      medication after a single dose of grazoprevir, ruzasvir, and uprifosbuvir plus
      ribavirin due to serious adverse events of vomiting and tachycardia. The presence
      of baseline resistance-associated substitutions had no impact on SVR12. No
      participant who completed treatment in either study experienced virologic
      failure. CONCLUSION: Grazoprevir, ruzasvir, and uprifosbuvir, with or without
      ribavirin, for 16 or 24 weeks was safe and highly effective in participants with 
      HCV infection who had previously failed NS5A inhibitor-containing therapy.

TI  - Hepatitis B virus evades innate immunity of hepatocytes but activates cytokine
      production by macrophages.

LID - 10.1002/hep.29348 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects hepatocytes specifically and causes
      immune-mediated liver damage. How HBV interacts with the innate immunity at the
      early phase of infection, either with hepatocytes or other cells in the liver,
      remains controversial. To address this question, we utilized various human
      cell-culture models and humanized Alb-uPA/SCID mice. All these models were unable
      to mount an interferon (IFN) response despite robust HBV replication. To
      elucidate the mechanisms involved in the lack of IFN response, we examined
      whether HBV actively inhibits innate immune functions of hepatocytes. By treating
      HBV-infected cells with known inducers of the IFN signaling pathway, we observed 
      no alteration of either sensing or downstream IFN response by HBV. We showed that
      the DNA innate sensing pathways are poorly active in hepatocytes, consistent with
      muted innate immune recognition of HBV. Upon exposure to high-level HBV, human
      macrophages could be activated with increased inflammatory cytokine expressions. 
      CONCLUSION: HBV behaves like a "stealth" virus and is not sensed by, nor actively
      interferes with, the intrinsic innate immunity of infected hepatocytes.
      Macrophages are capable of sensing HBV, but require exposure to high HBV titers, 
      potentially explaining the long "window period" during acute infection and HBV's 
      propensity to chronic infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:1779-1793).

TI  - Hepatitis C virus-induced tumor-initiating cancer stem-like cells activate
      stromal fibroblasts in a xenograft tumor model.
PG  - 1766-1778

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often causes persistent infection and is an increasingly 
      important factor in the etiology of fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular
      carcinoma, although the mechanisms for the disease processes remain unclear. We
      have shown previously that HCV infection generates an epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition state and tumor-initiating cancer stem-like cells in human
      hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated whether HCV-induced tumor-initiating 
      cancer stem-like cells when implanted into mice activate stromal fibroblasts. A
      number of fibroblast activation markers, including matrix metalloproteinase 2,
      were significantly increased at the mRNA or protein level in the xenograft
      tumors, suggesting the presence of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Fibroblast
      activation markers of murine origin were specifically increased in tumor,
      suggesting that fibroblasts migrate to form stroma. Next, we demonstrated that
      conditioned medium from HCV-infected human hepatocytes activates fibrosis-related
      markers in hepatic stellate cells. We further observed that these HCV-infected
      hepatocytes express transforming growth factor beta, which activates stromal
      fibroblast markers. Subsequent analysis suggested that anti-transforming growth
      factor beta neutralizing antibody, when incubated with conditioned medium from
      HCV-infected hepatocytes, inhibits fibrosis marker activation in primary human
      hepatic stellate cells. CONCLUSION: HCV-infected hepatocytes induce local
      fibroblast activation by secretion of transforming growth factor beta, and a
      preneoplastic or tumor state of the hepatocytes influences the network for the
      tumor-associated fibroblast environment. (Hepatology 2017;66:1766-1778).

TI  - Pericentral hepatocytes produce insulin-like growth factor-2 to promote liver
      regeneration during selected injuries in mice.
PG  - 2002-2015
LID - 10.1002/hep.29340 [doi]
AB  - Liver regeneration (LR) happens after various types of injuries. Unlike the
      well-studied LR caused by partial hepatectomy (PHx), there is accumulating
      evidence suggesting that LR during other injuries may result from unknown
      mechanisms. In this study, we found that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) was
      drastically induced following the liver injuries caused by tyrosinemia or
      long-term treatments of CCl4 . However, this was not observed during the early
      phase of acute liver injuries after PHx or single treatment of CCl4 . Remarkably,
      most IGF-2-expressing hepatocytes were located at the histological area around
      the central vein of the liver lobule after the liver injuries caused either in
      fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient mice or in CCl4 chronically treated mice.
      Hepatocyte proliferation in vivo was significantly promoted by induced IGF-2
      overexpression, which could be inhibited by adeno-associated virus-delivered
      IGF-2 short hairpin RNAs or linsitinib, an inhibitor of IGF-2 signaling.
      Proliferating hepatocytes in vivo responded to IGF-2 through both insulin
      receptor and IGF-1 receptor. IGF-2 also significantly promoted DNA synthesis of
      primary hepatocytes in vitro. More interestingly, the significantly induced IGF-2
      was also found to colocalize with glutamine synthetase in the region enriched
      with proliferating hepatocytes for the liver samples from patients with liver
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: IGF-2 is produced by pericentral hepatocytes to promote
      hepatocyte proliferation and repair tissue damage in the setting of chronic liver
      injury, which is distinct from the signaling that occurs post-PHx. (Hepatology
      2017;66:2002-2015).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29342 [doi]
AB  - The debate about the best approach to select patients with hepatocellular cancer 
      (HCC) waiting for liver transplantation (LT) is still ongoing. This study aims to
      identify the best variables allowing to discriminate between "high-" and
      "low-benefit" patients. To do so, the concept of intention-to-treat (ITT)
      survival benefit of LT has been created. Data of 2,103 adult HCC patients
      consecutively enlisted during the period 1987-2015 were analyzed. Three rigorous 
      statistical steps were used in order to create the ITT survival benefit of LT:
      the development of an ITT LT and a non-LT survival model, and the individual
      prediction of the ITT survival benefit of LT defined as the difference between
      the median ITT survival with (based on the first model) and without LT (based on 
      the second model) calculated for each enrolled patient. Four variables (Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease, alpha-fetoprotein, Milan-Criteria status, and
      radiological response) displayed a high effect in terms of delta benefit.
      According to these risk factors, four benefit groups were identified. Patients
      with three to four factors ("no-benefit group"; n = 405 of 2,103; 19.2%) had no
      benefit of LT compared to alternative treatments. Conversely, patients without
      any risk factor ("large-benefit group"; n = 108; 5.1%) yielded the highest
      benefit from LT reaching 60 months. CONCLUSION: The ITT transplant survival
      benefit presented here allows physicians to better select HCC patients waiting
      for LT. The obtained stratification may lead to an improved and more equitable
      method of organ allocation. Patients without benefit should be de-listed, whereas
      patients with large benefit ratio should be prioritized for LT. (Hepatology
      2017;66:1910-1919).

TI  - Argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1): A marker of unclassified hepatocellular
      adenoma and high bleeding risk.
PG  - 2016-2028
LID - 10.1002/hep.29336 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are rare benign tumors divided into three main
      subgroups defined by pathomolecular features, HNF1A (H-HCA), mutated beta-catenin
      (b-HCA), and inflammatory (IHCA). In the case of unclassified HCAs (UHCAs), which
      are currently identified by default, a high risk of bleeding remains a clinical
      issue. The objective of this study was to explore UHCA proteome with the aim to
      identify specific biomarkers. Following dissection of the tumoral (T) and
      nontumoral (NT) tissue on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HCA tissue sections
      using laser capture methodology, we performed mass spectrometry analysis to
      compare T and NT protein expression levels in H-HCA, IHCA, b-HCA, UHCA, and focal
      nodular hyperplasia. Using this methodology, we searched for proteins which are
      specifically deregulated in UHCA. We demonstrate that proteomic profiles allow
      for discriminating known HCA subtypes through identification of classical
      biomarkers in each HCA subgroup. We observed specific up-regulation of the
      arginine synthesis pathway associated with overexpression of argininosuccinate
      synthase (ASS1) and arginosuccinate lyase in UHCA. ASS1 immunohistochemistry
      identified all the UHCA, of which 64.7% presented clinical bleeding
      manifestations. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the significance of ASS1 was 
      not restricted to UHCA, but also encompassed certain hemorrhagic cases in other
      HCA subtypes, particularly IHCA. CONCLUSION: ASS1 + HCA combined with a typical
      hematoxylin and eosin stain aspect defined a new HCA subgroup at a high risk of
      bleeding. (Hepatology 2017;66:2016-2028).

TI  - Prospero-related homeobox 1 drives angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma
      through selectively activating interleukin-8 expression.
PG  - 1894-1909
LID - 10.1002/hep.29337 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis has been proven to play an important role in the progression of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism underlying HCC
      angiogenesis is not well understood. In this study, Prospero-related homeobox 1
      (PROX1) was identified as a novel proangiogenic factor in HCC cell lines and
      tissues. A strong positive correlation was found between the levels of PROX1 and 
      microvessel density in HCC tissues. Knockdown of PROX1 expression in HCC cells
      significantly inhibited the in vitro capillary tube formation by human vascular
      endothelial cells and in vivo angiogenesis of HCC, while overexpression of PROX1 
      in HCC cells induced the opposite effects. PROX1 and nuclear factor kappaB p65
      expression levels were positively correlated in both HCC tissues and cell lines. 
      PROX1 enhances the nuclear accumulation of p65 and stabilizes p65 by recruiting
      ubiquitin-specific protease 7 to prevent p65 ubiquitination. Consequently, PROX1 
      activated nuclear factor kappaB signaling and selectively promoted expression of 
      the proangiogenic interleukin-8 (IL-8) by epigenetically stimulating the IL-8
      promoter. Finally, progression of high PROX1 expression HCC in tumor xenograft
      mice could be effectively contained by an anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have identified PROX1 as a crucial promoter of HCC angiogenesis; 
      our study provides an insight into PROX1's function in HCC progression and the
      potential therapeutic application of anti-IL-8 antibody in high PROX1 expression 
      HCC patients. (Hepatology 2017;66:1894-1909).

TI  - Alcohol abstinence in patients surviving an episode of alcoholic hepatitis:
      Prediction and impact on long-term survival.
PG  - 1842-1853
LID - 10.1002/hep.29338 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is the most severe form of alcoholic liver disease. Most
      studies have focused on short-term prognosis, whereas factors associated with
      long-term survival are largely unknown. The aims of our study were to (1)
      determine the impact of complete abstinence from alcohol on long-term survival
      and (2) identify prognostic factors at admission capable of predicting abstinence
      during long-term follow-up in patients with AH. One hundred forty-two patients
      with biopsy-proven AH that survived the first episode were included. Demographic,
      psychiatric, and biochemical variables at admission and drinking status during
      follow-up were obtained. Cox regression, logistic regression, and classification 
      and regression trees (CART) analyses were used for statistical analysis. Overall 
      mortality was 38% with a median follow-up of 55 months. During follow-up,
      complete abstinence was reported in 39% and was associated with better long-term 
      survival (hazard ratio, 0.53; P = 0.03). After adjustment for baseline prognostic
      scoring systems (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and age, bilirubin,
      international normalized ratio, creatinine scores), complete abstinence was
      independently associated with survival (P < 0.05). Age and lack of past
      alcoholism treatments were independently associated with complete abstinence (P <
      0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively) during follow-up. CART analysis generated a
      simple and practical algorithm based on the combination of past alcoholism
      treatments and age. Using CART analysis, we stratified 2 subgroups of patients
      with high (65%) and low (26%-29%) rates of complete abstinence after an episode
      of AH. CONCLUSION: Complete abstinence after an episode of AH positively impacts 
      long-term survival. The combination of 2 variables easily obtained at admission
      might be useful to predict long-term abstinence after an episode of AH.
      Strategies aimed at promoting alcohol abstinence in these patients are necessary.

TI  - Hepatic stimulator substance resists hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by
      regulating Drp1 translocation and activation.
PG  - 1989-2001
LID - 10.1002/hep.29326 [doi]
AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury, induced by abnormal mitochondrial fission-related
      apoptosis, is a major concern in liver transplantation settings. Our previous
      studies have demonstrated that hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) is an
      antiapoptotic effector and could protect liver from ischemia/reperfusion injury. 
      However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we
      report that in vitro and in vivo HSS could regulate mitochondrial fission and
      hepatocyte apoptosis during liver ischemia/reperfusion injury by orchestrating
      the translocation and activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Using a
      mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced liver injury, we found that
      HSS-haploinsufficient (HSS(+/-) ) mice displayed exacerbated liver damage based
      on their increased serum aminotransferase levels, cell structural destruction,
      and apoptosis levels compared to wild-type (HSS(+/+) ) littermates. Disruption of
      HSS markedly increased cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and Bax expression,
      accompanied by elevated phosphorylated Drp1 and release of cytochrome c. In
      parallel in vitro studies, we found that HSS could inhibit the expression of CDK1
      and that HSS inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis through its suppression of CDK1/cyclin
      B-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-616 of Drp1, thereby decreasing Drp1
      accumulation in mitochondria and Drp1-mediated activation of the mitochondrial
      fission program. On the contrary, knockdown of HSS increased CDK1 as well as Drp1
      phosphorylation and aggravated hepatocellular apoptosis. Mechanistic
      investigation showed that HSS was able to reduce the stability and translation of
      CDK1 mRNA by modulating the expression of several microRNAs (miRs), including
      miR-410-3p, miR-490-3p, and miR-582-5p. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a novel
      mechanism for HSS in regulating the mitochondrial fission machinery and further
      suggest that modulation of HSS may provide a therapeutic approach for combating
      liver damage. (Hepatology 2017;66:1989-2001).

AB  - Nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) 
      are important regulators of bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Here, we
      show that global Fxr (-/-) Shp(-/-) double knockout (DKO) mice are refractory to 
      weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis when challenged with
      high-fat diet. DKO mice display an inherently increased capacity to burn fat and 
      suppress de novo hepatic lipid synthesis. Moreover, DKO mice were also very
      active and that correlated well with the observed increase in phosphoenolpyruvate
      carboxykinase expression, type IA fibers, and mitochondrial function in skeletal 
      muscle. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that liver-specific Shp deletion protects
      against fatty liver development by suppressing expression of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 and lipid-droplet protein fat-specific
      protein 27 beta. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Fxr and Shp inactivation may
      be beneficial to combat diet-induced obesity and uncover that hepatic SHP is
      necessary to promote fatty liver disease. (Hepatology 2017;66:1854-1865).

TI  - Fecal microbiota transplant from a rational stool donor improves hepatic
      encephalopathy: A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1727-1738
LID - 10.1002/hep.29306 [doi]
AB  - Recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a leading cause of readmission despite
      standard of care (SOC) associated with microbial dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) may improve dysbiosis; however, it has not been studied in 
      HE. We aimed to define whether FMT using a rationally derived stool donor is safe
      in recurrent HE compared to SOC alone. An open-label, randomized clinical trial
      with a 5-month follow-up in outpatient men with cirrhosis with recurrent HE on
      SOC was conducted with 1:1 randomization. FMT-randomized patients received 5 days
      of broad-spectrum antibiotic pretreatment, then a single FMT enema from the same 
      donor with the optimal microbiota deficient in HE. Follow-up occurred on days 5, 
      6, 12, 35, and 150 postrandomization. The primary outcome was safety of FMT
      compared to SOC using FMT-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary
      outcomes were adverse events, cognition, microbiota, and metabolomic changes.
      Participants in both arms were similar on all baseline criteria and were followed
      until study end. FMT with antibiotic pretreatment was well tolerated. Eight (80%)
      SOC participants had a total of 11 SAEs compared to 2 (20%) FMT participants with
      SAEs (both FMT unrelated; P = 0.02). Five SOC and no FMT participants developed
      further HE (P = 0.03). Cognition improved in the FMT, but not the SOC, group.
      Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score transiently worsened
      postantibiotics, but reverted to baseline post-FMT. Postantibiotics, beneficial
      taxa, and microbial diversity reduction occurred with Proteobacteria expansion.
      However, FMT increased diversity and beneficial taxa. SOC microbiota and MELD
      score remained similar throughout. CONCLUSION: FMT from a rationally selected
      donor reduced hospitalizations, improved cognition, and dysbiosis in cirrhosis
      with recurrent HE. (Hepatology 2017;66:1727-1738).

TI  - Polo-like-kinase 1 is a proviral host factor for hepatitis B virus replication.
PG  - 1750-1765
LID - 10.1002/hep.29236 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and current treatments for chronic hepatitis B and
      HCC are suboptimal. Herein, we identified cellular serine/threonine
      Polo-like-kinase 1 (PLK1) as a positive effector of HBV replication. The aim of
      this study was to demonstrate the proviral role of PLK1 in HBV biosynthesis and
      validate PLK1 inhibition a potential antiviral strategy. To this end, we employed
      physiologically relevant HBV infection models of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs)
      and differentiated HepaRG cells in conjunction with pharmacologic PLK1
      inhibitors, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, and overexpression 
      of constitutively active PLK1 (PLK1(CA) ). In addition, a humanized liver
      Fah(-/-) /Rag2(-/-) /Il2rg(-/-) (FRG) mouse model was used to determine the
      antiviral effect of PLK1 inhibitor BI-2536 on HBV infection in vivo. Finally, in 
      vitro PLK1 kinase assays and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to
      demonstrate that HBV core protein (HBc) is a PLK1 substrate. We demonstrated that
      HBV infection activated cellular PLK1 in PHHs and differentiated HepaRG cells.
      PLK1 inhibition by BI-2536 or siRNA-mediated knockdown suppressed HBV DNA
      biosynthesis, whereas overexpression of PLK1(CA) increased it, suggesting that
      the PLK1 effects on viral biosynthesis are specific and that PLK1 is a proviral
      cellular factor. Significantly, BI-2536 administration to HBV-infected humanized 
      liver FRG mice strongly inhibited HBV infection, validating PLK1 as an antiviral 
      target in vivo. The proviral action of PLK1 is associated with the biogenesis of 
      the nucleocapsid, as BI-2536 leads to its decreased intracellular
      formation/accumulation. In this respect, our studies identified HBc as a PLK1
      substrate in vitro, and mapped PLK1 phosphorylation sites on this protein.
      CONCLUSION: PLK1 is a proviral host factor that could be envisaged as a target
      for combined antiviral and antitumoral strategies against HBV infection and
      HBV-mediated carcinogenesis. (Hepatology 2017;66:1750-1765).

TI  - A novel quantitative microarray antibody capture assay identifies an extremely

      mongolians.

AB  - Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes the most severe form of human viral hepatitis.
      HDV requires a hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection to provide HDV with HBV
      surface antigen envelope proteins. The net effect of HDV is to make the
      underlying HBV disease worse, including higher rates of hepatocellular carcinoma.
      Accurate assessments of current HDV prevalence have been hampered by the lack of 
      readily available and reliable quantitative assays, combined with the absence of 
      a Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. We sought to develop a
      convenient assay for accurately screening populations and to use this assay to
      determine HDV prevalence in a population with abnormally high rates of
      hepatocellular carcinoma. We developed a high-throughput quantitative microarray 
      antibody capture assay for anti-HDV immunoglobulin G wherein recombinant HDV
      delta antigen is printed by microarray on slides coated with a noncontinuous,
      nanostructured plasmonic gold film, enabling quantitative fluorescent detection
      of anti-HDV antibody in small aliquots of patient serum. This assay was then used
      to screen all HBV-infected patients identified in a large randomly selected
      cohort designed to represent the Mongolian population. We identified two
      quantitative thresholds of captured antibody that were 100% predictive of the
      sample either being positive on standard western blot or harboring HDV RNA
      detectable by real-time quantitative PCR. Subsequent screening of the HBV(+)
      cohort revealed that a remarkable 57% were RNA(+) and an additional 4% were
      positive on western blot alone. CONCLUSION: The quantitative microarray antibody 
      capture assay's unique performance characteristics make it ideal for population
      screening; its application to the Mongolian HBV surface antigen-positive
      population reveals an apparent approximately 60% prevalence of HDV coinfection
      among these HBV-infected Mongolian subjects, which may help explain the
      extraordinarily high rate of hepatocellular carcinoma in Mongolia. (Hepatology

TI  - New insights into the role and mechanism of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling in 
      the pathobiology of liver diseases.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29689 [doi]
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in the liver occurs in response
      to physical and chemical stress, including alterations in nutrients, growth
      factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix, DNA damage, drugs and toxins. This
      signaling pathway plays a role in liver injury and diseases such as drug induced 
      hepatotoxicity, viral hepatitis, infection and inflammation, NAFLD, NASH, ALD,
      ischemia/reperfusion, fibrosis, regeneration, and carcinogenesis (1-4). In
      mammals, three major groups of MAPK have been identified. Each of these groups of
      MAPK is activated by a protein kinase cascade. MAPK signaling cascades consist of
      at least three components, or tiers: MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K), MAPK kinase
      (MAP2K), and MAPK. The groups are named according to their executing downstream
      MAPK, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the p38 kinase,
      and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) families. In the liver, JNK is a dominant
      effector MAPK which catalyzes the phosphorylation of numerous substrate proteins 
      including nuclear AP1 transcription factors (c-Jun, etc) as well as protein
      kinases and phosphatases, scaffold proteins, and other functional proteins (4,
      5). JNK activation and substrate phosphorylation has two major direct
      consequences: regulation of gene expression through AP1 transcription factors and
      direct activation or inhibition of protein targets (Fig.1). The liver expresses
      both JNK1 and JNK2. In this review we will focus on recent studies from many
      different laboratories in the past 5 years which have improved our understanding 
      of the role of JNK signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of liver diseases and
      promise to lead to exciting therapeutic applications. Because of the broad nature
      of this subject, we have selected specific areas which illustrate the important
      recent conceptual advances. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Global microRNA expression profiling in the liver biopsies of hepatitis B
      virus-infected patients suggests specific microRNA signatures for viral
      persistence and hepatocellular injury.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29690 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can manipulate the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks
      in infected cells to create a permissive environment for viral replication,
      cellular injury, disease onset, and its progression. The aim of the present study
      was to understand the miRNA networks and their target genes in the liver of
      hepatitis B patients involved in HBV replication, liver injury, and liver
      fibrosis. We investigated differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray in liver 
      biopsy samples from different stages of HBV infection and liver disease
      (immune-tolerant [n = 8], acute viral hepatitis [n = 8], no fibrosis [n = 16],
      early [F1+F2, n = 19] or late [F3+F4, n = 14] fibrosis, and healthy controls [n =
      7]). miRNA expression levels were analyzed by unsupervised principal component
      analysis and hierarchical clustering. Analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks 
      identified 17 miRNAs and 18 target gene interactions with four distinct nodes,
      each representing a stage-specific gene regulation during disease progression.
      The immune-tolerant group showed elevated miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and Let-7a-3p 
      levels, which could target genes involved in innate immune response and viral
      replication. In the acute viral hepatitis group, miR-125b-5p and miR-3613-3p were
      up, whereas miR-940 was down, which might affect cell proliferation through the
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In early fibrosis,
      miR-34b-3p, miR-1224-3p, and miR-1227-3p were up, while miR-499a-5p was down,
      which together possibly mediate chronic inflammation. In advanced fibrosis,
      miR-1, miR-10b-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-133b, and miR-671-5p were up, while miR-20b-5p 
      and miR-455-3p were down, possibly allowing chronic disease progression.
      Interestingly, only 8 of 17 liver-specific miRNAs exhibited a similar expression 
      pattern in patient sera. CONCLUSION: miRNA signatures identified in this study
      corroborate previous findings and provide fresh insight into the understanding of
      HBV-associated liver diseases which may be helpful in developing early-stage
      disease diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Towards the Elimination of Hepatitis C in the United States.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29685 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents has reignited
      discussion over hepatitis C elimination potential in the United States.
      Eliminating hepatitis C will require a critical examination regarding technical
      feasibility, economic considerations, and social/political attention. Tremendous 
      advancement has been made in recent years with the availability of sensitive
      diagnostic tests and highly effective DAAs capable of achieving sustained viral
      response (SVR) in more than 95% of patients. Eliminating hepatitis C requires
      escalating existing surveillance networks to identify and respond to new
      epidemics. Basic prevention strategies such as community based outreach and
      education, testing and counseling, clean syringe and needle exchange programs,
      safe injection sites, opioid substitution therapies, and mental health services
      must be scaled up and adapted to target high risk groups. Although costs of DAAs 
      have raised budget concerns for hepatitis C elimination, studies have shown that 
      eliminating hepatitis C will produce a savings of up to 6.5 billion USD annually 
      along with other intangible benefits such as work productivity and quality of
      life. Simulation economic models and meta-analyses suggest that all adults should
      be screened for hepatitis C, but special efforts must focus on high risk
      populations. There is growing recognition that social and political factors are
      at least as important as technical feasibility and economic considerations. Due
      to lack of promotion and public awareness, HCV elimination efforts continue to
      receive inadequate funding. Social stigma continues to impede meaningful policy
      changes. Eliminating hepatitis C from the U.S. is possible but it will require a 
      sustained national commitment and strong political leadership. This article is

LID - 10.1002/hep.29683 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic alterations immensely contributed to human carcinogenesis.
      Conventional epigenetic studies predominantly focused on DNA methylation, histone
      modifications, and chromatin remodeling. Recently, diverse and reversible
      chemical modifications on RNAs emerge as a new layer of epigenetic regulation.
      N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant chemical modification on eukaryotic
      mRNA and is important to the regulation of mRNA stability, splicing, and
      translation. Using transcriptome sequencing, we discovered that METTL3
      (methyltransferase like 3), a major RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase, was
      significantly up-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and multiple
      solid tumors. Clinically, overexpression of METTL3 was associated with poor
      prognosis of HCC patients. Functionally, we proved that knockdown of METTL3
      drastically reduced HCC cell proliferation, migration and colony formation in
      vitro. Knockout of METTL3 remarkably suppressed HCC tumorigenicity and lung
      metastasis in vivo. On the other hand, using CRISPR/dCas9-VP64 activation system,
      we demonstrated that overexpression of METTL3 significantly promoted HCC growth
      both in vitro and in vivo. Through transcriptome sequencing, m6A-Seq and m6A
      MeRIP qRT-PCR, we identified SOCS2 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 2) as a
      target of METTL3-mediated m6A modification. Knockdown of METTL3 substantially
      abolished SOCS2 mRNA m6A modification and augmented SOCS2 mRNA expression. We
      also showed that m6A-mediated SOCS2 mRNA degradation relied on m6A "reader"
      protein YTHDF2 dependent pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that METTL3 was 
      frequently up-regulated in human HCC and contributed to HCC progression. METTL3
      repressed SOCS2 expression in HCC via the m6A-YTHDF2 dependent mechanism. Thus,
      our findings suggested a new dimension of epigenetic alteration in liver
      carcinogenesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha/interleukin-1beta signaling enhances hepatoma
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition through macrophages in a hypoxic-inflammatory
      microenvironment.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29681 [doi]
AB  - The development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are dependent
      on its local microenvironment. Hypoxia and inflammation are two critical factors 
      that shape the HCC microenvironment; however, the interplay between the two
      factors and the involvement of cancer cells under such conditions remain poorly
      understood. We found that tumor-associated macrophages, the primary
      proinflammatory cells within tumors, secreted more interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta)
      under moderate hypoxic conditions due to increased stability of hypoxia inducible
      factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Under persistent and severe hypoxia, we found that
      the necrotic debris of HCC cells induced potent IL-1beta release by
      tumor-associated macrophages with an M2 phenotype. We further confirmed that the 
      necrotic debris-induced IL-1beta secretion was mediated through Toll-like
      receptor 4/TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta/nuclear factor 
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells signaling in a similar, but not
      identical, fashion to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Using mass
      spectrometry, we identified a group of proteins with O-linked glycosylation to be
      responsible for the necrotic debris-induced IL-1beta secretion. Following the
      increase of IL-1beta in the local microenvironment, the synthesis of HIF-1alpha
      was up-regulated by IL-1beta in HCC cells through cyclooxygenase-2. The
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition of HCC cells was enhanced by overexpression of 
      HIF-1alpha. We further showed that IL-1beta promoted HCC metastasis in mouse
      models and was predictive of poor prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings revealed an HIF-1alpha/IL-1beta signaling loop between cancer cells and 
      tumor-associated macrophages in a hypoxic microenvironment, resulting in cancer
      cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis; more importantly, our
      results suggest a potential role of an anti-inflammatory strategy in HCC
      treatment. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Stochastic phenotype switching leads to intratumor heterogeneity in human liver
      cancer.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29679 [doi]
AB  - Intratumor heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a major factor impacting
      diagnosis and personalized treatment of cancer. We characterized stochastic
      phenotype switching as a novel mechanism contributing to intratumor heterogeneity
      and malignant potential of liver cancer. Clonal analysis of primary tumor cell
      cultures of a human sarcomatoid cholangiocarcinoma identified different types of 
      self-propagating subclones characterized by stable (keratin-7-positive or
      keratin-7-negative) phenotypes and an unstable phenotype consisting of mixtures
      of keratin-7-positive and keratin-7-negative cells, which lack stem cell features
      but may reversibly switch their phenotypes. Transcriptome sequencing and
      immunohistochemical studies with the markers Zeb1 and CD146/MCAM demonstrated
      that switching between phenotypes is linked to changes in gene expression related
      but not identical to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Stochastic phenotype
      switching occurred during mitosis and did not correlate with changes in DNA
      methylation. Xenotransplantation assays with different cellular subclones
      demonstrated increased tumorigenicity of cells showing phenotype switching,
      resulting in tumors morphologically resembling the invasive component of primary 
      tumor and metastasis. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that stochastic phenotype 
      switching contributes to intratumor heterogeneity and that cells with a switching
      phenotype have increased malignant potential. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Actin cytoskeleton remodeling drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition for
      hepatoma invasion and metastasis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29678 [doi]
AB  - High invasiveness is a hallmark of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Large
      tumors predict invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
      is crucial for cancer invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms whereby
      large tumors tend to undergo EMT remain unclear. We conducted a subgenome-wide
      screen and identified KLHL23 as an HCC invasion suppressor via inhibiting EMT.
      KLHL23 binds to actin and suppresses actin polymerization. KLHL23 silencing
      induced filopodium and lamellipodium formation. Moreover, EMT suppressed by
      KLHL23 through its action on actin dynamics. Traditionally, actin cytoskeleton
      remodeling is downstream of EMT reprogramming. It is, therefore, intriguing to
      ask why and how KLHL23 inversely regulates EMT. Activation of actin cytoskeleton 
      remodeling by either KLHL23 silencing or treatment with actin cytoskeleton
      modulators augmented cellular hypoxic responses in a cell density-dependent
      manner resulting in HIF and Notch signals and subsequent EMT. Environmental
      hypoxia did not induce EMT unless actin cytoskeleton remodeling was
      simultaneously activated and only when cells were at high density. The resulted
      EMT was reversed by either adenosine 5'-triphosphate supplementation or actin
      polymerization inhibitors. Downregulation of KLHL23 was associated with invasion,
      metastasis, and poor prognosis of HCC and pancreatic cancer. Correlations of
      tumor size with EMT and inverse association of the expression of KLHL23 with
      HIF-/Notch-signals were further validated in patient-derived xenograft HCCs in
      mice. CONCLUSION: Simultaneously activation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling by
      intrinsic (such as KLHL23 downregulation) or microenvironment cues is crucial for
      cell density-dependent and hypoxia-mediated EMT, providing a mechanistic link
      between large tumor size and invasion/metastasis. Our findings open a new door to
      develop the prevention and treatment strategies for tumor invasion and
      metastasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - External validation of the ITA.LI.CA prognostic system for patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter cohort study. (HEP-17-0903).
LID - 10.1002/hep.29662 [doi]
AB  - Several staging systems for HCC have been developed. BCLC is considered the best 
      in predicting survival, although limitations have emerged. Recently the
      Italian-Liver-Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) prognostic system, integrating the ITA.LI.CA
      tumor-staging (stages 0, A, B1-3; C) with Child-Pugh score, ECOG-PST, and AFP
      with a strong ability to predict survival was proposed. Aim of our study was to
      provide an external validation of the ITA.LI.CA system in an independent
      real-life occidental cohort of HCCs. METHODS: From September 2008 to April 2016, 
      1508 cirrhotics with incident HCC were consecutively enrolled in 27 Italian
      institutions (EpaHCC multi-institutional cohort). Clinical, tumor and
      treatment-related variables were collected and patients stratified according to
      BCLC, ITA.LI.CA prognostic system, HKLC, CLIP, JIS, and MESIAH scores. Harrel's
      C-index, Akaike-Information-Criterion and likelihood-ratio test were used to
      compare predictive ability of different systems. A subgroup analysis for
      treatment category (curative vs palliative) was performed. RESULTS: Median
      follow-up was 44 months (IQR 23-63) and median OS was 34 (IQR 13-82). Median age 
      was 71 years, and patients were mainly males and HCV carriers. According to
      ITA.LI.CA tumor staging 246 patients were in stage-0, 472 in stage-A; 657 in the 
      stages-B1/3; 133 in stage-C. ITA.LI.CA prognostic system showed the best
      discriminatory ability (C-index = 0.77) and monotonicity of gradients, compared
      to other systems, and the superiority was also confirmed after stratification for
      treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that independently
      validated the ITA.LI.CA prognostic system in a large cohort of Western patients
      with incident HCCs. ITA.LI.CA-system performed better than other multidimensional
      prognostic systems even after stratification by curative or palliative treatment.
      This new system appears to be particularly useful to predict individual HCC
      prognosis in clinical practice. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Interaction between alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome in predicting
      severe liver disease in the general population.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29631 [doi]
AB  - The metabolic syndrome and alcohol risk use are both associated with high
      prevalence of hepatic steatosis, but only a minority develop liver failure or
      liver cancer. Few general population studies have analyzed metabolic predictors
      of such severe liver complications. We studied which metabolic factors best
      predict severe liver complications, stratified by alcohol consumption. 6732
      individuals without baseline liver disease who participated in the Finnish
      population-based Health 2000 Study (2000-2001), a nationally representative
      cohort. Follow-up data from national registers until 2013 were analyzed for
      liver-related admissions, mortality, and liver cancer. Baseline alcohol use and
      metabolic factors were analyzed by backward stepwise Cox regression analysis. 84 
      subjects experienced a severe liver event during follow-up. In the final
      multivariate model, factors predictive of liver events were age (HR 1.02, 95%CI
      1.004-1.04), gender (women HR 0.55, 0.34-0.91), alcohol use (HR 1.002,
      1.001-1.002), diabetes (HR 2.73, 1.55-4.81), LDL cholesterol (HR 0.74,
      0.58-0.93), and HOMA-IR (HR 1.01, 1.004-1.02). Among alcohol risk users (average 
      alcohol use >/=210 g/week for men, >/=140 g/week for women), diabetes (HR 6.79,
      95%CI 3.18-14.5) was the only significant predictor. Among non-risk drinkers,
      age, alcohol use, smoking, waist circumference, low LDL cholesterol and HOMA-IR
      were significant independent predictors. The total cholesterol-to-LDL
      cholesterol-ratio and waist circumference-to-BMI-ratio emerged as additional
      independent predictors. CONCLUSION: Multiple components of the metabolic syndrome
      independently affected the risk for severe liver disease. Alcohol was significant
      even when average alcohol consumption was within the limits currently defining
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Using the Icelandic Genealogical Database to define the familial risk of primary 
      biliary cholangitis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29675 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary factors in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) have been well defined in
      genome wide-association studies but there is not much direct data available that 
      define the relative risk for family members with an affected proband. An
      increased risk in first-degree relatives has been demonstrated in a variety of
      studies but data have been lacking on further detailed associations for
      subsequent generations. The objective of the study was to use the unique
      Icelandic genealogical database to study the familiality of PBC. All patients
      with positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies measurements in Iceland during the
      period of 1991-2015, fulfilling diagnostic criteria for PBC were included. The
      Icelandic Genealogical Database was used to assess familial relations. For each
      case of PBC, 10,000 control subjects matched for age, gender and number of known 
      relatives were randomly chosen from this database to calculate the familial
      relative risk of PBC. The average kinship coefficient (KC) of the patients was
      calculated and compared to the average kinship coefficient of controls. Overall
      222 PBC patients were identified, 182 females and 40 males, median age 62 years. 
      First-, second- and third-degree relatives of the PBC patients had a high
      relative risk of the disease: 9.13 (p<0.0001), 3.61 (p=0.014) and 2.59 (p=0.008),
      respectively. In fourth- and fifth-degree relatives the relative risk was also
      increased, with 1.66 (p=0.08) and 1.42 (p=0.08), respectively. The average
      kinship coefficient of the patients was also higher than that of the control
      subjects, with 21.34 x10-5 vs. 9.56 x10-5 (p<0.0001). In conclusion relatives of 
      PBC patients had markedly higher risk for development of the disease compared
      with controls and importantly our data demonstrate that the risk was
      significantly increased even in second- and third-degree relatives. This article

TI  - Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma need a personalized management: A
      lesson from clinical practice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29668 [doi]
AB  - The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) advanced stage (BCLC C) of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes a heterogeneous population, where
      sorafenib alone is the recommended treatment. In this study, our aim was to
      assess treatment and overall survival (OS) of BCLC C patients subclassified
      according to clinical features (performance status [PS], macrovascular invasion
      [MVI], extrahepatic spread [EHS] or MVI + EHS) determining their allocation to
      this stage. From the Italian Liver Cancer database, we analyzed 835 consecutive
      BCLC C patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2014. Patients were subclassified as: 
      PS1 alone (n = 385; 46.1%), PS2 alone (n = 146; 17.5%), MVI (n = 224; 26.8%), EHS
      (n = 51; 6.1%), and MVI + EHS (n = 29; 3.5%). MVI, EHS, and MVI + EHS patients
      had larger and multifocal/massive HCCs and higher alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels 
      than PS1 and PS2 patients. Median OS significantly declined from PS1 (38.6
      months) to PS2 (22.3 months), EHS (11.2 months), MVI (8.2 months), and MVI + EHS 
      (3.1 months; P < 0.001). Among MVI patients, OS was longer in those with
      peripheral than with central (portal trunk) MVI (11.2 vs. 7.1 months; P = 0.005).
      The most frequent treatments were: curative approaches in PS1 (39.7%), supportive
      therapy in PS2 (41.8%), sorafenib in MVI (39.3%) and EHS (37.3%), and best
      supportive care in MVI + EHS patients (51.7%). Independent prognostic factors
      were: Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, Child-Pugh class, ascites,
      platelet count, albumin, tumor size, MVI, EHS, AFP levels, and treatment type.
      CONCLUSION: BCLC C stage does not identify patients homogeneous enough to be
      allocated to a single stage. PS1 alone is not sufficient to include a patient
      into this stage. The remaining patients should be subclassified according to PS
      and tumor features, and new patient-tailored therapeutic indications are needed.

TI  - Modulation of the intestinal bile acid-FXR-FGF15 axis improves alcoholic liver
      disease in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29676 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic liver disease is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. 
      Functional consequences of alcohol-associated dysbiosis are largely unknown. The 
      aim of this study was to identify a mechanism of how changes in the intestinal
      microbiota contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Metagenomic sequencing of
      intestinal contents demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding in mice is
      associated with an overrepresentation of bacterial genomic DNA encoding
      choloylglycine hydrolase, which deconjugates bile acids in the intestine. Bile
      acid analysis confirmed an increased amount of unconjugated bile acids in the
      small intestine after ethanol administration. Mediated by a lower farnesoid x
      receptor (FXR) activity in enterocytes, lower fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-15
      protein secretion was associated with increased hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme
      (Cyp)-7a1 protein expression and circulating bile acid levels. Depletion of the
      commensal microbiota with non-absorbable antibiotics attenuated hepatic Cyp7a1
      expression and reduced alcoholic liver disease in mice, suggesting that increased
      bile acid synthesis is dependent on gut bacteria. To restore intestinal FXR
      activity, we used a pharmacological intervention with the intestine-restricted
      FXR agonist fexaramine, which protected mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.
      While bile acid metabolism was only minimally altered, fexaramine treatment
      stabilized the gut barrier and significantly modulated hepatic genes involved in 
      lipid metabolism. To link the beneficial metabolic effect to FGF15, a
      non-tumorigenic FGF19 variant - a human FGF15 ortholog - was overexpressed in
      mice using adeno-associated viruses. FGF19 treatment showed similarly beneficial 
      metabolic effects and ameliorated alcoholic steatohepatitis. Taken together,
      alcohol-associated metagenomic changes result in alterations of bile acid
      profiles. Targeted interventions improve bile acid-FXR-FGF15 signaling by
      modulation of hepatic Cyp7a1 and lipid metabolism, and reduce ethanol-induced
      liver disease in mice. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - C/EBPalpha-dependent preneoplastic tumor foci are the origin of hepatocellular
      carcinoma and aggressive pediatric liver cancer.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29677 [doi]
AB  - Recent publications show that classic hepatoblastoma (HBL) is the result of
      failure of hepatic stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes, while
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is caused by the dedifferentiation of hepatocytes 
      into cancer stem cells. However, the mechanisms of aggressive HBL and the
      mechanisms that cause dedifferentiation of hepatocytes into cancer stem cells are
      unknown. We found that, similar to HCC but opposite to classic HBL, aggressive
      HBL is the result of dedifferentiation of hepatocytes into cancer stem cells. In 
      both cases of liver cancer, the dephosphorylation of tumor suppressor protein
      CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) at Ser193 (Ser190 in human
      protein) or mutation of Ser193 to Ala results in a modified protein with
      oncogenic activities. We have investigated liver cancer in a mouse model
      C/EBPalpha-S193A, in a large cohort of human HBL samples, and in Pten/p53 double 
      knockout mice and found that these cancers are characterized by elevation of
      C/EBPalpha that is dephosphorylated at Ser190/193. We found that dephosphorylated
      C/EBPalpha creates preneoplastic foci with cancer stem cells that give rise to
      HCC and aggressive HBL. C/EBPalpha-dependent dedifferentiation of hepatocytes
      into cancer stem cells includes increased proliferation of hepatocytes, followed 
      by generation of multinucleated hepatocytes and subsequent appearance of
      hepatocytes with delta-like 1 homolog-positive intranuclear inclusions. We
      further isolated C/EBPalpha-dependent multinucleated hepatocytes and found that
      they possess characteristics of tumor-initiating cells, including elevation of
      stem cell markers. C/EBPalpha-dependent cancer stem cells are observed in
      patients with aggressive HBL and in patients with a predisposition for liver
      cancer. CONCLUSION: The earliest steps of adult HCC and aggressive pediatric
      liver cancer have identical features that include conversion of the tumor
      suppressor C/EBPalpha into an oncogenic isoform, which further creates
      preneoplastic foci where hepatocytes dedifferentiate into cancer cells, giving
      rise to liver cancer. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - New insights into diagnosis and therapeutic options for proliferative
      hepatoblastoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29672 [doi]
AB  - Surgery and cisplatin-based treatment of hepatoblastoma (HB) currently guarantee 
      the survival of 70-80% of patients. However, some important challenges remain in 
      diagnosing high risk tumors and identifying relevant targetable pathways offering
      new therapeutic avenues. Previously, two molecular subclasses of hepatoblastoma
      tumors have been described, namely C1 and C2; C2 being the subgroup with the
      poorest prognosis, a more advanced tumor stage and the worst overall survival
      rate. An associated 16-gene signature to discriminate the two tumoral subgroups
      was proposed but it has not been transferred into clinical routine. To address
      these issues we performed RNA sequencing of 25 tumors and matched normal liver
      samples from patients. The transcript profiling separated HB into three distinct 
      subgroups named C1, C2A and C2B, identifiable by a concise four-gene signature:
      HSD17B6, ITGA6, TOP2A and VIM, with TOP2A being characteristic for the
      proliferative C2A tumors. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed by
      RT-qPCR on an expanded cohort and by immunohistochemistry. We also revealed
      significant overexpression of genes involved in Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway in
      the C2A subgroup. We then investigated the ability of several described FA
      inhibitors to block growth of HB cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that
      bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, strongly impairs the
      proliferation and survival of HB cell lines in vitro, blocks FA pathway
      associated double-strand DNA repair and significantly impedes HB growth in vivo. 
      In conclusion, the highly proliferating C2A subtype is characterized by TOP2A
      gene up-regulation and FA pathway activation and HB therapeutic arsenal could
      include Bortezomib for the treatment of patients with the most aggressive tumors.

TI  - Cytoplasmic localization of the cell polarity factor scribble supports liver
      tumor formation and tumor cell invasiveness.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29669 [doi]
AB  - The loss of epithelial cell polarity plays an important role in the development
      and progression of liver cancer. However, the specific molecular mechanisms
      supporting tumor initiation and progression are poorly understood. In this study,
      transcriptome data and immunofluorescence stains of tissue samples derived from
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients revealed that overexpression associated
      with cytoplasmic localization of the basolateral cell polarity complex protein
      scribble (Scrib) correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. In comparison
      with HCC cells stably expressing wild-type Scrib (Scrib(WT) ), mutated Scrib with
      enforced cytoplasmic enrichment (Scrib(P305L) ) induced AKT signaling through the
      destabilization of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and PH domain and
      leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1). Cytoplasmic Scrib(P305L)
      stimulated a gene signature and a phenotype characteristic for epithelial to
      mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HCC cell invasiveness. Scrib(P305L) -dependent
      invasion was mediated by the activator protein 1 (AP-1) constituents ATF2 and
      JunB through induction of paracrine-acting secreted protein acidic and
      cysteine-rich (SPARC). Coexpression of Scrib(P305L) and the oncogene c-MYC
      through hydrodynamic gene delivery in mouse livers promoted tumor formation and
      increased abundance of pAKT, pATF2, and SPARC in comparison with controls.
      Finally, cytoplasmic Scrib localization correlated with AKT and ATF2
      phosphorylation in human HCC tissues, and the Scrib(P305L) -dependent gene
      signature was enriched in cancer patients with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION:
      Perturbation of hepatocellular polarity due to overexpression and cytoplasmic
      enrichment of Scrib supports tumor initiation and HCC cell dissemination through 
      specific molecular mechanisms. Biomarker signatures identified in this study can 
      be used for the identification of HCC patients with higher risk for the
      development of metastasis. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Development and Validation of a Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis-Specific
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Instrument: The PSC PRO.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29664 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PSC is a chronic liver disease associated with inflammation and
      biliary fibrosis that leads to cholangitis, cirrhosis, and impaired quality of
      life. Our objective was to develop and validate a PSC-specific PRO instrument.
      METHODS: We developed a 42-item PSC PRO instrument that contains 2 modules
      (Symptoms and Impact of Symptoms), and conducted external validation. Reliability
      and validity were evaluated using clinical data and a battery of other validated 
      instruments. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a subgroup of patients who
      repeated the PSC PRO after the first administration. RESULTS: 102 PSC subjects
      (44+/-13 years, 32% male, 74% employed, 39% cirrhotic, 14% with history of
      decompensated cirrhosis, 38% history of depression, and 68% with inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) completed PSC PRO and other PRO instruments (SF-36, CLDQ,
      PBC-40, 5-D Itch). PSC PRO demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach 
      alphas 0.84-0.94) and discriminant validity (41/42 items had the highest
      correlations with their own domains). There were good correlations between PSC
      PRO domains and relevant domains of SF-36, CLDQ, and PBC-40 (R=0.69-0.90; all
      p<0.0001), but lower (R=0.31-0.60, p<0.001) with 5-D Itch. Construct validity
      showed that PSC PRO can differentiate patients according to the presence and
      severity of cirrhosis and history of depression (p<0.05), but not by IBD
      (p>0.05). Test-retest reliability was assessed in 53 subjects who repeated PSC
      PRO within a median (IQR) of 37 (27-47) days. There was excellent reliability for
      most domains with intra-class correlations 0.71-0.88 (all p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      PSC PRO is a self-administered disease-specific instrument developed according to
      FDA guidelines. This preliminary validation study suggests good psychometric
      properties. Further validation of the instrument in larger and more diverse
      sample of PSC patients is needed. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Diabetes, metabolic comorbidities, and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: Results 
      from two prospective cohort studies.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29660 [doi]
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      However, it is unknown whether T2D duration or additional metabolic comorbidities
      further contribute to HCC risk. From the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), 120,826
      women were enrolled in 1980, and from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
      (HPFS), 50,284 men were enrolled in 1986 and followed through 2012.
      Physician-diagnosed T2D was ascertained at baseline and updated biennially. Cox
      proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate age- and
      multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
      incident HCC. Over 32 years of follow-up (4,488,410 person-years), we documented 
      112 cases of HCC (69 women, 43 men). T2D was associated with an increased HCC
      risk (multivariable HR, 4.59; 95% CI, 2.98-7.07), as was an increasing T2D
      duration (Ptrend < 0.001). Compared to nondiabetics, the multivariable HRs for
      HCC were 2.96 (95% CI, 1.57-5.60) for 0-<2 years; 6.08 (95% CI, 2.96-12.50) for
      2-<10 years; and 7.52 (95% CI, 3.88-14.58) for >/=10 years. Increasing number of 
      metabolic comorbidities (T2D, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) was
      associated with increased HCC risk (Ptrend < 0.001); compared to individuals
      without metabolic comorbidity, those with four metabolic comorbidities had an
      8.1-fold increased HCC risk (95% CI, 2.48-26.7). In T2D, neither insulin use nor 
      oral hypoglycemic use was significantly associated with HCC risk (HR, 2.04 [95%
      CI, 0.69-6.09] and HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 0.69-3.07], respectively). CONCLUSION: T2D
      is independently associated with increased risk for HCC in two prospective
      cohorts of U.S. men and women. This risk is enhanced with prolonged diabetes
      duration and with comorbid metabolic conditions, suggesting the importance of
      insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of HCC. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - beta-Catenin Deficiency in Hepatocytes Aggravates Hepatocarcinogenesis Driven by 
      Oncogenic beta-Catenin and MET.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29661 [doi]
AB  - Both activating and inactivating mutations in ctnnb1, encoding beta-catenin, have
      been implicated in liver tumorigenesis in humans and mice, although the
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Herein we show that deletion of
      endogenous beta-catenin in hepatocytes aggravated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      development driven by an oncogenic version of beta-catenin (CAT) in combination
      with HGF receptor MET. Although the mitogenic signaling and cell cycle
      progression was modestly impaired after CAT/MET transfection, the
      beta-catenin-deficient livers displayed changes in transcriptomes, increased DNA 
      damage response, expanded Sox9(+) cells, and upregulation of pro-tumorigenic
      cytokines including IL-6 and TGF-beta1. These events eventually exacerbated
      CAT/MET-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in beta-catenin-deficient livers, featured by
      upregulation of Erk, Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and cyclin D1 expression.
      The resultant mouse tumors showed similar transcriptomes to human HCC samples
      with concomitant CTNNB1 mutations and MET overexpression. These data argue that
      while dominantly activating mutants of beta-catenin are oncogenic, inhibiting the
      oncogenic signaling pathway generates a pro-oncogenic microenvironment, which may
      facilitate HCC recurrence following a targeted therapy of the primary tumor.
      Therefore, an effective therapeutic strategy must require disruption of the
      oncogenic signaling in tumor cells and also suppression of the secondary
      tumor-promoting stromal effects in the liver microenvironment. This article is

TI  - High mobility group protein B1 controls liver cancer initiation through
      yes-associated protein -dependent aerobic glycolysis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29663 [doi]
AB  - Emerging studies have suggested that the Hippo pathway is involved in the
      tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the key regulator of
      the Hippo pathway in liver tumor metabolic reprogramming remains elusive. Here,
      we provide evidence that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a chromosomal
      protein, plays a role in the regulation of the Hippo pathway during liver
      tumorigenesis. Cre/loxP recombination-mediated HMGB1 depletion in hepatocytes
      blocks diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer initiation in mice, whereas short 
      hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing of HMGB1 inhibits HCC cell proliferation.
      Mechanistically, the binding of HMGB1 to GA-binding protein alpha promotes the
      expression of yes-associated protein (YAP), a major downstream effector of the
      Hippo pathway that contributes to liver tumorigenesis by inducing
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha)-dependent aerobic glycolysis. Like
      wild-type YAP-complementary DNA, YAP-5SA-S94A can restore HIF1alpha DNA binding
      activity, glycolysis-associated gene expression, and HIF1alpha-YAP complex
      formation in YAP-knockdown HCC cell lines. In contrast, verteporfin, a reagent
      targeting the interface between YAP and TEA domain transcription factor, has the 
      ability to block YAP-HIF1alpha complex formation. Notably, genetic or
      pharmacologic inhibition of the HMGB1-YAP-HIF1alpha pathway confers protection
      against excessive glycolysis and tumor growth in mice. CONCLUSION: These findings
      demonstrate that HMGB1 plays a novel role in modulating the YAP-dependent
      HIF1alpha pathway and shed light on the development of metabolism-targeting
      therapeutics for HCC chemoprevention. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - beta-Catenin and interleukin-1beta-dependent chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10
      production drives progression of disease in a mouse model of congenital hepatic
      fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29652 [doi]
AB  - Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), a genetic disease caused by mutations in the
      polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene, encoding for the protein
      fibrocystin/polyductin complex, is characterized by biliary dysgenesis,
      progressive portal fibrosis, and a protein kinase A-mediated activating
      phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser675. Biliary structures of Pkhd1(del4/del4)
      mice, a mouse model of CHF, secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), a
      chemokine able to recruit macrophages. The aim of this study was to clarify
      whether CXCL10 plays a pathogenetic role in disease progression in CHF/Caroli
      disease and to understand the mechanisms leading to increased CXCL10 secretion.
      We demonstrate that treatment of Pkhd1(del4/del4) mice for 3 months with AMG-487,
      an inhibitor of CXC chemokine receptor family 3, the cognate receptor of CXCL10, 
      reduces the peribiliary recruitment of alternative activated macrophages (cluster
      of differentiation 45(+) F4/80(+) cells), spleen size, liver fibrosis (sirius
      red), and cyst growth (cytokeratin 19-positive area), consistent with a
      pathogenetic role of CXCL10. Furthermore, we show that in fibrocystin/polyductin 
      complex-defective cholangiocytes, isolated from Pkhd1(del4/del4) mice, CXCL10
      production is mediated by Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 3 in response to interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and beta-catenin.
      Specifically, IL-1beta promotes signal transducer and activator of transcription 
      3 phosphorylation, whereas beta-catenin promotes its nuclear translocation.
      Increased pro-IL-1beta was regulated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
      of activated B cells, and increased secretion of active IL-1beta was mediated by 
      the activation of Nod-like receptors, pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome
      (increased expression of caspase 1 and Nod-like receptors, pyrin domain
      containing 3). CONCLUSION: In fibrocystin/polyductin complex-defective
      cholangiocytes, beta-catenin and IL-1beta are responsible for signal transducer
      and activator of transcription 3-dependent secretion of CXCL10; in vivo
      experiments show that the CXCL10/CXC chemokine receptor family 3 axis prevents
      the recruitment of macrophages, reduces inflammation, and halts the progression
      of the disease; the increased production of IL-1beta highlights the
      autoinflammatory nature of CHF and may open novel therapeutic avenues.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA H19 interacts with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 to
      reprogram hepatic lipid homeostasis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29654 [doi]
AB  - H19 is an imprinted long noncoding RNA abundantly expressed in embryonic liver
      and repressed after birth. We show that H19 serves as a lipid sensor by
      synergizing with the RNA-binding polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)
      to modulate hepatic metabolic homeostasis. H19 RNA interacts with PTBP1 to
      facilitate its association with sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c mRNA
      and protein, leading to increased stability and nuclear transcriptional activity.
      H19 and PTBP1 are up-regulated by fatty acids in hepatocytes and in diet-induced 
      fatty liver, which further augments lipid accumulation. Ectopic expression of H19
      induces steatosis and pushes the liver into a "pseudo-fed" state in response to
      fasting by promoting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c protein
      cleavage and nuclear translocation. Deletion of H19 or knockdown of PTBP1
      abolishes high-fat and high-sucrose diet-induced steatosis. CONCLUSION: Our study
      unveils an H19/PTBP1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 feedforward
      amplifying signaling pathway to exacerbate the development of fatty liver.

TI  - Incidence and predictors of HBsAg seroclearance after cessation of nucleos(t)ide 
      analogue therapy in HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29640 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) loss is a rare event during nucleos(t)ide analogue 
      (Nuc) therapy. Limited data suggest that stopping Nuc therapy may increase HBsAg 
      loss rate in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative patients. A large study was
      conducted to investigate this issue in more detail. Of the 1075 HBeAg-negative
      patients treated with Nuc for 156 (61-430) weeks, 6 showed HBsAg seroclearance
      during treatment at an estimated annual incidence of 0.15%. Of the patients who
      remained HBsAg seropositive, 691 (52.3 years old, 86% males, 44.6% cirrhosis) had
      stopped Nuc therapy by Asian-Pacific stopping rule and then were prospectively
      followed-up. Baseline and on treatment clinical and viral features, treatment
      duration, consolidation duration, time to undetectable HBV DNA, time to normal
      ALT, end of treatment (EOT) HBsAg and HBsAg log reduction were compared between
      patients with and without HBsAg seroclearance after EOT. During a median
      off-therapy follow-up period of 155 (2-614) weeks, HBsAg seroclearance was
      confirmed in 42 patients. The 6-year cumulative incidence was 13% with an
      estimated annual incidence of 1.78%. Cox regression analysis showed that shorter 
      time to undetectable HBV DNA (<12wks), greater HBsAg reduction during therapy (>1
      log10 ), lower EOT HBsAg level (<100 IU/mL), patients with sustained response and
      relapsers not retreated were factors for off-therapy HBsAg seroclearance.
      CONCLUSION: The incidence of HBsAg seroclearance after stopping Nuc was much
      higher than that during therapy, and was highest in patients without virologic
      and clinical relapse. Patients with clinical relapse who remain untreated had
      7.34 times higher incidence of HBsAg clearance than those received re-treatment, 
      suggesting that transient untreated clinical relapse may drive sufficient immune 
      control to functional cure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Pyroptosis by caspase11/4-gasdermin-D pathway in alcoholic hepatitis in mice and 
      patients.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29645 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) continues to be a disease with high mortality and no
      efficacious medical treatment. Although severe AH is presented as acute on
      chronic liver failure, what underlies this transition from chronic alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (ASH) to AH is largely unknown. To address this question,
      unbiased RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses were performed on livers of the
      recently developed AH mouse model, which exhibits the shift to AH from chronic
      ASH upon weekly alcohol binge, and these results are compared to gene expression 
      profiling data from AH patients. This cross-analysis has identified Casp11 (CASP4
      in humans) as a commonly up-regulated gene known to be involved in the
      noncanonical inflammasome pathway. Immunoblotting confirms CASP11/4 activation in
      AH mice and patients, but not in chronic ASH mice and healthy human livers.
      Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), which induces pyroptosis (lytic cell death caused by
      bacterial infection) downstream of CASP11/4 activation, is also activated in AH
      livers in mice and patients. CASP11 deficiency reduces GSDMD activation,
      bacterial load in the liver, and severity of AH in the mouse model. Conversely,
      the deficiency of interleukin-18, the key antimicrobial cytokine, aggravates
      hepatic bacterial load, GSDMD activation, and AH. Furthermore,
      hepatocyte-specific expression of constitutively active GSDMD worsens
      hepatocellular lytic death and polymorphonuclear leukocyte inflammation.
      CONCLUSION: These results implicate pyroptosis induced by the CASP11/4-GSDMD
      pathway in the pathogenesis of AH. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - B lymphocytes limit senescence-driven fibrosis resolution and favor
      hepatocarcinogenesis in mouse liver injury.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29636 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent neoplasia and a leading cause of
      inflammation-related cancer mortality. Despite that most HCCs arise from
      persistent inflammatory conditions, pathways linking chronic inflammation to
      cancer development are still incompletely elucidated. We dissected the role of
      adaptive immunity in the Mdr2 knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mouse, a model of
      inflammation-associated cancer, in which ablation of adaptive immunity has been
      induced genetically (Rag2(-/-) Mdr2(-/-) and muMt-Mdr2(-/-) mice) or with in vivo
      treatments using lymphocyte-specific depleting antibodies (anti-CD20 or
      anti-CD4/CD8). We found that activated B and T lymphocytes, secreting fibrogenic 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and other proinflammatory cytokines,
      infiltrated liver of the Mdr2(-/-) mice during chronic fibrosing cholangitis.
      Lymphocyte ablation, in the Rag2(-/-) Mdr2(-/-) and muMt-Mdr2(-/-) mice, strongly
      suppressed hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and extracellular matrix
      deposition, enhancing HSC transition to cellular senescence. Moreover, lack of
      lymphocytes changed the intrahepatic metabolic/oxidative state, resulting in
      skewed macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype.
      Remarkably, hepatocarcinogenesis was significantly suppressed in the Rag2(-/-)
      Mdr2(-/-) mice, correlating with reduced TNFalpha/NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa
      B) pathway activation. Ablation of CD20(+) B cells, but not of CD4(+) /CD8(+) T
      cells, in Mdr2(-/-) mice, promoted senescence-mediated fibrosis resolution and
      inhibited the protumorigenic TNFalpha/NF-kappaB pathway. Interestingly, presence 
      of infiltrating B cells correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness and
      reduced disease-free survival in human HCC. CONCLUSION: Adaptive immunity
      sustains liver fibrosis (LF) and favors HCC growth in chronic injury, by
      modulating innate components of inflammation and limiting the extent of HSC
      senescence. Therapies designed for B-cell targeting may be an effective strategy 
      in LF. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - MicroRNA-21 and Dicer are dispensable for hepatic stellate cell activation and
      the development of liver fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29627 [doi]
AB  - Fibrosis and cancer represent two major complications of chronic liver disease.
      MicroRNAs have been implicated in the development of fibrosis and cancer, thus
      constituting potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the role of
      microRNA-21 (miR-21), a microRNA that has been implicated in the development of
      fibrosis in multiple organs and has also been suggested to act as an "oncomir."
      Accordingly, miR-21 was the microRNA that showed the strongest up-regulation in
      activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in multiple models of fibrogenesis, with 
      an 8-fold to 24-fold induction compared to quiescent HSCs. However, miR-21
      antisense inhibition did not suppress the activation of murine or human HSCs in
      culture or in liver slices. Moreover, genetic deletion of miR-21 in two
      independently generated knockout mice or miR-21 antisense inhibition did not
      alter HSC activation or liver fibrosis in models of toxic and biliary liver
      injury. Despite a strong up-regulation of miR-21 in injury-associated
      hepatocellular carcinoma and in cholangiocarcinoma, miR-21 deletion or antisense 
      inhibition did not reduce the development of liver tumors. As inhibition of the
      most up-regulated microRNA did not affect HSC activation, liver fibrosis, or
      fibrosis-associated liver cancer, we additionally tested the role of microRNAs in
      HSCs by HSC-specific Dicer deletion. Although Dicer deletion decreased microRNA
      expression in HSCs and altered the expression of select genes, it only exerted
      negligible effects on HSC activation and liver fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Genetic and 
      pharmacologic manipulation of miR-21 does not inhibit the development of liver
      fibrosis and liver cancer. Moreover, suppression of microRNA synthesis does not
      significantly affect HSC phenotype and activation. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Combinatorial genetics in liver repopulation and carcinogenesis with a novel in
      vivo CRISPR activation platform.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29626 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 activation (CRISPRa) systems have enabled genetic screens in cultured
      cells lines to discover and characterize drivers and inhibitors of cancer cell
      growth. We adapted this system for use in vivo to assess whether modulating
      endogenous gene expression levels can result in functional outcomes in the native
      environment of the liver. We engineered the dCas9(+) mouse, a Cre-inducible
      CRISPRa system for cell type-specific gene activation in vivo. We tested the
      capacity for genetic screening in live animals by applying CRISPRa in a
      clinically relevant model of liver injury and repopulation. We targeted promoters
      of interest in regenerating hepatocytes using multiple single guide RNAs (gRNAs),
      and employed high-throughput sequencing to assess enrichment of gRNA sequences
      during liver repopulation, and to link specific gRNAs to the initiation of
      carcinogenesis. All components of the CRISPRa system were expressed in a cell
      type-specific manner and activated endogenous gene expression in vivo. Multiple
      gRNA cassettes targeting a proto-oncogene were significantly enriched following
      liver repopulation, indicative of enhanced cell division of cells expressing the 
      proto-oncogene. Furthermore, hepatocellular carcinomas developed containing gRNAs
      that activated this oncogene, indicative of cancer initiation events.
      Furthermore, we employed our system for combinatorial cancer genetics in vivo, as
      we found that while clonal hepatocellular carcinomas were dependent on the
      presence of the oncogene-inducing gRNAs, they were depleted for multiple gRNAs
      activating tumor suppressors. CONCLUSION: The in vivo CRISPRa platform developed 
      here allows for parallel and combinatorial genetic screens in live animals. This 
      approach enables screening for drivers and suppressors of cell replication and
      tumor initiation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Risk Score to Predict the Development of Hepatic Encephalopathy in a
      Population-Based Cohort of Patients with Cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29628 [doi]
AB  - Over 40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE 
      is associated with decreased survival, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and
      frequent hospitalization. Accordingly, we aimed to develop a tool to
      risk-stratify patients for HE development. We studied a population-based cohort
      of all patients with cirrhosis without baseline HE (N=1,979) from the Veterans
      Administration from Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio (1/1/2005-12/31/10) using
      demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy data. The primary outcome was the
      development of HE. Risk-scores were constructed with both baseline and
      longitudinal data (annually updated parameters) and validated using
      bootstrapping. The cohort had mean age of 58.0+/-8.3 years, 36% had hepatitis C, 
      17% had ascites. Opiates, benzodiazepines, statins, and nonselective
      beta-blockers were taken at baseline by 24%, 13%, 17%, and 12%. Overall,
      863(43.7%) developed HE within 5 years. In multivariable models, risk factors
      (HR, 95%CI) for HE included higher bilirubin (1.07, 1.05-1.09) and nonselective
      beta-blocker use (1.34, 1.09-1.64), while higher albumin (0.54, 0.48-0.59) and
      statin use (0.80, 0.65-0.98) were protective. Other clinical factors, including
      opiate and benzodiazepine use were not predictive. The AUROC for HE using the 4
      significant variables in baseline and longitudinal models were 0.68 (0.66-0.70)
      and 0.73 (0.71-0.75), respectively. Model effects were validated and converted
      into a risk score. A score </=0 in our longitudinal model assigns a 6% 1-year
      probability of HE while a score >20 assigns a 38% 1-year risk. CONCLUSION:
      Patients with cirrhosis can be stratified by a simple risk-score for HE that
      accounts for changing clinical data. Our data also highlight a role for statins
      in reducing cirrhosis complications including HE. This article is protected by

TI  - A single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals precise pathways and regulatory
      mechanisms underlying hepatoblast differentiation.
PG  - 1387-1401
LID - 10.1002/hep.29353 [doi]
AB  - How bipotential hepatoblasts differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes
      remains unclear. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hepatoblasts,
      hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes sorted from embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) to E17.5
      mouse embryos, we found that hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte differentiation occurred
      gradually and followed a linear default pathway. As more cells became fully
      differentiated hepatocytes, the number of proliferating cells decreased.
      Surprisingly, proliferating and quiescent hepatoblasts exhibited homogeneous
      differentiation states at a given developmental stage. This unique feature
      enabled us to combine single-cell and bulk-cell analyses to define the precise
      timing of the hepatoblast-to-hepatocyte transition, which occurs between E13.5
      and E15.5. In contrast to hepatocyte development at almost all levels,
      hepatoblast-to-cholangiocyte differentiation underwent a sharp detour from the
      default pathway. New cholangiocyte generation occurred continuously between E11.5
      and E14.5, but their maturation states at a given developmental stage were
      heterogeneous. Even more surprising, the number of proliferating cells increased 
      as more progenitor cells differentiated into mature cholangiocytes. Based on an
      observation from the single-cell analysis, we also discovered that the protein
      kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway promoted
      cholangiocyte maturation. CONCLUSION: Our studies have defined distinct pathways 
      for hepatocyte and cholangiocyte development in vivo, which are critically
      important for understanding basic liver biology and developing effective
      strategies to induce stem cells to differentiate toward specific hepatic cell
      fates in vitro. (Hepatology 2017;66:1387-1401).

TI  - Palliative care access for hospitalized patients with end-stage liver disease
      across the United States.
PG  - 1585-1591
LID - 10.1002/hep.29297 [doi]
AB  - Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) often have a high symptom burden.
      Historically, palliative care (PC) services have been underused in this
      population. We investigated the use of PC services in patients with ESLD
      hospitalized across the United States. We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to
      conduct a retrospective nationwide cohort analysis. All patients >18 years of age
      admitted with ESLD, defined as those with at least two liver decompensation
      events, were included in the analysis. A multivariate logistic regression model
      predicting referral to PC was created. We analyzed 55,208,382 hospitalizations
      from the 2006-2012 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, with 39,349 (0.07%) patients
      meeting study inclusion. PC consultation was performed in 1,789 (4.5%) ESLD
      patients. The rate of PC referral in ESLD increased from 0.97% in 2006 to 7.1% in
      2012 (P < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with lower referral
      to PC were Hispanic race (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.66-0.89; P < 0.01) and insurance coverage (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65-0.84; P <
      0.01). Factors associated with increased referral to PC were age (per 5-year
      increase, OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08; P < 0.01), do-not-resuscitate status (OR, 
      16.24; 95% CI, 14.20-18.56; P < 0.01), treatment in a teaching hospital (OR,
      1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.39; P < 0.01), presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (OR,
      2.00; 95% CI, 1.71-2.33; P < 0.01), and presence of metastatic cancer (OR, 2.39; 
      95% CI, 1.80-3.18; P < 0.01). PC referral was most common in west coast hospitals
      (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.53-2.14; P < 0.01) as well as large-sized hospitals (OR,
      1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.82; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: From 2006 to 2012 the use of PC
      in ESLD patients increased substantially; socioeconomic, geographical, and ethnic
      barriers to accessing PC were observed. (Hepatology 2017;66:1585-1591).

TI  - A liver-specific gene expression panel predicts the differentiation status of in 
      vitro hepatocyte models.
PG  - 1662-1674

AB  - Alternative cell sources, such as three-dimensional organoids and induced
      pluripotent stem cell-derived cells, might provide a potentially effective
      approach for both drug development applications and clinical transplantation. For
      example, the development of cell sources for liver cell-based therapy has been
      increasingly needed, and liver transplantation is performed for the treatment for
      patients with severe end-stage liver disease. Differentiated liver cells and
      three-dimensional organoids are expected to provide new cell sources for tissue
      models and revolutionary clinical therapies. However, conventional experimental
      methods confirming the expression levels of liver-specific lineage markers cannot
      provide complete information regarding the differentiation status or degree of
      similarity between liver and differentiated cell sources. Therefore, in this
      study, to overcome several issues associated with the assessment of
      differentiated liver cells and organoids, we developed a liver-specific gene
      expression panel (LiGEP) algorithm that presents the degree of liver similarity
      as a "percentage." We demonstrated that the percentage calculated using the LiGEP
      algorithm was correlated with the developmental stages of in vivo liver tissues
      in mice, suggesting that LiGEP can correctly predict developmental stages.
      Moreover, three-dimensional cultured HepaRG cells and human pluripotent stem
      cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells showed liver similarity scores of 59.14% and
      32%, respectively, although general liver-specific markers were detected.
      CONCLUSION: Our study describes a quantitative and predictive model for
      differentiated samples, particularly liver-specific cells or organoids; and this 
      model can be further expanded to various tissue-specific organoids; our LiGEP can
      provide useful information and insights regarding the differentiation status of
      in vitro liver models. (Hepatology 2017;66:1662-1674).

TI  - Increasing burden of liver cancer despite extensive use of antiviral agents in a 
      hepatitis B virus-endemic population.
PG  - 1454-1463

AB  - Most mortalities from liver disease and liver cancer worldwide are attributable
      to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus. Despite remarkable advances in 
      the treatment of HBV over past decades, limited population-level data are
      available regarding its impact on burden of liver disease and liver cancer.
      Mortality data from liver disease and liver cancer were obtained from the
      national death certificate database of Korea, an HBV-endemic country, between
      1999 and 2013, and were analyzed by Joinpoint analysis. For liver disease, number
      of annual deaths decreased by 62.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.0-62.6),
      crude death rate (CDR) decreased by 64.6% (95% CI, 64.3-64.9) from 21.2 to 7.5
      per 100,000 population, and age-standardized death rate (ADR) declined by 75.0%
      (95% CI, 74.7-75.3), between 1999 and 2013. In contrast, for liver cancer, number
      of annual deaths increased by 17.8% (95% CI, 17.6-18.0) and CDR increased by
      10.2% (95% CI, 10.0-10.4) from 20.5 to 22.6, although ADR decreased by 26.9% (95%
      CI, 26.6-27.2). The annual number of patients receiving oral antiviral agents
      against HBV increased from 1,716 to 187,226 during the study period. The increase
      in mean age at death from liver disease was significantly greater than that from 
      liver cancer (8.8 vs. 6.1 years: P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Marked reduction in liver
      disease mortality by widespread use of antiviral treatments against HBV may
      increase the life expectancy and number of patients at risk of developing liver
      cancer, inadvertently leading to increased burden of liver cancer in an
      HBV-endemic population. The competing nature between death from liver disease and
      that from liver cancer should be carefully considered in establishing a health
      care policy. (Hepatology 2017;66:1454-1463).

TI  - The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma decreases after the first 5 years of
      entecavir or tenofovir in Caucasians with chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 1444-1453
LID - 10.1002/hep.29320 [doi]
AB  - Whether there is a change of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in chronic 
      hepatitis B patients under long-term therapy with potent nucleos(t)ide analogues 
      is currently unclear. We therefore assessed the HCC incidence beyond year 5 of
      entecavir/tenofovir (ETV/TDF) therapy and tried to determine possible factors
      associated with late HCC occurrence. This European, 10-center, cohort study
      included 1,951 adult Caucasian chronic hepatitis B patients without HCC at
      baseline who received ETV/TDF for >/=1 year. Of them, 1,205 (62%) patients
      without HCC within the first 5 years of therapy have been followed for 5-10
      (median, 6.8) years. HCCs have been diagnosed in 101/1,951 (5.2%) patients within
      the first 5 years and 17/1,205 (1.4%) patients within 5-10 years. The yearly HCC 
      incidence rate was 1.22% within and 0.73% after the first 5 years (P = 0.050).
      The yearly HCC incidence rate did not differ within and after the first 5 years
      in patients without cirrhosis (0.49% versus 0.47%, P = 0.931), but it
      significantly declined in patients with cirrhosis (3.22% versus 1.57%, P =
      0.039). All HCCs beyond year 5 developed in patients older than 50 years at
      ETV/TDF onset. Older age, lower platelets at baseline and year 5, and liver
      stiffness >/=12 kPa at year 5 were independently associated with more frequent
      HCC development beyond year 5 in multivariable analysis. No patient with low
      Platelets, Age, Gender-Hepatitis B score at baseline or year 5 developed HCC.
      CONCLUSION: The HCC risk decreases beyond year 5 of ETV/TDF therapy in Caucasian 
      chronic hepatitis B patients, particularly in those with compensated cirrhosis;
      older age (especially >/=50 years), lower platelets, and liver stiffness >/=12
      kPa at year 5 represent the main risk factors for late HCC development.

TI  - Critical role of CREBH-mediated induction of transforming growth factor beta2 by 
      hepatitis C virus infection in fibrogenic responses in hepatic stellate cells.
PG  - 1430-1443
LID - 10.1002/hep.29319 [doi]
AB  - Mechanisms of hepatic fibrogenesis induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV), one of the
      leading causes of liver fibrosis, are not fully understood. We studied
      transcriptional up-regulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta),
      especially TGF-beta2, which is mediated by activation of liver-enriched
      transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, hepatocyte specific
      (CREBH) triggered by HCV infection and its functional significance for induction 
      of profibrogenic phenotypes by interaction of HCV-infected cells with hepatic
      stellate cells (HSCs). Compared to TGF-beta1, expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA was
      induced faster and to a higher level upon HCV infection. Serum TGF-beta2 levels
      in hepatitis C patients were higher compared to those in healthy individuals and 
      were positively correlated with hepatic fibrosis stages F0-F2. TGF-beta2 promoter
      activity was decreased and increased, respectively, by silencing and
      overexpression of CREBH. CREBH recognition sites were identified in the TGF-beta2
      promoter. CREBH binding to the promoter and its increase in cells expressing HCV 
      Core-NS2 were shown by gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation,
      respectively. The active form of CREBH was detectable in HCV-infected chimeric
      mice with human livers and cells expressing HCV proteins. Involvement of CREBH in
      HCV-induced fibrogenic response was further demonstrated in the CREBH null-mutant
      mouse model. Fibrogenic phenotypes were assessed using co-cultures of
      HCV-infected cells and HSCs. Expressions of fibrogenic factors and TGF-beta1
      increasing in the co-cultures was prevented by TGF-beta2- or CREBH silencing.
      CONCLUSION: CREBH was identified as a key positive regulator of TGF-beta2
      transcription in HCV-infected cells. TGF-beta2 released from infected cells
      potentially contributes to cross-induction of TGF-beta in an autocrine manner
      through its own signaling pathway, leading to an increase in fibrogenic responses
      in adjacent HSCs. (Hepatology 2017;66:1430-1443).

TI  - Antiplatelet therapy and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic
      hepatitis B patients on antiviral treatment.
PG  - 1556-1569
LID - 10.1002/hep.29318 [doi]
AB  - Antiplatelet therapy has shown protective effects against hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) in preclinical studies. However, it is unclear whether
      antiplatelet therapy lowers the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
      A retrospective analysis was conducted of data from 1,674 chronic hepatitis B
      patients, enrolled between January 2002 and May 2015, whose serum hepatitis B
      virus DNA levels were suppressed by antivirals to <2,000 IU/mL. The primary and
      secondary outcomes were development of HCC and bleeding events, respectively.
      Risk was compared between patients with antiplatelet treatment (aspirin,
      clopidogrel, or both; antiplatelet group) and patients who were not treated
      (non-antiplatelet group) using a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model for 
      total population and propensity score-matching analysis. The antiplatelet group
      included 558 patients, and the non-antiplatelet group had 1,116 patients. During 
      the study period, 63 patients (3.8%) developed HCC. In time-varying Cox
      proportional analyses, the antiplatelet group showed a significantly lower risk
      of HCC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.85; P =
      0.01), regardless of antiplatelet agent. In propensity score-matched pairs,
      antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced the risk of HCC (HR, 0.34; 95% CI,
      0.15-0.77; P = 0.01). However, the overall risk of bleeding was higher in the
      antiplatelet group (HR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.98-5.42; P < 0.001), particularly for
      clopidogrel with or without aspirin. Treatment with aspirin alone was not
      associated with a higher bleeding risk (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.48-2.54; P = 0.81).
      CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of HCC in chronic hepatitis B
      patients whose hepatitis B virus is effectively suppressed. However, antiplatelet
      therapy containing clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding. (Hepatology
      2017;66:1556-1569).

TI  - High hepatitis C cure rates among black and nonblack human immunodeficiency
      virus-infected adults in an urban center.
PG  - 1402-1412
LID - 10.1002/hep.29308 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cure rates have been similar in patients with and without
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection; however, in the ION-4 study,
      black patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) were significantly
      less likely to achieve cure (90%) compared to nonblack patients (99%). There are 
      limited real-world data on the effectiveness of oral direct-acting antivirals
      (DAAs) in predominantly minority HIV/HCV coinfected populations. We analyzed HCV 
      treatment outcomes among 255 HCV coinfected patients initiating DAAs between
      February 2014 and March 2016 in an urban clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. To
      facilitate adherence, patients received standardized HIV nurse/pharmacist
      support, which included nurse visits and telephone calls. Median age was 43
      years, 88% were black, 73% male, 69% had a history of injection drug use, 45% a
      history of hazardous alcohol use, and 57% a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis.
      Median CD4 count was 577 (interquartile range, 397-820) cells/mm(3) ; most (97%) 
      were on antiretroviral therapy, had HIV RNA <20 copies/mL (87%), and were
      infected with HCV genotype 1 (98%). Over 60% had significant fibrosis (Fibrosis-4
      Index score 1.45-3.25 [44%] and >3.25 [17%, cirrhosis]) and 30% were HCV
      treatment experienced. The majority of patients received LDV/SOF with or without 
      ribavirin (91%) and were treated for 12 weeks. Overall, the sustained virological
      response rate was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-98) and did not vary by
      race (black, 96% [95% CI, 93-98]; nonblack, 97%, [95% CI, 83-99]), history of
      injection drug use, alcohol use, or psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: HCV
      treatment was highly effective among HIV-infected patients who received care
      within an integrated nurse/pharmacist adherence support program. These results
      suggest that race and psychosocial comorbidity may not be barriers to HCV
      elimination. (Hepatology 2017;66:1402-1412).

TI  - Hepatitis B virus X protein-elevated MSL2 modulates hepatitis B virus covalently 
      closed circular DNA by inducing degradation of APOBEC3B to enhance
      hepatocarcinogenesis.
PG  - 1413-1429
LID - 10.1002/hep.29316 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause in the occurrence of
      hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer, in which nuclear HBV covalently
      closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the genomic form that templates viral transcription
      and sustains viral persistence, plays crucial roles. In the present study, we
      explored the hypothesis that HBV X protein (HBx)-elevated male-specific lethal 2 
      (MSL2) activated HBV replication by modulating cccDNA in hepatoma cells, leading 
      to hepatocarcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the
      expression of MSL2 was positively associated with that of HBV and was increased
      in the liver tissues of HBV-transgenic mice and clinical HCC patients.
      Interestingly, microarray profiling identified that MSL2 was associated with
      those genes responding to the virus. Mechanistically, MSL2 could maintain HBV
      cccDNA stability through degradation of APOBEC3B by ubiquitylation in hepatoma
      cells. Above all, HBx accounted for the up-regulation of MSL2 in stably
      HBx-transfected hepatoma cell lines and liver tissues of HBx-transgenic mice.
      Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that the promoter region of MSL2
      regulated by HBx was located at nucleotide -1317/-1167 containing FoxA1 binding
      element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay validated that HBx could enhance the
      binding property of FoxA1 to MSL2 promoter region. HBx up-regulated MSL2 by
      activating YAP/FoxA1 signaling. Functionally, silencing MSL2 was able to block
      the growth of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: HBx-elevated MSL2

      Information to support informed choices.
PG  - 1546-1555
LID - 10.1002/hep.29315 [doi]
AB  - Surveillance by ultrasonography for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for
      individuals with cirrhosis is recommended. There is debate regarding the
      effectiveness of surveillance in reducing mortality, and there is little
      information on the harms available to patients considering surveillance. The aim 
      of this study was to provide estimates of both the benefit and harms of
      surveillance. A Markov model was built to simulate outcomes of individuals aged
      50 years with well-compensated cirrhosis entering surveillance. Following
      identification of a focal lesion by ultrasound surveillance, further
      investigations were defined by the European Association for the Study of the
      Liver/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer recall policy.
      Benefit and harm outcomes are expressed per 1,000 patients over 5 years. For
      every 1,000 patients in surveillance over 5 years, there are 13 fewer deaths (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 12-14) compared with no surveillance, equating to a
      number needed to screen to prevent one death from HCC of 77. In comparison, many 
      more individuals experienced harm through surveillance. For every 1,000 patients,
      150 (95% CI, 146-154) had one or more false-positive tests equating to a number
      needed to harm from surveillance of 7. As a consequence of a false-positive test,
      65 individuals required at least one additional unnecessary computed tomography
      scan or magnetic resonance imaging and 39 required an unnecessary liver biopsy
      according to the recall policy. Surveillance benefits were sensitive to the
      incidence of HCC and the mortality benefit achieved by treatment. Harms were
      sensitive to the rates of false-positive testing and the frequency of liver
      biopsy. CONCLUSION: There is a balance between the small absolute mortality
      benefit to surveillance for HCC and the numerically more frequent harms resulting
      from false-positive testing. Implementation of the recently revised American
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommendations is predicted to
      reduce harms from unnecessary liver biopsy. (Hepatology 2017;66:1546-1555).

TI  - Calcium-binding protein 39 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma growth and
      metastasis by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.
PG  - 1529-1545
LID - 10.1002/hep.29312 [doi]
AB  - Calcium-binding protein (CAB39) is a key regulator of a group of sterile 20
      kinases. Here, we report that CAB39 was frequently up-regulated in hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), which was significantly associated with tumor metastasis (P =
      0.000), poorer disease-free survival rate (P = 0.027), and poor prognosis (P =
      0.000). Ectopic expression of CAB39 in immortalized human liver cell line LO2 and
      HCC cell lines QGY-7703 and BEL-7402 could increase foci formation, colony
      formation in soft agar, tumor formation in nude mice, and cell motility.
      Silencing CAB39 expression in two HCC cell lines, Huh7 and MHCC97H, with short
      hairpin RNA could effectively abolish its oncogenic function. Further study found
      that CAB39 contributed to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway
      activation, and mutations of the key sites of CAB39 markedly decrease the level
      of phosphorylated ERK. In addition, CAB39 could promote epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition by up-regulating N-cadherin and Fibronectin and down-regulating
      E-cadherin and alpha-E-catenin. As a result, beta-catenin nuclear translocation
      was increased and its downstream target gene, matrix metalloproteinase-9, was
      up-regulated. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings suggested that CAB39
      played very important oncogenic roles in HCC pathogenesis and progression by
      activating the ERK signaling pathway. Better understanding of CAB39 may lead to
      its clinical application as a biomarker for a prognosis predictor and a novel
      therapeutic target. (Hepatology 2017;66:1529-1545).

TI  - Bone morphogenetic protein signaling governs biliary-driven liver regeneration in
      zebrafish through tbx2b and id2a.
PG  - 1616-1630
LID - 10.1002/hep.29309 [doi]
AB  - Upon mild liver injury, new hepatocytes originate from preexisting hepatocytes.
      However, if hepatocyte proliferation is impaired, a manifestation of severe liver
      injury, biliary epithelial cells (BECs) contribute to new hepatocytes through BEC
      dedifferentiation into liver progenitor cells (LPCs), also termed oval cells or
      hepatoblast-like cells (HB-LCs), and subsequent differentiation into hepatocytes.
      Despite the identification of several factors regulating BEC dedifferentiation
      and activation, little is known about factors involved in the regulation of LPC
      differentiation into hepatocytes during liver regeneration. Using a zebrafish
      model of near-complete hepatocyte ablation, we show that bone morphogenetic
      protein (Bmp) signaling is required for BEC conversion to hepatocytes,
      particularly for LPC differentiation into hepatocytes. We found that severe liver
      injury led to the up-regulation of genes involved in Bmp signaling, including
      smad5, tbx2b, and id2a, in the liver. Bmp suppression did not block BEC
      dedifferentiation into HB-LCs; however, the differentiation of HB-LCs into
      hepatocytes was impaired due to the maintenance of HB-LCs in an undifferentiated 
      state. Later Bmp suppression did not affect HB-LC differentiation but increased
      BEC number through proliferation. Notably, smad5, tbx2b, and id2a mutants
      exhibited similar liver regeneration defects as those observed in Bmp-suppressed 
      livers. Moreover, BMP2 addition promoted the differentiation of a murine LPC line
      into hepatocytes in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Bmp signaling regulates BEC-driven liver 
      regeneration through smad5, tbx2b, and id2a: it regulates HB-LC differentiation
      into hepatocytes through tbx2b and BEC proliferation through id2a; our findings
      provide insights into promoting innate liver regeneration as a novel therapy.

      A case-control study in southwest China.
PG  - 1519-1528
LID - 10.1002/hep.29310 [doi]
AB  - Microcystins have been reported to be carcinogenic by animal and cell
      experimentation, but there are no data on the linkage between serum microcystins 
      and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in humans. We conducted a clinical
      case-control study to investigate the association between serum microcystins and 
      HCC risk after controlling several known risk factors, such as hepatitis B virus,
      alcohol, and aflatoxin. From December 2013 to May 2016, 214 patients newly
      diagnosed with HCC along with 214 controls (frequency-matched by age and sex)
      were recruited from three hospitals in Chongqing, southwest China. Basic
      information on lifestyle and history of disease was obtained by questionnaire.
      Blood samples were collected and analyzed for serum microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and
      aflatoxin-albumin adduct by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for hepatitis B
      surface antigen status by chemiluminescence assay. Binary logistic regression
      analyses were performed to assess the independent effects of MC-LR and its joint 
      effects with other factors on HCC risk. The adjusted odds ratio for HCC risk by
      serum MC-LR was 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-5.5) in all patients.
      Notably, a clear relationship between increased MC-LR level (Q2, Q3, and Q4) and 
      HCC risk was observed with elevated adjusted odds ratios (1.3, 2.6, and 4.0,
      respectively). Positive interactions with the additive model were investigated
      between MC-LR and hepatitis B virus infection (synergism index = 3.0; 95% CI,
      2.0-4.5) and between MC-LR and alcohol (synergism index = 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7-9.5), 
      while a negative interaction was found between MC-LR and aflatoxin (synergism
      index = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7). Additionally, serum MC-LR was significantly
      associated with tumor differentiation (r = -0.228, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We
      provide evidence that serum MC-LR was an independent risk factor for HCC in
      humans, with an obvious positive interaction with hepatitis B virus and alcohol
      but a negative interaction with aflatoxin. (Hepatology 2017;66:1519-1528).

TI  - Regulatory T-cell conditioning endows activated effector T cells with suppressor 
      function in autoimmune hepatitis/autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis.
PG  - 1570-1584
LID - 10.1002/hep.29307 [doi]
AB  - Imbalance between T regulatory (Treg) and T effector (Teff) cells is likely to
      contribute to the induction and perpetuation of liver damage in autoimmune
      hepatitis (AIH) and autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (AISC) either through
      inability of Tregs to restrain proliferation and effector cytokine production by 
      responders or through conversion of Tregs into T helper type 1 (Th1) or type 17
      (Th17) effector lymphocytes. We investigated the effect of Treg skewing on the
      phenotypic and functional properties of CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells, an
      activated subset of Teff, in 32 patients with AIH and 20 with AISC and in 36
      healthy subjects. In AIH/AISC we noted a substantial increase in peripheral
      blood-derived CD4(+) CD127(+) CD25(high) cells that display a Th1/Th17 phenotypic
      profile, as reflected by heightened interferon gamma and interleukin 17 (IL-17)
      production as well as by high levels of T-bet and related orphan receptor 3
      expression, which is strongly correlated with disease activity. CD4(+) CD127(+)
      CD25(high) cells are unresponsive to low-dose IL-2 and in patients have marked
      proliferative ability, further enhanced by stimulation with IL-7. CD4(+) CD127(+)
      CD25(high) cells obtained from CD4(+) cells exposed to Treg polarizing conditions
      display enhanced IL-10 production; up-regulate CD49b and LAG-3, markers of T
      regulatory 1 cells; and effectively suppress responder cell proliferation in both
      healthy subjects and AIH/AISC patients through a mechanism which is dependent on 
      interferon gamma and IL-17. The suppressive function of CD4(+) CD127(+)
      CD25(high) cells is maintained upon proinflammatory challenge in healthy subjects
      but not in AIH/AISC. CONCLUSION: Treg skewing confers activated Teff phenotypic
      and functional properties of T regulatory 1 cells in health and in AIH/AISC,
      though suppressive function is lost in patients upon proinflammatory challenge;
      protracted modulation of the inflammatory environment is required to attenuate
      the effector potential while boosting immunoregulatory properties in Teff.

TI  - Comparison of laboratory tests, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance elastography to
      detect fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1486-1501
LID - 10.1002/hep.29302 [doi]
AB  - Many noninvasive methods for diagnosing liver fibrosis (LF) have been proposed.
      To determine the best method for diagnosing LF in nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD), we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to compare the 
      performance of aspartate aminotransferase to platelets ratio index (APRI),
      fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), BARD score, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FibroScan,
      shear wave elastography (SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for
      diagnosing LF in NAFLD. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive
      predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of these noninvasive methods for detecting
      significant fibrosis (SF), advanced fibrosis (AF), and cirrhosis. Heterogeneity
      was explored using meta-regression. Sixty-four articles with a total of 13,046
      NAFLD subjects were included. The overall mean prevalence of SF, AF, and
      cirrhosis was 45.0%, 24.0%, and 9.4% in NAFLD patients, respectively. With an
      APRI threshold of 1.0 and 1.5, the sensitivities and specificities were 50.0% and
      84.0% and 18.3% and 96.1%, respectively, for AF. With a FIB-4 threshold of 2.67
      and 3.25, the sensitivities and specificities were 26.6% and 96.5% and 31.8% and 
      96.0%, respectively, for AF. The summary sensitivities and specificities of BARD 
      score (threshold of 2), NFS (threshold of -1.455), FibroScan M (threshold of
      8.7-9), SWE, and MRE for detecting AF were 0.76 and 0.61, 0.72 and 0.70, 0.87 and
      0.79, 0.90 and 0.93, and 0.84 and 0.90, respectively. The summary AUROC values
      using APRI, FIB-4, BARD score, NFS, FibroScan M probe, XL probe, SWE, and MRE for
      diagnosing AF were 0.77, 0.84, 0.76, 0.84, 0.88, 0.85, 0.95, and 0.96,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: MRE and SWE may have the highest diagnostic accuracy
      for staging fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Among the four noninvasive simple
      indexes, NFS and FIB-4 probably offer the best diagnostic performance for
      detecting AF. (Hepatology 2017;66:1486-1501).

TI  - Significance of oliguria in critically ill patients with chronic liver disease.
PG  - 1592-1600
LID - 10.1002/hep.29303 [doi]
AB  - Clinical guidelines recommend using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
      (KDIGO) criteria for the diagnosis and classification of acute kidney injury
      (AKI) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Concerns have been raised
      about the use of urine output (UO) criteria in CLD. We examined the significance 
      of oliguria meeting the urine output criteria for AKI (AKI-UO) and examined its
      association with clinical outcomes in CLD patients. Using an 8-year clinical
      database from a large university medical center, 3458 patients with CLD were
      identified. AKI occurred in 2854 (82.5%) patients when they fulfilled any KDIGO
      criteria. When serum creatinine (SC) and UO criteria were used, 604 patients
      (17.5%) had no evidence of AKI and had the lowest hospital mortality rate (5%).
      Using AKI-UO criteria alone, 2103 patients (60.8%) were classified as stage 2-3
      AKI. When only SC criteria were applied, 1281 (61%) of those patients with stage 
      2-3 AKI-UO were misclassified as either no AKI or AKI stage 1. Patients
      reclassified with AKI according to UO criteria (AKI-UO) had nearly a 3-fold
      increased rate of hospital mortality compared with patients without any AKI
      (14.6% versus 5%; P < 0.001) and more than a 50% increased mortality compared
      with stage 1 AKI-SC (14.6% versus 9%; P < 0.001). Patients with transient
      oliguria (AKI-UO stage 1) had increased mortality rates compared with patients
      without oliguria (14.9% versus 6.9%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CLD patients have a 
      high incidence of AKI. Compared with creatinine criteria alone, incorporating UO 
      into the diagnostic criteria increased the measured incidence of AKI. Stage 2-3
      AKI-UO has a high negative impact on hospital mortality. (Hepatology
      2017;66:1592-1600).

AB  - Genetic mutations leading to oncogenic variants of receptor tyrosine kinases
      (RTKs) are frequent events during tumorigenesis; however, the cellular
      vulnerability to nononcogenic RTK fluctuations has not been characterized. Here, 
      we demonstrated genetically that in the liver subtle increases in wild-type Met
      RTK levels are sufficient for spontaneous tumors in mice (Alb-R26(Met) ),
      conceptually illustrating how the shift from physiological to pathological
      conditions results from slight perturbations in signaling dosage. By analyzing 96
      different genes in a panel of tumor samples, we demonstrated that liver
      tumorigenesis modeled by Alb-R26(Met) mice corresponds to a subset of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, thus establishing the clinical relevance
      of this HCC mouse model. We elucidated the regulatory networks underlying
      tumorigenesis by combining a phosphokinome screen with bioinformatics analysis.
      We then used the signaling diversity results obtained from Alb-R26(Met) HCC
      versus control livers to design an "educated guess" drug screen, which led to the
      identification of new, deleterious synthetic lethal interactions. In particular, 
      we report synergistic effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase,
      ribosomal S6 kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1/2 in combination with Bcl-XL
      inhibition on a panel of liver cancer cells. Focusing on mitogen-activated
      protein kinase kinase and Bcl-XL targeting, we mechanistically demonstrated
      concomitant down-regulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase and myeloid cell leukemia 1 levels. Of note, a phosphorylated
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase+/BCL-XL(+) /myeloid cell leukemia 1+
      signature, deregulated in Alb-R26(Met) tumors, characterizes a subgroup of HCC
      patients with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our genetic studies highlight the
      heightened vulnerability of liver cells to subtle changes in nononcogenic RTK
      levels, allowing them to acquire a molecular profile that facilitates the full
      tumorigenic program; furthermore, our outcomes uncover new synthetic lethal
      interactions as potential therapies for a cluster of HCC patients. (Hepatology

AB  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder
      characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and/or extrahepatic bile
      ducts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging modality that
      can be used to diagnose PSC and detect disease related complications.
      Quantitative MRI technologies also have the potential to provide valuable
      prognostic information. Despite the potential of this imaging technology, the
      clinical application of MRI in the care of PSC patients and imaging standards
      vary across institutions. Moreover, a unified position statement about the role
      of MRI in the care of PSC patients, quality imaging standards, and its potential 
      as a research tool is lacking. CONCLUSION: Members of the International PSC Study
      Group and radiologists from North America and Europe have compiled the following 
      position statement to provide guidance regarding the application of MRI in the
      care of PSC patients, minimum imaging standards, and future areas of research.

TI  - Syndecan-1 limits the progression of liver injury and promotes liver repair in
      acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice.
PG  - 1601-1615
LID - 10.1002/hep.29265 [doi]
AB  - Accidental or intentional misuse of acetaminophen (APAP) is the leading cause of 
      acute liver failure in the Western world. Although mechanisms that trigger
      APAP-induced liver injury (AILI) are well known, those that halt the progression 
      of APAP liver disease and facilitate liver recovery are less understood. Heparan 
      sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) bind to and regulate various tissue injury factors 
      through their heparan sulfate (HS) chains, but the importance of HSPGs in liver
      injury in vivo remains unknown. Here, we examined the role of syndecan-1, the
      major cell-surface HSPG of hepatocytes, in AILI. Ablation of syndecan-1 in mice
      led to unopposed progression of liver injury upon APAP overdose. However, direct 
      APAP hepatoxicity and liver injury at early times post-APAP overdose were
      unaffected by syndecan-1, suggesting that syndecan-1 influences later mechanisms 
      that lead to liver repair. The exuberant liver injury phenotypes in syndecan-1
      null (Sdc1(-/-) ) mice were traced to a deficiency in protein kinase B (Akt)
      activation in hepatocytes, which led to a delayed increase in glycogen synthase
      kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta)-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of Akt
      worsened, whereas inhibition of GSK-3beta and caspases protected mice from AILI. 
      Moreover, administration of purified syndecan-1, HS, or engineered heparan
      compounds containing 2-O-sulfate groups rescued Sdc1(-/-) mice from AILI by
      potentiating Akt signaling and inhibiting GSK-3beta-mediated apoptosis in
      hepatocytes. In addition, HS showed a significantly prolonged therapeutic
      efficacy as compared to N-acetylcysteine. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate
      that 2-O-sulfated domains in syndecan-1 HS halt disease progression and promote
      liver repair by enhancing hepatocyte survival in AILI. We propose that syndecan-1
      is a critical endogenous factor that controls the balance between prosurvival
      signaling and apoptosis in hepatocytes in APAP liver disease. (Hepatology

TI  - Hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids is mediated by both sodium taurocholate
      cotransporting polypeptide and organic anion transporting polypeptides and
      modulated by intestinal sensing of plasma bile acid levels in mice.
PG  - 1631-1643
LID - 10.1002/hep.29251 [doi]
AB  - The Na(+) -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1) is believed to 
      be pivotal for hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids. However, plasma bile acid
      levels are normal in a subset of NTCP knockout mice and in mice treated with
      myrcludex B, a specific NTCP inhibitor. Here, we elucidated which transport
      proteins mediate the hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids and demonstrated
      intestinal sensing of elevated bile acid levels in plasma in mice. Mice or
      healthy volunteers were treated with myrcludex B. Hepatic bile acid uptake
      kinetics were determined in wild-type (WT), organic anion transporting
      polypeptide (OATP) knockout mice (lacking Slco1a/1b isoforms), and human
      OATP1B1-transgenic mice. Effects of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) on
      hepatic transporter mRNA levels were assessed in rat hepatoma cells and in mice
      by peptide injection or adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression. NTCP
      inhibition using myrcludex B had only moderate effects on bile acid kinetics in
      WT mice, but completely inhibited active transport of conjugated bile acid
      species in OATP knockout mice. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase Cyp7a1 expression
      was strongly down-regulated upon prolonged inhibition of hepatic uptake of
      conjugated bile acids. Fgf15 (mouse counterpart of FGF19) expression was induced 
      in hypercholanemic OATP and NTCP knockout mice, as well as in myrcludex B-treated
      cholestatic mice, whereas plasma FGF19 was not induced in humans treated with
      myrcludex B. Fgf15/FGF19 expression was induced in polarized human
      enterocyte-models and mouse organoids by basolateral incubation with a high
      concentration (1 mM) of conjugated bile acids. CONCLUSION: NTCP and OATPs
      contribute to hepatic uptake of conjugated bile acids in mice, whereas the
      predominant uptake in humans is NTCP mediated. Enterocytes sense highly elevated 
      levels of (conjugated) bile acids in the systemic circulation to induce FGF15/19,
      which modulates hepatic bile acid synthesis and uptake. (Hepatology

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) exhibit a diversity of molecular phenotypes,
      raising major challenges in clinical management. HCCs detected by surveillance
      programs at an early stage are candidates for potentially curative therapies
      (local ablation, resection, or transplantation). In the long term,
      transplantation provides the lowest recurrence rates. Treatment allocation is
      based on tumor number, size, vascular invasion, performance status, functional
      liver reserve, and the prediction of early (<2 years) recurrence, which reflects 
      the intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor. Well-differentiated, potentially
      low-aggressiveness tumors form the heterogeneous molecular class of
      nonproliferative HCCs, characterized by an approximate 50% beta-catenin mutation 
      rate. To define the clinical, pathological, and molecular features and the
      outcome of nonproliferative HCCs, we constructed a 1,133-HCC transcriptomic
      metadata set and validated findings in a publically available 210-HCC RNA
      sequencing set. We show that nonproliferative HCCs preserve the zonation program 
      that distributes metabolic functions along the portocentral axis in normal liver.
      More precisely, we identified two well-differentiated, nonproliferation
      subclasses, namely periportal-type (wild-type beta-catenin) and perivenous-type
      (mutant beta-catenin), which expressed negatively correlated gene networks. The
      new periportal-type subclass represented 29% of all HCCs; expressed a hepatocyte 
      nuclear factor 4A-driven gene network, which was down-regulated in mouse
      hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A knockout mice; were early-stage tumors by Barcelona 
      Clinic Liver Cancer, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program, and
      tumor-node-metastasis staging systems; had no macrovascular invasion; and showed 
      the lowest metastasis-specific gene expression levels and TP53 mutation rates.
      Also, we identified an eight-gene periportal-type HCC signature, which was
      independently associated with the highest 2-year recurrence-free survival by
      multivariate analyses in two independent cohorts of 247 and 210 patients.
      CONCLUSION: Well-differentiated HCCs display mutually exclusive periportal or
      perivenous zonation programs. Among all HCCs, periportal-type tumors have the
      lowest intrinsic potential for early recurrence after curative resection.

TI  - Magnetic resonance elastography measured shear stiffness as a biomarker of
      fibrosis in pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 1474-1485
LID - 10.1002/hep.29241 [doi]
AB  - Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a promising technique for noninvasive
      assessment of fibrosis, a major determinant of outcome in nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD). However, data in children are limited. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the accuracy of MRE for the detection of fibrosis and
      advanced fibrosis in children with NAFLD and to assess agreement between manual
      and novel automated reading methods. We performed a prospective, multicenter
      study of two-dimensional (2D) MRE in children with NAFLD. MR elastograms were
      analyzed manually at two reading centers, and using a new automated technique.
      Analysis using each approach was done independently. Correlations were determined
      between MRE analysis methods and fibrosis stage. Thresholds for classifying the
      presence of fibrosis and of advanced fibrosis were computed and cross-validated. 
      In 90 children with a mean age of 13.1 +/- 2.4 years, median hepatic stiffness
      was 2.35 kPa. Stiffness values derived by each reading center were strongly
      correlated with each other (r = 0.83). All three analyses were significantly
      correlated with fibrosis stage (center 1, rho = 0.53; center 2, rho = 0.55; and
      automated analysis, rho = 0.52; P < 0.001). Overall cross-validated accuracy for 
      detecting any fibrosis was 72.2% for all methods (95% confidence interval [CI],
      61.8%-81.1%). Overall cross-validated accuracy for assessing advanced fibrosis
      was 88.9% (95% CI, 80.5%-94.5%) for center 1, 90.0% (95% CI, 81.9%-95.3%) for
      center 2, and 86.7% (95% CI, 77.9%-92.9%) for automated analysis. CONCLUSION: 2D 
      MRE can estimate hepatic stiffness in children with NAFLD. Further refinement and
      validation of automated analysis techniques will be an important step in
      standardizing MRE. How to best integrate MRE into clinical protocols for the
      assessment of NAFLD in children will require prospective evaluation. (Hepatology

LID - 10.1002/hep.29240 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of outcome according to the time frame can help
      optimize the therapeutic development in severe alcoholic hepatitis. We assessed
      short-term and long-term survival in severe alcoholic hepatitis based on baseline
      disease severity, extent of therapeutic improvement, long-term influence of
      alcohol relapse, and their interaction. Data and alcohol consumption were
      prospectively recorded in 398 patients treated with corticosteroids in the short 
      term (from corticosteroid initiation to 6 months) and long term (from 6 months to
      maximum follow-up time). Cumulative incidence rate of first alcohol relapse was
      25.2%, 33.7%, and 35.2% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Alcohol relapse
      (>/=30 g/day) was not associated with mortality (P = 0.24) during the short-term 
      period (1,606 patient-months at risk), but the Lille (P < 0.0001) and Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease (P < 0.0001) scores were independent prognostic factors. 
      In patients who were alive at 6 months (median follow-up, 42 months;
      interquartile range 11-88), corresponding to 10,413 patient-months at risk,
      alcohol consumption (>/=30 g/day) was associated with mortality (hazard ratio,
      3.9; P < 0.0001). Additional analysis with abstinent patients as a reference
      showed a dose effect of alcohol on the hazard ratio of death: 2.36 (P = 0.052)
      for 1-29 g/day, 3.2 (P = 0.003) for 30-49 g/day, 3.51 (P < 0.0001) for 50-99
      g/day, and 5.61 (P < 0.0001) for >/= 100 g/day. The baseline Model for End-Stage 
      Liver Disease score was not predictive of long-term outcome, while Lille score (P
      = 0.02) and alcohol relapse (P < 0.0001) were independent prognostic factors.
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that new therapeutic development for severe
      alcoholic hepatitis must target liver injury in the short term and alcohol
      consumption in the long term; thus, health agencies can endorse future study
      designs adapted to the time frame of factors influencing mortality; with this in 
      mind, drug-targeting mechanisms involved in liver injury should only be tested
      for the short-term period. (Hepatology 2017;66:1464-1473).

TI  - Benefit-risk assessment for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir based on patient 
      population and hepatitis C virus genotype: U. S. Food and Drug Administration's
      evaluation.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29601 [doi]
AB  - On July 18, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) (Vosevi) fixed-dose combination
      (FDC), an interferon-free, complete regimen for adult patients with chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
      (Child-Pugh A) who have: * genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and have
      previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing a nonstructural protein 5A
      (NS5A) inhibitor; and * genotype 1a or 3 infection and have previously been
      treated with an HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.
      Approval was based on an acceptable safety profile and high sustained virological
      response rates 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) in two phase 3
      clinical trials in subjects previously treated with a direct-acting antiviral
      (DAA) regimen. In POLARIS-1, 96% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. 
      In POLARIS-4, 98% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. A key and
      challenging question in evaluating the data was determining the contribution of
      VOX to SOF/VEL and how this differed depending on the genotype and patient
      population. In this article, we provide our perspective on the issues considered 
      in making these determinations, especially regarding the POLARIS-4 data in
      subjects who have previously been treated with a chronic HCV regimen containing
      sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor. CONCLUSION: We seek to provide context as
      to why a broad indication was given for NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients (HCV 
      genotypes 1-6) while the indication for NS5A inhibitor- naive patients was
      limited to HCV genotypes 1a and 3 only. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Case definitions for inclusion and analysis of endpoints in clinical trials for
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis through the lens of regulatory science.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29607 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important cause of liver-related
      morbidity and mortality. There are no approved therapies, and the results of
      clinical trials have been difficult to compare due to inconsistent definitions of
      relevant disease parameters in patients with NASH. The natural course of the
      disease has not been rigorously characterized, particularly with respect to the
      contributions of underlying obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other comorbidities and
      the treatments provided for these comorbidities. Efforts to perform analyses of
      pooled data are limited by heterogeneous case definitions used across studies to 
      define disease states. There remains a major unmet need in the field to develop
      standardized definitions for populations for interventional trials. Such
      definitions are expected to impact how endpoints for clinical trials are
      constructed. The Liver Forum is a multistakeholder effort including US and
      European regulatory agencies, academic investigators, professional and patient
      representative organizations, and industry to catalyze therapeutic development
      for NASH by developing potential solutions to barriers to development. The Case
      Definitions Working Group was established by The Liver Forum to evaluate the
      validity of case definitions for populations to be included in clinical trials
      for NASH from a regulatory science perspective. Based on such analyses, specific 
      recommendations are provided noting the strengths and weaknesses of the case
      definitions along with knowledge gaps that require additional study. (Hepatology 
      2017).

TI  - Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth and metabolic maturation in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29613 [doi]
AB  - Postnatal liver development is characterized by hepatocyte growth, proliferation,
      and functional maturation. Notably, canonical Wnt signaling in hepatocytes has
      been identified as an important regulator of final adult liver size and metabolic
      liver zonation. The cellular origin of Wnt ligands responsible for homeostatic
      liver/body weight ratio (LW/BW) remained unclear, which was also attributable to 
      a lack of suitable endothelial Cre driver mice. To comprehensively analyze the
      effects of hepatic angiocrine Wnt signaling on liver development and metabolic
      functions, we used endothelial subtype-specific Stab2-Cre driver mice to delete
      Wls from hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). The resultant Stab2-Cre(tg/wt)
      ;Wls(fl/fl) (Wls-HECKO) mice were viable, but showed a significantly reduced
      LW/BW. Specifically, ablation of angiocrine Wnt signaling impaired metabolic
      zonation in the liver, as shown by loss of pericentral, beta-catenin-dependent
      target genes such as glutamine synthase (Glul), RhBg, Axin2, and cytochrome P450 
      2E1, as well as by extended expression of periportal genes such as arginase 1.
      Furthermore, endothelial subtype-specific expression of a c-terminally YFP-tagged
      Wls fusion protein in Wls-HECKO mice (Stab2-Cre(tg/wt) ;Wls(fl/fl)
      ;Rosa26:Wls-YFP(fl/wt) [Wls-rescue]) restored metabolic liver zonation.
      Interestingly, lipid metabolism was altered in Wls-HECKO mice exhibiting
      significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, while maintaining normal plasma 
      triglyceride and blood glucose concentrations. On the contrary, zonal expression 
      of Endomucin, LYVE1, and other markers of HEC heterogeneity were not altered in
      Wls-HECKO livers. CONCLUSION: Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth as
      well as development of metabolic liver zonation in mice, whereas intrahepatic HEC
      zonation is not affected. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Impact of Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma on Survival in Patients with 
      Compensated Cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29594 [doi]
AB  - Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been recommended in patients 
      with cirrhosis. In this work, we examine the extent to which the competing risk
      of hepatic decompensation influences the benefit of HCC surveillance, by
      investigating the impact of availability of liver transplantation (LTx) and rate 
      of progression of hepatic decompensation on survival gain from HCC surveillance. 
      A multistate Markov model was constructed simulating a cohort of 50-year old
      patients with compensated cirrhosis. The primary outcome of interest was
      all-cause and HCC-specific mortality. The main input data included incidence of
      HCC, sensitivity of screening test, and mortality from hepatic decompensation.
      Treatment modalities modeled included LTx, resection, and radiofrequency
      ablation. In the base case scenario, LTx would be available to rescue a
      proportion of patient from deaths. In the absence of surveillance, 68.2% of the
      cohort members died by 15 years, which was from HCC in 25.1% and from hepatic
      decompensation in 43.6% of decedents. With surveillance, the median survival
      improved from 10.4 years to 11.2 years. The number needed to be under
      surveillance to reduce one all- cause and HCC-specific death over 15 years was 28
      and 18, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, incidence of HCC and progression
      of cirrhosis had the strongest effect on the benefit of surveillance, whereas LTx
      availability had negligible impact. CONCLUSIONS: HCC surveillance decreases
      all-cause and tumor-specific mortality in patients with compensated cirrhosis
      regardless of LTx availability. In addition, incidence of HCC and sensitivity of 
      surveillance test also had a substantial impact on the benefits of surveillance.

TI  - A randomized trial of obeticholic acid monotherapy in patients with primary
      biliary cholangitis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29569 [doi]
AB  - Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent farnesoid X receptor agonist, was studied as
      monotherapy in an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      phase 2 study in patients with primary biliary cholangitis who were then followed
      for up to 6 years. The goals of the study were to assess the benefit of OCA in
      the absence of ursodeoxycholic acid, which is relevant for patients who are
      intolerant of ursodeoxycholic acid and at higher risk of disease progression.
      Patients were randomized and dosed with placebo (n = 23), OCA 10 mg (n = 20), or 
      OCA 50 mg (n = 16) given as monotherapy once daily for 3 months (1 randomized
      patient withdrew prior to dosing). The primary endpoint was the percent change in
      alkaline phosphatase from baseline to the end of the double-blind phase of the
      study. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to month
      3/early termination in markers of cholestasis, hepatocellular injury, and
      farnesoid X receptor activation. Efficacy and safety continue to be monitored
      through an ongoing 6-year open-label extension (N = 28). Alkaline phosphatase was
      reduced in both OCA groups (median% [Q1, Q3], OCA 10 mg -53.9% [-62.5, -29.3],
      OCA 50 mg -37.2% [-54.8, -24.6]) compared to placebo (-0.8% [-6.4, 8.7]; P <
      0.0001) at the end of the study, with similar reductions observed through 6 years
      of open-label extension treatment. OCA improved many secondary and exploratory
      endpoints (including gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase,
      conjugated bilirubin, and immunoglobulin M). Pruritus was the most common adverse
      event; 15% (OCA 10 mg) and 38% (OCA 50 mg) discontinued due to pruritus.
      CONCLUSION: OCA monotherapy significantly improved alkaline phosphatase and other
      biochemical markers predictive of improved long-term clinical outcomes. Pruritus 
      increased dose-dependently with OCA treatment. Biochemical improvements were
      observed through 6 years of open-label extension treatment. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease impairs expression of the type II inositol
      1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29588 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease
      worldwide. It may result in several types of liver problems, including impaired
      liver regeneration (LR), but the mechanism for this is unknown. Because LR
      depends on calcium signaling, we examined the effects of NAFLD on expression of
      the type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR2), the principle calcium 
      release channel in hepatocytes. ITPR2 promoter activity was measured in Huh7 and 
      HepG2 cells. ITPR2 and c-Jun protein levels were evaluated in Huh7 cells, in
      liver tissue from a rat model of NAFLD, and in liver biopsy specimens of patients
      with simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). LR was assessed in
      wild-type and Itpr2 knockout (Itpr2(-/-) ) mice following 67% hepatectomy. Cell
      proliferation was examined in ITPR2-knockout HepG2 cells generated by the
      CRISPR/Cas9 system. c-Jun dose dependently decreased activity of the human ITPR2 
      promoter. c-Jun expression was increased and ITPR2 was decreased in fat-loaded
      Huh7 cells and in livers of rats fed a high-fat, high-fructose diet.
      Overexpression of c-Jun reduced protein and mRNA expression of ITPR2 in Huh7
      cells, whereas knockdown of c-Jun prevented the decrease of ITPR2 in fat-loaded
      Huh7 cells. ITPR2 expression was decreased and c-Jun was increased in liver
      biopsies of patients with steatosis and NASH compared to controls. ITPR2-knockout
      cells exhibited less nuclear calcium signaling and cell proliferation than
      control cells. LR assessed by Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was
      markedly decreased in Itpr2(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: Fatty liver induces a
      c-Jun-mediated decrease in ITPR2 in hepatocytes. This may account for the
      impaired LR that occurs in NAFLD. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Dual catenin loss in murine liver causes tight junctional deregulation and
      progressive intrahepatic cholestasis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29585 [doi]
AB  - beta-Catenin, the downstream effector of the Wnt signaling, plays important roles
      in hepatic development, regeneration and tumorigenesis. However, its role at
      hepatocyte adherens junctions (AJ) is relatively poorly understood, chiefly due
      to spontaneous compensation by gamma-catenin. Here, we simultaneously ablate
      beta- and gamma-catenin expression in mouse liver by interbreeding
      beta-catenin-gamma-catenin double-floxed mice and albumin-cre transgenic mice.
      Double knockout mice (DKO) show failure to thrive, impaired hepatocyte
      differentiation, cholemia, ductular reaction, progressive cholestasis,
      inflammation, fibrosis and tumorigenesis, which was associated with deregulation 
      of tight junctions (TJ) and bile acid transporters, leading to early morbidity
      and mortality, a phenotype reminiscent of Progressive Familial Intrahepatic
      Cholestasis (PFIC). To address the mechanism, we specifically and temporally
      eliminated both catenins from hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus-8 carrying
      cre-recombinase under the thyroid-binding globulin promoter (AAV8-TBG-Cre). This 
      led to a time-dependent breach of blood bile barrier associated with sequential
      disruption of AJ and TJ verified by ultrastructural imaging and intravital
      microscopy, which revealed unique para-cellular leaks around individual
      hepatocytes allowing mixing of blood and bile, and leakage of blood from one
      sinusoid to another. Molecular analysis identified sequential losses of
      E-cadherin, occludin, claudin-3 and claudin-5 due to enhanced proteasomal
      degradation, and of claudin-2, a beta-catenin transcriptional target, which was
      also validated in vitro. In conclusion, we report partially redundant function of
      catenins at AJ in regulating TJ and contributing to blood bile barrier.
      Furthermore, concomitant hepatic loss of beta- and gamma-catenin disrupts
      structural and functional integrity of AJ and TJ via transcriptional and
      posttranslational mechanisms. Mice with dual catenin loss develop progressive
      intrahepatic cholestasis, and hence provides a unique model to study diseases
      like PFIC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Polycystic liver disease: Hepatic venous outflow obstruction lesions of the
      non-cystic parenchyma have major consequences.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with polycystic liver disease, development of cysts
      induces hepatic venous outflow obstruction (HVOO) and parenchymal modifications, 
      challenging the paradigm of a normal non-cystic liver parenchyma. The aims were
      to reappraise the pathology of the non-cystic parenchyma, by focusing on HVOO
      lesions; and to investigate the association with outflow obstruction at imaging
      and perioperative course after liver resection. METHODS: This is a retrospective 
      study conducted in one tertiary center between 1993 and 2014. Polycystic liver
      disease patients (n=125) who underwent resection (n=90) or transplantation (n=35)
      were included. HVOO parenchymal lesions were assessed for all patients and a
      liver congestion score was built. Imaging was analysed for 45 patients with
      CT-scan and perioperative course was assessed in resected patients. RESULTS: At
      pathology, 92% of the patients had HVOO lesions, sinusoidal dilatation being the 
      most common feature. HVOO was more severe in patients who underwent
      transplantation compared to liver resection, as assessed by the congestion score.
      At imaging, all patients had HVOO with at least two hepatic veins involved.
      Mosaic enhancement pattern of the parenchyma was associated with the severity of 
      hepatic vein obstruction (p=0.045) and the compression of the inferior vena cava 
      (p=0.014). In case of liver resection, intraoperative course was characterized by
      haemorrhage, related to HVOO at imaging. Ascites (44%) and liver failure (9%) in 
      the postoperative period were associated with blood losses and transfusions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic venous outflow obstruction, including development of venous 
      collaterality and parenchymal changes, is frequent in polycystic liver disease
      and has major consequences on intraoperative bleeding and postoperative ascites
      and liver failure. Hepatic venous outflow obstruction should be taken into
      account to choose surgical treatment the most suited. This article is protected

LID - 10.1002/hep.29579 [doi]
AB  - Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe complication of cirrhosis with
      increased risk of mortality. Pulmonary microvascular alterations are key features
      of HPS, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, and studies on HPS
      are limited to rats. Placental growth factor (PlGF), a pro-angiogenic molecule
      that is selectively involved in pathological angiogenesis, may play an important 
      role in HPS development, however, its role has never been investigated. In this
      study, we validated an HPS model by common bile duct ligation (CBDL) in mice,
      investigated the kinetic changes in pulmonary angiogenesis and inflammation
      during HPS development, and provide evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy by 
      targeting pathological angiogenesis. Mice with CBDL developed hypoxemia and
      intrapulmonary shunting on a background of liver fibrosis. Pulmonary alterations 
      included increased levels of pro-angiogenic and inflammatory markers, which was
      confirmed in serum of human HPS patients. Increased PlGF production in HPS mice
      originated from alveolar type II cells and lung macrophages, demonstrated by
      immunofluorescent stainings. Dysfunctional vessel formation in CBDL mice was
      visualized by microscopy on vascular corrosion casts. Both prophylactic and
      therapeutic anti-PlGF (alphaPlGF) antibody treatment impeded HPS development, as 
      demonstrated by significantly less intrapulmonary shunting and improved gas
      exchange. alphaPlGF treatment decreased endothelial cell dysfunction in vivo and 
      in vitro, and was accompanied by reduced pulmonary inflammation. Importantly,
      alphaPlGF therapy did not affect liver alterations, supporting alphaPlGF's
      capability to directly target the pulmonary compartment. CONCLUSION: CBDL in mice
      induces HPS, which is mediated by PlGF production. alphaPlGF treatment improves
      experimental HPS by counteracting pulmonary angiogenesis and might be an
      attractive therapeutic strategy for human HPS. This article is protected by

TI  - Hepatitis B cure: From discovery to regulatory approval.
PG  - 1296-1313
LID - 10.1002/hep.29323 [doi]
AB  - The majority of persons currently treated for chronic hepatitis B require
      long-term or lifelong therapy. New inhibitors of hepatitis B virus entry,
      replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in
      development. The introduction of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B
      necessitates a standardized appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these
      treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical
      trials. To move the field forward and to expedite the pathway from discovery to
      regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 
      to develop a consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical
      trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was that a complete
      sterilizing cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be
      feasible. Instead, a functional cure characterized by sustained loss of hepatitis
      B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion,
      which is associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of
      patients than is currently achieved with existing treatments is a feasible goal. 
      Development of standardized assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining
      hepatitis B virus cure should occur in parallel with development of novel
      antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new treatments
      can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy
      or to predict response. Combination of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies 
      will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited
      proof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity
      should be conducted prior to proceeding to combination therapies. The safety of
      any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of
      currently approved nucleos(t)ide analogues. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Acute hepatic porphyrias: Recommendations for evaluation and long-term
      management.
PG  - 1314-1322
LID - 10.1002/hep.29313 [doi]
AB  - The acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of four inherited disorders, each
      resulting from a deficiency in the activity of a specific enzyme in the heme
      biosynthetic pathway. These disorders present clinically with acute neurovisceral
      symptoms which may be sporadic or recurrent and, when severe, can be
      life-threatening. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the clinical
      features resemble other more common medical conditions. There are four major
      subgroups: symptomatic patients with sporadic attacks (<4 attacks/year) or
      recurrent acute attacks (>/=4 attacks/year), asymptomatic high porphyrin
      precursor excretors, and asymptomatic latent patients without symptoms or
      porphyrin precursor elevations. Given their clinical heterogeneity and potential 
      for significant morbidity with suboptimal management, comprehensive clinical
      guidelines for initial evaluation, follow-up, and long-term management are
      needed, particularly because no guidelines exist for monitoring disease
      progression or response to treatment. The Porphyrias Consortium of the National
      Institutes of Health's Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, which consists of
      expert centers in the clinical management of these disorders, has formulated
      these recommendations. These recommendations are based on the literature, ongoing
      natural history studies, and extensive clinical experience. Initial assessments
      should include diagnostic confirmation by biochemical testing, subsequent genetic
      testing to determine the specific acute hepatic porphyria, and a complete medical
      history and physical examination. Newly diagnosed patients should be counseled
      about avoiding known precipitating factors. The frequency of follow-up depends on
      the clinical subgroup, with close monitoring of patients with recurrent attacks
      who may require treatment modifications as well as those with clinical
      complications. Comprehensive care should include subspecialist referrals when
      needed. Annual assessments include biochemical testing and monitoring for
      long-term complications. These guidelines provide a framework for monitoring
      patients with acute hepatic porphyrias to ensure optimal outcomes. (Hepatology
      2017;66:1314-1322).

TI  - aPKC-iota/P-Sp1/Snail signaling induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and
      immunosuppression in cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 1165-1182
LID - 10.1002/hep.29296 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly malignant bile duct cancer that tends to
      invade and metastasize early. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has
      been implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, as well as in cancer cell
      evasion of host immunity. In this study, we investigated the interaction between 
      atypical protein kinase C-iota (aPKC-iota) and Snail in the regulation of EMT and
      its relationship to CCA immunosuppression. Our results demonstrated that
      aPKC-iota, Snail, and infiltrated immunosuppressive cells were significantly
      up-regulated in CCA tumor tissues and linked to poor prognosis. aPKC-iota induced
      EMT and immunosuppression by regulating Snail in vitro and in vivo, although
      aPKC-iota did not directly interact with Snail in coimmunoprecipitation
      experiments. To further clarify the molecular interaction between aPKC-iota and
      Snail in relation to EMT, quantitative iTRAQ-based phosphoproteomic analysis and 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were conducted to identify the
      substrates of aPKC-iota-dependent phosphorylation. Combined with
      coimmunoprecipitation, we showed that specificity protein 1 (Sp1) was directly
      phosphorylated by aPKC-iota on Ser59 (P-Sp1). Both Sp1 and P-Sp1 were
      up-regulated in CCA tumor tissues and associated with clinicopathological
      features and poor prognosis in CCA patients. Moreover, using chromatin
      immunoprecipitation assays, we found that P-Sp1 regulated Snail expression by
      increasing Sp1 binding to the Snail promoter. P-Sp1 also regulated
      aPKC-iota/Snail-induced EMT-like changes and immunosuppression in CCA cells. Our 
      findings further indicated that CCA cells with EMT-like features appear to
      generate immunosuppressive natural T regulatory-like cluster of differentiation
      4-positive (CD4(+) )CD25(-) cells rather than to increase CD4(+) CD25(+) natural 
      T regulatory cells, in part by mediating T regulatory-inducible cytokines such as
      transforming growth factor beta1 and interleukin 2. CONCLUSION: These results
      demonstrate that aPKC-iota promotes EMT and induces immunosuppression through the
      aPKC-iota/P-Sp1/Snail signaling pathway and may be a potential therapeutic target
      for CCA. (Hepatology 2017;66:1165-1182).

TI  - Serum extracellular vesicles contain protein biomarkers for primary sclerosing
      cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 1125-1143
LID - 10.1002/hep.29291 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) includes a heterogeneous group of biliary cancers with
      poor prognosis. Several conditions, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
      are risk factors. Noninvasive differential diagnosis between intrahepatic CCA and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sometimes difficult. Accurate noninvasive
      biomarkers for PSC, CCA, and HCC are not available. In the search for novel
      biomarkers, serum extracellular vesicles (EV) were isolated from CCA (n = 43),
      PSC (n = 30), or HCC (n = 29) patients and healthy individuals (control, n = 32);
      and their protein content was characterized. By using nanoparticle tracking
      analysis, serum EV concentration was found to be higher in HCC than in all the
      other groups. Round morphology (by transmission electron microscopy), size (
      approximately 180 nm diameter by nanoparticle tracking analysis), and markers
      (clusters of differentiation 9, 63, and 81 by immunoblot) indicated that most
      serum EV were exosomes. Proteome profiles (by mass spectrometry) revealed
      multiple differentially expressed proteins among groups. Several of these
      proteins showed high diagnostic values with maximum area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve of 0.878 for CCA versus control, 0.905 for CCA
      stage I-II versus control, 0.789 for PSC versus control, 0.806 for noncirhottic
      PSC versus control, 0.796 for CCA versus PSC, 0.956 for CCA stage I-II versus
      PSC, 0.904 for HCC versus control, and 0.894 for intrahepatic CCA versus HCC.
      Proteomic analysis of EV derived from CCA human cells in vitro revealed higher
      abundance of oncogenic proteins compared to EV released by normal human
      cholangiocytes. Orthotopic implant of CCA human cells in the liver of
      immunodeficient mice resulted in the release to serum of EV containing some
      similar human oncogenic proteins. CONCLUSION: Proteomic signatures found in serum
      EV of CCA, PSC, and HCC patients show potential usefulness as diagnostic tools.

TI  - Plasma cystatin C is a predictor of renal dysfunction, acute-on-chronic liver
      failure, and mortality in patients with acutely decompensated liver cirrhosis.
PG  - 1232-1241
LID - 10.1002/hep.29290 [doi]
AB  - The development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in patients with liver
      cirrhosis is associated with high mortality rates. Renal failure is the most
      significant organ dysfunction that occurs in ACLF. So far there are no biomarkers
      predicting ACLF. We investigated whether cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) can predict development of renal
      dysfunction (RD), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), ACLF, and mortality. We determined 
      the plasma levels of CysC and NGAL in 429 patients hospitalized for acute
      decompensation of cirrhosis in the EASL-CLIF Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure in
      Cirrhosis (CANONIC) study. The patients were followed for 90 days. Patients
      without RD or ACLF at inclusion but with development of either had significantly 
      higher baseline concentrations of CysC and NGAL compared to patients without.
      CysC, but not NGAL, was found to be predictive of RD (odds ratio, 9.4; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.8-49.7), HRS (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-14.8), and
      ACLF (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.3-25.9). CysC at day 3 was not found to be a
      better predictor than baseline CysC. CysC and NGAL were both predictive of 90-day
      mortality, with hazard ratios for CysC of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.1-4.7) and for NGAL of
      1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.4). CONCLUSION: Baseline CysC is a biomarker of RD, HRS, and
      ACLF and an independent predictor of mortality in patients with acutely
      decompensated liver cirrhosis, though determining CysC at day 3 did not provide
      any benefit; while NGAL is also associated with short-term mortality, it fails to
      predict development of RD, HRS, and ACLF. Baseline CysC may help to identify
      patients at risk earlier and improve clinical management. (Hepatology

TI  - Stratifying risk in the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage: Results of
      an individual patient meta-analysis.
PG  - 1219-1231
LID - 10.1002/hep.29267 [doi]
AB  - Endoscopic variceal ligation plus beta-blockers (EVL+BB) is currently recommended
      for variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, a recommendation that extends to all
      patients with cirrhosis with previous variceal bleeding irrespective of
      prognostic stage. Individualizing patient care is relevant, and in published
      studies on variceal rebleeding prophylaxis, there is a lack of information
      regarding response to therapy by prognostic stage. This study aimed at comparing 
      EVL plus BB with monotherapy (EVL or BB) on all-source rebleeding and mortality
      in patients with cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding stratified by cirrhosis
      severity (Child A versus B/C) by means of individual time-to-event patient data
      meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials. The study used individual data
      on 389 patients from three trials comparing EVL plus BB versus BB and 416
      patients from four trials comparing EVL plus BB versus EVL. Compared with BB
      alone, EVL plus BB reduced overall rebleeding in Child A (incidence rate ratio
      0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.89; P = 0.025) but not in Child B/C,
      without differences in mortality. The effect of EVL on rebleeding was different
      according to Child (P for interaction <0.001). Conversely, compared with EVL, EVL
      plus BB reduced rebleeding in both Child A and B/C, with a significant reduction 
      in mortality in Child B/C (incidence rate ratio 0.46; 95% confidence interval,
      0.25-0.85; P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Outcomes of therapies to prevent variceal
      rebleeding differ depending on cirrhosis severity: in patients with preserved
      liver function (Child A), combination therapy is recommended because it is more
      effective in preventing rebleeding, without modifying survival, while in patients
      with advanced liver failure (Child B/C), EVL alone carries an increased risk of
      rebleeding and death compared with combination therapy, underlining that BB is
      the key element of combination therapy. (Hepatology 2017;66:1219-1231).

TI  - Death and liver transplantation within 2 years of onset of drug-induced liver
      injury.
PG  - 1275-1285
LID - 10.1002/hep.29283 [doi]
AB  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an important cause of death and indication
      for liver transplantation (fatality). The role of DILI in these fatalities is
      poorly characterized, particularly when fatalities occur >26 weeks after DILI
      onset. We analyzed patients in the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network
      prospective study having a fatal outcome within 2 years of onset. Each case was
      reviewed by eight network investigators and categorized as DILI having a primary,
      a contributory, or no role in the fatality. We subcategorized primary role cases 
      as acute, chronic, acute-on-chronic, or acute cholestatic liver failure. For
      contributory and no role cases, we assigned a primary cause of death. Among 1,089
      patients, 107 (9.8%) fatalities occurred within 2 years. DILI had a primary role 
      in 68 (64%), a contributory role in 15 (14%), and no role in 22 (21%); 2 had
      insufficient data. Among primary role cases, 74% had acute, 13% chronic, 7% acute
      on chronic, and 6% acute cholestatic failure. For the 15 contributory role cases,
      common causes of death included sepsis, malignancy, and severe cutaneous
      reactions with multiorgan failure. For the 22 no role cases, malignancies
      accounted for most fatalities. Higher bilirubin, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and 
      thrombocytopenia were independently associated with DILI fatalities. New R ratio 
      Hy's law had a higher positive predictive value for overall fatality (14% versus 
      10%) and a stronger independent association with DILI fatalities within 26 weeks 
      compared to the original version of Hy's law (hazard ratio, 6.2, 95% confidence
      interval 3.4-11.1, versus 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.7). CONCLUSIONS:
      DILI leads directly or indirectly to fatality in 7.6% of cases; 40% of these had 
      nonacute liver failure courses. New R ratio Hy's law better identifies risk for
      death compared to the original Hy's law. (Hepatology 2017;66:1275-1285).

TI  - TGR5 contributes to hepatic cystogenesis in rodents with polycystic liver
      diseases through cyclic adenosine monophosphate/Galphas signaling.
PG  - 1197-1218
LID - 10.1002/hep.29284 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic cystogenesis in polycystic liver disease is associated with increased
      levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cholangiocytes lining liver
      cysts. Takeda G protein receptor 5 (TGR5), a G protein-coupled bile acid
      receptor, is linked to cAMP and expressed in cholangiocytes. Therefore, we
      hypothesized that TGR5 might contribute to disease progression. We examined
      expression of TGR5 and Galpha proteins in cultured cholangiocytes and in livers
      of animal models and humans with polycystic liver disease. In vitro, we assessed 
      cholangiocyte proliferation, cAMP levels, and cyst growth in response to (1) TGR5
      agonists (taurolithocholic acid, oleanolic acid [OA], and two synthetic
      compounds), (2) a novel TGR5 antagonist (m-tolyl 5-chloro-2-[ethylsulfonyl]
      pyrimidine-4-carboxylate [SBI-115]), and (3) a combination of SBI-115 and
      pasireotide, a somatostatin receptor analogue. In vivo, we examined hepatic
      cystogenesis in OA-treated polycystic kidney rats and after genetic elimination
      of TGR5 in double mutant TGR5(-/-) ;Pkhd1(del2/del2) mice. Compared to control,
      expression of TGR5 and Galphas (but not Galphai and Galphaq ) proteins was
      increased 2-fold to 3-fold in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo. In
      vitro, TGR5 stimulation enhanced cAMP production, cell proliferation, and cyst
      growth by approximately 40%; these effects were abolished after TGR5 reduction by
      short hairpin RNA. OA increased cystogenesis in polycystic kidney rats by 35%; in
      contrast, hepatic cystic areas were decreased by 45% in TGR5-deficient TGR5(-/-) 
      ;Pkhd1(del2/del2) mice. TGR5 expression and its colocalization with Galphas were 
      increased approximately 2-fold upon OA treatment. Levels of cAMP, cell
      proliferation, and cyst growth in vitro were decreased by approximately 30% in
      cystic cholangiocytes after treatment with SBI-115 alone and by approximately 50%
      when SBI-115 was combined with pasireotide. CONCLUSION: TGR5 contributes to
      hepatic cystogenesis by increasing cAMP and enhancing cholangiocyte
      proliferation; our data suggest that a TGR5 antagonist alone or concurrently with
      somatostatin receptor agonists represents a potential therapeutic approach in
      polycystic liver disease. (Hepatology 2017;66:1197-1218).

TI  - FIB-4 stage of liver fibrosis predicts incident heart failure among HIV-infected 
      and uninfected patients.
PG  - 1286-1295
LID - 10.1002/hep.29285 [doi]
AB  - Liver fibrosis is common, particularly in individuals who are infected with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive
      heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown
      whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess
      whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF 
      and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is
      modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the 
      Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular
      disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or
      December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index
      (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox
      proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease
      risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events 
      occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25
      (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95%
      confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively). The
      association of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and incident CHF persisted regardless 
      of HIV/HCV status. CONCLUSION: Moderate and advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are
      associated with an increased risk of CHF. The association for advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis persists even among participants without hepatitis C and/or
      HIV infection. Assessing liver health may be important for reducing the risk of
      future CHF events, particularly among HIV and hepatitis C infected people among
      whom cardiovascular disease risk is elevated and liver disease is common.

TI  - Loss of L-selectin-guided CD8(+) , but not CD4(+) , cells protects against
      ischemia reperfusion injury in a steatotic liver.
PG  - 1258-1274
LID - 10.1002/hep.29276 [doi]
AB  - Steatotic liver responds with increased hepatocellular injury when exposed to an 
      ischemic-reperfusion insult. Increasing evidence supports the role of immune
      cells as key mediators of this injury in a normal (lean) state, but data about
      their role in a steatotic liver are practically nonexistent. The objective of the
      current study was to delineate the contribution of specific phenotypes of T cells
      and adhesion molecules in exacerbated cell death in steatotic liver injury. RNA
      sequencing was performed on isolated steatotic primary hepatocytes, and T-cell
      markers were assessed in hepatic lymphocytes after ischemia reperfusion injury
      (IRI) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Cluster of differentiation 8 knockout
      (CD8(-/-) ) and CD4(-/-) mice along with CD8 and L-selectin antibody-treated mice
      were fed an HFD, and hepatocellular injury was assessed by histology, propidium
      iodide injection, and alanine aminotransferase after IRI. RNA sequencing
      demonstrated a strikingly differential gene profile in steatotic hepatocytes
      versus lean hepatocytes. After injury, the HFD liver showed increased necrosis,
      infiltrating CD8(+) cells, alanine aminotransferase, and proinflammatory
      cytokines. Hepatic lymphocytes demonstrated increased CD8(+) /CD62L(+)
      (L-selectin) cells in HFD-fed mice after IRI. CD8(-/-) mice and CD8-depleted
      C57BL/6 mice demonstrated significant protection from injury, which was not seen 
      in CD4(-/-) mice. L-selectin blockade also demonstrated significant
      hepatoprotection from IRI. L-selectin ligand MECA-79 was increased in HFD-fed
      mice undergoing IRI. CONCLUSION: Blockade of CD8 and L-selectin, but not CD4,
      ameliorated hepatocellular injury, confirming that CD8(+) cells are critical
      drivers of injury in a steatotic liver; this represents a therapeutic target in
      steatotic liver injury, underlining the importance of development of therapies
      specific to a steatotic liver. (Hepatology 2017;66:1258-1274).

TI  - Sofosbuvir and ribavirin in adolescents 12-17 years old with hepatitis C virus
      genotype 2 or 3 infection.

AB  - Children with chronic hepatitis C virus infection have limited treatment options.
      We evaluated the all-oral combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in adolescents 
      aged 12-17 with hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov
      NCT02175758). Fifty-two patients received sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily and
      weight-based ribavirin twice daily for 12 (genotype 2) or 24 (genotype 3) weeks. 
      The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and its metabolite GS-331007 were evaluated by
      intensive plasma sampling at day 7 in the first 10 patients enrolled and by
      sparse sampling in all patients throughout treatment. The primary efficacy
      endpoint was the percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response 12
      weeks after treatment (SVR12). The median age of patients was 15 years, and 75%
      had genotype 3. Eighty-three percent of patients were treatment-naive, and 73%
      were infected by vertical transmission. Forty percent were assessed as not having
      cirrhosis; the remainder did not have a cirrhosis determination. Overall, SVR12
      was achieved by 98% of patients (51/52; 95% confidence interval, 90%-100%). SVR12
      rates were 100% (13/13) for patients with genotype 2 and 97% (38/39) for those
      with genotype 3. The single patient who did not achieve SVR12 was lost to
      follow-up after achieving SVR4. The most commonly reported adverse events were
      nausea (27%) and headache (23%). When compared with the exposure in adults
      treated in phase 2 and 3 sofosbuvir studies, the area under the curve and maximum
      concentration for sofosbuvir and GS-331007 in adolescents were within predefined 
      pharmacokinetic equivalence boundaries of 50%-200%. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir and
      ribavirin was safe and highly effective in adolescents with chronic hepatitis C
      virus genotype 2 or 3 infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:1102-1110).

TI  - The PNPLA3 variant associated with fatty liver disease (I148M) accumulates on
      lipid droplets by evading ubiquitylation.
PG  - 1111-1124
LID - 10.1002/hep.29273 [doi]
AB  - A sequence variation (I148M) in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
      protein 3 (PNPLA3) is strongly associated with fatty liver disease, but the
      underlying mechanism remains obscure. In this study, we used knock-in (KI) mice
      (Pnpla3(148M/M) ) to examine the mechanism responsible for accumulation of
      triglyceride (TG) and PNPLA3 in hepatic lipid droplets (LDs). No differences were
      found between Pnpla3(148M/M) and Pnpla3(+/+) mice in hepatic TG synthesis,
      utilization, or secretion. These results are consistent with TG accumulation in
      the Pnpla3(148M/M) mice being caused by impaired TG mobilization from LDs.
      Sucrose feeding, which is required to elicit fatty liver in KI mice, led to a
      much larger and more persistent increase in PNPLA3 protein in the KI mice than in
      wild-type (WT) mice. Inhibition of the proteasome (bortezomib), but not
      macroautophagy (3-methyladenine), markedly increased PNPLA3 levels in WT mice,
      coincident with the appearance of ubiquitylated forms of the protein. Bortezomib 
      did not increase PNPLA3 levels in Pnpla3(148M/M) mice, and only trace amounts of 
      ubiquitylated PNPLA3 were seen in these animals. CONCLUSION: These results are
      consistent with the notion that the 148M variant disrupts ubiquitylation and
      proteasomal degradation of PNPLA3, resulting in accumulation of PNPLA3-148M and
      impaired mobilization of TG from LDs. (Hepatology 2017;66:1111-1124).

TI  - Biases in the reporting of hepatocellular carcinoma tumor sizes on the liver
      transplant waiting list.
PG  - 1144-1150
LID - 10.1002/hep.29269 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the possibility that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      listed for liver transplant with tumors just outside stage T2 size criteria may
      be inaccurately reported as just meeting the tumor size criteria for transplant. 
      The United Network for Organ Sharing/Standard Transplant Analysis and Research
      database identified 12,958 patients listed for liver transplants with HCC
      exception points from 2006 to 2013, 9,168 of whom were listed with one tumor. A
      logistic power peak function was fitted to the single-tumor size histogram, with 
      the fitted values representing unbiased expected values. The difference between
      the observed and expected tumor counts for 2.0 cm and 5.0 cm was 238 (22%) and 66
      (57%), respectively. This suggests that up to 304 (3.0%) patients with tumors
      outside of transplant criteria had their measurements recorded at the margins of 
      eligibility. A risk-adjusted Poisson model evaluated the ratio of observed to
      expected HCC recurrence by tumor size. There were 435 HCC recurrences among 6,049
      transplants. Only 2.0-cm tumors had observed to expected recurrence differing
      from 1 (ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.94), indicating a 27% lower
      than expected rate of recurrence. CONCLUSION: Higher than expected observed tumor
      counts at the lower transplant criteria margin were corroborated by lower than
      expected HCC recurrence, suggesting that tumor sizes at the margins of HCC
      transplant criteria may be subject to inaccurate reporting. (Hepatology

TI  - Targeting CCl4 -induced liver fibrosis by RNA interference-mediated inhibition of
      cyclin E1 in mice.
PG  - 1242-1257
LID - 10.1002/hep.29275 [doi]
AB  - Initiation and progression of liver fibrosis requires proliferation and
      activation of resting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Cyclin E1 (CcnE1) is the
      regulatory subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and controls cell
      cycle re-entry. We have recently shown that genetic inactivation of CcnE1
      prevents activation, proliferation, and survival of HSCs and protects from liver 
      fibrogenesis. The aim of the present study was to translate these findings into
      preclinical applications using an RNA interference (RNAi)-based approach.
      CcnE1-siRNA (small interfering RNA) efficiently inhibited CcnE1 gene expression
      in murine and human HSC cell lines and in primary HSCs, resulting in diminished
      proliferation and increased cell death. In C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice, delivery 
      of stabilized siRNA using a liposome-based carrier targeted approximately 95% of 
      HSCs, 70% of hepatocytes, and 40% of CD45(+) cells after single injection. Acute 
      CCl4 -mediated liver injury in WT mice induced endogenous CcnE1 expression and
      proliferation of surviving hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells, including
      CD45(+) leukocytes. Pretreatment with CcnE1-siRNA reverted CcnE1 induction to
      baseline levels of healthy mice, which was associated with reduced liver injury, 
      diminished proliferation of hepatocytes and leukocytes, and attenuated overall
      inflammatory response. For induction of liver fibrosis, WT mice were challenged
      with CCl4 for 4-6 weeks. Co-treatment with CcnE1-siRNA once a week was sufficient
      to continuously block CcnE1 expression and cell-cycle activity of hepatocytes and
      nonparenchymal cells, resulting in significantly ameliorated liver fibrosis and
      inflammation. Importantly, CcnE1-siRNA also prevented progression of liver
      fibrosis if applied after onset of chronic liver injury. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic 
      targeting of CcnE1 in vivo using RNAi is feasible and has high antifibrotic
      activity. (Hepatology 2017;66:1242-1257).

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of human liver metabolism is fundamental for effective
      diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. This knowledge can be obtained with
      systems biology/medicine approaches that account for the complexity of hepatic
      responses and their systemic consequences in other organs. Computational modeling
      can reveal hidden principles of the system by classification of individual
      components, analyzing their interactions and simulating the effects that are
      difficult to investigate experimentally. Herein, we review the state-of-the-art
      computational models that describe liver dynamics from metabolic, gene
      regulatory, and signal transduction perspectives. We focus especially on
      large-scale liver models described either by genome scale metabolic networks or
      an object-oriented approach. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of each
      modeling approach and their value for clinical applications in diagnosis,
      therapy, and prevention of liver diseases as well as precision medicine in
      hepatology. (Hepatology 2017;66:1323-1334).

      carcinoma progression.

AB  - Noncoding RNAs play important roles in cancer biology, providing potential
      targets for cancer intervention. As a new class of endogenous noncoding RNAs,
      circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recently identified in cell development and
      function, and certain types of pathological responses, generally acting as a
      microRNA (miRNA) sponge to regulate gene expression. Identifying the deregulated 
      circRNAs and their roles in cancer has attracted much attention. However, the
      expression profile and function of circRNAs in human hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) remain to be investigated. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of
      human circRNAs in HCC tissues and identified circMTO1 (mitochondrial translation 
      optimization 1 homologue; hsa_circRNA_0007874/hsa_circRNA_104135) as one circRNA 
      significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues. HCC patients with low circMTO1
      expression had shortened survival. By using a biotin-labeled circMTO1 probe to
      perform RNA in vivo precipitation in HCC cells, we identified miR-9 as the
      circMTO1-associated miRNA. Furthermore, silencing of circMTO1 in HCC could
      down-regulate p21, the target of oncogenic miR-9, resulting in the promotion of
      HCC cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, the tumor-promoting effect of
      circMTO1 silencing was blocked by miR9 inhibitor. Intratumoral administration of 
      cholesterol-conjugated circMTO1 small interfering RNA promoted tumor growth in
      HCC-bearing mice in vivo. CONCLUSION: circMTO1 suppresses HCC progression by
      acting as the sponge of oncogenic miR-9 to promote p21 expression, suggesting
      that circMTO1 is a potential target in HCC treatment. The decrease of circMTO1 in
      HCC tissues may serve as a prognosis predictor for poor survival of patients.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of current direct-acting antiviral regimens in kidney and

PG  - 1090-1101
LID - 10.1002/hep.29258 [doi]
AB  - Data outside of clinical trials with direct-acting antiviral regimens with or
      without ribavirin as treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus in solid organ
      transplant recipients are limited. Liver transplant (LT), kidney transplant (KT),
      and dual liver kidney (DLK) transplant recipients from the Hepatitis C
      Therapeutic Registry and Research Network database, a multicenter, longitudinal
      clinical care treatment cohort, treated with direct-acting antiviral regimens
      between January 1, 2014, and February 15, 2016, were included to assess safety
      and efficacy. Included were 443 posttransplant patients (KT = 60, LT = 347, DLK =
      36); 42% had cirrhosis, and 54% had failed prior antiviral therapy. Most had
      genotype (GT) 1 (87% with 52% GT1a, 27% GT1b, and 8% GT1 no subtype) and were
      treated with sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir +/- ribavirin (85%) followed by SOF +
      daclatasvir +/- ribavirin (9%) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir 
      +/- ribavirin (6%). Rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks were 
      available on 412 patients, and 395 patients (95.9%) achieved SVR at 12 weeks:
      96.6%, 94.5%, and 90.9% among LT, KT, and DLK transplant recipients,
      respectively. Ribavirin did not influence SVR rates and was more often used in
      those with higher BMI, higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and lower
      creatinine. Female gender, baseline albumin >/=3.5 g/dL, baseline total bilirubin
      </=1.2 mg/dL, absence of cirrhosis, and hepatic decompensation predicted SVR at
      12 weeks. Six episodes of acute rejection (n = 2 KT, 4 LT) occurred, during
      hepatitis C virus treatment in 4 and after cessation of treatment in 2.
      CONCLUSION: In a large prospective observational cohort study, direct-acting
      antiviral therapy with SOF/ledipasvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir +
      dasabuvir, and SOF plus daclatasvir was efficacious and safe in LT, KT, and DLK
      transplant recipients; ribavirin did not influence SVR, and graft rejection was
      rare. (Hepatology 2017;66:1090-1101).

AB  - The optimal retreatment strategy for patients chronically infected with hepatitis
      C virus who experience virologic failure after treatment with direct-acting
      antiviral-based therapies remains unclear. In this multicenter, open-label, phase
      2 study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg) plus weight-adjusted ribavirin
      administered for 24 weeks in patients who did not achieve sustained virologic
      response after prior treatment with direct-acting antiviral regimens that
      included the nucleotide analogue nonstructural protein 5B inhibitor sofosbuvir
      plus the nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor velpatasvir with or without the
      nonstructural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor voxilaprevir. The primary efficacy 
      endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained virologic response at
      12 weeks after the cessation of treatment. In total, 63 of 69 (91%; 95%
      confidence interval, 82%-97%) patients achieved sustained virologic response at
      12 weeks, including 36 of 37 (97%; 95% confidence interval, 86%-100%) patients
      with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection, 13 of 14 (93%; 95% confidence
      interval, 66%-100%) patients with genotype 2 infection, and 14 of 18 (78%; 95%
      confidence interval, 52%-94%) patients with genotype 3 infection. Most adverse
      events were of mild or moderate severity. The most frequently reported adverse
      events were fatigue, nausea, headache, insomnia, and rash. One patient (1%) with 
      genotype 1a infection discontinued all study drugs due to an adverse event
      (irritability). CONCLUSION: Retreatment of patients who previously failed
      direct-acting antiviral-based therapies with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir plus
      ribavirin for 24 weeks was well tolerated and effective, particularly those with 
      hepatitis C virus genotype 1 or 2 infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:1083-1089).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29239 [doi]
AB  - Strong tolerance to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigens limits the
      therapeutic effect of the conventional hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
      vaccination in both preclinical animal models and patients with chronic hepatitis
      B (CHB) infection. In contrast, we observed that clinical CHB patients presented 
      less immune tolerance to the preS1 domain of HBV large surface antigen. To study 
      whether targeting the weak tolerance of the preS1 region could improve therapy
      gain, we explored vaccination with the long peptide of preS1 domain for HBV
      virions clearance. Our study showed that this preS1-polypeptide rather than HBsAg
      vaccination induced robust immune responses in HBV carrier mice. The anti-preS1
      rapidly cleared HBV virions in vivo and blocked HBV infection to hepatocytes in
      vitro. Intriguingly, vaccination of preS1-polypeptide even reduced the tolerized 
      status of HBsAg, opening a therapeutic window for the host to respond to the
      HBsAg vaccine. A sequential administration of antigenically distinct
      preS1-polypeptide and HBsAg vaccines in HBV carrier mice could finally induce
      HBsAg/hepatitis B surface antibody serological conversion and clear chronic HBV
      infection in carrier mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that preS1 can
      function as a therapeutic vaccine for the control of CHB. (Hepatology

TI  - H19 promotes cholestatic liver fibrosis by preventing ZEB1-mediated inhibition of
      epithelial cell adhesion molecule.
PG  - 1183-1196
LID - 10.1002/hep.29209 [doi]
AB  - Based on our recent finding that disruption of bile acid (BA) homeostasis in mice
      results in the induction of hepatic long noncoding RNA H19 expression, we sought 
      to elucidate the role of H19 in cholestatic liver fibrosis. Hepatic
      overexpression of H19RNA augmented bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver
      fibrosis, which was accompanied by the elevation of serum alanine
      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and BA levels. Multiple 
      genes related to liver fibrosis, inflammation, and biliary hyperplasia were
      increased in H19-BDL versus null-BDL mice, whereas genes in BA synthesis were
      decreased. Livers and spleens of H19-BDL mice showed significant enrichment of
      CD3+gammadelta+, interleukin-4, and interleukin-17 producing CD4+ and CD8+ immune
      cell populations. H19 down-regulated hepatic zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1
      (ZEB1) but up-regulated epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SRY (sex
      determining region Y)-box 9 expression. Mechanistically, ZEB1 repressed EpCAM
      promoter activity and gene transcription. H19RNA impeded ZEB1's inhibitory action
      by interacting with ZEB1 protein to prevent its binding to the EpCAM promoter.
      Hepatic overexpression of ZEB1 or knockdown of EpCAM diminished H19-induced
      fibrosis; the latter was also prevented in H19(-/-) mice. H19RNA was markedly
      induced by bile acids in mouse small cholangiocytes and to a lesser extent in
      mouse large cholangiocytes. The up-regulation of H19RNA and EpCAM correlated
      positively with the down-regulation of ZEB1 in primary sclerosing cholangitis and
      primary biliary cirrhosis liver specimens. CONCLUSION: The activation of hepatic 
      H19RNA promoted cholestatic liver fibrosis in mice through the ZEB1/EpCAM
      signaling pathway. (Hepatology 2017;66:1183-1196).

      cells.
PG  - 1045-1057
LID - 10.1002/hep.29211 [doi]
AB  - The development of pathogenic mechanisms, specific antiviral treatments and
      preventive vaccines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been limited due to
      lack of cell culture models that can naturally imitate the entire HCV life cycle.
      Here, we established an HCV cell culture model based on human fetal liver stem
      cells (hFLSCs) that supports the entire blood-borne hepatitis C virus (bbHCV)
      life cycle. More than 90% of cells remained infected by various genotypes. bbHCV 
      was efficiently propagated, and progeny virus were infectious to hFLSCs. The
      virus could be passed efficiently between cells. The viral infectivity was
      partially blocked by specific antibodies or small interfering RNA against HCV
      entry factors, whereas HCV replication was inhibited by antiviral drugs. We
      observed viral particles of approximately 55 nm in diameter in both cell culture 
      media and infected cells after bbHCV infection. CONCLUSION: Our data show that
      the entire bbHCV life cycle could be naturally imitated in hFLSCs. This model is 
      expected to provide a powerful tool for exploring the process and the mechanism
      of bbHCV infection at the cellular level and for evaluating the treatment and
      preventive strategies of bbHCV infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:1045-1057).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29213 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance represents a clinical cure,
      although the clearance rate is extremely low. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the feasibility and safety profiles of pegylated-interferon alpha-2a
      (PEG-IFNalpha-2a) as a therapeutic option for inactive HBsAg carriers. There were
      144 inactive HBsAg carriers enrolled and divided into a therapeutic group (102
      subjects) and a control group (42 subjects). PEG-IFNalpha-2a and PEG-IFNalpha-2a 
      combined with adefovir dipivoxil were used for treatment group subjects with
      hepatitis B virus DNA <20 IU/mL and 20 IU/mL </= hepatitis B virus DNA < 2,000
      IU/mL, respectively. Total therapy duration was no more than 96 weeks. HBsAg
      clearance and seroconversion rates at therapeutic weeks 48 and 96 were used to
      evaluate the therapeutic efficacy. Per protocol analysis showed that the HBsAg
      clearance rate and seroconversion rate in the treatment group were 29.8% and
      20.2% at week 48 and increased to 44.7% and 38.3% at week 96, respectively.
      However, the HBsAg clearance rate in the control group was 2.4% at weeks 48 and
      96, and no subject achieved seroconversion. The quantitative HBsAg levels and
      changes during the early period of treatment (at week 12 and week 24) as well as 
      the alanine aminotransferase elevation at week 12 were strong predictors of HBsAg
      clearance. The adverse events were similar to those with treatment for chronic
      hepatitis B patients. CONCLUSION: High rates of HBsAg clearance and
      seroconversion could be achieved by PEG-IFNalpha-2a-based treatments and the
      treatments were relatively safe for inactive HBsAg carriers. (Hepatology

TI  - Long-term outcomes of entecavir monotherapy for chronic hepatitis B after liver
      transplantation: Results up to 8 years.
PG  - 1036-1044

AB  - Long-term antiviral prophylaxis is required to prevent hepatitis B recurrence for
      patients with chronic hepatitis B after liver transplantation. We determined the 
      long-term outcome of 265 consecutive chronic hepatitis B liver transplant
      recipients treated with entecavir monotherapy without hepatitis B immune
      globulin. Viral serology, viral load, and liver biochemistry were performed at
      regular intervals during follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 59
      months. The cumulative rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance
      were 90% and 95% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. At 1, 3, 5, and 8 years, 85%,
      88%, 87.0%, and 92% were negative for HBsAg, respectively, and 95%, 99%, 100%,
      and 100% had undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, respectively. Fourteen
      patients remained persistently positive for HBsAg, all of whom had undetectable
      HBV DNA. There was no significant difference in liver stiffness for those who
      remained HBsAg-positive compared to those who achieved HBsAg seroclearance (5.5
      versus 5.2 kPa, respectively; P = 0.52). The overall 9-year survival was 85%.
      There were 37 deaths during the follow-up period, of which none were due to
      hepatitis B recurrence. CONCLUSION: Long-term entecavir monotherapy is highly
      effective at preventing HBV reactivation after liver transplantation for chronic 
      hepatitis B, with a durable HBsAg seroclearance rate of 92%, an undetectable HBV 
      DNA rate of 100% at 8 years, and excellent long-term survival of 85% at 9 years.

TI  - A Large-scale, multicenter serum metabolite biomarker identification study for
      the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29561 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most lethal cancer worldwide. The
      lack of effective biomarkers for the early detection of HCC results in
      unsatisfactory curative treatments. Here, metabolite biomarkers were identified
      and validated for HCC diagnosis. A total of 1,448 subjects, including healthy
      controls and patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, liver cirrhosis, 
      and HCC, were recruited from multiple centers in China. Liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods were used to
      characterize the subjects' serum metabolic profiles and to screen and validate
      the HCC biomarkers. A serum metabolite biomarker panel including
      phenylalanyl-tryptophan and glycocholate was defined. This panel had a higher
      diagnostic performance than did alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in differentiating HCC
      from a high-risk population of cirrhosis, such as an area under the
      receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.930, 0.892, and 0.807 for the panel 
      versus 0.657, 0.725, and 0.650 for AFP in the discovery set, test set, and cohort
      1 of the validation set, respectively. In the nested case-control study, this
      panel had high sensitivity (range 80.0%-70.3%) to detect preclinical HCC, and its
      combination with AFP provided better risk prediction of preclinical HCC before
      clinical diagnosis. Besides, this panel showed a larger area under the
      receiver-operating characteristic curve than did AFP (0.866 versus 0.682) to
      distinguish small HCC, and 80.6% of the AFP false-negative patients with HCC were
      correctly diagnosed using this panel in the test set, which was corroborated by
      the validation set. The specificity and biological relevance of the identified
      biomarkers were further evaluated using sera from another two cancers and HCC
      tissue specimens, respectively. CONCLUSION: The discovered and validated serum
      metabolite biomarker panel exhibits good diagnostic performance for the early
      detection of HCC from at-risk populations. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Portal pressure and liver stiffness measurements in the prediction of fibrosis
      regression after sustained virological response in recurrent hepatitis C.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29557 [doi]
AB  - Sustained virological response (SVR) improves survival in post-liver transplant
      (LT) recurrent hepatitis C. However, the impact of SVR on fibrosis regression is 
      not well defined. In addition, the performance of noninvasive methods to evaluate
      the presence of fibrosis and portal hypertension (PH) post-SVR has been scarcely 
      evaluated. We aimed to investigate the degree of fibrosis regression (decrease
      >/=1 METAVIR stage) after-SVR and its associated factors in recurrent hepatitis
      C, as well as the diagnostic capacity of noninvasive methods in the assessment of
      liver fibrosis and PH after viral clearance. We evaluated 112 hepatitis C
      virus-infected LT recipients who achieved SVR between 2001 and 2015. A liver
      biopsy was performed before treatment and 12 months post-SVR. Hepatic venous
      pressure gradient (HVPG), liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and Enhanced Liver
      Fibrosis (ELF) score were also determined at the same time points. Sixty-seven
      percent of the cohort presented fibrosis regression: 43% in recipients with
      cirrhosis and 72%-85% in the remaining stages (P = 0.002). HVPG, LSM, and ELF
      significantly decreased post-SVR. Liver function significantly improved, and
      survival was significantly better in patients achieving fibrosis regression.
      Baseline HVPG and LSM as well as decompensations before therapy were independent 
      predictors of fibrosis regression. One year post-SVR, LSM had a high diagnostic
      accuracy to discard the presence of advanced fibrosis (AF) and clinically
      significant PH (AUROC, 0.902 and 0.888). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, SVR post-LT
      induces fibrosis regression in most patients, leading to significant clinical
      benefits. Pretreatment HVPG and LSM are significant determinants of the
      likelihood of fibrosis regression. Finally, LSM accurately predicts the presence 
      of AF and PH 1 year after SVR and thus can be used to determine monitoring
      strategies. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease incidence and impact on metabolic burden and
      death: A 20 year-community study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29546 [doi]
AB  - Recent population-based data on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
      epidemiology in general, and incidence in particular, are lacking. We examined
      trends in NAFLD incidence in a U.S. community and the impact of NAFLD on incident
      metabolic comorbidities (MCs), cardiovascular (CV) events, and mortality. A
      community cohort of all adults diagnosed with NAFLD in Olmsted County, Minnesota,
      between 1997 and 2014 was constructed using the Rochester Epidemiology Project
      database. The yearly incidence rate were calculated. The impact of NAFLD on
      incident MCs, CV events, and mortality was studied using a multistate model, with
      a 4:1 age- and sex-matched general population as a reference. We identified 3,869
      NAFLD subjects (median age, 53; 52% women) and 15,209 controls; median follow-up 
      was 7 (1-20) years. NAFLD incidence increased 5-fold, from 62 to 329 in 100,000
      person-years. The increase was highest (7-fold) in young adults, aged 18-39
      years. The 10-year mortality was higher in NAFLD subjects (10.2%) than controls
      (7.6%; P < 0.0001). NAFLD was an independent risk factor for incident MCs and
      death. Mortality risk decreased as the number of incident MCs increased: relative
      risk (RR) = 2.16 (95% confidence [CI], 1.41-3.31), 1.99 (95% CI, 1.48-2.66), 1.75
      (95% CI, 1.42-2.14), and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.89-1.30) when 0, 1, 2, or 3 MCs were
      present, respectively. The NAFLD impact on CV events was significant only in
      subjects without MCs (RR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.35-2.86). NAFLD reduced life
      expectancy by 4 years, with more time spent in high metabolic burden. CONCLUSION:
      Incidence of NAFLD diagnosis in the community has increased 5-fold, particularly 
      in young adults. NAFLD is a consequence, but also a precursor of MC. Incident MC 
      attenuates the impact of NAFLD on death and annuls its impact on CV disease.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus testing for case identification in persons born during
      1945-1965: Results from three randomized controlled trials.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29548 [doi]
AB  - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Preventive Services Task
      Force recommend one-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing for persons born during 
      1945-1965 (birth cohort). However, few studies estimate the effect of birth
      cohort (BC) testing implementation on HCV diagnoses in primary care settings. We 
      aimed to determine the probability of identifying HCV infections in primary care 
      using targeted BC testing compared with usual care at three academic medical
      centers. From December 2012 to March 2014, each center compared one of three
      distinct interventions with usual care using an independently designed randomized
      controlled trial. Across centers, BC patients with no clinical documentation of
      previous HCV testing or diagnosis were randomly assigned to receive a one-time
      offering of HCV antibody (anti-HCV) testing via one of three independent
      implementation strategies (repeated-mailing outreach, electronic medical
      record-integrated provider best practice alert [BPA], and direct patient
      solicitation) or assigned to receive usual care. We estimated model-adjusted risk
      ratios (aRR) of anti-HCV-positive (anti-HCV+) identification using BC testing
      versus usual care. In the repeated mailing trial, 8992 patients (intervention, n 
      = 2993; control, n = 5999) were included in the analysis. The intervention was
      eight times as likely to identify anti-HCV+ patients compared with controls (aRR,
      8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-23.0; adjusted probabilities:
      intervention, 0.27%; control, 0.03%). In the BPA trial, data from 14,475 patients
      (BC, n = 8928; control, n = 5,547) were analyzed. The intervention was 2.6 times 
      as likely to identify anti-HCV+ patients versus controls (aRR, 2.6; 95% CI,
      1.1-6.4; adjusted probabilities: intervention, 0.29%; control, 0.11%). In the
      patient-solicitation trial, 8873 patients (BC, n = 4307; control, n = 4566) were 
      analyzed. The intervention was five times as likely to identify anti-HCV+
      patients compared with controls (aRR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.3-12.3; adjusted
      probabilities: intervention, 0.68%; control, 0.11%). CONCLUSION: BC testing was
      effective in identifying previously undiagnosed HCV infections in primary care
      settings. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - New pediatric percentiles of liver enzyme serum levels (ALT, AST, GGT): Effects
      of age, sex, BMI and pubertal stage.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29542 [doi]
AB  - The present study aims to clarify the effects of sex, age, BMI and puberty on
      transaminase serum levels in children and adolescents and to provide new age- and
      sex-related percentiles for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Venous blood and
      anthropometric data were collected from 4,126 cases. Excluded were cases of
      participants with potential hepatotoxic medication, with evidence of potential
      illness at the time of blood sampling and non-normal BMI (BMI < 10(th) or >
      90(th) ). The resulting data (N = 3,131 cases) were used for the calculations of 
      ALT, AST, and GGT percentiles. Age- and sex-related reference intervals were
      established by using an LMSP-type method. Serum levels of transaminases follow
      age-specific patterns and relate to the onset of puberty. This observation is
      more pronounced in girls than in boys. The ALT percentiles showed similar shaped 
      patterns in both sexes. Multivariate regression confirmed significant effects of 
      puberty and BMI-SDS (beta = 2.21) on ALT. Surprisingly, AST serum levels were
      negatively influenced by age (beta = -1.42) and BMI-SDS (beta = -0.15). The GGT
      percentiles revealed significant sex-specific differences, correlated positively 
      with age (beta = 0.37) and showed significant association with BMI-SDS (beta =
      1.16). CONCLUSION: Current reference values of ALT, AST and GGT serum levels were
      calculated for children between 11 months and 16.0 years, using modern analytical
      and statistical methods. This study extends the current knowledge about
      transaminases by revealing influences of age, sex, BMI, and puberty on the serum 
      concentrations of all three parameters and has for these parameters one of the
      largest sample sizes published so far. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for hepatitis C virus genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis
      and/or prior treatment experience: A partially randomized phase 3 clinical trial.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29541 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ribavirin-free coformulated
      glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3
      infection with prior treatment experience and/or compensated cirrhosis, a patient
      population with limited treatment options. SURVEYOR-II, Part 3 was a partially
      randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study. Treatment-experienced (prior 
      interferon or pegylated interferon +/- ribavirin or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin +/-
      pegylated interferon therapy) patients without cirrhosis were randomized 1:1 to
      receive 12 or 16 weeks of G/P (300 mg/120 mg) once daily. Treatment-naive or
      treatment-experienced patients with compensated cirrhosis were treated with G/P
      for 12 or 16 weeks, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was the
      percentage of patients with sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12
      (SVR12). Safety was evaluated throughout the study. There were 131 patients
      enrolled and treated. Among treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis,
      SVR12 was achieved by 91% (20/22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72-97) and 95%
      (21/22; 95% CI, 78-99) of patients treated with G/P for 12 or 16 weeks,
      respectively. Among those with cirrhosis, SVR12 was achieved by 98% (39/40; 95%
      CI, 87-99) of treatment-naive patients treated for 12 weeks and 96% (45/47; 95%
      CI, 86-99) of patients with prior treatment experience treated for 16 weeks. No
      adverse events led to discontinuation of study drug, and no serious adverse
      events were related to study drug. CONCLUSION: Patients with hepatitis C virus
      genotype 3 infection with prior treatment experience and/or compensated cirrhosis
      achieved high SVR12 rates following 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with G/P. The
      regimen was well tolerated. (Hepatology 2017).

AB  - Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have changed the landscape of hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) treatment, but chronic hepatitis C (CHC) remains a leading indication for
      liver transplantation (LT). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been
      reported in HBV-HCV-coinfected patients treated with DAAs. We report on a case of
      late HBV reactivation after DAA-based treatment of recurrent hepatitis C in an

TI  - Human leukocyte antigen variants and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma modified by
      hepatitis C virus genotypes: A genome-wide association study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29531 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study to discover genetic variants
      associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      We genotyped 502 HCC cases and 749 non-HCC controls using the Axiom-CHB
      genome-wide array. After identifying single-nucleotide polymorphism clusters
      located in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which were potentially
      associated with HCC, HLA-DQB1 genotyping was performed to analyze 994 anti-HCV
      seropositives collected in the period 1991-2013 in a community-based cohort for
      evaluating long-term predictability of HLA variants for identifying the risk of
      HCC. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 
      95% confidence intervals of HLA genotypes for determining the aforementioned HCC 
      risk. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the proximity of HLA-DQB1 were
      associated with HCC (P < 8.7 x 10(-8) ) in the genome-wide association study.
      Long-term follow-up showed a significant association with HLA-DQB1*03:01 and
      DQB1*06:02 (P < 0.05). The adjusted hazard ratios associated with HCC were 0.45
      (0.30-0.68) and 2.11 (1.34-3.34) for DQB1*03:01 and DQB1*06:02, respectively.
      After stratification by HCV genotypes, DQB1*03:01 showed protective effects only 
      in patients with HCV genotype 1, whereas DQB1*06:02 conferred risk of HCC only in
      patients with HCV non-1 genotypes. HLA imputation analyses revealed that
      HLA-DRB1*15:01, which is in linkage disequilibrium with DQB1*06:02, also
      increased the risk of HCC (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.93).
      Haplotype analysis supported that DQB1*03:01 and DQB1*06:02 are primarily
      protective and susceptible variants, respectively. CONCLUSION: HLA-DQB1 was
      independently associated with HCC; HCV genotypes modified the effects of HLA-DQB1
      on the risk of HCC. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Induction of cancer cell stemness by depletion of macrohistone H2A1 in
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29519 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) contain a subpopulation of cancer stem cells
      (CSCs), which exhibit stem cell-like features and are responsible for tumor
      relapse, metastasis, and chemoresistance. The development of effective treatments
      for HCC will depend on a molecular-level understanding of the specific pathways
      driving CSC emergence and stemness. MacroH2A1 is a variant of the histone H2A and
      an epigenetic regulator of stem-cell function, where it promotes differentiation 
      and, conversely, acts as a barrier to somatic-cell reprogramming. Here, we
      focused on the role played by the histone variant macroH2A1 as a potential
      epigenetic factor promoting CSC differentiation. In human HCC sections we
      uncovered a significant correlation between low frequencies of macroH2A1 staining
      and advanced, aggressive HCC subtypes with poorly differentiated tumor
      phenotypes. Using HCC cell lines, we found that short hairpin RNA-mediated
      macroH2A1 knockdown induces acquisition of CSC-like features, including the
      growth of significantly larger and less differentiated tumors when injected into 
      nude mice. MacroH2A1-depleted HCC cells also exhibited reduced proliferation,
      resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and stem-like metabolic changes consistent
      with enhanced hypoxic responses and increased glycolysis. The loss of macroH2A1
      increased expression of a panel of stemness-associated genes and drove
      hyperactivation of the nuclear factor kappa B p65 pathway. Blocking
      phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 on Ser536 inhibited the emergence
      of CSC-like features in HCC cells knocked down for macroH2A1. CONCLUSION: The
      absence of histone variant macroH2A1 confers a CSC-like phenotype to HCC cells in
      vitro and in vivo that depends on Ser536 phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa 
      B p65; this pathway may hold valuable targets for the development of CSC-focused 
      treatments for HCC. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Cardiovascular predictors of death in patients with cirrhosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29520 [doi]
AB  - Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor outcomes in patients with
      cirrhosis. We investigated if subclinical cardiac morphologic and functional
      modifications can influence survival in cirrhotic patients during follow-up. A
      series of cirrhotic patients without cardiovascular or pulmonary disease
      underwent standard and tissue Doppler echocardiography to assess left ventricular
      (LV) geometry, systo/diastolic function and the main haemodynamic parameters.
      After baseline evaluation 115 cirrhotic patients were followed up for at least 6 
      years. During follow up 54 patients died (47%). On univariate analysis age, BSA, 
      MELD, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, systemic vascular
      resistance index, the ratio of transmitral Doppler early filling velocity to
      tissue Doppler early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') were associated
      with increased risk of death. In a Cox hazard regression analysis including these
      factors and other hypothesized important factors (but not MELD) increased age
      (p=0.04) and left atrial dimension (p=0.005), and lower BSA (p=0.03) were the
      strongest predictors of death. When MELD was included in the analysis the main
      predictors were MELD, age and BSA. When multivariate analysis was performed
      incorporating only cardiovascular parametres, increased E/e' (p=0.003) and heart 
      rate (p= 0.03) and reduced mean blood pressure (p= 0.01) resulted significantly
      associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: in a large cohort of cirrhotic
      patients and after a long follow-up MELD, age and BSA were the main predictors of
      death. Among cardiovascular parameters, left atrium enlargement, increased heart 
      rate and E/e' and reduced mean blood pressure resulted independent predictors of 
      death. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nuclear lamina genetic variants, including a truncated LAP2, in twins and
      siblings with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29522 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the major chronic liver
      disease in many countries. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, but twin and
      familial studies indicate significant heritability, which is not fully explained 
      by currently known genetic susceptibility loci. Notably, mutations in genes
      encoding nuclear lamina proteins, including lamins, cause lipodystrophy syndromes
      that include NAFLD. We hypothesized that variants in lamina-associated proteins
      predispose to NAFLD and used a candidate gene-sequencing approach to test for
      variants in 10 nuclear lamina-related genes in a cohort of 37 twin and sibling
      pairs: 21 individuals with and 53 without NAFLD. Twelve heterozygous sequence
      variants were identified in four lamina-related genes (ZMPSTE24, TMPO, SREBF1,
      SREBF2). The majority of NAFLD patients (>90%) had at least one variant compared 
      to <40% of controls (P < 0.0001). When only insertions/deletions and changes in
      conserved residues were considered, the difference between the groups was
      similarly striking (>80% versus <25%; P < 0.0001). Presence of a lamina variant
      segregated with NAFLD independently of the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism. Several
      variants were found in TMPO, which encodes the lamina-associated polypeptide-2
      (LAP2) that has not been associated with liver disease. One of these, a
      frameshift insertion that generates truncated LAP2, abrogated lamin-LAP2 binding,
      caused LAP2 mislocalization, altered endogenous lamin distribution, increased
      lipid droplet accumulation after oleic acid treatment in transfected cells, and
      led to cytoplasmic association with the ubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1.
      CONCLUSION: Several variants in nuclear lamina-related genes were identified in a
      cohort of twins and siblings with NAFLD; one such variant, which results in a
      truncated LAP2 protein and a dramatic phenotype in cell culture, represents an
      association of TMPO/LAP2 variants with NAFLD and underscores the potential
      importance of the nuclear lamina in NAFLD. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - NLRP3 inflammasome driven liver injury and fibrosis: Roles of IL-17 and TNF in
      mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29523 [doi]
AB  - The NLRP3 inflammasome, a caspase-1 activation platform, plays a key role in the 
      modulation of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis
      that interleukin 17 (IL-17) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are key cytokines
      involved in amplifying and perpetuating the liver damage and fibrosis resulting
      from NLRP3 activation. To address this hypothesis, gain-of-function Nlrp3(A350V) 
      knock-in mice were bred onto il17a and Tnf knockout backgrounds allowing for
      constitutive Nlrp3 activation in myeloid derived cells in mice deficient in IL-17
      or TNF. Livers of Nlrp3(A350V) knock-in mice exhibited severe liver inflammatory 
      changes characterized by infiltration with neutrophils, increased expression of
      chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1 and CXCL2 chemokines, activated
      inflammatory macrophages, and elevated levels of IL-17 and TNF. Mutants with
      ablation of il17a signal showed fewer neutrophils when compared to intact
      Nlrp3(A350V) mutants, but still significant inflammatory changes when compared to
      the nonmutant il17a knockout littermates. The severe inflammatory changes
      associated with mutant Nlrp3 were almost completely rescued by Tnf knockout in
      association with a marked decrease in circulating IL-1beta levels. Intact
      Nlrp3(A350V) mutants showed changes in liver fibrosis, as evidenced by
      morphometric quantitation of Sirius Red staining and increased mRNA levels of
      profibrotic genes, including connective tissue growth factor and tissue inhibitor
      of matrix metalloproteinase 1. Il17a lacking mutants exhibited amelioration of
      the aforementioned fibrosis, whereas Tnf-deficient mutants showed no signs of
      fibrosis when compared to littermate controls. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers key
      roles for TNF and, to a lesser extent, IL-17 as mediators of liver inflammation
      and fibrosis induced by constitutive NLRP3 inflammasome activation in
      myeloid-derived cells. These findings may lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at
      halting the progression of liver injury and fibrogenesis in various liver
      pathogeneses driven by NLRP3 activation. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Organic Solute Transporter-beta (SLC51B) Deficiency in Two Brothers with
      Congenital Diarrhea and Features of Cholestasis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29516 [doi]
AB  - Primary bile acid malabsorption (PBAM) is associated with congenital diarrhea,
      steatorrhea, and a block in the intestinal return of bile acids in the
      enterohepatic circulation. Mutations in the ileal Na(+) -dependent bile acid
      transporter (ASBT; SLC10A2) can cause PBAM, but do not appear to account for most
      familial cases. Another major transporter involved in the intestinal reclamation 
      of bile acids is the heteromeric Organic Solute Transporter alpha-beta
      (OSTalpha-OSTbeta; SLC51A-SLC51B), which exports bile acid across the basolateral
      membrane. Here we report the first patients with OSTbeta deficiency, clinically
      characterized by chronic diarrhea, severe fat soluble vitamin deficiency, and
      features of cholestatic liver disease including elevated serum
      gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous 
      single nucleotide deletion in codon 27 of SLC51B, resulting in a frameshift and
      premature termination at codon 50. Functional studies in transfected cells showed
      that the SLC51B mutation resulted in markedly reduced taurocholic acid uptake
      activity and reduced expression of the OSTalpha partner protein. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings identify OSTbeta deficiency as a new cause of congenital chronic
      diarrhea with features of cholestatic liver disease. These studies underscore
      OSTalpha-OSTbeta's key role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in
      humans. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Complete response under sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma:
      Relationship with dermatologic adverse events.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29515 [doi]
AB  - The clinical benefit of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      has been undervalued due to the absence of complete responses, even though
      patients who develop early dermatologic reactions have shown to have a positive
      outcome. In addition, sorafenib is described as an antiangiogenic drug, but it
      also acts on immunological cells. Thus, the goal of this study was to assess the 
      complete response rate in a retrospective cohort of HCC patients treated with
      sorafenib and to describe the profile of the patients who achieve complete
      response for identifying factors related to this event and their connection with 
      the immunological profile of sorafenib. Ten Spanish centers submitted cases of
      complete response under sorafenib. The baseline characteristics, development of
      early dermatologic reactions, and cause of treatment discontinuation were
      annotated. Radiological images taken before starting sorafenib, at first control,
      after starting sorafenib, at the time of complete response, and at least 1 month 
      after treatment were centrally reviewed. Of the 1119 patients studied, 20 had
      been classified as complete responders by the centers, but eight of these
      patients were excluded after central review. Ten patients had complete
      disappearance of all tumor sites, and two had just a small residual fibrotic
      scar. Thus, 12 patients were classified as complete responders (58% HCV, median
      age 59.7 years, 83.4% Child-Pugh class A, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status 0 91.7%, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C 83.3%). The
      median overall survival and treatment duration were 85.8 and 40.1 months,
      respectively. All but one patient developed early dermatologic reactions, and
      seven patients discontinued sorafenib after achieving complete response due to
      adverse events, patient decision, or liver decompensation. CONCLUSION: Complete
      response affects 1% of patients with HCC who are treated with sorafenib. The
      association of complete response with early dermatologic reactions supports the
      role of a specific immune/inflammatory patient profile in the improved response
      to sorafenib. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Contradictory effects of mitochondria- and non-mitochondria-targeted antioxidants
      on hepatocarcinogenesis by altering DNA repair in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29518 [doi]
AB  - Conflicting effects of antioxidant supplementation on cancer prevention or
      promotion is of great concern to healthy people and cancer patients. Despite
      recent studies about antioxidants accelerating the progression of lung cancer and
      melanoma, antioxidants may still play a role in cancer prevention. Both tumor and
      antioxidants types influence the actual efficacy. However, little is known about 
      the impact of different types of antioxidants on primary hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC), including non-mitochondrial- and mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants.
      Utilizing mouse models of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, we showed that
      administration of non-mitochondria-targeted antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
      and the soluble vitamin E analog, Trolox, prevented tumorigenesis, whereas
      administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SS-31 (the
      mitochondria-targeted peptide) and Mito-Q (a derivative of ubiquinone)
      facilitated tumorigenesis. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and SS-31 caused very
      different changes in the oxidation-reduction state and DNA damage response. In
      diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-treated primary hepatocytes, NAC and Trolox alleviated
      DNA damage by activating ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM and Rad3-related
      (ATR) for DNA repair whereas SS-31 and Mito-Q aggravated damage by inactivating
      them. Interestingly, partial recovery of SS-31-scavengened mitochondrial reactive
      oxygen species (mtROS) could alleviate SS-31-aggravated DNA damage. Localization 
      of ATM between mitochondria and nuclei was altered after NAC and SS-31 treatment.
      Furthermore, blockage of phospho-ATR (p-ATR) led to the recurrence of
      NAC-ameliorated DEN HCC. In contrast, reactivation of p-ATR blocked
      SS-31-promoted DEN HCC. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the type of
      antioxidants plays a previously unappreciated role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and
      provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of antioxidants
      for liver cancer. (Hepatology 2018).

TI  - The ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A
      randomized, phase 2 trial.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29514 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase,
      leads to improvement in inflammation and fibrosis in animal models of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of
      selonsertib, a selective inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, alone
      or in combination with simtuzumab, in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
      and stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis. In this multicenter phase 2 trial, 72 patients
      were randomized to receive 24 weeks of open-label treatment with either 6 or 18
      mg of selonsertib orally once daily with or without once-weekly injections of 125
      mg of simtuzumab or simtuzumab alone. The effect of treatment was assessed by
      paired pretreatment and posttreatment liver biopsies, magnetic resonance
      elastography, magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction,
      quantitative collagen content, and noninvasive markers of liver injury. Due to
      the lack of effect of simtuzumab on histology or selonsertib pharmacokinetics,
      selonsertib groups with and without simtuzumab were pooled. After 24 weeks of
      treatment, the proportion of patients with a one or more stage reduction in
      fibrosis in the 18-mg selonsertib group was 13 of 30 (43%; 95% confidence
      interval, 26-63); in the 6-mg selonsertib group, 8 of 27 (30%; 95% confidence
      interval, 14-50); and in the simtuzumab-alone group, 2 of 10 (20%; 95% confidence
      interval, 3-56). Improvement in fibrosis was associated with reductions in liver 
      stiffness on magnetic resonance elastography, collagen content and lobular
      inflammation on liver biopsy, as well as improvements in serum biomarkers of
      apoptosis and necrosis. There were no significant differences in adverse events
      between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that selonsertib
      may reduce liver fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and stage
      2-3 fibrosis. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Natural immunoglobulin M initiates an inflammatory response important for both
      hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury and regeneration in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29512 [doi]
AB  - Complement plays a role in both hepatic ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI)
      and liver regeneration, but it is not clear how complement is activated in either
      process. We investigated the role of self-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM)
      antibodies in activating complement after hepatic IR and liver resection. Natural
      IgM antibodies that recognize danger-associated molecular patterns (neoepitopes) 
      activate complement following both hepatic IR and liver resection.
      Antibody-deficient Rag1(-/-) mice were protected from hepatic IRI, but had
      increased hepatic injury and an impaired regenerative response after 70% partial 
      hepatectomy (PHx). We identified two IgM monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that
      specifically reversed the effect of Rag1 deficiency in both models; B4
      (recognizes Annexin IV) and C2 (recognizes subset of phospholipids). Focusing on 
      the B4-specific response, we demonstrated sinusoidal colocalization of IgM and
      C3d in Rag1(-/-) mice that were reconstituted with B4 mAb, and furthermore that
      the Annexin IV neoepitope is specifically and similarly expressed after both
      hepatic IR and PHx in wild-type (WT) mice. A single-chain antibody construct
      (scFv) derived from B4 mAb blocked IgM binding and reduced injury post-IR in WT
      mice, although, interestingly, B4scFv did not alter regeneration post-PHx,
      indicating that anti-Annexin IV antibodies are sufficient, but not necessary, for
      the regenerative response in the context of an entire natural antibody
      repertoire. We also demonstrated expression of the B4 neoepitope in postischemic 
      human liver samples obtained posttransplantation and a corollary depletion in IgM
      recognizing the B4 and C2 neoepitopes in patient sera following liver
      transplantation. CONCLUSION: These data indicate an important role for IgM in
      hepatic IRI and regeneration, with a similar cross-species injury-specific
      recognition system that has implications for the design of neoepitope targeted
      therapeutics. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases the risk of chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) while effective HCV treatment decreases the incidence of CKD.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29505 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-infected patients and the incidence reduction of CKD after receipt of HCV
      treatment. We also evaluated the risk of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
      (MPGN) and cryoglobulinemia in chronic HCV patients. A retrospective cohort
      analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan Database (2008-2015) in the United
      States was conducted. In a cohort of 56,448 HCV-infected patients and 169,344
      propensity score (1:3)-matched non-HCV patients, we examined the association of
      HCV infection with the incidence of CKD. Of 55,818 HCV patients, 6.6 % (n =
      3666), 6.3% (n = 3534), and 8.3% (n = 4628) patients received either
      interferon-based dual, triple, or all-oral direct acting antiviral agent therapy,
      respectively, whereas 79% of patients did not receive any HCV treatment. Cox
      proportional hazards models were used to compare the risk of developing CKD in
      HCV patients compared with non-HCV patients and treated patients compared with
      untreated HCV patients. In a multivariate time-varying Cox regression model,
      HCV-infected patients had a 27% increased risk of CKD compared with non-HCV
      patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.37).
      Among HCV patients, individuals who received the minimally effective HCV
      treatment for dual, triple, or all-oral therapy had a 30% decreased risk of
      developing CKD (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88). In addition, HCV-infected patients 
      experienced a twofold and a nearly 17-fold higher risk of MPGN (HR, 2.23; 95% CI,
      1.84-2.71) and cryoglobulinemia (HR, 16.91; 95% CI, 12.00-23.81) respectively,
      compared with non-HCV patients. CONCLUSION: HCV-infected individuals in the
      United States are at greater risk of developing CKD, MPGN, and cryoglobulinemia. 
      Minimally effective treatment of HCV infection can prevent the development of
      CKD, although the association was not significant for all-oral therapy.

TI  - Gene-disease associations identify a connectome with shared molecular pathways in
      human cholangiopathies.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29504 [doi]
AB  - Cholangiopathies are a diverse group of progressive diseases whose primary cell
      targets are cholangiocytes. To identify shared pathogenesis and molecular
      connectivity among the three main human cholangiopathies (biliary atresia [BA],
      primary biliary cholangitis [PBC], and primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]), we 
      built a comprehensive platform of published data on gene variants, gene
      expression, and functional studies and applied network-based analytics in the
      search for shared molecular circuits. Mining the data platform with largest
      connected component and interactome analyses, we validated previously reported
      associations and identified essential and hub genes. In addition to
      disease-specific modules, we found a substantial overlap of disease neighborhoods
      and uncovered a group of 34 core genes that are enriched for immune processes and
      abnormal intestine/hepatobiliary mouse phenotypes. Within this core, we
      identified a gene subcore containing signal transduction and activator of
      transcription 3, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and forkhead box P3
      prominently placed in a regulatory connectome of genes related to cellular
      immunity and fibrosis. We also found substantial gene enrichment in the advanced 
      glycation endproduct/receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) pathway
      and showed that RAGE activation induced cholangiocyte proliferation. CONCLUSION: 
      Human cholangiopathies share pathways enriched by immunity genes and a molecular 
      connectome that links different pathogenic features of BA, PBC, and PSC.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in Japanese patients with chronic
      genotype 2 hepatitis C virus infection.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29510 [doi]
AB  - Glecaprevir (nonstructural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir
      (nonstructural protein 5A inhibitor) (G/P), a coformulated once-daily, all oral, 
      ribavirin (RBV)-free, direct-acting antiviral regimen, was evaluated for safety
      and efficacy in hepatitis C virus genotype 2 (GT2)-infected Japanese patients,
      including those with compensated cirrhosis. CERTAIN-2 is a phase 3, open-label,
      multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of G/P (300/120 mg) once
      daily in treatment-naive and interferon +/- RBV treatment-experienced Japanese
      patients without cirrhosis but with GT2 infection. Patients were randomized 2:1
      to receive 8 weeks of G/P (arm A) or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir (400 mg once daily) +
      RBV (600-1000 mg weight-based, twice daily) (arm B). The primary endpoint was
      noninferiority of G/P compared to sofosbuvir + RBV by assessing sustained
      virologic response at posttreatment week 12 (SVR12) among patients in the
      intent-to-treat population. SVR12 was also assessed in treatment-naive and
      interferon +/- RBV treatment-experienced patients with GT2 infection and
      compensated cirrhosis who received G/P for 12 weeks in the CERTAIN-1 study. A
      total of 136 patients were enrolled in CERTAIN-2. SVR12 was achieved by 88/90
      (97.8%) patients in arm A and 43/46 (93.5%) patients in arm B. No patient in arm 
      A experienced virologic failure, while 2 did in arm B. The primary endpoint was
      achieved. In CERTAIN-1, 100% (18/18) of GT2-infected patients with compensated
      cirrhosis achieved SVR12. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were
      experienced by 2 patients without cirrhosis in each arm and no patient with
      cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate high efficacy and favorable
      tolerability of G/P in GT2-infected Japanese patients. (Hepatology 2017).

AB  - Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a novel cellular glycoprotein,
      has been identified as a suppressor of various cardiovascular diseases because of
      its capacity to reduce hyperplasia, maintain vascular homeostasis, and promote
      endothelial restoration. However, the effects and mechanism of CREG in metabolic 
      disorder and hepatic steatosis remain unknown. Here, we report that
      hepatocyte-specific CREG deletion dramatically exacerbates high-fat diet and
      leptin deficiency-induced (ob/ob) adverse effects such as obesity, hepatic
      steatosis, and metabolic disorders, whereas a beneficial effect is conferred by
      CREG overexpression. Additional experiments demonstrated that c-Jun N-terminal
      kinase 1 (JNK1) but not JNK2 is largely responsible for the protective effect of 
      CREG on the aforementioned pathologies. Notably, JNK1 inhibition strongly
      prevents the adverse effects of CREG deletion on steatosis and related metabolic 
      disorders. Mechanistically, CREG interacts directly with apoptosis
      signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and inhibits its phosphorylation, thereby
      blocking the downstream MKK4/7-JNK1 signaling pathway and leading to
      significantly alleviated obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis.
      Importantly, dramatically reduced CREG expression and hyperactivated JNK1
      signaling was observed in the livers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
      patients, suggesting that CREG might be a promising therapeutic target for NAFLD 
      and related metabolic diseases. CONCLUSION: The results of our study provides
      evidence that CREG is a robust suppressor of hepatic steatosis and metabolic
      disorders through its direct interaction with ASK1 and the resultant inactivation
      of ASK1-JNK1 signaling. This study offers insights into NAFLD pathogenesis and
      its complicated pathologies, such as obesity and insulin resistance, and paves
      the way for disease treatment through targeting CREG. (Hepatology

TI  - How healthy are the "Healthy volunteers"? Penetrance of NAFLD in the biomedical
      research volunteer pool.
PG  - 825-833
LID - 10.1002/hep.29247 [doi]
AB  - Healthy volunteers are crucial for biomedical research. Inadvertent inclusion of 
      subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as controls can compromise
      study validity and subject safety. Given the rising prevalence of NAFLD in the
      general population, we sought to identify its prevalence and potential impact in 
      volunteers for clinical trials. We conducted a cross-sectional study of subjects 
      who were classified as healthy volunteers between 2011 and 2015 and had no known 
      liver disease. Subjects were classified as presumed NAFLD (pNF; alanine
      aminotransferase [ALT] level >/= 20 for women or >/= 31 for men and body mass
      index [BMI] > 25 kg/m(2) ), healthy non-NAFLD controls (normal ALT and BMI), or
      indeterminate. A total of 3160 subjects participated as healthy volunteers in 149
      clinical trials (1-29 trials per subject); 1732 of these subjects (55%) had a BMI
      > 25 kg/m(2) and 1382 (44%) had abnormal ALT. pNF was present in 881 subjects
      (27.9%), and these subjects were older than healthy control subjects and had
      higher triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HbA1c and lower
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.001 for all). The 149 trials included
      101 non-interventional, 33 interventional, and 15 vaccine trials. The impact on
      study validity of recruiting NAFLD subjects as controls was estimated as likely, 
      probable, and unlikely in 10, 41, and 98 trials, respectively. The proportion of 
      pNF subjects (28%-29%) did not differ by impact. Only 14% of trials used both BMI
      and ALT for screening. ALT cutoffs for screening were based on local reference
      values. Grade 3-4 ALT elevations during the study period were rare but more
      common in pNF subjects than in healthy control subjects (4 versus 1). CONCLUSION:
      NAFLD is common and often overlooked in volunteers for clinical trials, despite
      its potential impact on subject safety and validity of study findings. Increased 
      awareness of NAFLD prevalence and stricter ALT cutoffs may ameliorate this
      problem. (Hepatology 2017;66:825-833).

TI  - Autoreactive monoclonal antibodies from patients with primary biliary cholangitis
      recognize environmental xenobiotics.
PG  - 885-895
LID - 10.1002/hep.29245 [doi]
AB  - A major problem in autoimmunity has been identification of the earliest events
      that lead to breach of tolerance. Although there have been major advances in
      dissecting effector pathways and the multilineage immune responses to
      mitochondrial self-antigens in primary biliary cholangitis, the critical links
      between environmental factors and tolerance remain elusive. We hypothesized that 
      environmental xenobiotic modification of the E2 subunit of the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase (PDC-E2) inner lipoyl domain can lead to loss of tolerance to
      genetically susceptible hosts. Previously we demonstrated that serum anti-PDC-E2 
      autoantibodies cross-react with the chemical xenobiotics 2-octynoic acid and
      6,8-bis (acetylthio) octanoic acid and further that there is a high frequency of 
      PDC-E2-specific peripheral plasmablasts. Herein we generated 104 recombinant
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) based on paired heavy-chain and light-chain variable
      regions of individual plasmablasts derived from primary biliary cholangitis
      patients. We identified 32 mAbs reactive with native PDC-E2, including 20
      specific for PDC-E2 and 12 cross-reactive with both PDC-E2 and 2-octynoic acid
      and 6,8-bis (acetylthio) octanoic acid. A lower frequency of replacement somatic 
      hypermutations, indicating a lower level of affinity maturation, was observed in 
      the complementarity-determining regions of the cross-reactive mAbs in comparison 
      to mAbs exclusively recognizing PDC-E2 or those for irrelevant antigens. In
      particular, when the highly mutated heavy-chain gene of a cross-reactive mAb was 
      reverted to the germline sequence, the PDC-E2 reactivity was reduced
      dramatically, whereas the xenobiotic reactivity was retained. Importantly,
      cross-reactive mAbs also recognized lipoic acid, a mitochondrial fatty acid that 
      is covalently bound to PDC-E2. CONCLUSION: Our data reflect that chemically
      modified lipoic acid or lipoic acid itself, through molecular mimicry, is the
      initial target that leads to the development of primary biliary cholangitis.

TI  - Pentamidine blocks hepatotoxic injury in mice.
PG  - 922-935
LID - 10.1002/hep.29244 [doi]
AB  - Toxin-induced liver diseases lack effective therapies despite increased
      understanding of the role factors such as an overactive innate immune response
      play in the pathogenesis of this form of hepatic injury. Pentamidine is an
      effective antimicrobial agent against several human pathogens, but studies have
      also suggested that this drug inhibits inflammation. This potential
      anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, together with the development of a new
      oral form of pentamidine isethionate VLX103, led to investigations of the
      effectiveness of this drug in the prevention and treatment of hepatotoxic liver
      injury. Pretreatment with a single injection of VLX103 in the d-galactosamine
      (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of acute, fulminant liver injury
      dramatically decreased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, histological
      injury, the number of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine 
      triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and mortality compared with
      vehicle-injected controls. VLX103 decreased GalN/LPS induction of tumor necrosis 
      factor (TNF) but had no effect on other proinflammatory cytokines. VLX103
      prevented the proinflammatory activation of cultured hepatic macrophages and
      partially blocked liver injury from GalN/TNF. In GalN/LPS-treated mice, VLX103
      decreased activation of both the mitochondrial death pathway and downstream
      effector caspases 3 and 7, which resulted from reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase
      activation and initiator caspase 8 cleavage. Delaying VLX103 treatment for up to 
      3 hours after GalN/LPS administration was still remarkably effective in blocking 
      liver injury in this model. Oral administration of VLX103 also decreased
      hepatotoxic injury in a second more chronic model of alcohol-induced liver
      injury, as demonstrated by decreased serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase
      levels and numbers of TUNEL-positive cells. CONCLUSION: VLX103 effectively
      decreases toxin-induced liver injury in mice and may be an effective therapy for 
      this and other forms of human liver disease. (Hepatology 2017;66:922-935).

TI  - Protein disulfide isomerase inhibition synergistically enhances the efficacy of
      sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 855-868
LID - 10.1002/hep.29237 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is the only approved targeted drug for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
      but its effect on patients' survival gain is limited and varies over a wide range
      depending on pathogenetic conditions. Thus, enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib
      and finding a reliable predictive biomarker are crucial to achieve efficient
      control of HCCs. In this study, we utilized a systems approach by combining
      transcriptome analysis of the mRNA changes in HCC cell lines in response to
      sorafenib with network analysis to investigate the action and resistance
      mechanism of sorafenib. Gene list functional enrichment analysis and gene set
      enrichment analysis revealed that proteotoxic stress and apoptosis modules are
      activated in the presence of sorafenib. Further analysis of the endoplasmic
      reticulum stress network model, combined with in vitro experiments, showed that
      introducing an additional stress by treating the orally active protein disulfide 
      isomerase (PDI) inhibitor (PACMA 31) can synergistically increase the efficacy of
      sorafenib in vitro and in vivo, which was confirmed using a mouse xenograft
      model. We also found that HCC patients with high PDI expression show resistance
      to sorafenib and poor clinical outcomes, compared to the low-PDI-expression
      group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PDI is a promising therapeutic
      target for enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib and can also be a biomarker for
      predicting sorafenib responsiveness. (Hepatology 2017;66:855-868).

TI  - SIRT1/HSF1/HSP pathway is essential for exenatide-alleviated, lipid-induced
      hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.
PG  - 809-824
LID - 10.1002/hep.29238 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that lipid-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      stress is a major contributor to the progression of hepatic steatosis. Exenatide 
      (exendin-4), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is known to improve
      hepatic steatosis, with accumulating evidence. In this study, we investigated
      whether exenatide could alleviate lipid-induced hepatic ER stress through mammal 
      sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and illustrated the detailed mechanisms. Male C57BL/6J mice
      challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with exenatide or normal
      saline by intraperitoneal injection for 4 weeks. We observed that HFD feeding
      induced hepatic ER stress as indicated by increased expression of
      glucose-regulated protein 78, phosphorylated protein kinase-like ER kinase, and
      phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, while these increases were
      significantly inhibited by exenatide. Exenatide notably decreased the liver
      weight and hepatic steatosis induced by HFD challenge. Consistently, in human
      HepG2 cells and primary murine hepatocytes, exendin-4 also significantly
      alleviated the ER stress and lipid accumulation induced by palmitate.
      Importantly, further studies showed that exendin-4 enhanced the binding of heat
      shock factor 1 to the promoter of heat shock protein (HSP) genes through
      SIRT1-mediated deacetylation, which then increased the expression of molecular
      chaperones HSP70 and HSP40 to alleviate hepatic ER stress. Finally, inhibition of
      SIRT1 by genetic whole-body heterozygous knockout or by lentiviral short hairpin 
      RNA knockdown greatly diminished the effect of exenatide on deacetylating heat
      shock factor 1, increasing HSP expression and alleviating ER stress and hepatic
      steatosis in HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSION: The SIRT1/heat shock factor 1/HSP pathway 
      is essential for exenatide-alleviated, lipid-induced ER stress and hepatic
      steatosis, which provides evidence for a molecular mechanism to support exenatide
      and incretin mimetics as promising therapeutics for obesity-induced hepatic
      steatosis. (Hepatology 2017;66:809-824).

TI  - Sirtuin 3 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy dictating hepatocyte
      susceptibility to lipotoxicity.
PG  - 936-952
LID - 10.1002/hep.29229 [doi]
AB  - Lipotoxicity induced by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) plays a central role in the 
      pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the exact
      mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase located primarily inside mitochondria.
      In this study, we demonstrated that an SFA-rich high-fat diet (HFD) was more
      detrimental to the liver than an isocaloric unsaturated HFD rich in fatty acids. 
      Unexpectedly, SIRT3 expression and activity were significantly elevated in the
      livers of mice exposed to the SFA-rich HFD. Using cultured HepG2 and AML-12
      hepatocytes, we demonstrated that unlike monounsaturated fatty acids, SFAs
      up-regulate SIRT3 expression and activity. SIRT3 overexpression renders both the 
      liver and hepatocytes susceptible to palmitate-induced cell death, which can be
      alleviated by SIRT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. In contrast,
      SIRT3 suppression protects hepatocytes from palmitate cytotoxicity. Further
      studies revealed that SIRT3 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy, thereby
      enhancing the susceptibility of hepatocytes to SFA-induced cytotoxicity.
      Mechanistic investigations revealed that SIRT3 overexpression causes manganese
      superoxide dismutase deacetylation and activation, which depleted intracellular
      superoxide contents, leading to adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
      (AMPK) inhibition and mammalian target of rapamycin C1 activation, resulting in
      autophagy suppression. In contrast, SIRT3 siRNA gene silencing enhanced autophagy
      flux. A similar result was observed in the liver tissue of SIRT3 knockout mice.
      CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SIRT3 is a negative regulator of autophagy
      whose activation by SFAs contributes to lipotoxicity in hepatocytes and suggest
      that restraining SIRT3 overactivation can be a potential therapeutic choice for
      the treatment of NAFLD as well as other metabolic disorders, with lipotoxicity
      being the principal pathomechanism. (Hepatology 2017;66:936-952).

TI  - PTEN Down-Regulation Promotes beta-Oxidation to Fuel Hypertrophic Liver Growth
      After Hepatectomy in Mice.
PG  - 908-921
LID - 10.1002/hep.29226 [doi]
AB  - In regenerating liver, hepatocytes accumulate lipids before the major wave of
      parenchymal growth. This transient, regeneration-associated steatosis (TRAS) is
      required for liver recovery, but its purpose is unclear. The tumor suppressor
      phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a key inhibitor of the protein kinase
      B/mammalian target of rapamycin axis that regulates growth and metabolic
      adaptations after hepatectomy. In quiescent liver, PTEN causes pathological
      steatosis when lost, whereas its role in regenerating liver remains unknown.
      Here, we show that PTEN down-regulation promotes liver growth in a TRAS-dependent
      way. In wild-type mice, PTEN reduction occurred after TRAS formation, persisted
      during its disappearance, and correlated with up-regulated beta-oxidation at the 
      expense of lipogenesis. Pharmacological modulation revealed an association of
      PTEN with TRAS turnover and hypertrophic liver growth. In liver-specific
      Pten(-/-) mice shortly after induction of knockout, hypertrophic regeneration was
      accelerated and led to hepatomegaly. The resulting surplus liver mass was
      functional, as demonstrated by raised survival in a lethal model of
      resection-induced liver failure. Indirect calorimetry revealed lipid oxidation as
      the primary energy source early after hepatectomy. The shift from glucose to
      lipid usage was pronounced in Pten(-/-) mice and correlated with the
      disappearance of TRAS. Partial inhibition of beta-oxidation led to persisting
      TRAS in Pten(-/-) mice and abrogated hypertrophic liver growth. PTEN
      down-regulation may promote beta-oxidation through beta-catenin, whereas
      hypertrophy was dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. CONCLUSION:
      PTEN down-regulation after hepatectomy promotes the burning of TRAS-derived
      lipids to fuel hypertrophic liver regeneration. Therefore, the anabolic function 
      of PTEN deficiency in resting liver is transformed into catabolic activities upon
      tissue loss. These findings portray PTEN as a node coordinating liver growth with
      its energy demands and emphasize the need of lipids for regeneration. (Hepatology

TI  - Pentraxin-3 modulates lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and
      attenuates liver injury.
PG  - 953-968
LID - 10.1002/hep.29215 [doi]
AB  - Acute-on-chronic liver injury is characterized by an important inflammatory
      response frequently associated with endotoxemia. In this context, acute-phase
      proteins such as Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) are released; however, little is known about 
      their role in chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate the
      role of PTX3 in liver injury. The role of PTX3 was evaluated in cultured human
      cells, liver tissue slices, and mice with acute-on-chronic liver injury. PTX3
      expression was assessed in tissue and serum samples from 54 patients with
      alcoholic hepatitis. PTX3 expression was up-regulated in animal models of liver
      injury and strongly induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Liver cell fractionation
      showed that macrophages and activated hepatic stellate cells were the main cell
      types expressing PTX3 in liver injury. Ex vivo and in vivo studies showed that
      PTX3 treatment attenuated LPS-induced liver injury, inflammation, and cell
      recruitment. Mechanistically, PTX3 mediated the hepatic stellate cell
      wound-healing response. Moreover, PTX3 modulated LPS-induced inflammation in
      human primary liver macrophages and peripheral monocytes by enhancing a TIR
      domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-dependent response and favoring a
      macrophage interleukin-10-like phenotype. Additionally, hepatic and plasma PTX3
      levels were increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, a prototypic
      acute-on-chronic condition; and its expression correlated with disease severity
      scores, endotoxemia, infections, and short-term mortality, thus suggesting that
      expression of PTX3 found in patients could be a counterregulatory response to
      injury. CONCLUSION: Experimental and human evidence suggests that, in addition to
      being a potential biomarker for alcoholic hepatitis, PTX3 participates in the
      wound-healing response and attenuates LPS-induced liver injury and inflammation; 
      therefore, administration of PTX3 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in
      acute-on-chronic conditions, particularly those associated with endotoxemia.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of complications of selective internal radiation
      therapy: Expert guidance and systematic review.
PG  - 969-982
LID - 10.1002/hep.29207 [doi]
AB  - Selective internal radiation therapy (or radioembolization) by intra-arterial
      injection of radioactive yttrium-90-loaded microspheres is increasingly used for 
      the treatment of patients with liver metastases or primary liver cancer. The
      high-dose beta-radiation penetrates an average of only 2.5 mm from the source,
      thus limiting its effects to the site of delivery. However, the off-target
      diversion of yttrium-90 microspheres to tissues other than the tumor may lead to 
      complications. The most prominent of these complications include radiation
      gastritis and gastrointestinal ulcers, cholecystitis, radiation pneumonitis, and 
      radioembolization-induced liver disease, which may occur despite careful
      pretreatment planning. Thus, selective internal radiation therapy demands an
      expert multidisciplinary team approach in order to provide comprehensive care for
      patients. This review provides recommendations to multidisciplinary teams on the 
      optimal medical processes in order to ensure the safe delivery of selective
      internal radiation therapy. Based on the best available published evidence and
      expert opinion, we recommend the most appropriate strategies for the prevention, 
      early diagnosis, and management of potential radiation injury to the liver and to
      other organs. (Hepatology 2017;66:969-982).

TI  - Monotherapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for multiple drug-resistant
      chronic hepatitis B: 3-year trial.
PG  - 772-783
LID - 10.1002/hep.29187 [doi]
AB  - Combination therapy has been recommended for the treatment of patients harboring 
      multiple drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, we recently
      demonstrated that monotherapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) for 48
      weeks displayed noninferior efficacy to TDF plus entecavir (ETV) combination
      therapy in patients with HBV resistant to multiple drugs, including ETV and
      adefovir. Nonetheless, whether prolonged TDF monotherapy would be safe and
      increase the virologic response rate in these patients was unclear. Among 192
      patients with HBV-resistance mutations to ETV and/or adefovir, who were
      randomized to receive TDF monotherapy (n = 95) or TDF/ETV combination therapy (n 
      = 97) for 48 weeks, 189 agreed to continue TDF monotherapy (TDF-TDF group) or to 
      switch to TDF monotherapy (TDF/ETV-TDF group) and 180 (93.8%) completed the
      144-week study. Serum HBV DNA <15 IU/mL at week 48, the primary efficacy
      endpoint, was achieved in 66.3% in the TDF-TDF group and 68.0% in the TDF/ETV-TDF
      group (P = 0.80). At week 144, the proportion with HBV DNA <15 IU/mL increased to
      74.5%, which was significantly higher compared with that at week 48 (P = 0.03),
      without a significant difference between groups (P = 0.46). By on-treatment
      analysis, a total of 79.4% had HBV DNA <15 IU/mL at week 144. Transient virologic
      breakthrough occurred in 6 patients, which was due to poor drug adherence. At
      week 144, 19 patients who had HBV DNA levels >60 IU/mL qualified for genotypic
      resistance analysis, and 6 retained some of their baseline resistance mutations
      of HBV. No patients developed additional resistance mutations throughout the
      study period. CONCLUSION: TDF monotherapy was efficacious and safe for up to 144 
      weeks, providing an increasing rate of virologic response in heavily pretreated
      patients with multidrug-resistant HBV. (Hepatology 2017;66:772-783).

TI  - Hepatitis C viral load, genotype, and increased risk of developing end-stage
      renal disease: REVEAL-HCV study.
PG  - 784-793
LID - 10.1002/hep.29192 [doi]
AB  - The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) remains controversial without considering the role of HCV viral
      load and genotype. This study aimed to determine whether HCV RNA level and
      genotype affect the risk of developing ESRD. Between 1991 and 1992, 19,984
      participants aged 30-65 years were enrolled in a community-based prospective
      cohort study in Taiwan. Chronic HCV infection was defined by detectable HCV viral
      load. ESRD was determined as the need for chronic dialysis or renal
      transplantation. Conventional Cox proportional hazard and competing risk models
      were used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) for ESRD. After a median follow-up
      of 16.8 years, 204 cases were detected during 319,474 person-years. The incidence
      rates of ESRD for nonchronically HCV-infected and chronically HCV-infected
      patients were 60.2 and 194.3 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The
      multivariable HR was 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-3.89) when comparing
      patients with and without chronic HCV infection. Patients with low and high HCV
      RNA levels were at higher risk of ESRD than those who were nonchronically
      HCV-infected (HR, 2.11, 95% CI 1.16-3.86, and HR, 3.06, 95% CI 1.23-7.58; Ptrend 
      < 0.001). This association remained robust after taking pre-ESRD death as a
      competing event for ESRD. Patients with HCV genotype 1 tended to have a higher
      risk of developing ESRD (HR, 3.60 95% CI 1.83-7.07) compared with nonchronically 
      HCV-infected subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that chronic HCV infection
      is associated with an increased risk of developing ESRD and suggests that
      elevated serum levels of HCV RNA (>167,000 IU/mL) and HCV genotype 1 are strong
      predictors of ESRD, indicating clinical implications for the management of
      chronic HCV. (Hepatology 2017;66:784-793).

TI  - Ginsenoside Rg3 restores hepatitis C virus-induced aberrant mitochondrial
      dynamics and inhibits virus propagation.
PG  - 758-771
LID - 10.1002/hep.29177 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) alters mitochondrial dynamics associated with persistent 
      viral infection and suppression of innate immunity. Mitochondrial dysfunction is 
      also a pathologic feature of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Despite the
      high efficacy of DAAs, their use in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C in
      interferon-sparing regimens occasionally produces undesirable side effects such
      as fatigue, migraine, and other conditions, which may be linked to mitochondrial 
      dysfunction. Here, we show that clinically prescribed DAAs, including sofosbuvir,
      affect mitochondrial dynamics. To counter these adverse effects, we examined
      HCV-induced and DAA-induced aberrant mitochondrial dynamics modulated by
      ginsenoside, which is known to support healthy mitochondrial physiology and the
      innate immune system. We screened several ginsenoside compounds showing antiviral
      activity using a robust HCV cell culture system. We investigated the role of
      ginsenosides in antiviral efficacy, alteration of mitochondrial transmembrane
      potential, abnormal mitochondrial fission, its upstream signaling, and mitophagic
      process caused by HCV infection or DAA treatment. Only one of the compounds,
      ginsenoside Rg3 (G-Rg3), exhibited notable and promising anti-HCV potential.
      Treatment of HCV-infected cells with G-Rg3 increased HCV core protein-mediated
      reduction in the expression level of cytosolic p21, required for increasing
      cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity, which catalyzes Ser616 phosphorylation of
      dynamin-related protein 1. The HCV-induced mitophagy, which follows mitochondrial
      fission, was also rescued by G-Rg3 treatment. CONCLUSION: G-Rg3 inhibits HCV
      propagation. Its antiviral mechanism involves restoring the HCV-induced
      dynamin-related protein 1-mediated aberrant mitochondrial fission process,
      thereby resulting in suppression of persistent HCV infection. (Hepatology
      2017;66:758-771).

TI  - Statins decrease the risk of decompensation in hepatitis B virus- and hepatitis C
      virus-related cirrhosis: A population-based study.
PG  - 896-907
LID - 10.1002/hep.29172 [doi]
AB  - Statin use decreases the risk of decompensation and mortality in patients with
      cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether this beneficial effect can be
      extended to cirrhosis in the general population or cirrhosis due to other causes,
      such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or alcohol, remains unknown. Statin use
      also decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with
      chronic HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether the effect can be observed
      in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The goal of this study was to determine 
      the effect of statin use on rates of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in HBV-, 
      HCV-, and alcohol-related cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis were identified from
      a representative cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries from
      2000 to 2013. Statin users, defined as having a cumulative defined daily dose
      (cDDD) >/=28, were selected and served as the case cohort. Statin nonusers (<28
      cDDD) were matched through propensity scores. The association between statin use 
      and risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC were estimated. A total of 1350
      patients with cirrhosis were enrolled. Among patients with cirrhosis, statin use 
      decreased the risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in a dose-dependent
      manner (P for trend <0.0001, <0.0001, and 0.009, respectively). Regression
      analysis revealed a lower risk of decompensation among statin users with
      cirrhosis due to chronic HBV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 0.25-0.62) or HCV infection (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93). The
      lowered risk of decompensation was of borderline significance among statin users 
      with alcohol-related cirrhosis (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.07). CONCLUSION: Statin 
      use decreases the decompensation rate in both HBV- and HCV-related cirrhosis. Of 
      borderline significance is a decreased decompensation rate in alcohol-related
      cirrhosis. (Hepatology 2017;66:896-907).

TI  - Hepatitis C virus-induced CCL5 secretion from macrophages activates hepatic
      stellate cells.
PG  - 746-757
LID - 10.1002/hep.29170 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated chronic liver disease is a serious health
      problem around the world and often causes fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular
      carcinoma. The mechanism of liver disease progression during HCV infection is
      still unclear, although inflammation is believed to be an important player in
      disease pathogenesis. We previously reported that macrophages including Kupffer
      cells exposed to HCV induce proinflammatory cytokines. These secreted cytokines
      may activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) toward fibrosis. In this study, we
      examined crosstalk between macrophages and HSCs following HCV infection. Primary 
      human HSCs and immortalized HSCs (LX2 cells) were incubated with conditioned
      medium derived from HCV-exposed human macrophages. Expression of inflammasome and
      fibrosis-related genes in these cells was examined, with increased expression of 
      inflammatory (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, interleukins 1beta and 6, and
      cysteine-cysteine chemokine ligand 5 [CCL5]) and profibrogenic (transforming
      growth factor beta1, collagen type 4 alpha 1, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and
      alpha-smooth muscle actin) markers. Further investigation suggested that CCL5,
      secreted from HCV-exposed macrophages, activates inflammasome and fibrosis
      markers in HSCs and that neutralizing antibody to CCL5 inhibited activation.
      CONCLUSION: Together, our results demonstrate that human macrophages exposed to
      HCV induce CCL5 secretion, which plays a significant role in hepatic inflammation
      and fibrosis. (Hepatology 2017;66:746-757).

TI  - The role of long noncoding RNA H19 in gender disparity of cholestatic liver
      injury in multidrug resistance 2 gene knockout mice.
PG  - 869-884
LID - 10.1002/hep.29145 [doi]
AB  - The multidrug resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mouse is a well-established
      model of cholestatic cholangiopathies. Female Mdr2(-/-) mice develop more severe 
      hepatobiliary damage than male Mdr2(-/-) mice, which is correlated with a higher 
      proportion of taurocholate in the bile. Although estrogen has been identified as 
      an important player in intrahepatic cholestasis, the underlying molecular
      mechanisms of gender-based disparity of cholestatic injury remain unclear. The
      long noncoding RNA H19 is an imprinted, maternally expressed, and
      estrogen-targeted gene, which is significantly induced in human
      fibrotic/cirrhotic liver and bile duct-ligated mouse liver. However, whether
      aberrant expression of H19 accounts for gender-based disparity of cholestatic
      injury in Mdr2(-/-) mice remains unknown. The current study demonstrated that H19
      was markedly induced ( approximately 200-fold) in the livers of female Mdr2(-/-) 
      mice at advanced stages of cholestasis (100 days old) but not in age-matched male
      Mdr2(-/-) mice. During the early stages of cholestasis, H19 expression was
      minimal. We further determined that hepatic H19 was mainly expressed in
      cholangiocytes, not hepatocytes. Both taurocholate and estrogen significantly
      activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway and
      induced H19 expression in cholangiocytes. Knocking down H19 not only
      significantly reduced taurocholate/estrogen-induced expression of fibrotic genes 
      and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 in cholangiocytes but also markedly
      reduced cholestatic injury in female Mdr2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, expression of
      small heterodimer partner was substantially inhibited at advanced stages of liver
      fibrosis, which was reversed by H19 short hairpin RNA in female Mdr2(-/-) mice.
      Similar findings were obtained in human primary sclerosing cholangitis liver
      samples. CONCLUSION: H19 plays a critical role in the disease progression of
      cholestasis and represents a key factor that causes the gender disparity of
      cholestatic liver injury in Mdr2(-/-) mice. (Hepatology 2017;66:869-884).

      Willebrand disease were enrolled at 31 study sites in the United States, Europe, 
      Australia, Canada, Israel, and Thailand. Patients were given an oral, once-daily,
      fixed-dose combination of EBR/GZR 50 mg/100 mg for 12 weeks and randomized to the
      immediate-treatment group (ITG) or deferred-treatment group (DTG; placebo
      followed by active treatment). The primary endpoints were the proportion of
      patients in the ITG with unquantifiable HCV RNA 12 weeks posttreatment (sustained
      virological response 12 weeks after completion of study treatment; SVR12) and the
      comparison of safety in the ITG and DTG. In the ITG, 100 of 107 patients (93.5%) 
      achieved SVR12, 6 relapsed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in
      94.7% (18 of 19), 97.6% (40 of 41), and 89.4% (42 of 47) of patients with sickle 
      cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease,
      respectively. Serious adverse events were reported by 2.8% (n = 3) and 11.5% (n =
      6) of patients in the ITG and DTG, respectively. Hemoglobin levels and
      international normalized ratio values were similar in patients receiving EBR/GZR 
      and placebo; among patients with hemoglobinopathies, change in mean hemoglobin
      levels was similar in those receiving EBR/GZR compared to those receiving
      placebo. CONCLUSION: These results add to the expanding pool of data available
      for EBR/GZR, indicating a high level of efficacy and favorable tolerability in
      patients with HCV infection. (Hepatology 2017;66:736-745).

AB  - Maturation of hepatic cells can be gradually acquired through multiple stages of 
      hepatic lineage specification, while it is unclear whether hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection is maturationally lineage-dependent. We investigated the
      susceptibility to HCV at multiple stages of human embryonic stem cells,
      definitive endodermal cells, hepatic stem cells, hepatoblasts (hHBs), and mature 
      hepatocytes. Susceptibility to infection occurred initially at the stage of human
      hepatic stem cells; however, hHBs proved to have the highest permissiveness and
      infectivity compared with all other stages. The hHBs' susceptibility to HCV
      correlated with the translocation of occludin, an HCV receptor, from cytoplasm to
      plasma membrane of HBs. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor enhanced the HCV 
      susceptibility of hHBs through rearrangement of occludin by dephosphorylation;
      this minimized hHB polarization and prevented hHBs from further maturation. The
      transcription profiles of different hepatic lineage stages indicated that
      expression of innate immune response genes was correlated with hepatic
      maturation; interferon beta played an important role in protecting hHBs from HCV 
      infection. HCV-infected hHBs were able to engraft and integrate into the livers
      of Fah(-/-) Rag2(-/-) mice and maintained an hHB phenotype for over 12 weeks
      during the time when HCV antigen was evident. After suppression of interferon
      beta in hHBs, HCV infection was significantly enhanced in the engrafted humanized
      liver tissue of host mice. CONCLUSION: Human embryonic stem cell-derived hHBs are
      the optimal hosts for HCV infectivity; the realization that HCV entry and
      replication occur primarily at a particular hepatic lineage stage enables us to
      understand the HCV infection factors, life cycle, and infection dynamics that are
      facets of the pathogenesis as well as suggesting targets for anti-HCV treatment.

TI  - Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is the limiting host factor of
      hepatitis B virus infection in macaque and pig hepatocytes.
PG  - 703-716
LID - 10.1002/hep.29112 [doi]
AB  - Infections with the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV)
      depend on species-specific host factors like the receptor human sodium
      taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP). Complementation of mouse
      hepatocytes with hNTCP confers susceptibility to HDV but not HBV, indicating the 
      requirement of additional HBV-specific factors. As an essential premise toward
      the establishment of an HBV-susceptible animal model, we investigated the role of
      hNTCP as a limiting factor of hepatocytes in commonly used laboratory animals.
      Primary hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, pigs, rhesus macaques, and cynomolgus 
      macaques were transduced with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding hNTCP and
      subsequently infected with HBV. Cells were analyzed for Myrcludex B binding,
      taurocholate uptake, HBV covalently closed circular DNA formation, and expression
      of all HBV markers. Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) from
      the respective species was cloned and analyzed for HBV and HDV receptor activity 
      in a permissive hepatoma cell line. Expression of hNTCP in mouse, rat, and dog
      hepatocytes permits HDV infection but does not allow establishment of HBV
      infection. Contrarily, hepatocytes from cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques, and
      pigs became fully susceptible to HBV upon hNTCP expression with efficiencies
      comparable to human hepatocytes. Analysis of cloned Ntcp from all species
      revealed a pronounced role of the human homologue to support HBV and HDV
      infection. CONCLUSION: Ntcp is the key host factor limiting HBV infection in
      cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and in pigs. In rodents (mouse, rat) and dogs,
      transfer of hNTCP supports viral entry but additional host factors are required
      for the establishment of HBV infection. This finding paves the way for the
      development of macaques and pigs as immunocompetent animal models to study HBV
      infection in vivo, immunological responses against the virus and viral
      pathogenesis. (Hepatology 2017;66:703-716).

TI  - A liver-specific long noncoding RNA with a role in cell viability is elevated in 
      human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
PG  - 794-808
LID - 10.1002/hep.29034 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocyte apoptosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to fibrosis 
      and cirrhosis, which permanently damage the liver. Understanding the regulation
      of hepatocyte apoptosis is therefore important to identify therapeutic targets
      that may prevent the progression of NASH to fibrosis. Recently, increasing
      evidence has shown that long noncoding (lnc) RNAs are involved in various
      biological processes and that their dysregulation underlies a number of complex
      human diseases. By performing gene expression profiling of 4,383 lncRNAs in 82
      liver samples from individuals with NASH (n = 48), simple steatosis but no NASH
      (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 23), we discovered a liver-specific lncRNA
      (RP11-484N16.1) on chromosome 18 that showed significantly elevated expression in
      the liver tissue of NASH patients. This lncRNA, which we named lnc18q22.2 based
      on its chromosomal location, correlated with NASH grade (r = 0.51, P = 8.11 x
      10(-7) ), lobular inflammation (r = 0.49, P = 2.35 x 10(-6) ), and nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease activity score (r = 0.48, P = 4.69 x 10(-6) ). The
      association of lnc18q22.2 to liver steatosis and steatohepatitis was replicated
      in 44 independent liver biopsies (r = 0.47, P = 0.0013). We provided a genetic
      structure of lnc18q22.2 showing an extended exon 2 in liver. Knockdown of
      lnc18q22.2 in four different hepatocyte cell lines resulted in severe phenotypes 
      ranging from reduced cell growth to lethality. This observation was consistent
      with pathway analyses of genes coexpressed with lnc18q22.2 in human liver or
      affected by lnc18q22.2 knockdown. CONCLUSION: We identified an lncRNA that can
      play an important regulatory role in liver function and provide new insights into
      the regulation of hepatocyte viability in NASH. (Hepatology 2017;66:794-808).

TI  - Continuous renal replacement therapy is associated with reduced serum ammonia
      levels and mortality in acute liver failure.

AB  - Hyperammonemia has been associated with intracranial hypertension and mortality
      in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). We evaluated the effect of renal
      replacement therapy (RRT) on serum ammonia level and outcomes in ALF. This was a 
      multicenter cohort study of consecutive ALF patients from the United States ALF
      Study Group registry between January 1998 and December 2016. First, we studied
      the association of ammonia with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and 21-day
      transplant-free survival (TFS; n = 1,186). Second, we studied the effect of RRT
      on ammonia for the first 3 days post study admission (n = 340) and on 21-day TFS 
      (n = 1,186). Higher admission (n = 1,186) median ammonia level was associated
      with grade 3-4 HE (116 vs. 83 mumol/L) and mortality at day 21 attributed to
      neurological (181 vs. 90 mumol/L) and all causes (114 vs. 83 mumol/L; P < 0.001
      for all). Among 340 patients with serial ammonia levels, 61 (18%) were on
      continuous RRT (CRRT), 59 (17%) were on intermittent RRT (IRRT), and 220 (65%)
      received no RRT for the first 2 days. From days 1 to 3, median ammonia decreased 
      by 38%, 23%, and 19% with CRRT, IRRT, and no RRT, respectively. Comparing to no
      RRT use, whereas ammonia reduction with CRRT was significant (P = 0.007), with
      IRRT it was not (P = 0.75). After adjusting for year of enrollment, age,
      etiology, and disease severity, whereas CRRT (odds ratio [OR], 0.47 [95%
      confidence interval {CI}, 0.26-0.82]) was associated with reduction in 21-day
      transplant-free all-cause mortality, IRRT (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.04-2.72]) was
      associated with an increase. CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of ALF patients,
      hyperammonemia was associated with high-grade HE and worse 21-day TFS. CRRT was
      associated with a reduction in serum ammonia level and improvement of 21-day TFS.

TI  - Viral persistence, liver disease and host response in Hepatitis C-like virus rat 
      model.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29494 [doi]
AB  - The lack of a relevant, tractable, and immunocompetent animal model for hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) has severely impeded investigations of viral persistence, immunity 
      and pathogenesis. In the absence of immunocompetent models with robust HCV
      infection, homolog hepaciviruses in their natural host could potentially provide 
      useful surrogate models. We isolated a rodent hepacivirus (RHV) from wild rats
      (Rattus norvegicus), RHV-rn1, acquired the complete viral genome sequence and
      developed an infectious reverse genetics system. RHV-rn1 resembles HCV in genomic
      features including the pattern of polyprotein cleavage sites and secondary
      structures in the viral 5' and 3' UTRs. We used site-directed and random
      mutagenesis to determine that only the first of the two miR-122 seed sites in
      viral 5'UTR is required for viral replication and persistence in rats. Next, we
      used the clone derived virus progeny to infect several inbred and outbred rat
      strains. Our results determined that RHV-rn1 possesses several HCV-defining
      hallmarks: hepatotropism, propensity to persist, and the ability of induce
      gradual liver damage. Histological examination of liver samples revealed the
      presence of lymphoid aggregates, parenchymal inflammation and macro/micro
      vesicular steatosis in chronically infected rats. Gene expression analysis
      demonstrated that the intrahepatic response during RHV-rn1 infection in rats
      mirrors that of HCV infection, including persistent activation of interferon
      signaling pathways. Finally, we determined that the backbone drug of HCV direct
      acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, Sofosbuvir, effectively suppresses chronic
      RHV-rn1 infection in rats. Taken together, we developed RHV-rn1 infected rats as 
      a fully immunocompetent and informative surrogate model to delineate the
      mechanisms of HCV-related viral persistence, immunity and pathogenesis. This

TI  - Projections of primary liver cancer to 2030 in 30 countries worldwide.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29498 [doi]
AB  - Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the
      second most common cause of cancer death. Future predictions can inform health
      planners and raise awareness of the need for cancer control action. We predicted 
      the future burden of PLC in 30 countries around 2030. Incident cases of PLC
      (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, C22) were obtained
      from 30 countries for 1993-2007. We projected new PLC cases to 2030 using
      age-period-cohort models (NORDPRED software). Age-standardized incidence rates
      per 100,000 person-years were calculated by country and sex. Increases in new
      cases and rates of PLC are projected in both sexes. The largest increases in
      rates are, among men, in Norway (2.9% per annum), US whites (2.6%), and Canada
      (2.4%) and, among women, in the United States (blacks 4.0%), Switzerland (3.4%), 
      and Germany (3.0%). The projected declines are in China, Japan, Singapore, and
      parts of Europe (e.g., Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia). A 35% increase in the 
      number of new cases annually is expected compared to 2005. This increasing burden
      reflects both increasing rates (and the underlying prevalence of risk factors)
      and demographic changes. Japan is the only country with a predicted decline in
      the net number of cases and annual rates by 2030. CONCLUSION: Our reporting of a 
      projected increase in PLC incidence to 2030 in 30 countries serves as a baseline 
      for anticipated declines in the longer term through the control of hepatitis B
      virus and hepatitis C virus infections by vaccination and treatment; however, the
      prospect that rising levels of obesity and its metabolic complications may lead
      to an increased risk of PLC that potentially offsets these gains is a concern.

TI  - Significance of definitions of relapse after discontinuation of oral antivirals
      in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29497 [doi]
AB  - Relapses are observed in most HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients who
      discontinue nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), but the rates of relapse vary widely
      among studies and whether all patients with relapse need retreatment is unclear. 
      The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different definitions on the
      rates of post-treatment relapse and therefore on the probability of retreatment
      in such patients who discontinued effective long-term NAs therapy. In total, 130 
      non-cirrhotic HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients before NAs were
      included. All had on-therapy virological remission for >/=24 months and close
      follow-up for >/=12 months after stopping NAs or until retreatment, which started
      on stringent predefined criteria. Relapses rates based on several predetermined
      definitions of virological and perhaps biochemical criteria were assessed. The
      median duration of therapy was 60 and of on-therapy virological remission 43
      months. During a median off-NAs follow-up of 15 months, no patient experienced
      liver decompensation or died. Cumulative relapse rates ranged between 2%-49% at
      3, 4%-73% at 6, 11%-82% at 12 and 16%-90% at 24 months, whereas cumulative
      retreatment rates were 15%, 22% and 40% at 6, 12 and 24 months after NAs
      discontinuation. No patient characteristic was independently associated with the 
      probability of relapse based on at least two definitions or of retreatment. In
      conclusion, in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients who discontinue NAs,
      the definition of relapse has great impact on the off-NAs relapse rates and
      potentially on the probability of retreatment. Regardless of definition, off-NAs 
      relapses cannot be easily predicted by the patients' characteristics. A
      substantial proportion of such patients may not require retreatment if stringent 
      criteria are adopted. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Self-assembled liver organoids recapitulate hepatobiliary organogenesis in vitro.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29483 [doi]
AB  - Several three-dimensional cell culture systems are currently available to create 
      liver organoids. In gneral, these systems display better physiologic and
      metabolic aspects of intact liver tissue compared with two-dimensional culture
      systems. However, none reliably mimic human liver development, including parallel
      formation of hepatocyte and cholangiocyte anatomical structures. Here, we show
      that human fetal liver progenitor cells self-assembled inside acellular liver
      extracellular matrix scaffolds to form three-dimensional liver organoids that
      recapitulated several aspects of hepatobiliary organogenesis and resulted in
      concomitant formation of progressively more differentiated hepatocytes and bile
      duct structures. The duct morphogenesis process was interrupted by inhibiting
      Notch signaling, in an attempt to create a liver developmental disease model with
      a similar phenotype to Alagille syndrome. CONCLUSION: In the current study, we
      created an in vitro model of human liver development and disease, physiology, and
      metabolism, supported by liver extracellular matrix substrata; we envision that
      it will be used in the future to study mechanisms of hepatic and biliary
      development and for disease modeling and drug screening. (Hepatology 2017;

TI  - Engaging hepatitis C infected patients in cost-effectiveness analyses: A
      literature review.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29482 [doi]
AB  - Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment
      strategies have become common, but few appear to include patient engagement or
      the patient perspective. The objectives of the current study were to (1) identify
      published HCV CEA studies that include patient input and (2) derive insights on
      patient-informed variable and outcome selection to build a framework for future
      economic analyses of HCV. A literature search was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE,
      and PubMed from January 1, 2012 to May 28, 2017. Terms sought included a
      combination of "incremental cost-effectiveness ratio" OR "economic evaluation" OR
      "cost effectiveness analysis" OR "cost utility analysis" OR "budget impact
      analysis" OR "cost benefit analysis" AND "hepatitis C". A total of 1,040 articles
      were identified in the search and seven articles were selected for further
      evaluation after abstracts and the full text of eligible articles were screened. 
      One economic evaluation used direct patient engagement to account for patient
      preferences in the final model. The study endpoints identified included a variety
      of clinical, social, psychological, and economic outcomes. Costs primarily
      focused on productivity loss, missed work, out-of-pocket treatment costs, and
      indirect costs to family or friends supporting the patient. CONCLUSION: To date, 
      the inclusion of the patient voice through patient engagement as part of methods 
      in cost-effectiveness research in existing published studies has been limited.
      Future CEA studies should consider how patient engagement may impact economic
      models and their implementation into practice. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of cenicriviroc for treatment of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with fibrosis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29477 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate cenicriviroc (CVC), a dual antagonist of CC
      chemokine receptor types 2 and 5, for treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) with liver fibrosis (LF). A randomized, double-blind, multinational phase 
      2b study enrolled subjects with NASH, a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity
      score (NAS) >/=4, and LF (stages 1-3, NASH Clinical Research Network) at 81
      clinical sites. Subjects (N = 289) were randomly assigned CVC 150 mg or placebo. 
      Primary outcome was >/=2-point improvement in NAS and no worsening of fibrosis at
      year 1. Key secondary outcomes were: resolution of steatohepatitis (SH) and no
      worsening of fibrosis; improvement in fibrosis by >/=1 stage and no worsening of 
      SH. Biomarkers of inflammation and adverse events were assessed. Full study
      recruitment was achieved. The primary endpoint of NAS improvement in the
      intent-to-treat population and resolution of SH was achieved in a similar
      proportion of subjects on CVC (N = 145) and placebo (N = 144; 16% vs. 19%, P =
      0.52 and 8% vs. 6%, P = 0.49, respectively). However, the fibrosis endpoint was
      met in significantly more subjects on CVC than placebo (20% vs. 10%; P = 0.02).
      Treatment benefits were greater in those with higher disease activity and
      fibrosis stage at baseline. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation were reduced with
      CVC. Safety and tolerability of CVC were comparable to placebo. CONCLUSION: After
      1 year of CVC treatment, twice as many subjects achieved improvement in fibrosis 
      and no worsening of SH compared with placebo. Given the urgent need to develop
      antifibrotic therapies in NASH, these findings warrant phase 3 evaluation.

TI  - Projected increase in obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related liver
      transplantation waitlist additions in the United States.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29473 [doi]
AB  - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis is the fastest growing indication 
      for liver transplantation (LT) in the US. We aimed to determine the temporal
      trend behind the rise in obesity and NASH-related additions to the LT waitlist in
      the US and make projections for future NASH burden on the LT waitlist. We used
      data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database from
      2000-2014 to obtain the number of NASH-related LT waitlist additions. The obese
      population in the US from 2000-2014 was estimated using data from the US Census
      Bureau and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Based on obesity
      trends, we established a time lag between obesity prevalence and NASH-related
      waitlist additions. We used data from the US Census Bureau on population
      projections from 2016-2030 to forecast obesity estimates and NASH-related LT
      waitlist additions. From 2000-2014, the proportion of obese individuals
      significantly increased 44.9% and the number of NASH-related annual waitlist
      additions increased from 391 to 1605. Increase in obesity prevalence was strongly
      associated with LT waitlist additions 9 years later in derivation and validation 
      cohorts (R(2) =0.9). Based on these data, annual NASH-related waitlist additions 
      are anticipated to increase by 55.4% (1,354 to 2,104) between 2016 and 2030.
      There is significant regional variation in obesity rates and in the anticipated
      increase in NASH-related waitlist additions (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: We project a
      marked increase in demand for LT for NASH given population obesity trends.
      Continued public health efforts to curb obesity prevalence are needed to reduce
      the projected future burden of NASH. This article is protected by copyright. All

TI  - Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibition reduces de novo lipogenesis in
      overweight male subjects: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study.
PG  - 324-334

AB  - NDI-010976, an allosteric inhibitor of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylases (ACC) ACC1 
      and ACC2, reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and favorably affects
      steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease.
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial
      evaluating the pharmacodynamic effects of a single oral dose of NDI-010976 on
      hepatic DNL in overweight and/or obese but otherwise healthy adult male subjects.
      Subjects were randomized to receive either NDI-010976 (20, 50, or 200 mg) or
      matching placebo in period 1, followed by the alternate treatment in period 2;
      and hepatic lipogenesis was stimulated with oral fructose administration.
      Fractional DNL was quantified by infusing a stable isotope tracer, [1-(13)
      C]acetate, and monitoring (13) C incorporation into palmitate of circulating very
      low-density lipoprotein triglyceride. Single-dose administration of NDI-010976
      was well tolerated at doses up to and including 200 mg. Fructose administration
      over a 10-hour period stimulated hepatic fractional DNL an average of 30.9 +/-
      6.7% (mean +/- standard deviation) above fasting DNL values in placebo-treated
      subjects. Subjects administered single doses of NDI-010976 at 20, 50, or 200 mg
      had significant inhibition of DNL compared to placebo (mean inhibition relative
      to placebo was 70%, 85%, and 104%, respectively). An inverse relationship between
      fractional DNL and NDI-010976 exposure was observed with >90% inhibition of
      fractional DNL associated with plasma concentrations of NDI-010976 >4 ng/mL.
      CONCLUSION: ACC inhibition with a single dose of NDI-010976 is well tolerated and
      results in a profound dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic DNL in overweight
      adult male subjects. Therefore, NDI-010976 could contribute considerable value to
      the treatment algorithm of metabolic disorders characterized by dysregulated
      fatty acid metabolism, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. (Hepatology

TI  - Alcohol abstinence ameliorates the dysregulated immune profiles in patients with 
      alcoholic hepatitis: A prospective observational study.
PG  - 575-590
LID - 10.1002/hep.29242 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) develops in only a small proportion of heavy drinkers.
      To better understand the mechanisms underlying this disparity, we conducted a
      study to define the relationship between AH development and dysregulated immune
      responses that might be ameliorated by alcohol abstinence. Sixty-eight AH
      patients, 65 heavy drinking controls without liver disease (HDC), and 20 healthy 
      controls were enrolled and followed up to 12 months. At baseline, HDC and healthy
      controls had no significant differences in their plasma levels of 38 inflammatory
      cytokines/chemokines measured using multiplex immunoassays. However, compared to 
      HDC, AH patients had higher baseline levels of 11 cytokines/chemokines (tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, interferon gamma-induced
      protein 10, IL-4, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor 2, IL-7, IL-15, and
      transforming growth factor alpha) but lower levels of the anti-inflammatory
      macrophage-derived chemokine. AH patients also had more activated yet
      dysfunctional immune cells as monocytes, T cells, and B cells expressed higher
      levels of cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and CD69 but low levels of human
      leukocyte antigen DR, CD80, and CD86 at baseline. In addition, CD4 T cells
      produced less interferon-gamma in response to T-cell stimulation. Up-regulated
      IL-6, IL-8, CD38, and CD69 and down-regulated macrophage-derived chemokine, human
      leukocyte antigen DR, CD86, and CD80 correlated positively and negatively,
      respectively, with disease severity. Longitudinal analysis indicated that levels 
      of IL-6, IL-8, CD38, and CD69 were reduced, whereas levels of macrophage-derived 
      chemokine, human leukocyte antigen DR, CD80, and CD86 were increased in abstinent
      AH patients. All of the cellular immune abnormalities were reversed by day 360 in
      abstinent AH patients; however, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha,
      IL-8, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor 2, and IL-7 remained higher. CONCLUSION: AH
      patients were in a highly immune-dysregulated state, whereas HDC showed little
      evidence of immune activation; alcohol abstinence reversed most, but not all, of 
      the immunological abnormalities. (Hepatology 2017;66:575-590).

TI  - A novel role of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) in regulating nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH).
PG  - 466-480
LID - 10.1002/hep.29230 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most prevalent cause of chronic liver 
      disease in the Western world. However, an optimum therapy for NASH is yet to be
      established, mandating more in-depth investigation into the molecular
      pathogenesis of NASH to identify novel regulatory molecules and develop targeted 
      therapies. Here, we unravel a unique function of astrocyte elevated
      gene-1(AEG-1)/metadherin in NASH using a transgenic mouse with
      hepatocyte-specific overexpression of AEG-1 (Alb/AEG-1) and a conditional
      hepatocyte-specific AEG-1 knockout mouse (AEG-1(DeltaHEP) ). Alb/AEG-1 mice
      developed spontaneous NASH whereas AEG-1(DeltaHEP) mice were protected from
      high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH. Intriguingly, AEG-1 overexpression was observed
      in livers of NASH patients and wild-type (WT) mice that developed steatosis upon 
      feeding HFD. In-depth molecular analysis unraveled that inhibition of peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha activity resulting in decreased fatty acid 
      beta-oxidation, augmentation of translation of fatty acid synthase resulting in
      de novo lipogenesis, and increased nuclear factor kappa B-mediated inflammation
      act in concert to mediate AEG-1-induced NASH. Therapeutically,
      hepatocyte-specific nanoparticle-delivered AEG-1 small interfering RNA provided
      marked protection from HFD-induced NASH in WT mice. CONCLUSION: AEG-1 might be a 
      key molecule regulating initiation and progression of NASH. AEG-1 inhibitory
      strategies might be developed as a potential therapeutic intervention in NASH
      patients. (Hepatology 2017;66:466-480).

TI  - Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatic vein
      invasion: A Japanese nationwide survey.
PG  - 510-517
LID - 10.1002/hep.29225 [doi]
AB  - Because of the rarity of hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT) compared with portal 
      vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, little is
      known about this disease entity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      prognosis of each treatment modality for HVTT through an analysis of data
      collected in a Japanese nationwide survey. We analyzed data for 1,021 Child-Pugh 
      A hepatocellular carcinoma patients with HVTT without inferior vena cava invasion
      registered between 2000 and 2007. Of these patients, 540 who underwent liver
      resection (LR) and 481 who received other treatments were compared. Propensity
      scores were calculated, and we successfully matched 223 patients (49.0% of the LR
      group). The median survival time in the LR group was 2.89 years longer than that 
      in the non-LR group (4.47 versus 1.58 years, P < 0.001) and 1.61 years longer
      than that in the non-LR group (3.42 versus 1.81 years, P = 0.023) in a propensity
      score-matched cohort. After curative resection, median survival times were
      similar between patients with HVTT in the peripheral hepatic vein and those with 
      HVTT in the major hepatic vein (4.85 versus 4.67 years, P = 0.974). In the LR
      group, the postoperative 90-day mortality rate was 3.4% (16 patients). In
      patients without PVTT, the median survival time was significantly better than
      that in patients with PVTT (5.67 versus 1.88 years, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: LR is
      associated with a good prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with HVTT, 
      especially in patients without PVTT. (Hepatology 2017;66:510-517).

TI  - Adult-onset cystic fibrosis liver disease: Diagnosis and characterization of an
      underappreciated entity.
PG  - 591-601
LID - 10.1002/hep.29217 [doi]
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) liver disease (CFLD), a leading cause of death in CF, is
      mostly described in pediatric populations. Adult-onset CFLD lacks sufficient
      characterization and diagnostic tools. A cohort of CF patients without CFLD
      during childhood were followed for up to 38 years with serologic testing,
      imaging, and noninvasive fibrosis markers. Historical CFLD diagnostic criteria
      were compared with newly proposed CFLD criteria. Thirty-six CF patients were
      followed for a median of 24.5 years (interquartile range 15.6-32.9). By the last 
      follow-up, 11 (31%) had died. With conventional criteria, 8 (22%) patients had
      CFLD; and by the new criteria, 17 (47%) had CFLD at a median age of 36.6 years
      (interquartile range 26.5-43.2). By the new criteria, those with CFLD had higher 
      median alanine aminotransferase (42 versus 27, P = 0.005), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST; 26 versus 21, P = 0.01), direct bilirubin (0.13 versus
      0.1, P = 0.01), prothrombin time (14.4 versus 12.4, P = 0.002), and
      AST-to-platelet ratio index (0.31 versus 0.23, P = 0.003) over the last 2 years
      of follow-up. Subjects with a FibroScan >6.8 kPa had higher alanine
      aminotransferase (42 versus 28U/L, P = 0.02), AST (35 versus 25U/L, P = 0.02),
      AST-to-platelet ratio index (0.77 versus 0.25, P = 0.0004), and Fibrosis-4 index 
      (2.14 versus 0.74, P = 0.0003) and lower platelet counts (205 versus 293, P =
      0.02). One CFLD patient had nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Longitudinally,
      mean platelet counts significantly declined in the CFLD group (from 310 to 230
      U/L, P = 0.0005). Deceased CFLD patients had lower platelet counts than those
      alive with CFLD (143 versus 258 U/L, P = 0.004) or those deceased with no CFLD
      (143 versus 327U/L, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Adult-onset CFLD may be more
      prevalent than previously described, which suggests a later wave of CFLD that
      impacts morbidity; routine liver tests, radiologic imaging, noninvasive fibrosis 
      markers, and FibroScan can be used algorithmically to identify adult CFLD; and
      further evaluation in other CF cohorts should be performed for validation.

TI  - Development of a novel frailty index to predict mortality in patients with
      end-stage liver disease.
PG  - 564-574
LID - 10.1002/hep.29219 [doi]
AB  - Cirrhosis is characterized by muscle wasting, malnutrition, and functional
      decline that confer excess mortality not well quantified by the Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Sodium (MELDNa) score. We aimed to develop a
      frailty index to capture these extrahepatic complications of cirrhosis and
      enhance mortality prediction in patients with cirrhosis. Consecutive outpatients 
      listed for liver transplantation at a single transplant center without MELD
      exceptions were assessed with candidate frailty measures. Best subset selection
      analyses with Cox regression identified subsets of frailty measures that
      predicted waitlist mortality (=death or delisting because of sickness). We
      selected the frailty index by balancing statistical accuracy with clinical
      utility. The net reclassification index (NRI) evaluated the %patients correctly
      reclassified by adding the frailty index to MELDNa. Included were 536 patients
      with cirrhosis with median MELDNa of 18. One hundred seven (20%) died/were
      delisted. The final frailty index consisted of: grip strength, chair stands, and 
      balance. The ability of MELDNa and the frailty index to correctly rank patients
      according to their 3-month waitlist mortality risk (i.e., concordance-statistic) 
      was 0.80 and 0.76, respectively, but 0.82 for MELDNa+frailty index together.
      Compared with MELDNa alone, MELDNa+frailty index correctly reclassified 16% of
      deaths/delistings (P = 0.005) and 3% of nondeaths/delistings (P = 0.17) with a
      total NRI of 19% (P < 0.001). Compared to those with robust frailty index scores 
      (<20th percentile), cirrhotics with poor frailty index scores (>80th percentile) 
      were more impaired by gait speed, difficulty with Instrumental Activities of
      Daily Living, exhaustion, and low physical activity (P < 0.001 for each).
      CONCLUSION: Our frailty index for patients with cirrhosis, comprised of three
      performance-based metrics, has construct validity for the concept of frailty and 
      improves risk prediction of waitlist mortality over MELDNa alone. (Hepatology

TI  - A novel role for CRTC2 in hepatic cholesterol synthesis through SREBP-2.
PG  - 481-497
LID - 10.1002/hep.29206 [doi]
AB  - Cholesterol synthesis is regulated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory 
      element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and its target gene
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), which is the
      rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate-responsive element (CRE) binding protein-regulated transcription
      coactivator (CRTC) 2 is the master regulator of glucose metabolism. However, the 
      effect of CRTC2 on cholesterol and its potential molecular mechanism remain
      unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CRTC2 expression and liver cholesterol
      content were increased in patients with high serum cholesterol levels who
      underwent resection of liver hemangiomas, as well as in mice fed a 4% cholesterol
      diet. Mice with adenovirus-mediated CRTC2 overexpression also showed elevated
      lipid levels in both serum and liver tissues. Intriguingly, hepatic de novo
      cholesterol synthesis was markedly increased under these conditions. In contrast,
      CRTC2 ablation in mice fed a 4% cholesterol diet (18 weeks) showed decreased
      lipid levels in serum and liver tissues compared with those in littermate
      wild-type mice. The expression of lipogenic genes (SREBP-2 and HMGCR) was
      consistent with hepatic CRTC2 levels. In vivo imaging showed enhanced
      adenovirus-mediated HMGCR-luciferase activity in adenovirus-mediated CRTC2 mouse 
      livers; however, the activity was attenuated after mutation of CRE or sterol
      regulatory element sequences in the HMGCR reporter construct. The effect of CRTC2
      on HMGCR in mouse livers was alleviated upon SREBP-2 knockdown. CRTC2 modulated
      SREBP-2 transcription by CRE binding protein, which recognizes the half-site CRE 
      sequence in the SREBP-2 promoter. CRTC2 reduced the nuclear protein expression of
      forkhead box O1 and subsequently increased SREBP-2 transcription by binding
      insulin response element 1, rather than insulin response element 2, in the
      SREBP-2 promoter. CONCLUSION: CRTC2 regulates the transcription of SREBP-2 by
      interfering with the recognition of insulin response element 1 in the SREBP-2
      promoter by forkhead box O1, thus inducing SREBP-2/HMGCR signaling and
      subsequently facilitating hepatic cholesterol synthesis. (Hepatology

TI  - The natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis in 781 children: A
      multicenter, international collaboration.
PG  - 518-527
LID - 10.1002/hep.29204 [doi]
AB  - There are limited data on the natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (PSC) in children. We aimed to describe the disease characteristics and long-term
      outcomes of pediatric PSC. We retrospectively collected all pediatric PSC cases
      from 36 participating institutions and conducted a survival analysis from the
      date of PSC diagnosis to dates of diagnosis of portal hypertensive or biliary
      complications, cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation, or death. We analyzed
      patients grouped by disease phenotype and laboratory studies at diagnosis to
      identify objective predictors of long-term outcome. We identified 781 patients,
      median age 12 years, with 4,277 person-years of follow-up; 33% with autoimmune
      hepatitis, 76% with inflammatory bowel disease, and 13% with small duct PSC.
      Portal hypertensive and biliary complications developed in 38% and 25%,
      respectively, after 10 years of disease. Once these complications developed,
      median survival with native liver was 2.8 and 3.5 years, respectively.
      Cholangiocarcinoma occurred in 1%. Overall event-free survival was 70% at 5 years
      and 53% at 10 years. Patient groups with the most elevated total bilirubin,
      gamma-glutamyltransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index
      at diagnosis had the worst outcomes. In multivariate analysis PSC-inflammatory
      bowel disease and small duct phenotypes were associated with favorable prognosis 
      (hazard ratios 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.9, and 0.7, 95% confidence
      interval 0.5-0.96, respectively). Age, gender, and autoimmune hepatitis overlap
      did not impact long-term outcome. CONCLUSION: PSC has a chronic, progressive
      course in children, and nearly half of patients develop an adverse liver outcome 
      after 10 years of disease; elevations in bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase,
      and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index at diagnosis can identify 
      patients at highest risk; small duct PSC and PSC-inflammatory bowel disease are
      more favorable disease phenotypes. (Hepatology 2017;66:518-527).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29202 [doi]
AB  - Up-regulated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is observed in
      multiple cancers with unclear mechanism. Using GAPDH transgenic mouse and a mouse
      model of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), here we show 
      that GAPDH overexpression aggravated tumor development by activating cell
      proliferation and inflammation. In cultured hepatic cells, overexpression of
      GAPDH or a catalytic domain-deleted GAPDH (GAPDH(DeltaCD) ) affected metabolism, 
      up-regulated phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), increased histone
      methylation levels, and promoted proliferation. Consistently, inhibition of GAPDH
      by short hairpin RNA reprogrammed metabolism down-regulated PHGDH and histone
      methylation, and inhibited proliferation. The xenograft study suggested that
      HepG2 cells overexpressing GAPDH or GAPDH(DeltaCD) similarly promoted tumor
      development, whereas knockdown PHGDH in GAPDH overexpressing cells significantly 
      inhibited tumor development. In liver sections of HCC patients, increased GAPDH
      staining was found to be positively correlated with PHGDH and histone methylation
      staining. CONCLUSION: GAPDH increases histone methylation levels by up-regulating
      PHGDH, promoting diversion from glycolysis to serine biosynthesis, and
      consequently accelerating HCC development. (Hepatology 2017;66:631-645).

TI  - Hepatic FXR/SHP axis modulates systemic glucose and fatty acid homeostasis in
      aged mice.
PG  - 498-509
LID - 10.1002/hep.29199 [doi]
AB  - The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and small heterodimer
      partner (SHP; NR0B2) play crucial roles in bile acid homeostasis. Global double
      knockout of FXR and SHP signaling (DKO) causes severe cholestasis and liver
      injury at early ages. Here, we report an unexpected beneficial impact on glucose 
      and fatty acid metabolism in aged DKO mice, which show suppressed body weight
      gain and adiposity when maintained on normal chow. This phenotype was not
      observed in single Fxr or Shp knockouts. Liver-specific Fxr/Shp double knockout
      mice fully phenocopied the DKO mice, with lower hepatic triglyceride
      accumulation, improved glucose/insulin tolerance, and accelerated fatty acid use.
      In both DKO and liver-specific Fxr/Shp double knockout livers, these metabolic
      phenotypes were associated with altered expression of fatty acid metabolism and
      autophagy-machinery genes. Loss of the hepatic FXR/SHP axis reprogrammed white
      and brown adipose tissue gene expression to boost fatty acid usage. CONCLUSION:
      Combined deletion of the hepatic FXR/SHP axis improves glucose/fatty acid
      homeostasis in aged mice, reversing the aging phenotype of body weight gain,
      increased adiposity, and glucose/insulin tolerance, suggesting a central role of 
      this axis in whole-body energy homeostasis. (Hepatology 2017;66:498-509).

TI  - Drug rechallenge following drug-induced liver injury.
PG  - 646-654
LID - 10.1002/hep.29152 [doi]
AB  - Drug-induced hepatocellular injury is identified internationally by alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels equal to or exceeding 5x the upper limit of normal 
      (ULN) appearing within 3 months of drug initiation, after alternative causes are 
      excluded. Upon withdrawing the suspect drug, ALT generally decrease by 50% or
      more. With drug readministration, a positive rechallenge has recently been
      defined by an ALT level of 3-5x ULN or greater. Nearly 50 drugs are associated
      with positive rechallenge after drug-induced liver injury (DILI): antimicrobials;
      and central nervous system, cardiovascular and oncology therapeutics. Drugs
      associated with high rates of positive rechallenge exhibit multiple risk factors:
      daily dose >50 mg, an increased incidence of ALT elevations in clinical trials,
      immunoallergic clinical injury, and mitochondrial impairment in vitro. These drug
      factors interact with personal genetic, immune, and metabolic factors to
      influence positive rechallenge rates and outcomes. Drug rechallenge following
      drug-induced liver injury is associated with up to 13% mortality in prospective
      series of all prescribed drugs. In recent oncology trials, standardized systems
      have enabled safer drug rechallenge with weekly liver chemistry monitoring during
      the high-risk period and exclusion of patients with hypersensitivity. However,
      high positive rechallenge rates with other innovative therapeutics suggest that
      caution should be taken with rechallenge of high-risk drugs. CONCLUSION: For
      critical medicines, drug rechallenge may be appropriate when 1) no safer
      alternatives are available, 2) the objective benefit exceeds the risk, and 3)
      patients are fully informed and consent, can adhere to follow-up, and alert
      providers to hepatitis symptoms. To better understand rechallenge outcomes and
      identify key risk factors for positive rechallenge, additional data are needed
      from controlled clinical trials, prospective registries, and large health care
      databases. (Hepatology 2017;66:646-654).

TI  - MicroRNA 181b-3p and its target importin alpha5 regulate toll-like receptor 4
      signaling in Kupffer cells and liver injury in mice in response to ethanol.
PG  - 602-615
LID - 10.1002/hep.29144 [doi]
AB  - Increased inflammatory signaling by Kupffer cells contributes to alcoholic liver 
      disease (ALD). Here we investigated the impact of small, specific-sized
      hyaluronic acid of 35 kD (HA35) on ethanol-induced sensitization of Kupffer
      cells, as well as ethanol-induced liver injury in mice. Unbiased analysis of
      microRNA (miRNA) expression in Kupffer cells identified miRNAs regulated by both 
      ethanol and HA35. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signaling was assessed in 
      primary cultures of Kupffer cells from ethanol- and pair-fed rats after treatment
      with HA35. Female C57BL6/J mice were fed ethanol or pair-fed control diets and
      treated or not with HA35. TLR4 signaling was increased in Kupffer cells by
      ethanol; this sensitization was normalized by ex vivo treatment with HA35. Next
      generation sequencing of Kupffer cell miRNA identified miRNA 181b-3p (miR181b-3p)
      as sensitive to both ethanol and HA35. Importin alpha5, a protein involved in p65
      translocation to the nucleus, was identified as a target of miR181b-3p; importin 
      alpha5 protein was increased in Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats, but
      decreased by HA35 treatment. Overexpression of miR181b-3p decreased importin
      alpha5 expression and normalized lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis
      factor alpha expression in Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats. In a mouse model 
      of ALD, ethanol feeding decreased miR181b-3p in liver and increased expression of
      importin alpha5 in nonparenchymal cells. Treatment with HA35 normalized these
      changes and also protected mice from ethanol-induced liver and intestinal injury.
      CONCLUSION: miR181b-3p is dynamically regulated in Kupffer cells and mouse liver 
      in response to ethanol and treatment with HA35. miR181b-3p modulates expression
      of importin alpha5 and sensitivity of TLR4-mediated signaling. This study
      identifies a miR181b-3p-importin alpha5 axis in regulating inflammatory signaling
      pathways in hepatic macrophages. (Hepatology 2017;66:602-615).

TI  - Substance P increases liver fibrosis by differential changes in senescence of
      cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cells.
PG  - 528-541
LID - 10.1002/hep.29138 [doi]
AB  - Substance P (SP) is involved in the proliferation of cholangiocytes in bile
      duct-ligated (BDL) mice and human cholangiocarcinoma growth by interacting with
      the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R). To identify whether SP regulates liver
      fibrosis during cholestasis, wild-type or NK-1R knockout (NK-1R(-/-) ) mice that 
      received BDL or sham surgery and multidrug resistance protein 2 knockout
      (Mdr2(-/-) ) mice treated with either an NK-1R antagonist (L-733,060) or saline
      were used. Additionally, wild-type mice were treated with SP or saline
      intraperitoneally. In vivo, there was increased expression of tachykinin
      precursor 1 (coding SP) and NK-1R in both BDL and Mdr2(-/-) mice compared to
      wild-type mice. Expression of tachykinin precursor 1 and NK-1R was significantly 
      higher in liver samples from primary sclerosing cholangitis patients compared to 
      healthy controls. Knockout of NK-1R decreased BDL-induced liver fibrosis, and
      treatment with L-733,060 resulted in decreased liver fibrosis in Mdr2(-/-) mice, 
      which was shown by decreased sirius red staining, fibrosis gene and protein
      expression, and reduced transforming growth factor-beta1 levels in serum and
      cholangiocyte supernatants. Furthermore, we observed that reduced liver fibrosis 
      in NK-1R(-/-) mice with BDL surgery or Mdr2(-/-) mice treated with L-733,060 was 
      associated with enhanced cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells and
      decreased senescence of cholangiocytes. In vitro, L-733,060 inhibited SP-induced 
      expression of fibrotic genes in hepatic stellate cells and cholangiocytes;
      treatment with L-733,060 partially reversed the SP-induced decrease of senescence
      gene expression in cultured hepatic stellate cells and the SP-induced increase of
      senescence-related gene expression in cultured cholangiocytes. CONCLUSION:
      Collectively, our results demonstrate the regulatory effects of the SP/NK-1R axis
      on liver fibrosis through changes in cellular senescence during cholestatic liver
      injury. (Hepatology 2017;66:528-541).

TI  - PRMT5 restricts hepatitis B virus replication through epigenetic repression of
      covalently closed circular DNA transcription and interference with pregenomic RNA
      encapsidation.
PG  - 398-415
LID - 10.1002/hep.29133 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem
      worldwide. The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) minichromosome, which
      serves as the template for the transcription of viral RNAs, plays a key role in
      viral persistence. While accumulating evidence suggests that cccDNA transcription
      is regulated by epigenetic machinery, particularly the acetylation of
      cccDNA-bound histone 3 (H3) and H4, the potential contributions of histone
      methylation and related host factors remain obscure. Here, by screening a series 
      of methyltransferases and demethylases, we identified protein arginine
      methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as an effective restrictor of HBV transcription and
      replication. In cell culture-based models for HBV infection and in liver tissues 
      of patients with chronic HBV infection, we found that symmetric dimethylation of 
      arginine 3 on H4 on cccDNA was a repressive marker of cccDNA transcription and
      was regulated by PRMT5 depending on its methyltransferase domain. Moreover,
      PRMT5-triggered symmetric dimethylation of arginine 3 on H4 on the cccDNA
      minichromosome involved an interaction with the HBV core protein and the
      Brg1-based human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, which resulted in down-regulation
      of the binding of RNA polymerase II to cccDNA. In addition to the inhibitory
      effect on cccDNA transcription, PRMT5 inhibited HBV core particle DNA production 
      independently of its methyltransferase activity. Further study revealed that
      PRMT5 interfered with pregenomic RNA encapsidation by preventing its interaction 
      with viral polymerase protein through binding to the reverse
      transcriptase-ribonuclease H region of polymerase, which is crucial for the
      polymerase-pregenomic RNA interaction. CONCLUSION: PRMT5 restricts HBV
      replication through a two-part mechanism including epigenetic suppression of
      cccDNA transcription and interference with pregenomic RNA encapsidation; these
      findings improve the understanding of epigenetic regulation of HBV transcription 
      and host-HBV interaction, thus providing new insights into targeted therapeutic
      intervention. (Hepatology 2017;66:398-415).

TI  - Characterization of ferroptosis in murine models of hemochromatosis.
PG  - 449-465
LID - 10.1002/hep.29117 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is a recently identified iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell
      death implicated in brain, kidney, and heart pathology. However, the biological
      roles of iron and iron metabolism in ferroptosis remain poorly understood. Here, 
      we studied the functional role of iron and iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of
      ferroptosis. We found that ferric citrate potently induces ferroptosis in murine 
      primary hepatocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Next, we screened for
      ferroptosis in mice fed a high-iron diet and in mouse models of hereditary
      hemochromatosis with iron overload. We found that ferroptosis occurred in mice
      fed a high-iron diet and in two knockout mouse lines that develop severe iron
      overload (Hjv(-/-) and Smad4(Alb/Alb) mice) but not in a third line that develops
      only mild iron overload (Hfe(-/-) mice). Moreover, we found that iron
      overload-induced liver damage was rescued by the ferroptosis inhibitor
      ferrostatin-1. To identify the genes involved in iron-induced ferroptosis, we
      performed microarray analyses of iron-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages.
      Interestingly, solute carrier family 7, member 11 (Slc7a11), a known
      ferroptosis-related gene, was significantly up-regulated in iron-treated cells
      compared with untreated cells. However, genetically deleting Slc7a11 expression
      was not sufficient to induce ferroptosis in mice. Next, we studied iron-treated
      hepatocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from Slc7a11(-/-) mice
      fed a high-iron diet. CONCLUSION: We found that iron treatment induced
      ferroptosis in Slc7a11(-/-) cells, indicating that deleting Slc7a11 facilitates
      the onset of ferroptosis specifically under high-iron conditions; these results
      provide compelling evidence that iron plays a key role in triggering
      Slc7a11-mediated ferroptosis and suggest that ferroptosis may be a promising
      target for treating hemochromatosis-related tissue damage. (Hepatology

TI  - The human longevity gene homolog INDY and interleukin-6 interact in hepatic lipid
      metabolism.
PG  - 616-630
LID - 10.1002/hep.29089 [doi]
AB  - Reduced expression of the Indy ("I am Not Dead, Yet") gene in lower organisms
      promotes longevity in a manner akin to caloric restriction. Deletion of the
      mammalian homolog of Indy (mIndy, Slc13a5) encoding for a plasma
      membrane-associated citrate transporter expressed highly in the liver, protects
      mice from high-fat diet-induced and aging-induced obesity and hepatic fat
      accumulation through a mechanism resembling caloric restriction. We studied a
      possible role of mIndy in human hepatic fat metabolism. In obese,
      insulin-resistant patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic mIndy
      expression was increased and mIndy expression was also independently associated
      with hepatic steatosis. In nonhuman primates, a 2-year high-fat, high-sucrose
      diet increased hepatic mIndy expression. Liver microarray analysis showed that
      high mIndy expression was associated with pathways involved in hepatic lipid
      metabolism and immunological processes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was identified as a 
      regulator of mIndy by binding to its cognate receptor. Studies in human primary
      hepatocytes confirmed that IL-6 markedly induced mIndy transcription through the 
      IL-6 receptor and activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and
      activator of transcription 3, and a putative start site of the human mIndy
      promoter was determined. Activation of the IL-6-signal transducer and activator
      of transcription 3 pathway stimulated mIndy expression, enhanced cytoplasmic
      citrate influx, and augmented hepatic lipogenesis in vivo. In contrast, deletion 
      of mIndy completely prevented the stimulating effect of IL-6 on citrate uptake
      and reduced hepatic lipogenesis. These data show that mIndy is increased in liver
      of obese humans and nonhuman primates with NALFD. Moreover, our data identify
      mIndy as a target gene of IL-6 and determine novel functions of IL-6 through
      mINDY. CONCLUSION: Targeting human mINDY may have therapeutic potential in obese 
      patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. German Clinical Trials Register: 
      DRKS00005450. (Hepatology 2017;66:616-630).

TI  - Role of surface antibody in hepatitis B reactivation in patients with resolved
      infection and hematologic malignancy: A meta-analysis.
PG  - 379-388
LID - 10.1002/hep.29082 [doi]
AB  - Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who are treated for
      hematological malignancies remain at risk for HBV reactivation. Because of
      conflicting studies about whether the antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
      (anti-HBs) protects against reactivation in patients with resolved infection
      (hepatitis B surface antigen negative) receiving chemotherapy for hematological
      malignancies, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine if anti-HBs reduces HBV
      reactivation risk. We sought English-language studies through March 1, 2016, in
      Medline and other sources that examined reactivation in patients with resolved
      HBV infection receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. The absolute
      risks and odds ratio (OR) of reactivation with versus without anti-HBs were
      estimated in random-effects model meta-analyses. In 20 studies involving 1,672
      patients not receiving antiviral prophylaxis, the reactivation risk was 14% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 9.4%-19%) in 388 patients who had antibodies to
      hepatitis B core antigen only versus 5.0% (95% CI 3.0%-7.0%) in 1,284 patients
      who also had anti-HBs. Anti-HBs reduced reactivation risk with a pooled OR of
      0.21 (95% CI 0.14-0.32) versus patients with antibody to hepatitis B core antigen
      only. Similar results were found when limiting the analysis to rituximab
      chemotherapy (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.32) and lymphoma (OR = 0.18, 95% CI
      0.11-0.28). CONCLUSION: In patients with resolved HBV receiving chemotherapy for 
      hematological malignancies without antiviral prophylaxis, anti-HBs positivity is 
      associated with a decreased risk of reactivation; HBV screening in this patient
      population should include the routine use of anti-HBs, and those who are
      anti-HBs-negative should receive antiviral prophylaxis. Future studies should
      examine the effect of anti-HBs serum titers, the potential role for booster
      vaccinations, and antiviral prophylaxis prior to chemotherapy in this patient
      population. (Hepatology 2017;66:379-388).

      infection and prior direct-acting antiviral treatment.

AB  - Although direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection have demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response,
      virologic failure may still occur, potentially leading to the emergence of viral 
      resistance, which can decrease the effectiveness of subsequent treatment.
      Treatment options for patients who failed previous DAA-containing regimens,
      particularly those with nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors, are limited and
      remain an area of unmet medical need. This phase 2, open-label study (MAGELLAN-1)
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir (GLE) + pibrentasvir (PIB) +/-
      ribavirin (RBV) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients with prior virologic failure 
      to HCV DAA-containing therapy. A total of 50 patients without cirrhosis were
      randomized to three arms: 200 mg GLE + 80 mg PIB (arm A), 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB
      with 800 mg once-daily RBV (arm B), or 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB without RBV (arm
      C). By intent-to-treat analysis, sustained virologic response at posttreatment
      week 12 was achieved in 100% (6/6, 95% confidence interval 61-100), 95% (21/22,
      95% confidence interval 78-99), and 86% (19/22, 95% confidence interval 67-95) of
      patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Virologic failure occurred in no
      patients in arm A and in 1 patient each in arms B and C (two patients were lost
      to follow-up in arm C). The majority of adverse events were mild in severity; no 
      serious adverse events related to study drug and no relevant laboratory
      abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, or hemoglobin were
      observed. CONCLUSION: The combination of GLE and PIB was highly efficacious and
      well tolerated in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and prior failure of
      DAA-containing therapy; RBV coadministration did not improve efficacy.

TI  - A prospective study of the utility of plasma biomarkers to diagnose alcoholic
      hepatitis.
PG  - 555-563
LID - 10.1002/hep.29080 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) often requires a transjugular liver
      biopsy (TJLB), a procedure that is not always readily accessible. We analyzed
      plasma biomarkers to estimate the presence of histological features of AH among
      patients with clinical suspicion of AH. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
      we tested M65 and M30 (circulating fragments of cytokeratin-18) and their
      respective fraction carried by microvesicles (MVs), CCL20 and TREM1. Leukocyte,
      platelet, and endothelial-derived MVs were quantified by way of flow cytometry.
      Test and validation cohorts prospectively included patients with clinical
      features of AH undergoing TJLB. In the test cohort, 46 of 83 (55%) patients
      showed histological features of AH. Age, bilirubin, INR, and creatinine (ABIC)
      score was B or C in 83%. Patients with histologically proven AH had higher levels
      of total and MV-bound M65 and total and MV-bound M30 and CCL20 than those without
      (P < 0.001 for all tests). Levels of TREM-1 and of subpopulations of MVs were not
      different between groups. M65 and M30 both had an area under the receiver
      operating characteristics curve of 0.84 to estimate the presence of AH. For M65, 
      a cutoff of 2000 IU/L had a positive predictive value of 91%, whereas a cutoff of
      641 IU/L had a negative predictive value of 88%. In the validation cohort, AH was
      histologically confirmed in 48 of 68 (71%) patients. ABIC score was B or C in 69%
      of patients. For M65, the above cutoffs had a diagnostic accuracy of 81%. Even
      better results were obtained in patients with suspicion of severe AH (ABIC B or
      C) in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: Plasma levels of cytokeratin-18 fragments are
      reliable noninvasive markers of AH. Using the proposed cutoffs for M65, two
      thirds of TJLB can be avoided, which can be useful in centers where this
      technique is not readily available. (Hepatology 2017;66:555-563).

PG  - 344-356
LID - 10.1002/hep.29071 [doi]
AB  - We assessed non-liver-related non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
      (AIDS)-related (NLR-NAR) events and mortality in a cohort of human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients treated 
      with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), between 2000 and 2008. The censoring
      date was May 31, 2014. Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the
      adjusted hazard rate (HR) of overall death in responders and nonresponders. Fine 
      and Gray regression analysis was conducted to determine the adjusted subhazard
      rate (sHR) of NLR deaths and NLR-NAR events considering death as the competing
      risk. The NLR-NAR events analyzed included diabetes mellitus, chronic renal
      failure, cardiovascular events, NLR-NAR cancer, bone events, and non-AIDS-related
      infections. The variables for adjustment were age, sex, past AIDS, HIV
      transmission category, nadir CD4(+) T-cell count, antiretroviral therapy, HIV
      RNA, liver fibrosis, HCV genotype, and exposure to specific anti-HIV drugs. Of
      the 1,625 patients included, 592 (36%) had a sustained viral response (SVR).
      After a median 5-year follow-up, SVR was found to be associated with a
      significant decrease in the hazard of diabetes mellitus (sHR, 0.57; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.93; P = 0.024) and decline in the hazard of
      chronic renal failure close to the threshold of significance (sHR, 0.43; 95% CI, 
      0.17-1.09; P = 0.075). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that eradication of HCV in
      coinfected patients is associated not only with a reduction in the frequency of
      death, HIV progression, and liver-related events, but also with a reduced hazard 
      of diabetes mellitus and possibly of chronic renal failure. These findings argue 
      for the prescription of HCV therapy in coinfected patients regardless of fibrosis
      stage. (Hepatology 2017;66:344-356).

AB  - Lipids are essential cellular components and energy sources of living organisms, 
      and altered lipid composition is increasingly recognized as a signature of
      cancer. We performed lipidomic analysis in a series of hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) cells and identified over 1,700 intact lipids originating from three major 
      lipid categories. Comparative lipidomic screening revealed that 93 significantly 
      changed lipids and decreased palmitic acyl (C16:0)-containing
      glycerophospholipids were positively associated with metastatic abilities of HCC 
      cells. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that C16:0
      incubation specifically reduced malignant cell proliferation, impaired cell
      invasiveness, and suppressed tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Biochemical 
      experiments demonstrated that C16:0 treatment decreased cell membrane fluidity
      and limited glucose metabolism. A phosphoproteomics approach further revealed
      such C16:0 incubation attenuated phosphorylation levels of mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
      pathway proteins. Multiple reaction monitoring analysis of 443 lipid molecules
      showed 8 reduced C16:0-containing lipids out of total 10 altered lipids when
      cancer tissues were compared with adjacent nontumor tissues in a cohort of
      clinical HCC specimens (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data collectively
      demonstrate the biomedical potential of using altered lipid metabolism as a
      diagnostic marker for cancerous cells and open an opportunity for treating
      aggressive HCCs by targeting altered C16:0 metabolism. (Hepatology

TI  - Protective role of endogenous plasmalogens against hepatic steatosis and
      steatohepatitis in mice.
PG  - 416-431
LID - 10.1002/hep.29039 [doi]
AB  - Free cholesterol (FC) accumulation in the liver is an important pathogenic
      mechanism of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Plasmalogens, key structural
      components of the cell membrane, act as endogenous antioxidants and are primarily
      synthesized in the liver. However, the role of hepatic plasmalogens in metabolic 
      liver disease is unclear. In this study, we found that hepatic levels of
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing plasmalogens, expression of
      glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (Gnpat; the rate-limiting enzyme in
      plasmalogen biosynthesis), and expression of Pparalpha were lower in mice with
      NASH caused by accumulation of FC in the liver. Cyclodextrin-induced depletion of
      FC transactivated Delta-6 desaturase by increasing sterol regulatory
      element-binding protein 2 expression in cultured hepatocytes. DHA, the major
      product of Delta-6 desaturase activation, activated GNPAT, thereby explaining the
      association between high hepatic FC and decreased Gnpat expression. Gnpat small
      interfering RNA treatment significantly decreased peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparalpha) expression in cultured
      hepatocytes. In addition to GNPAT, DHA activated PPARalpha and increased
      expression of Pparalpha and its target genes, suggesting that DHA in the
      DHA-containing plasmalogens contributed to activation of PPARalpha. Accordingly, 
      administration of the plasmalogen precursor, alkyl glycerol (AG), prevented
      hepatic steatosis and NASH through a PPARalpha-dependent increase in fatty acid
      oxidation. Gnpat(+/-) mice were more susceptible to hepatic lipid accumulation
      and less responsive to the preventive effect of fluvastatin on NASH development, 
      suggesting that endogenous plasmalogens prevent hepatic steatosis and NASH.
      CONCLUSION: Increased hepatic FC in animals with NASH decreased plasmalogens,
      thereby sensitizing animals to hepatocyte injury and NASH. Our findings uncover a
      novel link between hepatic FC and plasmalogen homeostasis through GNPAT
      regulation. Further study of AG or other agents that increase hepatic plasmalogen
      levels may identify novel therapeutic strategies against NASH. (Hepatology

PG  - 542-554
LID - 10.1002/hep.29029 [doi]
AB  - The etiopathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Genetic
      variants of fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) have been identified in genome-wide
      association studies as risk factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis. We
      investigated the role of Fut2 in murine liver pathophysiology by studying
      Fut2(-/-) mice. Fut2(-/-) mice were viable and fertile, had lower body weight
      than wild-type (wt) littermates and gray fur. Half of the Fut2(-/-) mice showed
      serum bile salt levels 40 times higher than wt (Fut2(-/-)(high) ), whereas the
      remainder were normocholanemic (Fut2(-/-)(low) ). Fut2(-/-) mice showed normal
      serum liver tests, bile flow, biliary bile salt secretion, fecal bile salt loss, 
      and expression of major hepatocellular bile salt transporters and cytochrome P450
      7a1, the key regulator of bile salt synthesis, indicating that elevated serum
      bile salts in Fut2(-/-)(high) mice were not explained by cholestasis.
      Fut2(-/-)(high) mice, but not Fut2(-/-)(low) mice, were sensitive to hydrophobic 
      bile salt feeding (0.3% glycochenodeoxycholate); they rapidly lost weight and
      showed elevation of serum liver tests (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) and areas of liver parenchymal
      necrosis. Histomorphological evaluation revealed the presence of paraportal
      shunting vessels, increased numbers of portal vascular structures, wall
      thickening of some portal arteries, and periductal fibrosis in Fut2(-/-)(high)
      mice more than Fut2(-/-)(low) mice and not wt mice. Unconjugated bilirubin and
      ammonia were or tended to be elevated in Fut2(-/-)(high) mice only. Portosystemic
      shunting was demonstrated by portal angiography, which disclosed virtually
      complete portosystemic shunting in Fut2(-/-)(high) mice, discrete portosystemic
      shunting in Fut2(-/-)(low) mice, and no shunting in wt littermates. CONCLUSION:
      Liver pathology in Fut2(-/-) mice is dominated by consequences of portosystemic
      shunting resulting in microcirculatory disturbances, mild (secondary) periductal 
      fibrosis, and sensitivity toward human bile salt toxicity. (Hepatology

AB  - The long-term clinical impact of low-level viremia (LLV; <2,000 IU/mL) is not
      well understood. As a result, it is unclear whether the development of LLV during
      entecavir monotherapy requires a change in therapy. A retrospective cohort of 875
      treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) monoinfected patients (mean age
      47.7 years, male = 564 [65.5%], cirrhosis = 443 [50.6%]) who received entecavir
      monotherapy were analyzed for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      The HCC risk was compared between patients who maintained virological response
      (MVR), defined by persistently undetectable HBV DNA (<12 IU/mL), and patients who
      experienced LLV, defined by either persistent or intermittent episodes of <2,000 
      IU/mL detectable HBV DNA. During a median 4.5 years of follow-up (range 1.0-8.7
      years), HCC was diagnosed in 85 patients (9.7%). HCC developed more frequently in
      patients who experienced LLV than MVR (14.3% versus 7.5% at 5 years, P = 0.015). 
      The hazard ratio comparing those with LLV to MVR was 1.98 (95% confidence
      interval = 1.28-3.06, P = 0.002, adjusted for age, sex, hepatitis B e antigen,
      baseline HBV DNA levels, and cirrhosis). Among patients with cirrhosis, those
      with LLV exhibited a significantly higher HCC risk than those with MVR (HCC
      incidence rate at 5 years 23.4% versus 10.3%, adjusted hazard ratio = 2.20, 95%
      confidence interval 1.34-3.60; P = 0.002). However, for patients without
      cirrhosis, there was no significant difference in the HCC risk between LLV and
      MVR. CONCLUSION: LLV observed during entecavir monotherapy was associated with a 
      higher risk of HCC, especially for those with cirrhosis, indicating that LLV
      during potent antiviral therapy is consequential. (Hepatology 2017;66:335-343).

AB  - No all-oral, direct-acting antiviral regimens have been approved for children
      with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We conducted a phase 2,
      multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      ledipasvir-sofosbuvir in adolescents with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. One
      hundred patients aged 12-17 years received a combination tablet of 90 mg
      ledipasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir once daily for 12 weeks. On the tenth day
      following initiation of dosing, 10 patients underwent an intensive
      pharmacokinetic evaluation of the concentrations of sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and
      the sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007. The primary efficacy endpoint was the
      percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks
      posttreatment. Median age of patients was 15 years (range 12-17). A majority
      (80%) were HCV treatment-naive, and 84% were infected through perinatal
      transmission. One patient had cirrhosis, and 42 did not; in 57 patients the
      degree of fibrosis was unknown. Overall, 98% (98/100; 95% confidence interval
      93%-100%) of patients reached sustained virologic response at 12 weeks. No
      patient had virologic failure. The 2 patients who did not achieve sustained
      virologic response at 12 weeks were lost to follow-up either during or after
      treatment. The three most commonly reported adverse events were headache (27% of 
      patients), diarrhea (14%), and fatigue (13%). No serious adverse events were
      reported. Area under the concentration-time curve (tau) and maximum concentration
      values for sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS-331007 were within the predefined
      pharmacokinetic equivalence boundaries of 50%-200% when compared with adults from
      phase 2 and 3 studies of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. CONCLUSION:
      Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir was highly effective at treating adolescents with chronic
      HCV genotype 1 infection; the dose of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir currently used in
      adults was well tolerated in adolescents and had an appropriate pharmacokinetic
      profile. (Hepatology 2017;66:371-378).

TI  - Hepatitis C virus double-stranded RNA is the predominant form in human liver and 
      in interferon-treated cells.
PG  - 357-370
LID - 10.1002/hep.28846 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is unique among RNA viruses in its ability to establish
      chronic infection in the majority of exposed adults. HCV persists in the liver
      despite interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction; robust induction
      actually predicts treatment failure and viral persistence. It is unclear which
      forms of HCV RNA are associated with ISG induction and IFN resistance during
      natural infections. To thoroughly delineate HCV RNA populations, we developed
      conditions that fully separate the strands of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
      and allow the released RNAs to be quantified in reverse transcription/polymerase 
      chain reaction assays. These methods revealed that dsRNA, a pathogen-associated
      molecular pattern (PAMP), comprised 52% (standard deviation, 28%) of the HCV RNA 
      in the livers of patients with chronic infection. HCV dsRNA was proportionally
      higher in patients with the unfavorable IL28B TT (rs12979860) genotype. Higher
      ratios of HCV double-stranded to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) correlated
      positively with ISG induction. In Huh-7.5 cells, IFN treatment increased the
      total amount of HCV dsRNA through a process that required de novo viral RNA
      synthesis and shifted the ratio of viral dsRNA/ssRNA in favor of dsRNA. This
      shift was blocked by ribavirin (RBV), an antiviral drug that reduces relapse in
      HCV patients. Northern blotting established that HCV dsRNA contained
      genome-length minus strands. CONCLUSION: HCV dsRNA is the predominant form in the
      HCV-infected liver and has features of both a PAMP and a genomic reservoir.
      Interferon treatment increased rather than decreased HCV dsRNA. This unexpected
      finding suggests that HCV produces dsRNA in response to IFN, potentially to
      antagonize antiviral defenses. (Hepatology 2017;66:357-370).

AB  - High-quality data on the efficacy of L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) in patients
      with cirrhosis and bouts of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) are missing. We
      evaluated the efficacy of intravenous LOLA in the reversal of bouts of OHE in
      patients with cirrhosis. In this prospective, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial conducted at two tertiary care institutes in India, 370 
      patients with cirrhosis and bouts of OHE were screened. After exclusion, 193
      (52.16%) patients were randomized to receive either intravenous infusions of LOLA
      (n = 98), 30 g daily, or placebo (n = 95) for 5 days. Standard of care treatment 
      (including lactulose and ceftriaxone) was given in both groups. Randomization was
      done centrally (http://www.sealedenvelope.com/). All study personnel were blinded
      to the treatment assignment. Fasting venous ammonia levels were estimated daily
      from 0 to 5 days. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins, hemogram, and 
      liver and renal function tests were performed at days 0 and 5. Primary outcome
      was mental state grade at day 5 of treatment. The grade of OHE was significantly 
      lower in the LOLA group (compared to placebo) on days 1-4 but not on day 5. The
      mean time taken for recovery was lower in the LOLA group compared to the placebo 
      group (1.92 +/- 0.93 versus 2.50 +/- 1.03 days, P = 0.002; 95% confidence
      interval -0.852 to -0.202). Venous ammonia at day 5 and length of hospital stay
      were significantly lower in the LOLA group. No significant difference in
      interleukins was seen between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with bouts of
      OHE, intravenous LOLA (as an add-on therapy to lactulose and ceftriaxone)
      significantly improves the grade of OHE over days 1-4, but not on day 5, and
      decreases venous ammonia, time of recovery, and length of hospital stay.

TI  - Impact of Sustained Virologic Response with Direct-Acting Antiviral Treatment on 
      Mortality in Patients with Advanced Liver Disease.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29408 [doi]
AB  - The impact of sustained virologic response (SVR) on mortality after direct-acting
      antiviral (DAA) treatment is not well documented. This study evaluated the impact
      of DAA-induced SVR on all-cause mortality and on incident hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) in 15,059 HCV-infected patients with advanced liver disease
      defined by a FIB-4 >3.25. Overall, 1,067 patients did not achieve SVR (No SVR)
      and 13,992 patients achieved SVR. In a mean follow-up period of approximately 1.6
      years, 195 No SVR patients and 598 SVR patients died. Mortality rates were 12.3
      deaths/100 patient years of follow-up for No SVR patients and 2.6 deaths/100
      patient years for SVR patients, a 78.9% reduction (p<0.001). Among patients
      without a prior diagnosis of HCC, 140 No SVR patients and 397 SVR patients were
      diagnosed with incident HCC. HCC rates were 11.5 HCC/100 patient years for No SVR
      patients and 1.9 HCC/100 patient years for SVR patients, an 83.5% reduction
      (p<0.001). In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models controlling for
      baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and comorbidities, SVR was
      independently associated with reduced risk of death compared to No SVR (hazard
      ratio (HR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.31, p<0.001). A history of
      decompensated liver disease (HR 1.57, 95%CI 1.34-1.83, p<0.001) and decreased
      albumin (HR 2.70 per 1 g/dL decrease 95%CI 2.38-3.12, p<0.001) were independently
      associated with increased risk of death. CONCLUSION: Those achieving SVR after
      DAA treatment had significantly lower all-cause mortality and lower incident HCC 
      rates than those who did not achieve SVR. This article is protected by copyright.

      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29403 [doi]
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated dexamethasone
      efficacy at preventing fever, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting, the most frequent
      adverse events of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Child-Pugh class A/B patients with HCC and
      no macrovascular invasion/extrahepatic metastases were randomly assigned to
      either a dexamethasone regimen (day 1, intravenous dexamethasone [20 mg] and
      granisetron [3 mg] before TACE; days 2 and 3, intravenous dexamethasone [8 mg])
      or a control regimen (day 1, intravenous placebo [saline] and granisetron [3 mg];
      days 2 and 3, intravenous placebo). The primary endpoint was complete response,
      defined as the absence of grade >/=1 fever, anorexia, or nausea/vomiting
      according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) and
      no use of rescue therapy for 120 hours after TACE. A total of 120 patients
      between October 2010 and June 2013 were randomly assigned to treatment groups.
      Overall the complete response rate was greater with the dexamethasone regimen
      than with the control regimen (47.5%, 95% confidence interval 34.3%-60.9%, versus
      10.2%, 95% confidence interval 3.8%-20.8%; P < 0.001). Cumulative incidences of
      fever, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting were higher in the control regimen group
      compared with the dexamethasone group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.095,
      respectively). The dexamethasone regimen was generally well tolerated by HCC
      patients including those with well-controlled diabetes mellitus and those with
      hepatitis B virus infection. CONCLUSION: The dexamethasone regimen was more
      effective than the control regimen at preventing TACE-induced fever, anorexia,
      and nausea/vomiting in patients with HCC. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - The presence and severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is associated with
      specific changes in circulating bile acids.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29359 [doi]
AB  - The histologic spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes
      fatty liver (NAFL) and steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis in
      up to 20% of NASH patients. Bile acids (BA) are linked to the pathogenesis and
      therapy of NASH. We (1) characterized the plasma BA profile in biopsy-proven NAFL
      and NASH and compared to controls and (2) related the plasma BA profile to liver 
      histologic features, disease activity, and fibrosis. Liquid chromatography/mass
      spectrometry quantified BAs. Descriptive statistics, paired and multiple group
      comparisons, and regression analyses were performed. Of 86 patients (24 controls,
      25 NAFL, and 37 NASH; mean age 51.8 years and body mass index 31.9 kg/m(2) ), 66%
      were women. Increased total primary BAs and decreased secondary BAs (both P <
      0.05) characterized NASH. Total conjugated primary BAs were significantly higher 
      in NASH versus NAFL (P = 0.047) and versus controls (P < 0.0001). NASH had higher
      conjugated to unconjugated chenodeoxycholate (P = 0.04), cholate (P = 0.0004),
      and total primary BAs (P < 0.0001). The total cholate to chenodeoxycholate ratio 
      was significantly higher in NAFLD without (P = 0.005) and with (P = 0.02)
      diabetes. Increased key BAs were associated with higher grades of steatosis
      (taurocholate), lobular (glycocholate) and portal inflammation
      (taurolithocholate), and hepatocyte ballooning (taurocholate). Conjugated cholate
      and taurocholate directly and secondary to primary BA ratio inversely correlated 
      to NAFLD activity score. A higher ratio of total secondary to primary BA
      decreased (odds ratio, 0.57; P = 0.004) and higher conjugated cholate increased
      the likelihood of significant fibrosis (F>/=2) (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: NAFLD is 
      associated with significantly altered circulating BA composition, likely
      unaffected by type 2 diabetes, and correlated with histological features of NASH;
      these observations provide the foundation for future hypothesis-driven studies of
      specific effects of BAs on specific aspects of NASH. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Hospital volume and mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
      creation in the United States.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29354 [doi]
AB  - The link between higher procedure volume and better outcomes for surgical
      procedures is well established. We aimed to determine whether procedure volume
      affected inpatient mortality in patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS). An epidemiological analysis of an all-payer database 
      recording hospitalizations during 2013 in the United States (Nationwide
      Readmissions Database) was performed. All patients >/= 18 years old undergoing
      TIPS during a hospital admission (n = 5529) without concurrent or prior liver
      transplantation were selected. All-cause inpatient mortality was assessed.
      Risk-adjusted mortality was assessed for hospitals categorized into quintiles
      based on annual TIPS volume (very low, 1-4/year; low, 5-9/year; medium,
      10-19/year; high, 20-29/year; and very high, >/= 30/year). TIPS were placed in
      all 5529 patients (mean age, 57 years [standard deviation, +/- 10.9 years];
      women, n = 2071; men, n = 3458). Mortality decreased with rising annual TIPS
      volume (13% for very low to 6% for very high volume hospitals; P < 0.01).
      Elective admissions were more common in hospitals with higher annual TIPS volume 
      (20.3% for very low to 30.8% for very high; P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, 
      compared with hospitals performing >/=30 TIPS per year, only hospitals performing
      1-4/year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.21-3.01; P = 0.01), 5-9/year (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.25-3.17; P < 0.01), and
      10-19/year (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.17-3.00; P = 0.01) had higher inpatient mortality
      (20-29/year: aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.84-2.84; P = 0.19). The absolute difference
      between risk-adjusted mortality rate for very low volume and very high volume
      hospitals was 6.1% (13.9% versus 7.8%). TIPS volume of </= 20 TIPS/year, variceal
      bleeding, and nosocomial infections were independent risk factors for inpatient
      mortality in patients with both elective and emergent admissions. CONCLUSION: The
      risk of inpatient mortality is lower in hospitals performing >/=20 TIPS per year.
      Future research exploring preventable factors for higher mortality and benefits
      of patient transfer to higher volume centers is warranted. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Role of ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases in cholangiocyte biology.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29350 [doi]
AB  - The ErbB/HER family comprises four distinct tyrosine kinase receptors,
      EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4, which trigger
      intracellular signals at the origin of essential cellular functions, including
      differentiation, proliferation, survival, and migration. Epithelial cells, named 
      cholangiocytes, that line intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, contribute
      substantially to biliary secretory functions and bile transport. Although ErbB
      receptors have been widely studied in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignancy of
      the biliary tract, knowledge of these receptors in biliary epithelium physiology 
      and in non-malignant cholangiopathies is far from complete. Current knowledge
      suggests a role for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cholangiocyte
      specification and proliferation, and in hepatocyte transdifferentiation into
      cholangiocytes during liver regeneration to restore biliary epithelium integrity.
      High expression and activation of EGFR and/or ErbB2 were recently demonstrated in
      biliary lithiasis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, two cholangiopathies
      regarded as risk factors for CCA. In CCA, ErbB receptors are frequently
      overexpressed, leading to tumor progression and low prognosis. Anti-ErbB
      therapies were efficient only in preclinical trials and have suggested the
      existence of resistance mechanisms with the need to identify predictive factors
      of therapy response. This review aims to compile the current knowledge on the
      functions of ErbB receptors in physiology and physiopathology of the biliary
      epithelium. (Hepatology 2017).

      virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 209-219
LID - 10.1002/hep.29189 [doi]
AB  - Mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure
      (ACLF) is high due to limited treatment options. Preclinical and clinical
      investigations have proved that treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
      is beneficial for recovery from liver injury. We hypothesized that the outcome of
      HBV-related ACLF would be improved by MSC treatment. From 2010 to 2013, 110
      patients with HBV-related ACLF were enrolled in this open-label, nonblinded
      randomized controlled study. The control group (n = 54) was treated with standard
      medical therapy (SMT) only. The experimental group (n = 56) was infused weekly
      for 4 weeks with 1.0 to 10 x 10(5) cells/kg allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs
      and then followed for 24 weeks. The cumulated survival rate of the MSC group was 
      73.2% (95% confidence interval 61.6%-84.8%) versus 55.6% (95% confidence interval
      42.3%-68.9%) for the SMT group (P = 0.03). There were no infusion-related side
      effects, but fever was more frequent in MSC compared to SMT patients during weeks
      5-24 of follow-up. No carcinoma occurred in any trial patient in either group.
      Compared with the control group, allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSC treatment
      markedly improved clinical laboratory measurements, including serum total
      bilirubin and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores. The incidence of severe
      infection in the MSC group was much lower than that in the SMT group (16.1%
      versus 33.3%, P = 0.04). Mortality from multiple organ failure and severe
      infection was higher in the SMT group than in the MSC group (37.0% versus 17.9%, 
      P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Peripheral infusion of allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs
      is safe and convenient for patients with HBV-related ACLF and significantly
      increases the 24-week survival rate by improving liver function and decreasing
      the incidence of severe infections. (Hepatology 2017;66:209-219).

TI  - Hypoxia mediates mitochondrial biogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma to promote 
      tumor growth through HMGB1 and TLR9 interaction.
PG  - 182-197
LID - 10.1002/hep.29184 [doi]
AB  - The ability of cancer cells to survive and grow under hypoxic conditions has been
      known for decades, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Under certain
      conditions, cancer cells undergo changes in their bioenergetic profile to favor
      mitochondrial respiration by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) and up-regulating mitochondrial
      biogenesis. In this study, we hypothesized that augmented mitochondrial
      biogenesis plays a critical role for cancer cells to survive hypoxia. Consistent 
      with this hypothesis, both hypoxic human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors
      and HCC cell lines subjected to hypoxia increase mitochondrial biogenesis.
      Silencing of PGC-1alpha in hypoxic HCC cell lines halts their proliferation.
      Mechanistic investigations in vitro indicated that intracellular high mobility
      group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, a nuclear protein overexpressed in HCC, is essential
      for the process. Silencing of HMGB1 in hypoxic HCC cell lines resulted in a
      significant decrease in PGC-1alpha activation and mitochondrial biogenesis.
      Without HMGB1, hypoxic HCC cells had significantly reduced adenosine triphosphate
      production, decreased cellular proliferation, and increased apoptosis. In a
      diethylnitrosamine-induced murine model of HCC, genetic blocking of HMGB1 in
      hypoxic tumors resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth. Tumors lacking
      HMGB1 had a significant reduction in mitochondrial biogenesis and a significant
      increase in mitochondrial dysfunction. Further in vitro mechanistic experiments
      indicated that during hypoxia HMGB1 translocates from the nucleus to the
      cytoplasm and binds to cytoplasmic Toll-like receptor-9. This binding leads to
      activation of p38 and subsequent phosphorylation of PGC-1alpha, with resultant
      up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our
      findings suggest that during hypoxia HMGB1 up-regulates mitochondrial biogenesis 
      in HCC cancer cells, promoting tumor survival and proliferation. (Hepatology
      2017;66:182-197).

TI  - A functional mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 signaling is indispensable
      for c-Myc-driven hepatocarcinogenesis.
PG  - 167-181
LID - 10.1002/hep.29183 [doi]
AB  - Amplification and/or activation of the c-Myc proto-oncogene is one of the leading
      genetic events along hepatocarcinogenesis. The oncogenic potential of c-Myc has
      been proven experimentally by the finding that its overexpression in the mouse
      liver triggers tumor formation. However, the molecular mechanism whereby c-Myc
      exerts its oncogenic activity in the liver remains poorly understood. Here, we
      demonstrate that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) cascade is 
      activated and necessary for c-Myc-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis. Specifically,
      we found that ablation of Raptor, the unique member of mTORC1, strongly inhibits 
      c-Myc liver tumor formation. Also, the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase/ribosomal protein 
      S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1/eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 4E signaling cascades downstream of mTORC1 are
      required for c-Myc-driven tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, microarray expression
      analysis revealed up-regulation of multiple amino acid transporters, including
      solute carrier family 1 member A5 (SLC1A5) and SLC7A6, leading to robust uptake
      of amino acids, including glutamine, into c-Myc tumor cells. Subsequent
      functional studies showed that amino acids are critical for activation of mTORC1 
      as their inhibition suppressed mTORC1 in c-Myc tumor cells. In human
      hepatocellular carcinoma specimens, levels of c-Myc directly correlate with those
      of mTORC1 activation as well as of SLC1A5 and SLC7A6. CONCLUSION: Our current
      study indicates that an intact mTORC1 axis is required for c-Myc-driven
      hepatocarcinogenesis; thus, targeting the mTOR pathway or amino acid transporters
      may be an effective and novel therapeutic option for the treatment of
      hepatocellular carcinoma with activated c-Myc signaling. (Hepatology

TI  - Polyphenic trait promotes liver cancer in a model of epigenetic instability in
      mice.
PG  - 235-251
LID - 10.1002/hep.29182 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the fifth-most common form of cancer
      worldwide and carries a high mortality rate attributed to lack of effective
      treatment. Males are 8 times more likely to develop HCC than females, an effect
      largely driven by sex hormones, albeit through still poorly understood
      mechanisms. We previously identified TRIM28 (tripartite protein 28), a scaffold
      protein capable of recruiting a number of chromatin modifiers, as a crucial
      mediator of sexual dimorphism in the liver. Trim28(hep-/-) mice display
      sex-specific transcriptional deregulation of a wide range of bile and steroid
      metabolism genes and development of liver adenomas in males. We now demonstrate
      that obesity and aging precipitate alterations of TRIM28-dependent
      transcriptional dynamics, leading to a metabolic infection state responsible for 
      highly penetrant male-restricted hepatic carcinogenesis. Molecular analyses
      implicate aberrant androgen receptor stimulation, biliary acid disturbances, and 
      altered responses to gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Trim28(hep-/-)
      -associated HCC. Correspondingly, androgen deprivation markedly attenuates the
      frequency and severity of tumors, and raising animals under axenic conditions
      completely abrogates their abnormal phenotype, even upon high-fat diet challenge.
      CONCLUSION: This work underpins how discrete polyphenic traits in epigenetically 
      metastable conditions can contribute to a cancer-prone state and more broadly
      provides new evidence linking hormonal imbalances, metabolic disturbances, gut
      microbiota, and cancer. (Hepatology 2017;66:235-251).

TI  - Autophagy determines efficiency of liver-directed gene therapy with
      adeno-associated viral vectors.
PG  - 252-265
LID - 10.1002/hep.29176 [doi]
AB  - Use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for liver-directed gene therapy has
      shown considerable success, particularly in patients with severe hemophilia B.
      However, the high vector doses required to reach therapeutic levels of transgene 
      expression caused liver inflammation in some patients that selectively destroyed 
      transduced hepatocytes. We hypothesized that such detrimental immune responses
      can be avoided by enhancing the efficacy of AAV vectors in hepatocytes. Because
      autophagy is a key liver response to environmental stresses, we characterized the
      impact of hepatic autophagy on AAV infection. We found that AAV induced mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy in human hepatocytes. This cell
      response was critically required for efficient transduction because under
      conditions of impaired autophagy (pharmacological inhibition, small interfering
      RNA knockdown of autophagic proteins, or suppression by food intake), recombinant
      AAV-mediated transgene expression was markedly reduced, both in vitro and in
      vivo. Taking advantage of this dependence, we employed pharmacological inducers
      of autophagy to increase the level of autophagy. This resulted in greatly
      improved transduction efficiency of AAV vectors in human and mouse hepatocytes
      independent of the transgene, driving promoter, or AAV serotype and was
      subsequently confirmed in vivo. Specifically, short-term treatment with a single 
      dose of torin 1 significantly increased vector-mediated hepatic expression of
      erythropoietin in C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, coadministration of rapamycin with AAV
      vectors resulted in markedly enhanced expression of human acid-alpha-glucosidase 
      in nonhuman primates. CONCLUSION: We identified autophagy as a pivotal cell
      response determining the efficiency of AAVs intracellular processing in
      hepatocytes and thus the outcome of liver-directed gene therapy using AAV vectors
      and showed in a proof-of-principle study how this virus-host interaction can be
      employed to enhance efficacy of this vector system. (Hepatology 2017;66:252-265).

TI  - Down-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha and defective zonation in
      livers expressing mutant Z alpha1-antitrypsin.
PG  - 124-135
LID - 10.1002/hep.29160 [doi]
AB  - alpha1 -Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders 
      and the liver disease due to the Z mutant of AAT (ATZ) is a prototype of
      conformational disorder due to protein misfolding with consequent aberrant
      intermolecular protein aggregation. In the present study, we found that livers of
      PiZ transgenic mice expressing human ATZ have altered expression of a network of 
      hepatocyte transcriptional factors, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha,
      that is early down-regulated and induces a transcriptional repression of ATZ
      expression. Reduced hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha was associated with
      activation of beta-catenin, which regulates liver zonation. Livers of PiZ mice
      and human patients with AAT deficiency were both found to have a severe
      perturbation of liver zonation. Functionally, PiZ mice showed a severe defect of 
      ureagenesis, as shown by increased baseline ammonia, and reduced urea production 
      and survival after an ammonia challenge. Down-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear
      factor-4alpha expression and defective zonation in livers have not been
      recognized so far as features of the liver disease caused by ATZ and are likely
      involved in metabolic disturbances and in the increased risk of hepatocellular
      carcinoma in patients with AAT deficiency. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study
      are consistent with the concept that abnormal AAT protein conformation and
      intrahepatic accumulation have broad effects on metabolic liver functions.

TI  - Immune phenotype and function of natural killer and T cells in chronic hepatitis 
      C patients who received a single dose of anti-MicroRNA-122, RG-101.
PG  - 57-68
LID - 10.1002/hep.29148 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNA-122 is an important host factor for the hepatitis C virus (HCV).
      Treatment with RG-101, an N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated anti-microRNA-122
      oligonucleotide, resulted in a significant viral load reduction in patients with 
      chronic HCV infection. Here, we analyzed the effects of RG-101 therapy on
      antiviral immunity. Thirty-two chronic HCV patients infected with HCV genotypes
      1, 3, and 4 received a single subcutaneous administration of RG-101 at 2 mg/kg (n
      = 14) or 4 mg/kg (n = 14) or received a placebo (n = 2/dosing group). Plasma and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at multiple time points, and
      comprehensive immunological analyses were performed. Following RG-101
      administration, HCV RNA declined in all patients (mean decline at week 2, 3.27
      log10 IU/mL). At week 8 HCV RNA was undetectable in 15/28 patients. Plasma
      interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) levels declined significantly upon
      dosing with RG-101. Furthermore, the frequency of natural killer (NK) cells
      increased, the proportion of NK cells expressing activating receptors normalized,
      and NK cell interferon-gamma production decreased after RG-101 dosing. Functional
      HCV-specific interferon-gamma T-cell responses did not significantly change in
      patients who had undetectable HCV RNA levels by week 8 post-RG-101 injection. No 
      increase in the magnitude of HCV-specific T-cell responses was observed at later 
      time points, including 3 patients who were HCV RNA-negative 76 weeks postdosing. 
      CONCLUSION: Dosing with RG-101 is associated with a restoration of NK-cell
      proportions and a decrease of NK cells expressing activation receptors; however, 
      the magnitude and functionality of ex vivo HCV-specific T-cell responses did not 
      increase following RG-101 injection, suggesting that NK cells, but not HCV
      adaptive immunity, may contribute to HCV viral control following RG-101 therapy.

TI  - Hepatic IFIT3 predicts interferon-alpha therapeutic response in patients of
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 152-166
LID - 10.1002/hep.29156 [doi]
AB  - Adjuvant interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy is used to control certain types of
      cancer in clinics. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), IFN-alpha therapy is
      effective in only a subgroup of patients; therefore, identifying biomarkers to
      predict the response to IFN-alpha therapy is of high significance and clinical
      utility. As the induced IFN-stimulated gene expression following IFN-alpha
      treatment plays pivotal roles in IFN-alpha effects, we screened IFN-stimulated
      gene expression in HCC tissues and found that several IFN-stimulated genes were
      significantly decreased in HCC. Interestingly, expression of IFN-induced protein 
      with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family members, including IFIT1, IFIT2,
      IFIT3, and IFIT5, was decreased in HCC tissues. We further analyzed the
      expression of IFIT family members in HCC and their roles in patients' responses
      to IFN-alpha therapy in two independent randomized controlled IFN-alpha therapy
      clinical trials of HCC patients. We found that higher expression of IFIT3, but
      not other IFITs, in HCC tissues predicts better response to IFN-alpha therapy,
      suggesting that IFIT3 may be a useful predictor of the response to IFN-alpha
      therapy in HCC patients. Mechanistically, IFIT3 enhanced the antitumor effects of
      IFN-alpha by promoting IFN-alpha effector responses both in vitro and in vivo.
      IFIT3 could bind signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and
      STAT2 to enhance STAT1-STAT2 heterodimerization and nuclear translocation upon
      IFN-alpha treatment, thus promoting IFN-alpha effector signaling. CONCLUSION:
      Higher IFIT3 expression in HCC tissues predicts better response to IFN-alpha
      therapy in HCC patients; IFIT3 promotes IFN-alpha effector responses and
      therapeutic effects by strengthening IFN-alpha effector signaling in HCC.

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection shows significant gender-related differences in
      pathogenesis, disease progression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
      The gender-associated differences in HBV replication and viral protein levels may
      be associated with distinct HBV-specific immune responses in the host. In the
      present study, we examined the impact of gender on HBV-specific immune responses 
      in two different mouse models representing transient and persistent hepadnaviral 
      infection; hydrodynamic injection with the HBV genome mimicked acute HBV
      infection, whereas the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination was studied in the
      woodchuck hepatitis virus transgenic mouse model. Consistent with previous
      reports, significantly higher HBV DNA and protein levels were detected in male
      compared to female mice. Although hydrodynamic injection with the HBV genome
      resulted in similar numbers of intrahepatic HBV-specific cluster of
      differentiation 8-positive (CD8(+) ) T cells, their functionality was
      significantly reduced in males and correlated with higher numbers of intrahepatic
      regulatory T cells (Tregs). Similar effects were observed in woodchuck hepatitis 
      virus transgenic mice immunized with a DNA prime-recombinant adenovirus boost
      vaccination protocol. Male mice showed functionally suppressed woodchuck
      hepatitis virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in the liver and significantly
      higher numbers of intrahepatic Tregs compared to females. Blockade of Treg
      responses in male mice led to augmented effector functions of specific CD8(+) T
      cells and subsequently improved virus control in both models of transient and
      persistent hepadnaviral infection. CONCLUSION: The functionality of
      virus-specific CD8(+) T cells in male mice was suppressed by intrahepatic Tregs
      and inversely correlated with levels of hepadnaviral DNA and viral protein; the
      induction of intrahepatic Tregs by viral replication and/or protein levels may
      explain the gender-related differences in the outcomes of HBV infection and limit
      the success of immunotherapeutic strategies in male patients. (Hepatology

TI  - Hepatic mitochondrial DNA/Toll-like receptor 9/MicroRNA-223 forms a negative
      feedback loop to limit neutrophil overactivation and acetaminophen hepatotoxicity
      in mice.
PG  - 220-234
LID - 10.1002/hep.29153 [doi]
AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure
      worldwide, in which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released by damaged hepatocytes
      activates neutrophils through binding of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), further
      aggravating liver injury. Here, we demonstrated that mtDNA/TLR9 also activates a 
      negative feedback pathway through induction of microRNA-223 (miR-223) to limit
      neutrophil overactivation and liver injury. After injection of APAP in mice,
      levels of miR-223, the most abundant miRNAs in neutrophils, were highly elevated 
      in neutrophils. Disruption of the miR-223 gene exacerbated APAP-induced hepatic
      neutrophil infiltration, oxidative stress, and injury and enhanced TLR9
      ligand-mediated activation of proinflammatory mediators in neutrophils. An
      additional deletion of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) gene
      ameliorated APAP-induced neutrophil infiltration and liver injury in miR-223
      knockout mice. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-223-deficient neutrophils
      were more susceptible to TLR9 agonist-mediated induction of proinflammatory
      mediators and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling, whereas
      overexpression of miR-223 attenuated these effects in neutrophils. Moreover,
      inhibition of TLR9 signaling by either treatment with a TLR9 inhibitor or by
      disruption of TLR9 gene partially, but significantly, suppressed miR-223
      expression in neutrophils post-APAP injection. In contrast, activation of TLR9
      up-regulated miR-223 expression in neutrophils in vivo and in vitro.
      Mechanistically, activation of TLR9 up-regulated miR-223 by enhancing NF-kappaB
      binding on miR-223 promoter, whereas miR-223 attenuated TLR9/NF-kappaB-mediated
      inflammation by targeting IkappaB kinase alpha expression. Collectively,

TI  - The animal naming test: An easy tool for the assessment of hepatic
      encephalopathy.
PG  - 198-208
LID - 10.1002/hep.29146 [doi]
AB  - Screening for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) that does not cause obvious
      disorientation or asterixis (minimal HE [MHE]/grade 1 HE) is important. We
      examined if the animal naming test (ANT1 ) (maximum number of animals listed in 1
      minute) is useful in this context. In total, 208 healthy controls, 40 controls
      with inflammatory bowel disease, and 327 consecutive patients with cirrhosis
      underwent the ANT1 . Patients were tested for MHE by the psychometric HE score,
      and 146 were assessed by electroencephalography; 202 patients were followed up
      regarding the occurrence of overt HE and death. In the healthy controls, ANT1 was
      influenced by limited education (<8 years) and advanced age (>80 years, P <
      0.001). Using an age and education adjusting procedure, the simplified ANT1
      (S-ANT1 ) was obtained. An S-ANT1 of <10 animals was abnormal. Of the patients,
      169 were considered unimpaired, 32 as having HE >/=grade 2, and 126 as having
      MHE/grade 1 HE. This group had lower S-ANT1 than unimpaired patients (12 +/- 0.4 
      versus 16 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001) and higher S-ANT1 than those with HE >/=grade 2 (4 
      +/- 0.9). In grade 1 HE the S-ANT1 was lower than in MHE. Following receiver
      operating characteristic analysis (Youden's index), 15 animals produced the best 
      discrimination between unimpaired and MHE/grade 1 HE patients. Thus, a
      three-level score (0 for S-ANT1 >/=15, 1 for 10 </= S-ANT1 < 15, 2 for S-ANT1
      <10) was obtained. This score was correlated both to the psychometric HE score (P
      < 0.0001) and to electroencephalography (P = 0.007). By sample random split
      validation, both S-ANT1 and its three-level score showed prognostic value
      regarding the 1-year risk of overt HE and death. No inflammatory bowel disease
      control had S-ANT <15. CONCLUSION: The S-ANT1 is an easily obtainable measure
      useful for the assessment of HE. (Hepatology 2017;66:198-208).

TI  - Treatment of patients waitlisted for liver transplant with all-oral direct-acting
      antivirals is a cost-effective treatment strategy in the United States.
PG  - 46-56
LID - 10.1002/hep.29137 [doi]
AB  - All-oral direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been shown to have high safety and 
      efficacy in treating patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) awaiting liver
      transplant (LT). However, there is limited empirical evidence comparing the
      health and economic outcomes associated with treating patients pre-LT versus
      post-LT. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of
      pre-LT versus post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA regimen among HCV patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or decompensated cirrhosis (DCC). We
      constructed decision-analytic Markov models of the natural disease progression of
      HCV in HCC patients and DCC patients waitlisted for LT. The model followed
      hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 patients with a mean age of 50 over a 30-year time 
      horizon from a third-party US payer perspective and estimated their health and
      cost outcomes based on pre-LT versus post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA
      regimen. Transition probabilities and utilities were based on the literature and 
      hepatologist consensus. Sustained virological response rates were sourced from
      ASTRAL-4, SOLAR-1, and SOLAR-2. Costs were sourced from RedBook, Medicare fee
      schedules, and published literature. In the HCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment
      strategy resulted in 11.48 per-patient quality-adjusted life years and $365,948
      per patient lifetime costs versus 10.39 and $283,696, respectively, in the
      post-LT arm. In the DCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy resulted in 9.27 
      per-patient quality-adjusted life years and $304,800 per patient lifetime costs
      versus 8.7 and $283,789, respectively, in the post-LT arm. As such, the pre-LT
      treatment strategy was found to be the most cost-effective in both populations
      with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,255 (HCC) and $36,583 (DCC). 
      Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that results were most sensitive to the 
      utility of patients post-LT, treatment sustained virological response rates, LT
      costs, and baseline Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (DCC analysis only). 
      CONCLUSION: The timing of initiation of antiviral treatment for HCV patients with
      HCC or DCC relative to LT is an important area of clinical and policy research;
      our results indicate that pre-LT treatment with a highly effective, all-oral DAA 
      regimen provides the best health outcomes and is the most cost-effective strategy
      for the treatment of HCV patients with HCC or DCC waitlisted for LT. (Hepatology 
      2017;66:46-56).

TI  - Evaluation of hepatitis B reactivation among 62,920 veterans treated with oral
      hepatitis C antivirals.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1002/hep.29135 [doi]
AB  - Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been reported in hepatitis C
      virus-infected individuals receiving direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. The
      overall risk among patients with current or prior HBV infection in the context of
      DAA treatment is unknown. The aim of this evaluation was to identify and
      characterize HBV reactivation among veterans treated with oral DAA therapy. This 
      retrospective evaluation included 62,290 hepatitis C virus-infected veterans
      completing oral DAA treatment. Baseline HBV infection status for each veteran was
      identified from HBV laboratory data performed prior to DAA initiation. To assess 
      for HBV reactivation and hepatitis we identified all hepatitis B surface antigen 
      (HBsAg), HBV DNA, and alanine aminotransferase results obtained while on DAA
      treatment or 7 days after. HBV reactivation was defined as a >1000 IU/mL increase
      in HBV DNA or HBsAg detection in a person who was previously negative. Prior to
      DAA treatment 85.5% (53,784/62,920) had HBsAg testing and 0.70% (377/53,784) were
      positive; 84.6% (53,237/62,920) had a hepatitis B surface antibody test, of which
      42.2% (22,479/53,237) were positive. In all, 9 of 62,290 patients treated with
      DAAs had evidence of HBV reactivation occurring while on DAA treatment. Eight
      occurred in patients known to be HBsAg-positive, and 1 occurred in a patient
      known to be isolated hepatitis B core antibody-positive. Seventeen other patients
      had small increases in HBV DNA levels that did not qualify as HBV reactivation.
      Only 3 of the 9 patients identified with HBV reactivation in this cohort
      exhibited peak alanine aminotransferase elevations >2 times the upper limit of
      normal. CONCLUSION: HBV reactivation of varying severity, even in the setting of 
      isolated hepatitis B core antibody, with or without accompanying hepatitis can
      occur-though the occurrence of accompanying severe hepatitis was rare.

TI  - Inflammation is independent of steatosis in a murine model of steatohepatitis.
PG  - 108-123
LID - 10.1002/hep.29129 [doi]
AB  - Obesity and alcohol consumption synergistically promote steatohepatitis, and
      neutrophil infiltration is believed to be associated with steatosis. However, the
      underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma (PPARgamma) plays a complex role in lipid metabolism and inflammation;
      therefore, the purpose of this study was to dissect its role in regulating
      steatosis and neutrophil infiltration in a clinically relevant mouse
      steatohepatitis model of 3-month high-fat diet (HFD) feeding plus a binge of
      ethanol (HFD-plus-binge ethanol). Hepatocyte-specific Pparg disruption reduced
      liver steatosis but surprisingly increased hepatic neutrophil infiltration after 
      HFD-plus-binge ethanol. Knockout or knockdown of the PPARgamma target gene,
      fat-specific protein 27, reduced steatosis without affecting neutrophil
      infiltration in this model. Moreover, hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Pparg
      gene, but not the fat-specific protein 27 gene, markedly up-regulated hepatic
      levels of the gene for chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1, a chemokine for
      neutrophil infiltration) in HFD-plus-binge ethanol-fed mice. In vitro, deletion
      of the Pparg gene also highly augmented palmitic acid or tumor necrosis factor
      alpha induction of Cxcl1 in mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, activation of
      PPARgamma with a PPARgamma agonist attenuated Cxcl1 expression in hepatocytes.
      Palmitic acid also up-regulated interleukin-8 (a key chemokine for human
      neutrophil recruitment) expression in human hepatocytes, which was attenuated and
      enhanced by cotreatment with a PPARgamma agonist and antagonist, respectively.
      Finally, acute ethanol binge markedly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic PPARgamma
      activation, which contributed to the up-regulation of hepatic Cxcl1 expression
      post-HFD-plus-binge ethanol. CONCLUSION: Hepatic PPARgamma plays an opposing role
      in controlling steatosis and neutrophil infiltration, leading to dissociation
      between steatosis and inflammation; acute ethanol gavage attenuates hepatic
      PPARgamma activation and subsequently up-regulates hepatic CXCL1/interleukin-8
      expression, thereby exacerbating hepatic neutrophil infiltration. (Hepatology
      2017;66:108-123).

TI  - Liver fibrosis scores predict liver disease mortality in the United States
      population.
PG  - 84-95
LID - 10.1002/hep.29113 [doi]
AB  - Fatty liver disease is common in the United States and worldwide due to changing 
      lifestyles and can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis contributing to premature
      death. We examined whether liver fibrosis scores were associated with increased
      overall and disease-specific mortality in a United States population-based
      prospective survey with up to 23 years of linked-mortality data. Data were
      analyzed from 14,841 viral hepatitis-negative adult participants in the third
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. Liver fibrosis was
      predicted using the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),
      fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), 
      and Forns score. Participants were passively followed for mortality, identified
      by death certificate underlying or contributing causes, by linkage to National
      Death Index records through 2011. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were
      calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression to adjust for mortality risk
      factors. During follow-up, cumulative mortality was 28.0% from all causes and
      0.82% with liver disease, including primary liver cancer. Elevated liver disease 
      mortality was found with an intermediate to high APRI (HR, 9.44; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 5.02-17.73), intermediate (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.33-7.44) or high
      (HR, 25.14; 95% CI, 8.38-75.40) FIB-4 score, high NFS (HR, 6.52; 95% CI,
      2.30-18.50), and intermediate (HR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.78-7.18) or high (HR, 63.13;
      95% CI, 22.16-179.78) Forns score. Overall mortality was also greater with higher
      fibrosis scores. CONCLUSION: In the United States population, higher liver
      fibrosis scores were associated with increased liver disease and overall
      mortality. Liver health management with common clinical measures of fibrosis risk
      stratification merits further investigation. (Hepatology 2017;66:84-95).

TI  - Risk of end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related
      death by fibrosis stage in the hepatitis C Alaska Cohort.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1002/hep.29115 [doi]
AB  - Long-term prospective studies of the outcomes associated with hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection are rare and critical for assessing the potential impact of HCV
      treatment. Using liver biopsy as a starting point, we analyzed the development of
      end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related
      death (LRD) according to fibrosis stage among a cohort of American Indian/Alaska 
      Native persons in Alaska. Persons were classified as having no/mild (Ishak =
      0,1), moderate (Ishak = 2), or severe (Ishak = 3,4) fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak 
      = 5,6). We examined time until development of ESLD, HCC, and LRD and report
      survival probabilities at 3, 5, 7, and 10 years. Of 407 persons, 39% (n = 150)
      had no/mild fibrosis, 32% (n = 131) had moderate fibrosis, 22% (n = 88) had
      severe fibrosis, and 9% (n = 38) had cirrhosis. The average time of follow-up was
      7.3 years. Within 5 years of biopsy, 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-6.8)
      of persons with no/mild fibrosis developed ESLD compared with 7.9% (95% CI,
      4.0-15.2), 16.4% (95% CI, 9.6-27.2), and 49.0% (95% CI, 33.0-67.7) with moderate,
      severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis, respectively (P < 0.01). The 5-year outcome of
      HCC was 1.0% (95% CI, 0.1-7.0), 1.0% (95% CI, 0.1-6.6), 1.1% (95% CI, 0.2-7.7),
      and 13.4% (95% CI, 4.4-36.7) among persons with no/mild fibrosis, moderate
      fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis, respectively (P < 0.01). Five years
      after biopsy, 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0-14.8) of persons with no/mild fibrosis had
      suffered an LRD compared with 1.0% (95% CI, 0.2-7.5) of persons with moderate
      fibrosis, 4.7% (95% CI, 1.5-14.1) with severe fibrosis, and 16.3% (95% CI,
      7.0-35.1) with cirrhosis (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: For prevention of HCC, LRD, and 
      ESLD in the short term, HCV therapy should target individuals who have more than 
      mild fibrosis. (Hepatology 2017;66:37-45).

      immunity and inflammation, from initiation through resolution. Galectin-9 (Gal-9)
      is highly expressed in the liver and has a wide variety of biological functions
      in innate and adaptive immunity that are instrumental in the maintenance of
      hepatic homeostasis. In the setting of viral hepatitis, increased expression of
      Gal-9 drives the expansion of regulatory T cells and contraction of effector T
      cells, thereby favoring viral persistence. The dichotomous nature of Gal-9 is
      evident in hepatocellular carcinoma, where loss of expression in hepatocytes
      promotes tumor growth and metastasis, whereas overexpression by Kupffer cells and
      endothelial cells inhibits the antitumor immune response. In nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease, Gal-9 is involved indirectly in the expansion of protective
      natural killer T-cell populations. In ischemic liver injury, hepatocyte-derived
      Gal-9 is both diagnostic and cytoprotective. In drug-induced acute liver failure,
      plasma levels correlate with outcome. Here, we offer a synthesis of recent and
      emerging findings on Gal-9 in the regulation of hepatic inflammation. Ongoing
      studies are warranted to better elucidate the pathophysiology of hepatic
      immune-mediated diseases and to develop new therapeutic interventions using
      glycan-binding proteins. (Hepatology 2017;66:271-279).

TI  - Hepatitis B reactivation in hepatitis B and C coinfected patients treated with
      antiviral agents: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 13-26
LID - 10.1002/hep.29109 [doi]
AB  - There is an increased awareness of hepatitis B (HBV) reactivation in chronic
      hepatitis C (CHC) patients coinfected with HBV treated with pan-oral
      direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). We performed a systematic review and
      meta-analysis to compare the rate of HBV reactivation in CHC patients coinfected 
      with overt HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive) and occult HBV
      (HBsAg negative with positive HBV DNA) infection separately, treated with
      interferon (IFN)-based therapy to those with pan-oral DAAs. The primary outcome
      was HBV reactivation, and the secondary outcomes included hepatitis due to HBV
      reactivation, sustained virologic response (SVR) for CHC, loss of HBV DNA and
      HBsAg seroclearance. Although the pooled incidence rate of HBV reactivation,
      among CHC patients with overt HBV (n = 779), was similar among those treated with
      IFN-based therapy (14.5%, P < 0.001) and DAAs (12.2%, P = 0.03; P = 0.91 for
      heterogeneity between subgroups), it was reported to occur much earlier in those 
      treated with DAAs (4-12 weeks during treatment) than in those treated with
      IFN-based therapies (most at the end of treatment and some during follow-up).
      Also, studies with DAA-based therapies were more likely to report incidence of
      hepatitis due to HBV reactivation (12.2% in DAAs vs. 0% in IFN; P = 0.009 for
      heterogeneity between subgroups). HBV reactivation and hepatitis due to HBV
      reactivation also occurred, though less frequently in CHC patients with occult
      HBV infection. CHC SVR was not affected by HBV reactivation (P = 0.27).
      CONCLUSION: HBV reactivation occurs earlier and is clinically more significant in
      CHC patients coinfected with overt and occult HBV who are treated with pan-oral
      DAAs compared with IFN-based therapy. It is therefore important to have all
      patients screened for evidence of overt or occult HBV infection and managed
      during pan-oral DAAs therapy. (Hepatology 2017;66:13-26).

TI  - MicroRNA-191 acts as a tumor promoter by modulating the TET1-p53 pathway in
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 136-151
LID - 10.1002/hep.29116 [doi]
AB  - Current treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains ineffective
      because knowledge of ICC carcinogenesis is unclear. Increasing evidence suggests 
      that microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-191, play an important role in
      tumorigenesis; but expression and biological functions of miR-191 in ICC remain
      to be established. This study investigated the functions and underlying
      mechanisms of miR-191 in ICC. ICC miRNA profiles were generated in five pairs of 
      ICC and matched to normal bile duct tissues by next-generation sequencing
      technology; ICC miRNA profiles were verified in 18 pairs of ICC tissues and
      normal bile duct tissues by quantitative RT-PCR. The miR-191-associated
      mechanisms in ICC were investigated in vitro and in vivo, and clinical outcomes
      associated with miR-191 were correlated in 84 patients. Our results showed that
      miR-191 expression was significantly increased in ICC compared with the adjacent 
      normal bile duct tissues (P < 0.001). Overexpression of miR-191 promoted
      proliferation, invasion, and migration of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and
      in vivo. The elevated miR-191 expression reduced the expression level of
      ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1)-a direct target gene of miR-191 in ICC, which
      catalyzes demethylation. The reduced TET1 expression level allowed the methylated
      CpG-rich regions at the p53 gene transcription start site stay methylated,
      leading to reduced p53 expression level, which compromises p53's anticancer
      vigor. Finally, miR-191 was found to be an independent risk factor for poor
      prognosis in patients with ICC (overall survival, hazard ratio = 3.742, 95%
      confidence interval 2.080-6.733, P < 0.001; disease-free survival, hazard ratio =
      2.331, 95% confidence interval 1.346-4.037, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our results
      suggest that overexpressed miR-191 is associated with ICC progression through the
      miR-191/TET1/p53 pathway. (Hepatology 2017;66:136-151).

TI  - Caspase-cleaved keratin-18 fragments increase during alcohol withdrawal and
      predict liver-related death in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
PG  - 96-107
LID - 10.1002/hep.29099 [doi]
AB  - Noninvasive assessment of disease activity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still unsettled, but
      essential for the evaluation of disease progression. We here studied the
      association of total (M65) and caspase-cleaved (M30) serum keratin-18 fragments
      (n = 204) with histological parameters (n = 106) in heavy drinkers primarily
      admitted for alcohol withdrawal before and after alcohol detoxification. An age-,
      sex-, and fibrosis-stage matched NAFLD cohort (n = 30) was used for comparison.
      The prognostic value of M30 and M65 levels were assessed in an additional
      prospectively followed-up cohort of 230 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC)
      using competing risk analyses. Among the histological parameters, both M30/65
      correlated significantly and better than any other serum marker with apoptosis
      and liver damage, such as ballooning (r = 0.65; P < 0.001), followed by lobular
      inflammation (0.48; P < 0.001), steatosis (0.46; P < 0.001), but less with
      fibrosis (0.24; P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristics
      curves to detect ballooning, steatosis, or steatohepatitis (SH) were slightly
      better for M30 (P < 0.005). Optimal M30 cut-off values for mild and severe
      ballooning were 330 and 420 U/L, and 290 and 330 U/L for SH grades 1 and 2. No
      significant differences of M30/65 were found between the matched NAFLD and ALD
      cohort. In contrast to aspartate-amino-transferase and M65, M30 levels increased 
      significantly from 391 to 518 U/L during alcohol detoxification. Moreover, levels
      of M30 and M65 predicted non-hepatocellular carcinoma liver-related mortality in 
      patients with AC during a mean observation interval of 67.2 months. CONCLUSION:
      Our data suggest M30 as highly specific marker of liver apoptosis both in ALD and
      NAFLD. In addition, hepatocellular apoptosis, as determined by M30 levels, occurs
      during alcohol withdrawal, and survival data point toward a novel underestimated 
      role of apoptosis in patients with ALD. (Hepatology 2017;66:96-107).

TI  - Pregnancy Outcome in Women Undergoing Liver Biopsy During Pregnancy: A Nationwide
      Population-Based Cohort Study.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29345 [doi]
AB  - Liver biopsy is an important procedure in the investigation of liver disease. We 
      examined pregnancy outcomes in women who underwent liver biopsy during pregnancy.
      In a nationwide population-based cohort study we linked data from the Swedish
      Medical Birth Registry (for births between 1992 and 2011) with those from the
      Swedish Patient Registry. We identified 23 pregnancies exposed to liver biopsy.
      We calculated relative risks (RRs) for adverse pregnancy outcomes according to
      liver biopsy status using 1,953,887 unexposed pregnancies with and without a
      record of liver disease as reference. Our main outcome measures were stillbirth
      and preterm birth. There were no stillbirths in pregnancies exposed to liver
      biopsies compared with 0.3% stillbirths in unexposed pregnancies. 3/23 (13%)
      exposed pregnancies were preterm (RR=2.6; 95%CI=0.9-7.5). Compared with women
      with a record of liver disease, preterm birth was not increased in those exposed 
      to liver biopsy (RR=0.9; 95%CI=0.1-6.0). Except for an increased risk of small
      for gestational age birth in pregnancies exposed to liver biopsy (RR=5.2;
      95%CI=1.8-14.8), other adverse pregnancy outcomes were independent of liver
      biopsy status when the analysis was restricted to women with a diagnosis of liver
      disease. Compared with unexposed sibling pregnancies, pregnancies with a liver
      biopsy were 7 days shorter, but birth weights did not differ between the siblings
      (-67g; p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Apart from a moderately increased risk of preterm
      birth and small for gestational age, there was no association between liver
      biopsy during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcome. Potential excess risks
      should be weighed against the advantages of having a liver biopsy that may
      influence clinical management of the patient indirectly influencing fetal health.

TI  - Targeting histone deacetylase 4/ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 impairs DNA repair
      for radiosensitization of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in mice.
LID - 10.1002/hep.29328 [doi]
AB  - Several strategies to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy against
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated. One approach is to develop
      radiosensitizing compounds. Because histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is highly
      expressed in liver cancer and known to regulate oncogenesis through chromatin
      structure remodeling and controlling protein access to DNA, we postulated that
      HDAC4 inhibition might enhance radiation's effect on HCC cells. HCC cell lines
      (Huh7 and PLC5) and an ectopic xenograft were pretreated with HDAC inhibitor or
      short hairpin RNA to knock down expression of HDAC4 and then irradiated (2.5-10.0
      Gy). We evaluated cell survival by a clonogenic assay; apoptosis by Annexin V
      immunofluorescence; gammaH2AX, Rad51, and HDAC4 by immunofluorescence staining;
      HDAC4, Rad51, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) in HCC cell nuclei by
      cell fractionation and confocal microscopy; physical interaction between
      HDAC4/Rad51/Ubc9 by immunoprecipitation; and the downstream targets of HDAC4
      knockdown by immunoblotting. Both HDAC4 knockdown and HDAC inhibitor enhanced
      radiation-induced cell death and reduced homologous recombination repair of DNA
      double-strand breaks and protein kinase B activation, leading to increased
      apoptosis. HDAC4 knockdown with or without an HDAC inhibitor significantly
      delayed tumor growth in a radiation-treated xenograft model. Radiation stimulated
      nuclear translocation of Rad51 in an HDAC4-dependent manner and the binding of
      Ubc9 directly to HDAC4, which led to Ubc9 acetylation. Moreover, these effects
      were accompanied by HDAC4/Ubc9/Rad51 complex dissociation through inhibiting
      nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: HDAC4 signaling blockade enhances
      radiation-induced lethality in HCC cells and xenografts. These findings raise the
      possibility that HDAC4/Ubc9/Rad51 complex in DNA repair may be a target for
      radiosensitization of HCC. (Hepatology 2017).

TI  - Toll-like receptor 5 signaling restrains T-cell/natural killer T-cell activation 
      and protects against concanavalin A-induced hepatic injury.
PG  - 2059-2073

AB  - Toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) signaling regulates the immune privileged status of
      the liver and is involved in hepatic immune disorders. However, the role of TLR5 
      has not yet been investigated in experimental models of concanavalin A (Con
      A)-mediated liver injury. Here, we show that TLR5 is highly up-regulated in the
      hepatic mononuclear cells of mice during Con A-induced hepatitis. Increased
      mortality and liver histopathology of TLR5-deficient mice correlated with
      excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting that TLR5 knockout 
      mice were more susceptible to Con A-induced hepatitis. We also report that
      administration of CBLB502, an exogenous TLR5 agonist, substantially alleviated
      Con A-mediated hepatitis in wild-type mice as shown by increased survival rates, 
      reduced aminotransferase and proinflammatory cytokine production, impaired
      lymphocyte infiltration, and ameliorated hepatocyte necrosis and/or apoptosis.
      Mechanistic studies revealed that CBLB502 acts as a negative regulator in
      limiting T-cell/natural killer T-cell activity and cytokine production in the Con
      A-hepatitis model. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that TLR5 in
      bone marrow-derived cells contributed to the hepatoprotective efficacy of CBLB502
      against Con A-induced liver injury. Moreover, interleukin-6 elevation induced by 
      CBLB502 is an important protective factor against Con A-induced liver injury. In 
      addition, we demonstrate that CBLB502 suppresses alpha-galactosylceramide-induced
      natural killer T cell-dependent inflammatory liver injury. CONCLUSION: The TLR5
      signaling pathway plays an important role in T cell-mediated hepatic injury and
      may be exploited for therapeutic treatment of inflammatory liver diseases.

TI  - The histone methyltransferase Suv39h2 contributes to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      in mice.

LID - 10.1002/hep.29127 [doi]
AB  - Uncontrolled inflammatory response highlights the central theme of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH), a growing global pandemic. Hepatocytes and macrophages
      represent two major sources of hepatic inflammation during NASH pathogenesis,
      contributing to excessive synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. The epigenetic 
      mechanism that accounts for the activation of hepatocytes and macrophages in this
      process remains obscure. Here, we report that compared to wild-type littermates, 
      mice with a deficiency in the histone H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of
      variegation 39 homolog 2 (Suv39h2, knockout) exhibited a less severe form of NASH
      induced by feeding with a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Pro-NASH stimuli
      increased Suv39h2 expression in cell culture, in mice, and in human livers. In
      hepatocytes, Suv39h2 bound to the Sirt1 gene promoter and repressed Sirt1
      transcription. Suv39h2 deficiency normalized Sirt1 expression, allowing nuclear
      factor kappa B/p65 to become hypoacetylated and thus dampening nuclear factor
      kappa B-dependent transcription of proinflammatory mediators. In macrophages,
      Suv39h2-mediated repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      transcription favored a proinflammatory M1 phenotype over an anti-inflammatory M2
      phenotype, thereby elevating hepatic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Suv39h2 plays a
      pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory response in hepatocytes and

AB  - The optimal retreatment strategy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected 
      patients who fail direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens remains unknown.
      In this phase 2, open-label study conducted at a single center in the United
      States, patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who previously failed to achieve
      sustained virological response (SVR) on a DAA-based regimen were randomized to
      receive treatment with a fixed-dose combination tablet of
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks.
      Patients were stratified by their cirrhosis and past nonstructural protein (NS)
      5A inhibitor exposure. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of
      patients with SVR at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). SVR12 was achieved by 24
      of 24 patients (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 86-100) receiving
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir alone and 24 of 25 (96%; 95% CI, 80-100)
      receiving the same treatment with RBV. None of the patients discontinued
      sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir therapy because of an adverse event (AE). The
      most commonly reported AEs with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir alone were
      diarrhea and bronchitis; and with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir plus RBV
      were fatigue, anemia, gastroenteritis, and nausea. CONCLUSION: A fixed-dose
      combination of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir was well tolerated and
      effective at achieving virological response in patients with HCV genotype 1
      infection and past DAA treatment experience. (Hepatology 2017;65:1803-1809).

TI  - RIG-I is a key antiviral interferon-stimulated gene against hepatitis E virus
      regardless of interferon production.
PG  - 1823-1839
LID - 10.1002/hep.29105 [doi]
AB  - Interferons (IFNs) are broad antiviral cytokines that exert their function by
      inducing the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However,
      little is known about the antiviral potential of these cellular effectors on
      hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, the leading cause of acute hepatitis globally.
      In this study, we profiled the antiviral potential of a panel of important human 
      ISGs on HEV replication in cell culture models by overexpression of an individual
      ISG. The mechanism of action of the key anti-HEV ISG was further studied. We
      identified retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma
      differentiation-associated protein 5, and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) as the
      key anti-HEV ISGs. We found that basal expression of RIG-I restricts HEV
      infection. Pharmacological activation of the RIG-I pathway by its natural ligand 
      5'-triphosphate RNA potently inhibits HEV replication. Overexpression of RIG-I
      activates the transcription of a wide range of ISGs. RIG-I also mediates but does
      not overlap with IFN-alpha-initiated ISG transcription. Although it is
      classically recognized that RIG-I exerts antiviral activity through the induction
      of IFN production by IRF3 and IRF7, we reveal an IFN-independent antiviral
      mechanism of RIG-I in combating HEV infection. We found that activation of RIG-I 
      stimulates an antiviral response independent of IRF3 and IRF7 and regardless of
      IFN production. However, it is partially through activation of the Janus kinase
      (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cascade of IFN
      signaling. RIG-I activated two distinct categories of ISGs, one
      JAK-STAT-dependent and the other JAK-STAT-independent, which coordinately
      contribute to the anti-HEV activity. CONCLUSION: We identified RIG-I as an
      important anti-HEV ISG that can be pharmacologically activated; activation of
      RIG-I stimulates the cellular innate immunity against HEV regardless of IFN
      production but partially through the JAK-STAT cascade of IFN signaling.

TI  - Left ventricular systolic function is associated with sympathetic nervous
      activity and markers of inflammation in cirrhosis.
PG  - 2019-2030
LID - 10.1002/hep.29104 [doi]
AB  - An accurate evaluation of cardiac function in patients with cirrhosis remains a
      challenge. We used robust echocardiographic indices to characterize left
      ventricular (LV) systolic function and its relationship to activation of the
      sympathetic nervous system and inflammation in 59 patients with cirrhosis and 59 
      age-matched controls. Additionally, in 11 patients we withdrew beta-blockers and 
      diuretics and used phenylephrine and albumin infusion to evaluate the response to
      acute afterload and preload changes (interventional substudy). Measures of
      systolic LV function such as the ejection intraventricular pressure difference
      (EIVPD) and the systolic strain rate were higher in patients with cirrhosis than 
      in controls (median [1st-3rd quartile], 4.0 [3.1-5.1] versus 2.9 [2.4-3.6] mm Hg 
      and -1.3 [-1.6 to -1.1] versus -1.2 [-1.6 to -1.1)] s(-1) , respectively; P <
      0.05 for both). EIVPD was related to the severity of liver disease (Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease, rho = 0.45, P < 0.001), the degree of sympathetic
      nervous system activation (noradrenaline, rho = 0.26, P = 0.05; heart rate
      variability, rho = -0.43, P = 0.003), and treatment with beta-blockers (P =
      0.001). In the interventional substudy, EIVPD was higher in patients with ascites
      (6.5 [5.4-8.5] versus 4.0 [3.9-5.1] mm Hg, P = 0.045). The decrease in EIVPD
      induced by phenylephrine was inversely related to baseline systolic function (P <
      0.05) and associated with markers of systemic vasodilatation (nitric oxide, rho =
      -0.66, P = 0.06; diastolic blood pressure, rho = 0.68, P = 0.04) and inflammation
      (interleukin-1beta, rho = -0.80, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: LV systolic function is 
      enhanced in cirrhosis due to augmented adrenergic tone and modulated by treatment
      with beta-blockers; acute afterload stress induces a deeper impairment of
      systolic function in patients with more advanced degrees of vasodilatation and
      inflammation; these changes in LV function related to cirrhosis can be assessed
      using robust echocardiographic methods. (Hepatology 2017;65:2019-2030).

TI  - Ammonia lowering reverses sarcopenia of cirrhosis by restoring skeletal muscle
      proteostasis.
PG  - 2045-2058
LID - 10.1002/hep.29107 [doi]
AB  - Sarcopenia or skeletal muscle loss is a frequent, potentially reversible
      complication in cirrhosis that adversely affects clinical outcomes.
      Hyperammonemia is a consistent abnormality in cirrhosis that results in impaired 
      skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown (proteostasis). Despite the
      availability of effective ammonia-lowering therapies, whether lowering ammonia
      restores proteostasis and increases muscle mass is unknown. Myotube diameter,
      protein synthesis, and molecular responses in C2C12 murine myotubes to withdrawal
      of ammonium acetate following 24-hour exposure to 10 mM ammonium acetate were
      complemented by in vivo studies in the hyperammonemic portacaval anastomosis rat 
      and sham-operated, pair-fed Sprague-Dawley rats treated with ammonia-lowering
      therapy by l-ornithine l-aspartate and rifaximin orally for 4 weeks. We observed 
      reduced myotube diameter, impaired protein synthesis, and increased autophagy
      flux in response to hyperammonemia, which were partially reversed following
      24-hour and 48-hour withdrawal of ammonium acetate. Consistently, 4 weeks of
      ammonia-lowering therapy resulted in significant lowering of blood and skeletal
      muscle ammonia, increase in lean body mass, improved grip strength, higher
      skeletal muscle mass and diameter, and an increase in type 2 fibers in treated
      compared to untreated portacaval anastomosis rats. The increased skeletal muscle 
      myostatin expression, reduced mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 function,
      and hyperammonemic stress response including autophagy markers normally found in 
      portacaval anastomosis rats were reversed by treatment with ammonia-lowering
      therapy. Despite significant improvement, molecular and functional readouts were 
      not completely reversed by ammonia-lowering measures. CONCLUSION:
      Ammonia-lowering therapy results in improvement in skeletal muscle phenotype and 
      function and molecular perturbations of hyperammonemia; these preclinical studies
      complement previous studies on ammonia-induced skeletal muscle loss and lay the
      foundation for prolonged ammonia-lowering therapy to reverse sarcopenia of
      cirrhosis. (Hepatology 2017;65:2045-2058).

TI  - Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma as bridge therapy to liver
      transplantation: A 10-year intention-to-treat analysis.
PG  - 1979-1990
LID - 10.1002/hep.29098 [doi]
AB  - In a long-term (10-year) study of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) as bridging therapy in patients listed for orthotopic liver
      transplantation (LT), we evaluated the impact of RFA on waiting list dropout
      rate, post-LT tumor recurrence, and long-term intention-to-treat,
      disease-specific survival (DSS). From March 2004 to October 2014, RFA was
      performed as the initial stand-alone bridge therapy to LT for 121 patients
      (men/women ratio, 83:38; mean age, 60.0 years) with 156 de novo HCCs (mean size, 
      2.4 cm). Follow-up period from initial RFA ranged from 1.3 to 128.0 months
      (median, 42.9 months). We assessed the overall and tumor-specific waiting list
      dropout rates, post-LT tumor recurrence, and 10-year post-LT and
      intention-to-treat survival rates. Dropout from the waiting list due to tumor
      progression occurred in 7.4% of patients. HCC recurrence after LT occurred in
      5.6% of patients. The post-LT overall survival (OS) rate at 5 and 10 years was
      75.8% and 42.2%, respectively, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was
      71.1% and 39.6%, respectively. Intention-to-treat OS, RFS, and DSS rates for the 
      entire study population at 5 and 10 years were 63.5% and 41.2%, 60.8% and 37.7%, 
      and 89.5% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: RFA as a first-line stand-alone
      bridge therapy to LT achieves excellent long-term overall and tumor-specific
      survivals, with a low dropout rate from tumor progression despite long wait list 
      times and a sustained low tumor recurrence rate upon post-LT follow-up of up to
      10 years. (Hepatology 2017;65:1979-1990).

TI  - Treatment of hepatitis C virus infection in patients with cirrhosis and
      predictive value of model for end-stage liver disease: Analysis of data from the 
      Hepa-C registry.
PG  - 1810-1822
LID - 10.1002/hep.29097 [doi]
AB  - Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are highly effective and well tolerated in 
      patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, including those with
      compensated cirrhosis. However, fewer data are available in patients with more
      advanced liver disease. Our retrospective, noninterventional, national,
      multicenter study in patients from the Spanish Hepa-C registry investigated the
      effectiveness and safety of interferon-free DAA regimens in patients with
      advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis, in routine 
      practice (all currently approved regimens were registered). Patients transplanted
      during treatment or within 12 weeks of completing treatment were excluded. Among 
      843 patients with cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A, n = 564; CTP
      class B/C, n = 175), 90% achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after
      treatment (SVR12). Significant differences in SVR12 and relapse rates were
      observed between CTP class A and CTP class B/C patients (94% versus 78%, and 4%
      versus 14%, respectively; both P < 0.001). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were
      more common in CTP class B/C versus CTP class A patients (50% versus 12%,
      respectively; P < 0.001). Incident decompensation was the most common serious
      adverse event (7% overall). Death rate during the study period was 16/843 (2%),
      significantly higher among CTP class B/C versus CTP class A patients (6.4% versus
      0.9%; P < 0.001). Baseline Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score alone
      (cut-off 18) was the best predictor of survival. CONCLUSION: Patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis receiving DAAs present lower response rates and
      experience more SAEs. In this setting, a MELD score >/=18 may help clinicians to 
      identify those patients with a higher risk of complications and to individualize 
      treatment decisions. (Hepatology 2017;65:1810-1822).

AB  - The development of different cell culture models has greatly contributed to
      increased understanding of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle. However, it is
      still challenging to grow HCV clinical isolates in cell culture. If overcome,
      this would open new perspectives to study HCV biology, including drug-resistant
      variants emerging with new antiviral therapies. In this study we hypothesized
      that this hurdle could be due to the presence of inhibitory factors in patient
      serum. Combining polyethylene glycol precipitation, iodixanol gradient, and
      size-exclusion chromatography, we obtained from HCV-seronegative sera a purified 
      fraction enriched in inhibitory factors. Mass spectrometric analysis identified
      apolipoprotein(a) (apo[a]) as a potential inhibitor of HCV entry. Apo(a) consists
      of 10 kringle IV domains (KIVs), one kringle V domain, and an inactive protease
      domain. The 10 KIVs are present in a single copy with the exception of KIV type 2
      (KIV2 ), which is encoded in a variable number of tandemly repeated copies,
      giving rise to numerous apo(a) size isoforms. In addition, apo(a) covalently
      links to the apolipoprotein B component of a low-density lipoprotein through a
      disulfide bridge to form lipoprotein(a). Using a recombinant virus derived from
      the JFH1 strain, we confirmed that plasma-derived and recombinant lipoprotein(a) 
      as well as purified recombinant apo(a) variants were able to specifically inhibit
      HCV by interacting with infectious particles. Our results also suggest that small
      isoforms are less inhibitory than the large ones. Finally, we observed that the
      lipoprotein moiety of HCV lipoviroparticles was essential for inhibition, whereas
      functional lysine-binding sites in KIV7 , KIV8 , and KIV10 were not required.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify apo(a) as an additional component of the lipid 
      metabolism modulating HCV infection. (Hepatology 2017;65:1851-1864).

TI  - The anticoagulant rivaroxaban lowers portal hypertension in cirrhotic rats mainly
      by deactivating hepatic stellate cells.
PG  - 2031-2044
LID - 10.1002/hep.29084 [doi]
AB  - In cirrhosis, increased intrahepatic vascular resistance (IHVR) is the primary
      factor for portal hypertension (PH) development. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)
      play a major role increasing IHVR because, when activated, they are contractile
      and promote fibrogenesis. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) can activate HSCs
      through thrombin and factor Xa, which are known PAR agonists, and cause
      microthrombosis in liver microcirculation. This study investigates the effects of
      the oral anticoagulant, rivaroxaban (RVXB), a direct antifactor Xa, on HSC
      phenotype, liver fibrosis (LF), liver microthrombosis, and PH in cirrhotic rats. 
      Hepatic and systemic hemodynamic, nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, LF, HSC
      activation, and microthrombosis were evaluated in CCl4 and
      thioacetamide-cirrhotic rats treated with RVXB (20 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle for 
      2 weeks. RVXB significantly decreased portal pressure (PP) in both models of
      cirrhosis without changes in portal blood flow, suggesting a reduction in IHVR.
      RVXB reduced oxidative stress, improved NO bioavailability, and ameliorated
      endothelial dysfunction. Rivaroxaban deactivated HSC, with decreased alpha-smooth
      muscle actin and mRNA expression of other HSC activation markers. Despite this
      marked improvement in HSC phenotype, no significant changes in LF were
      identified. RVXB markedly reduced fibrin deposition, suggesting reduced
      intrahepatic microthrombosis. CONCLUSION: RVXB decreases PP in two rat models of 
      cirrhosis. This effect is mostly associated with decreased IHVR, enhanced NO
      bioavailability, HSC deactivation, and reduced intrahepatic microthrombosis. Our 
      findings suggest that RVXB deserves further evaluation as a potential treatment
      for cirrhotic PH. (Hepatology 2017;65:2031-2044).

LID - 10.1002/hep.29090 [doi]
AB  - There is a need for further refinement of current histological systems for
      assessment of hepatic fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This 
      study evaluated hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD using dual-photon microscopy-based
      quantitation of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs). Fifty test cohort subjects
      and 42 validation cohort subjects with NAFLD and the full spectrum of fibrosis
      were studied. q-FPs were measured in specific predefined regions of interest
      (general, vessel, perisinusoid, and vascular septa). Seventy q-FPs had inter- and
      intraobserver concordance >/=0.8 and were related to the NASH Clinical Research
      Network fibrosis staging. Of these, 16 q-FPs with the strongest correlations (P <
      0.001 for all) were entered in a principal component analysis model (odds ratio
      [OR] 7.8, P < 0.001), which separated any stage of fibrosis versus no fibrosis,
      and cirrhosis versus earlier stages with the areas under the receiver operating
      characteristic curves of 0.88 and 0.93 (P </= 0.01 for both), respectively. In an
      independent multivariable analysis, four q-FPs-the number of collagen strands (OR
      8.5, P = 0.004), strand length (OR 12.0, P = 0.02), strand eccentricity (OR 8.3, 
      P = 0.004), and strand solidity (OR 8.0, P = 0.003)-were independently associated
      with fibrosis stages and were used to model fibrosis along a continuous linear
      scale using desirability functions; this linear scale of fibrosis measurement was
      also related to fibrosis stage (P < 0.0001). The robustness of both the
      multivariable model and the linear scale of measurement was confirmed in the
      validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The q-FP model provides an accurate reproducible
      method to evaluate fibrosis in NAFLD along a quantitative and continuous scale.

AB  - Hepatic metastases are amenable to ablation; however, many patients are not
      suitable candidates for such therapy and recurrence is common. The tumor
      microenvironment is known to be essential for metastatic growth, yet
      identification of plausible targets for cancer therapy in the microenvironment
      has proven elusive. We found that human colorectal cancer liver metastases and
      murine gastrointestinal experimental liver metastases are infiltrated by
      neutrophils. Plasticity in neutrophils has recently been shown to lead to both
      protumor and antitumor effects. Here, neutrophils promoted the growth of hepatic 
      metastases, given that depletion of neutrophils in already established,
      experimental, murine liver metastases led to diminished metastatic growth.
      Decreased growth was associated with reductions in vascular density and branching
      suggestive of vessel normalization. Metastasis-associated neutrophils expressed
      substantially more fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) than naive neutrophils,
      indicating neutrophil polarization by the tumor microenvironment. Administration 
      of FGF2 neutralizing antibody to mice bearing experimental liver metastases
      phenocopied neutrophil depletion by reducing liver metastatic colony growth,
      vascular density, and branching. CONCLUSION: Here, we show, using FGF2 as an
      example, that identification of factors responsible for the protumoral effects of
      infiltrating myeloid cells can be used to target established liver metastases.
      Such therapies could be utilized to limit disease progression and potentiate the 
      effects of standard ablative therapies. (Hepatology 2017;65:1920-1935).

TI  - The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 in bile-acid-induced cholangiocyte
      proliferation and cholestasis-induced liver injury in mice.
PG  - 2005-2018
LID - 10.1002/hep.29076 [doi]
AB  - Bile duct obstruction is a potent stimulus for cholangiocyte proliferation,
      especially for large cholangiocytes. Our previous studies reported that
      conjugated bile acids (CBAs) activate the protein kinase B (AKT) and
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways through
      sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) 2 in hepatocytes and cholangiocarcinoma
      cells. It also has been reported that taurocholate (TCA) promotes large
      cholangiocyte proliferation and protects cholangiocytes from bile duct ligation
      (BDL)-induced apoptosis. However, the role of S1PR2 in bile-acid-mediated
      cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestatic liver injury has not been elucidated.
      Here, we report that S1PR2 is the predominant S1PR expressed in cholangiocytes.
      Both TCA- and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT 
      were inhibited by JTE-013, a specific antagonist of S1PR2, in cholangiocytes. In 
      addition, TCA- and S1P-induced cell proliferation and migration were inhibited by
      JTE-013 and a specific short hairpin RNA of S1PR2, as well as chemical inhibitors
      of ERK1/2 and AKT in mouse cholangiocytes. In BDL mice, expression of S1PR2 was
      up-regulated in whole liver and cholangiocytes. S1PR2 deficiency significantly
      reduced BDL-induced cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestatic injury, as
      indicated by significant reductions in inflammation and liver fibrosis in S1PR2
      knockout mice. Treatment of BDL mice with JTE-013 significantly reduced total
      bile acid levels in serum and cholestatic liver injury. CONCLUSION: This study
      suggests that CBA-induced activation of S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways plays a
      critical role in obstructive cholestasis and may represent a novel therapeutic
      target for cholestatic liver diseases. (Hepatology 2017;65:2005-2018).

TI  - The Linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex acts as a liver tumor suppressor and 
      inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatitis.
PG  - 1963-1978
LID - 10.1002/hep.29074 [doi]
AB  - Linear ubiquitination is a key posttranslational modification that regulates
      immune signaling and cell death pathways, notably tumor necrosis factor receptor 
      1 (TNFR1) signaling. The only known enzyme complex capable of forming linear
      ubiquitin chains under native conditions to date is the linear ubiquitin chain
      assembly complex, of which the catalytic core component is heme-oxidized iron
      regulatory protein 2 ubiquitin ligase-1-interacting protein (HOIP). To understand
      the underlying mechanisms of maintenance of liver homeostasis and the role of
      linear ubiquitination specifically in liver parenchymal cells, we investigated
      the physiological role of HOIP in the liver parenchyma. To do so, we created mice
      harboring liver parenchymal cell-specific deletion of HOIP (Hoip(Deltahep) mice) 
      by crossing Hoip-floxed mice with albumin-Cre mice. HOIP deficiency in liver
      parenchymal cells triggered tumorigenesis at 18 months of age preceded by
      spontaneous hepatocyte apoptosis and liver inflammation within the first month of
      life. In line with the emergence of inflammation, Hoip(Deltahep) mice displayed
      enhanced liver regeneration and DNA damage. In addition, consistent with
      increased apoptosis, HOIP-deficient hepatocytes showed enhanced caspase
      activation and endogenous formation of a death-inducing signaling complex which
      activated caspase-8. Unexpectedly, exacerbated caspase activation and apoptosis
      were not dependent on TNFR1, whereas ensuing liver inflammation and tumorigenesis
      were promoted by TNFR1 signaling. CONCLUSION: The linear ubiquitin chain assembly
      complex serves as a previously undescribed tumor suppressor in the liver,
      restraining TNFR1-independent apoptosis in hepatocytes which, in its absence, is 
      causative of TNFR1-mediated inflammation, resulting in hepatocarcinogenesis.

AB  - Activated mast cells (MCs) release histamine (HA) and MCs infiltrate the liver
      following bile duct ligation (BDL), increasing intrahepatic bile duct mass (IBDM)
      and fibrosis. We evaluated the effects of BDL in MC-deficient (Kit(W-sh) ) mice. 
      Wild-type (WT) and Kit(W-sh) mice were subjected to sham or BDL for up to 7 days 
      and Kit(W-sh) mice were injected with cultured mast cells or 1x
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before collecting serum, liver, and
      cholangiocytes. Liver damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and alanine
      aminotransferase levels. IBDM was detected by cytokeratin-19 expression and
      proliferation by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fibrosis was detected by IHC, 
      hydroxyproline content, and by qPCR for fibrotic markers. Hepatic stellate cell
      (HSC) activation and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1)
      expression/secretion were evaluated. Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and histamine 
      receptor (HR) expression were detected by qPCR and HA secretion by enzymatic
      immunoassay. To evaluate vascular cells, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C expression were measured. In vitro, cultured
      HSCs were stimulated with cholangiocyte supernatants and alpha-smooth muscle
      actin levels were measured. BDL-induced liver damage was reduced in BDL Kit(W-sh)
      mice, whereas injection of MCs did not mimic BDL-induced damage. In BDL Kit(W-sh)
      mice, IBDM, proliferation, HSC activation/fibrosis, and TGF-beta1
      expression/secretion were decreased. The HDC/HA/HR axis was ablated in sham and
      BDL Kit(W-sh) mice. vWF and VEGF-C expression decreased in BDL Kit(W-sh) mice. In
      Kit(W-sh) mice injected with MCs, IBDM, proliferation, fibrosis, and vascular
      cell activation increased. Stimulation with cholangiocyte supernatants from BDL
      WT or Kit(W-sh) mice injected with MCs increased HSC activation, which decreased 
      with supernatants from BDL Kit(W-sh) mice. CONCLUSION: MCs promote hyperplasia,
      fibrosis, and vascular cell activation. Knockout of MCs decreases BDL-induced
      damage. Modulation of MCs may be important in developing therapeutics for
      cholangiopathies. (Hepatology 2017;65:1991-2004).

TI  - The membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 variant rs641738
      increases inflammation and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 1840-1850
LID - 10.1002/hep.29064 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is characterized by hepatic inflammation that promotes 
      progression to cirrhosis and predisposes to the development of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). Subtle interindividual genetic variation as well as viral and
      environmental factors interact to determine disease progression between
      individuals. Recently, the rs641738 membrane-bound O-acyltransferase
      domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) polymorphism was demonstrated to influence
      histological liver damage in alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease, and hepatitis C, but no data are available for CHB. We evaluated
      rs641738 influence on disease severity in a cohort of 1,101 patients with CHB.
      Forty-two patients underwent gene expression analysis to assess the functional
      consequences of rs641738 on hepatic MBOAT7 expression. The minor allele (T) of
      rs641738 was associated with greater inflammation (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.95; P = 0.001) and fibrosis (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 
      1.19-1.92; P = 0.01). Risk allele frequency in whites (0.43) was greater than in 
      Chinese (0.24), translating to a larger size effect in the former. The rs641738
      (T) allele was associated with lower hepatic MBOAT7 expression (P = 0.008), and
      the latter was associated with serum liver enzymes and inflammation. Neither
      patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 rs738409 nor transmembrane
      6 superfamily member 2 rs58542926 polymorphisms influenced disease severity.
      CONCLUSION: In patients with CHB, MBOAT7 rs641738 influences hepatic inflammation
      and fibrosis stage. (Hepatology 2017;65:1840-1850).

TI  - Activation of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 by human
      chorionic gonadotropin exerts a therapeutic effect on hepatic injury and
      inflammation.
PG  - 2074-2089
LID - 10.1002/hep.29072 [doi]
AB  - Incidence and prevalence of inflammatory liver diseases has increased over the
      last years, but therapeutic options are limited. Pregnancy induces a state of
      immune tolerance, which can result in spontaneous improvement of clinical
      symptoms of certain autoimmune diseases including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). We 
      investigated the immune-suppressive mechanisms of the human pregnancy hormone,
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in the liver. hCG signaling activates silent mating
      type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), which deacetylates forkhead box 
      o3 (FOXO3a), leading to repression of proapoptotic gene expression, because the
      immunosuppressive consequence attributed to the absence of caspase-3 activity of 
      hepatocellular interleukin 16 (IL-16) is no longer processed and released. Thus, 
      serum levels of IL-16, a key chemotactic factor for CD4(+) lymphocytes, were
      reduced and migration to injured hepatocytes prevented. Furthermore, elevated
      IL-16 levels are found in the sera from patients with AIH, hepatitis B virus,
      hepatitis C virus, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. CONCLUSION: Here, we report 
      that hCG regulates the SIRT1/FOXO3a axis in hepatocytes, resulting in immune
      suppression by attenuating caspase-3-dependent IL-16 processing and release,
      which concomitantly prevents autoaggressive T-cell infiltration of the liver.
      Considering the low toxicity profile of hCG in humans, interrupting the
      inflammatory cycle by hCG opens new perspectives for therapeutic intervention of 
      inflammatory liver diseases. (Hepatology 2017;65:2074-2089).

      frontier in the epidemic.
PG  - 2100-2109
LID - 10.1002/hep.29068 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant health burden in
      adolescents and young adults (AYAs) which has substantially risen in prevalence
      over the last decades. The occurrence of NAFLD parallels high rates of obesity
      and metabolic syndrome in this age group, with unhealthy lifestyle also playing
      an independent role. Genetic factors, sex, and ethnicity should be considered in 
      a risk stratification model. NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in
      AYAs often go unrecognized and, if untreated, can progress eventually to
      cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation (LT) before the age of 40. Recently,
      NASH has increased as an indication for LT in this age group. Important knowledge
      gaps include the feasibility of noninvasive diagnostic tests and imaging
      modalities as well as uncertainty about unique histological features and their
      predictive value. Future clinical trials focused on AYAs are needed to determine 
      effectiveness of therapies. Tools for increasing awareness and prevention of
      NAFLD in AYAs are greatly needed. (Hepatology 2017;65:2100-2109).

      critical review.
PG  - 2090-2099
LID - 10.1002/hep.29055 [doi]
AB  - Moderate alcohol consumption in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) is common, yet the effects on cardiovascular and liver health are
      unclear. Moderate alcohol use is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and
      decreased cardiovascular mortality in the general population, but whether similar
      benefits would be observed in persons with NAFLD remains largely unstudied. There
      is significant overlap in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and
      NAFLD, although studies of ALD have focused on pathological alcohol intake and
      few mechanistic studies of moderate alcohol use in NAFLD exist. We undertook a
      critical review of the effect of moderate alcohol use on cardiovascular and liver
      disease in patients with NAFLD. A total of seven observational studies met the
      criteria for inclusion (one for cardiovascular endpoints and six for liver
      endpoints). Insufficient studies have assessed the association of moderate
      alcohol use with cardiovascular outcomes. There was a positive association
      between moderate alcohol use and decreased NASH and fibrosis; however, heavy
      episodic drinking may accelerate fibrosis progression and moderate alcohol use
      may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced
      fibrosis. Significant methodological limitations were present, including
      incomplete adjustment for confounding factors and failure to measure lifetime use
      or the pattern of alcohol intake. Thus, a strong recommendation of benefit of
      moderate alcohol use in NAFLD cannot be made. There remains a need for additional
      high-quality longitudinal studies that evaluate both cardiovascular and liver
      outcomes among NAFLD patients with moderate or lesser degrees of alcohol use.

TI  - The PNPLA3 I148M variant modulates the fibrogenic phenotype of human hepatic
      stellate cells.
PG  - 1875-1890
LID - 10.1002/hep.29041 [doi]
AB  - The genetic polymorphism I148M of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 
      (PNPLA3) is robustly associated with hepatic steatosis and its progression to
      steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cancer. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are key
      players in the development of liver fibrosis, but the role of PNPLA3 and its
      variant I148M in this process is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the
      expression of PNPLA3 during human HSC activation and thereby explored how a
      PNPLA3 variant impacts hepatic fibrogenesis. We show that expression of PNPLA3
      gene and protein increases during the early phases of activation and remains
      elevated in fully activated HSCs (P < 0.01). Knockdown of PNPLA3 significantly
      decreases the profibrogenic protein alpha-smooth muscle actin (P < 0.05). Primary
      human I148M HSCs displayed significantly higher expression and release of
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (P < 0.01) and 
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (P < 0.001), thus contributing
      to migration of immune cells (P < 0.05). Primary I148M HSCs showed reduced
      retinol (P < 0.001) but higher lipid droplet content (P < 0.001). In line with
      this, LX-2 cells stably overexpressing I148M showed augmented proliferation and
      migration, lower retinol, and abolished retinoid X receptor/retinoid A receptor
      transcriptional activities but more lipid droplets. Knockdown of I148M PNPLA3 (P 
      < 0.001) also reduces chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 and collagen1alpha1
      expression (P < 0.05). Notably, I148M cells display reduced peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcriptional activity, and this effect
      was attributed to increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase, thereby inhibiting
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma through serine 84
      phosphorylation and promoting activator protein 1 transcription. Conversely, the 
      c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 and the peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone decreased activator
      protein 1 promoter activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that PNPLA3 is
      required for HSC activation and that its genetic variant I148M potentiates the
      profibrogenic features of HSCs, providing a molecular mechanism for the higher
      risk of progression and severity of liver diseases conferred to patients carrying
      the I148M variant. (Hepatology 2017;65:1875-1890).

TI  - Activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway aggravates proteotoxicity of
      hepatic mutant Z alpha1-antitrypsin.
PG  - 1865-1874
LID - 10.1002/hep.29035 [doi]
AB  - Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that can affect both the lung 
      and the liver. The vast majority of patients harbor a mutation in the serine
      protease inhibitor 1A (SERPINA1) gene leading to a single amino acid substitution
      that results in an unfolded protein that is prone to polymerization.
      Alpha1-antitrypsin defciency-related liver disease is therefore caused by a
      gain-of-function mechanism due to accumulation of the mutant Z alpha1-antitrypsin
      (ATZ) and is a key example of an disease mechanism induced by protein toxicity.
      Intracellular retention of ATZ triggers a complex injury cascade including
      apoptosis and other mechanisms, although several aspects of the disease
      pathogenesis are still unclear. We show that ATZ induces activation of c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun and that genetic ablation of JNK1 or JNK2
      decreased ATZ levels in vivo by reducing c-Jun-mediated SERPINA1 gene expression.
      JNK activation was confirmed in livers of patients homozygous for the Z allele,
      with severe liver disease requiring hepatic transplantation. Treatment of
      patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-hepatic cells with a JNK inhibitor 
      reduced accumulation of ATZ. CONCLUSION: These data reveal that JNK is a key
      pathway in the disease pathogenesis and add new therapeutic entry points for
      liver disease caused by ATZ. (Hepatology 2017;65:1865-1874).

TI  - Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor promotes tumor growth in hepatocellular
      carcinoma.
PG  - 1948-1962
LID - 10.1002/hep.29036 [doi]
AB  - Deregulation of the immune system is believed to contribute to cancer malignancy,
      which has led to recent therapeutic breakthroughs facilitating antitumor
      immunity. In a malignant setting, immunoglobulin receptors, which are fundamental
      components of the human immune system, fulfill paradoxical roles in cancer
      pathogenesis. This study describes a previously unrecognized pro-oncogenic
      function of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in the promotion of cell
      transformation and proliferation. Mechanistically, pIgR overexpression is
      associated with YES proto-oncogene 1, Src family tyrosine kinase (Yes)
      activation, which is required for pIgR-induced oncogenic growth. Specifically,
      pIgR activates the Yes-DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa-spleen tyrosine
      kinase-Rac1/CDC42-MEK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase)/ERK
      (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade in an immunoreceptor
      tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM)-dependent manner to promote cell
      transformation and tumor growth, although pIgR itself does not contain an ITAM
      sequence. Additionally, the combination of pIgR and phosphorylated Yes (p-Yes)
      levels serves as a prognostic biomarker for hepatitis B surface antigen-positive 
      and early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Moreover,
      pharmacological targeting of MEK/ERK or Yes represents a therapeutic option for
      the subgroup of patients with pIgR/p-Yes-positive HCC based on our results with
      both cancer cell-line-based xenografts and primary patient-derived xenografts.
      CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which pIgR promotes
      cancer malignancy, suggest the clinical potential of targeting this pathway in
      HCC, and provide new insight into the oncogenic role of immunoglobulin receptors.

TI  - Inhibition of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway suppresses
      hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing inflammation in mice.

AB  - Obesity is a critical risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it
      remains unknown whether inhibition of de novo lipid biosynthesis can suppress
      HCC. In this study, we blocked the sterol regulatory element-binding protein
      (SREBP) pathway, one of the key determinants of lipid homeostasis, by ablating
      78-kDa cell-surface glycoprotein or SREBP cleavage-activating protein in
      hepatocytes, as well as by administering a chemical compound called betulin. We
      found that either genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting the SREBP pathway
      dramatically reduced diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC progression by
      down-regulating tumor-promoting cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1beta. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of de novo lipid
      biosynthesis by suppressing the SREBP pathway prevents HCC. This study identifies
      a previously underappreciated role of the SREBP pathway in HCC and suggests a
      novel metabolic strategy to control liver cancer. (Hepatology 2017;65:1936-1947).

TI  - Increased risk of mortality by fibrosis stage in nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1557-1565
LID - 10.1002/hep.29085 [doi]
AB  - Liver fibrosis is the most important predictor of mortality in nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD). Quantitative risk of mortality by fibrosis stage has not
      been systematically evaluated. We aimed to quantify the fibrosis stage-specific
      risk of all-cause and liver-related mortality in NAFLD. Through a systematic
      review and meta-analysis, we identified five adult NAFLD cohort studies reporting
      fibrosis stage-specific mortality (0-4). Using fibrosis stage 0 as a reference
      population, fibrosis stage-specific mortality rate ratios (MRRs) with 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause and liver-related mortality were
      estimated. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Included were 1,495 NAFLD
      patients with 17,452 patient years of follow-up. Compared to NAFLD patients with 
      no fibrosis (stage 0), NAFLD patients with fibrosis were at an increased risk for
      all-cause mortality, and this risk increased with increases in the stage of
      fibrosis: stage 1, MRR = 1.58 (95% CI 1.19-2.11); stage 2, MRR = 2.52 (95% CI
      1.85-3.42); stage 3, MRR = 3.48 (95% CI 2.51-4.83); and stage 4, MRR = 6.40 (95% 
      CI 4.11-9.95). The results were more pronounced as the risk of liver-related
      mortality increased exponentially with each increase in the stage of fibrosis:
      stage 1, MRR = 1.41 (95% CI 0.17-11.95); stage 2, MRR = 9.57 (95% CI 1.67-54.93);
      stage 3, MRR = 16.69 (95% CI 2.92-95.36); and stage 4, MRR = 42.30 (95% CI
      3.51-510.34). Limitations of the study include an inability to adjust for
      comorbid conditions or demographics known to impact fibrosis progression in NAFLD
      and the inclusion of patients with simple steatosis and nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis without fibrosis in the reference comparison group. CONCLUSION:
      The risk of liver-related mortality increases exponentially with increase in
      fibrosis stage; these data have important implications in assessing the utility
      of each stage and benefits of regression of fibrosis from one stage to another.

      variceal rebleeding improves survival in cirrhosis.

AB  - Monitoring the hemodynamic response of portal pressure (PP) to drug therapy
      accurately stratifies the risk of variceal rebleeding (VRB). We assessed whether 
      guiding therapy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring may
      improve survival by preventing VRB. Patients with cirrhosis with controlled
      variceal bleeding were randomized to an HVPG-guided therapy group (N = 84) or to 
      a control group (N = 86). In both groups, HVPG and acute beta-blocker response
      were evaluated at baseline and HVPG measurements were repeated at 2-4 weeks to
      determine chronic response. In the HVPG-guided group, acute responders were
      treated with nadolol and acute nonresponders with nadolol+nitrates. Chronic
      nonresponders received nadolol+prazosin and had a third HVPG study. Ligation
      sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated
      with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were
      similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in
      the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard
      ratio [HR] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-0.99). Rebleeding occurred
      in 19% versus 31% of patients, respectively (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.29-0.98), and 
      further decompensation of cirrhosis occurred in 52% versus 72% (HR = 0.68; 95% CI
      = 0.46-0.99). The survival probability was higher with HVPG-guided therapy than
      in controls, both in acute (HR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.32-1.08) and chronic
      nonresponders (HR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.23-0.99). HVPG-guided patients had a greater
      reduction of HVPG and a lower final value than controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      HVPG monitoring, by stratifying risk and targeting therapy, improves the survival
      achieved with currently recommended treatment to prevent VRB using beta-blockers 
      and ligation. HVPG-guided therapy achieved a greater reduction in PP, which may
      have contributed to reduce the risk of rebleeding and of further decompensation
      of cirrhosis, thus contributing to a better survival. (Hepatology

      biliary cholangitis.

AB  - The identification of environmental factors that lead to loss of tolerance has
      been coined the holy grail of autoimmunity. Our work has focused on the
      reactivity of antimitochondrial autoantibodies (AMA) to chemical xenobiotics and 
      has hypothesized that a modified peptide within PDC-E2, the major mitochondrial
      autoantigen, will have been immunologically recognized at the time of loss of
      tolerance. Herein, we successfully applied intein technology to construct a
      PDC-E2 protein fragment containing amino acid residues 177-314 of PDC-E2 by
      joining a recombinant peptide spanning residues 177-252 (PDC-228) with a
      62-residue synthetic peptide from 253 to 314 (PP), which encompasses PDC-E2 inner
      lipoyl domain (ILD). We named this intein-constructed fragment PPL. Importantly, 
      PPL, as well as lipoic acid conjugated PPL (LA-PPL) and xenobiotic 2-octynoic
      acid conjugated PPL (2OA-PPL), are recognized by AMA. Of great importance, AMA
      has specificity for the 2OA-modified PDC-E2 ILD peptide backbone distinct from
      antibodies that react with native lipoylated PDC-E2 peptide. Interestingly, this 
      unique AMA subfraction is of the immunoglobulin M isotype and more dominant in
      early-stage primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), suggesting that exposure to
      2OA-PPL-like compounds occurs early in the generation of AMA. To understand the
      structural basis of this differential recognition, we analyzed PPL, LA-PPL, and
      2OA-PPL using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, with confirmations by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, and affinity antibody
      analysis. We demonstrate that the conformation of PDC-E2 ILD is altered when
      conjugated with 2OA, compared to conjugation with lipoic acid. CONCLUSION: A
      molecular understanding of the conformation of xenobiotic-modified PDC-E2 is
      critical for understanding xenobiotic modification and loss of tolerance in PBC
      with widespread implications for a role of environmental chemicals in the
      induction of autoimmunity. (Hepatology 2017;65:1670-1682).

TI  - Nonstructural protein 5B promotes degradation of the NORE1A tumor suppressor to
      facilitate hepatitis C virus replication.
PG  - 1462-1477
LID - 10.1002/hep.29049 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common risk factor for the development of 
      liver cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are only partially 
      understood. Here, we show that the HCV protein, nonstructural protein (NS) 5B,
      directly binds to the tumor suppressor, NORE1A (RASSF5), and promotes its
      proteosomal degradation. In addition, we show that NORE1A colocalizes to sites of
      HCV viral replication and suppresses the replication process. Thus, NORE1A has
      antiviral activity, which is specifically antagonized by NS5B. Moreover, the
      suppression of NORE1A protein levels correlated almost perfectly with elevation
      of Ras activity in primary human samples. Therefore, NORE1A inactivation by NS5B 
      may be essential for maximal HCV replication and may make a major contribution to
      HCV-induced liver cancer by shifting Ras signaling away from
      prosenescent/proapoptotic signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: HCV uses NS5B to
      specifically suppress NORE1A, facilitating viral replication and elevated Ras
      signaling. (Hepatology 2017;65:1462-1477).

TI  - Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) plays an essential role in
      hepatitis C virus infection-induced interferon responses.
PG  - 1478-1491
LID - 10.1002/hep.29050 [doi]
AB  - Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors are cytosolic pattern
      recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect non-self-RNA and activate downstream
      interferon (IFN) signaling. One of the RIG-I-like receptors, laboratory of
      genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), was originally thought to be a negative
      feedback regulator in the RIG-I signaling pathway, but growing evidence indicates
      that LGP2 is one cofactor of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)
      in MDA5-mediated IFN signaling activation. Our previous work showed that MDA5 was
      the major PRR to sense hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in hepatocytes, but the 
      role of LGP2 in HCV infection-induced IFN signaling has not been elucidated. In
      this study, we reported that LGP2 was a positive regulator of HCV
      infection-induced IFN signaling. Knockout of LGP2 in hepatocytes significantly
      diminished IFN production in response to HCV infection, but not to HCV
      3'untranslated region RNA transfection. Mechanistic studies showed that LGP2
      exerted its function at a step upstream of MDA5 in the IFN signaling. HCV
      infection promoted the molecular interaction between LGP2 and MDA5, which, in
      turn, enhanced MDA5/HCV RNA association. Finally, we demonstrated that the ATPase
      activity of LGP2 was critical for assisting MDA5/HCV RNA interaction and
      activating IFN signaling during HCV infection. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrated 
      that LGP2 plays an essential role in activating IFN signaling against HCV
      infection by promoting MDA5 recognition of HCV pathogen-associated molecular
      patterns. (Hepatology 2017;65:1478-1491).

TI  - An endoplasmic reticulum protein, Nogo-B, facilitates alcoholic liver disease
      through regulation of kupffer cell polarization.
PG  - 1720-1734
LID - 10.1002/hep.29051 [doi]
AB  - Nogo-B (Reticulon 4B) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein that
      regulates ER structure and function. Because ER stress is known to induce M2
      macrophage polarization, we examined whether Nogo-B regulates M1/M2 polarization 
      of Kupffer cells and alters the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). M1
      and M2 phenotypes were assessed in relation to Nogo-B expression and disease
      severity in liver specimens from ALD patients (NCT01875211). Liver specimens from
      wild-type (WT) and Nogo-B knockout (KO) mice fed a control or Lieber-DeCarli
      ethanol liquid diet (5% ethanol) for 6 weeks were analyzed for liver injury and
      steatosis. Kupffer cells isolated from WT and Nogo-B KO mice were assessed for M1
      and M2 activation. A significant positive correlation was observed between Nogo-B
      positive Kupffer cells and disease severity in ALD patients (n = 30, r = 0.66, P 
      = 0.048). Furthermore, Nogo-B-positive Kupffer cells were correlated with M1
      activation (inducible nitric oxide synthase) (r = 0.50, P = 0.05) and negatively 
      with markers of M2 status (CD163) (r = -0.48, P = 0.07) in these patients. WT
      mice exhibited significantly increased liver injury (P < 0.05) and higher hepatic
      triglyceride levels (P < 0.01) compared with Nogo-B KO mice in response to
      chronic ethanol feeding. Nogo-B in Kupffer cells promoted M1 polarization,
      whereas absence of Nogo-B increased ER stress and M2 polarization in Kupffer
      cells. CONCLUSION: Nogo-B is permissive of M1 polarization of Kupffer cells,
      thereby accentuating liver injury in ALD in humans and mice. Nogo-B in Kupffer
      cells may represent a new therapeutic target for ALD. (Hepatology

AB  - The migration from legacy fee-for-service reimbursement to payments linked to
      high-value health care is accelerating in the United States because of new
      legislation and redesign of payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
      Services. Because patients with chronic diseases account for substantial use of
      health care resources, payers and health systems are focusing on maximizing the
      value of care for these patients. Because chronic liver diseases impose a major
      health burden worldwide affecting the health and lives of many individuals and
      families as well as substantial costs for individuals and payers, hepatologists
      must understand how they can improve their practices. Hepatologists practice a
      high-intensity cognitive subspecialty, using complex and costly procedures and
      medications. High-value patient care requires multidisciplinary coordination,
      labor-intensive support for critically ill patients, and effective chronic
      disease management. Under current fee-for-service reimbursement, patient values, 
      medical success, and financial success can all be misaligned. Many current
      attempts to link health outcomes to reimbursement are based on compliance with
      process measures, with less emphasis on outcomes that matter most to patients,
      thus slowing transformation to higher-value team-based care. Outcome measures
      that reflect the entire cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and
      administrators in improving the quality and value of care. A comprehensive set of
      outcome measures for liver diseases is not currently available. Numerous
      researchers now are attempting to fill this gap by devising and testing outcome
      indicators and patient-reported outcomes for the major liver conditions. These
      indicators will provide tools to implement a value-based approach for patients
      with chronic liver diseases to compare results and value of care between referral
      centers, to perform health technology assessment, and to guide decision-making
      processes for health authorities. This review sets the groundwork for
      implementing a value-based, patient-centered approach to chronic liver diseases
      within a health system. (Hepatology 2017;65:1749-1755).

TI  - Shp2 promotes liver cancer stem cell expansion by augmenting beta-catenin
      signaling and predicts chemotherapeutic response of patients.
PG  - 1566-1580
LID - 10.1002/hep.28919 [doi]
AB  - Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp2) has been reported to play
      an important role in the maintenance and self-renewal of embryonic and adult stem
      cells, but its role in cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains obscure. Herein, we
      observed high expression of Shp2 in both chemoresistant hepatocellular carcinomas
      (HCCs) and recurrent HCCs from patients. A remarkable increase of Shp2 was
      detected in sorted epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive or cluster of
      differentiation 133-positive liver CSCs and in CSC-enriched hepatoma spheroids
      from patients. Up-regulated Shp2 facilitated liver CSC expansion by promoting the
      dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells and enhancing the self-renewal of liver CSCs.
      Mechanistically, Shp2 dephosphorylated cell division cycle 73 in the cytosol of
      hepatoma cells, and the dephosphorylated cell division cycle 73 bound
      beta-catenin and facilitated the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, which
      promoted the dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells. Shp2 increased beta-catenin
      accumulation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-mediated beta-catenin
      degradation in liver CSCs, thereby enhancing the self-renewal of liver CSCs.
      Blockage of beta-catenin abolished the discrepancy in liver CSC proportion and
      the self-renewal capacity between Shp2-depleted hepatoma cells and control cells,
      which further confirmed that beta-catenin is required in Shp2-promoted liver CSC 
      expansion. More importantly, HCC patients with low Shp2 levels benefited from
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization or sorafenib treatment, but patients
      with high Shp2 expression did not, indicating the significance of Shp2 in
      personalized HCC therapy. CONCLUSION: Shp2 could promote HCC cell
      dedifferentiation and liver CSC expansion by amplifying beta-catenin signaling
      and may be useful in predicting patient response to chemotherapeutics.

TI  - TM6SF2 rs58542926 impacts lipid processing in liver and small intestine.
PG  - 1526-1542
LID - 10.1002/hep.29021 [doi]
AB  - The transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) loss-of-function variant
      rs58542926 is a genetic risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and
      progression to fibrosis but is paradoxically associated with lower levels of
      hepatically derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. TM6SF2 is expressed
      predominantly in liver and small intestine, sites for triglyceride-rich
      lipoprotein biogenesis and export. In light of this, we hypothesized that TM6SF2 
      may exhibit analogous effects on both liver and intestine lipid homeostasis. To
      test this, we genotyped rs58542926 in 983 bariatric surgery patients from the
      Geisinger Medical Center for Nutrition and Weight Management, Geisinger Health
      System, in Pennsylvania and from 3,556 study participants enrolled in the Amish
      Complex Disease Research Program. Although these two cohorts have different
      metabolic profiles, carriers in both cohorts had improved fasting lipid profiles.
      Importantly, following a high-fat challenge, carriers in the Amish Complex
      Disease Research Program cohort exhibited significantly lower postprandial serum 
      triglycerides, suggestive of a role for TM6SF2 in the small intestine. To gain
      further insight into this putative role, effects of TM6SF2 deficiency were
      studied in a zebrafish model and in cultured human Caco-2 enterocytes. In both
      systems TM6SF2 deficiency resulted in defects in small intestine metabolism in
      response to dietary lipids, including significantly increased lipid accumulation,
      decreased lipid clearance, and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress.
      CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support a role of TM6SF2 in the regulation of
      postprandial lipemia, potentially through a similar function for TM6SF2 in the
      lipidation and/or export of both hepatically and intestinally derived
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. (Hepatology 2017;65:1526-1542).

      cell transplantation: A prospective study.
PG  - 1451-1461
LID - 10.1002/hep.29022 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg)-negative, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc)-positive
      patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not 
      been prospectively studied. HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients with
      undetectable HBV DNA undergoing allogeneic HSCT were prospectively monitored
      every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was HBV reactivation, defined as detectable
      HBV DNA (>/=10 IU/mL). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, HBsAg
      positivity, and changes in liver biochemistry and antibody to HBsAg levels. Among
      297 allogeneic HSCT recipients, 85 (28.7%) were HBsAg-negative,
      anti-HBc-positive, of whom 62 were recruited and monitored for a median of 48
      (4-104) weeks. The 2-year cumulative HBV DNA detectability rate was 40.8%,
      occurring at a median of 44 (8-100) weeks. Multivariate analysis showed that age 
      >/=50 years (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 8.2) and chronic graft-versus-host disease
      (P = 0.010, hazard ratio = 5.3) were significantly associated with HBV
      reactivation. Other clinical parameters, including baseline antibody to HBsAg
      status, serial changes in antibody to HBsAg levels, and donor serology, were not 
      associated with HBV reactivation. Patients <50 years old and without chronic
      graft-versus-host disease, compared with the remaining patient cohort, had a
      significantly lower 2-year cumulative HBV reactivation rate (5.6% versus 65.0%, P
      = 0.004). Entecavir successfully suppressed HBV DNA to undetectable levels, with 
      no cases developing biochemical hepatitis. CONCLUSION: HBsAg-negative,
      anti-HBc-positive patients had a high rate of HBV reactivation after allogeneic
      HSCT, with determinants of HBV reactivation including age >/=50 years and chronic
      graft-versus-host disease; treatment strategies based on these parameters may
      prevent HBV reactivation and subsequent complications. (ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of nontransplant surgery for pediatric cholestasis, 58
      clinically diagnosed children, including 20 with Alagille syndrome (ALGS), 16
      with familial intrahepatic cholestasis-1 (FIC1), 18 with bile salt export pump
      (BSEP) disease, and 4 others with low gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase disease
      (levels <100 U/L), were identified across 14 Childhood Liver Disease Research
      Network (ChiLDReN) centers. Data were collected retrospectively from individuals 
      who collectively had 39 partial external biliary diversions (PEBDs), 11 ileal
      exclusions (IEs), and seven gallbladder-to-colon (GBC) diversions. Serum total
      bilirubin decreased after PEBD in FIC1 (8.1 +/- 4.0 vs. 2.9 +/- 4.1 mg/dL,
      preoperatively vs. 12-24 months postoperatively, respectively; P = 0.02), but not
      in ALGS or BSEP. Total serum cholesterol decreased after PEBD in ALGS patients
      (695 +/- 465 vs. 457 +/- 319 mg/dL, preoperatively vs. 12-24 months
      postoperatively, respectively; P = 0.0001). Alanine aminotransferase levels
      increased in ALGS after PEBD (182 +/- 70 vs. 260 +/- 73 IU/L, preoperatively vs. 
      24 months; P = 0.03), but not in FIC1 or BSEP. ALGS, FIC1, and BSEP patients
      experienced less severely scored pruritus after PEBD (ALGS, 100% vs. 9% severe;
      FIC1, 64% vs. 10%; BSEP, 50% vs. 20%, preoperatively vs. >24 months
      postoperatively, respectively; P < 0.001). ALGS patients experienced a trend
      toward greater freedom from xanthomata after PEBD. There was a trend toward
      decreased pruritus in FIC1 after IE and GBC. Vitamin K supplementation increased 
      in ALGS after PEBD (33% vs. 77%; P = 0.03). Overall, there were 15 major
      complications after surgery. Twelve patients (3 ALGS, 3 FIC1, and 6 BSEP)
      subsequently underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: This was a multicenter 
      analysis of nontransplant surgical approaches to intrahepatic cholestasis.
      Approaches vary, are well tolerated, and generally, although not uniformly,
      result in improvement of pruritus and cholestasis. (Hepatology

TI  - Targeting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier attenuates fibrosis in a mouse model

AB  - Diseases of the liver related to metabolic syndrome have emerged as the most
      common and undertreated hepatic ailments. The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease is the aberrant accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes, though the
      mechanisms whereby this leads to hepatocyte dysfunction, death, and hepatic
      fibrosis are still unclear. Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones have shown
      efficacy in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but their widespread
      use is constrained by dose-limiting side effects thought to be due to activation 
      of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. We sought to determine
      whether a next-generation thiazolidinedione with markedly diminished ability to
      activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (MSDC-0602) would
      retain its efficacy for treating NASH in a rodent model. We also determined
      whether some or all of these beneficial effects would be mediated through an
      inhibitory interaction with the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (MPC2), which
      was recently identified as a mitochondrial binding site for thiazolidinediones,
      including MSDC-0602. We found that MSDC-0602 prevented and reversed liver
      fibrosis and suppressed expression of markers of stellate cell activation in
      livers of mice fed a diet rich in trans-fatty acids, fructose, and cholesterol.
      Moreover, mice with liver-specific deletion of MPC2 were protected from
      development of NASH on this diet. Finally, MSDC-0602 directly reduced hepatic
      stellate cell activation in vitro, and MSDC-0602 treatment or hepatocyte MPC2
      deletion also limited stellate cell activation indirectly by affecting secretion 
      of exosomes from hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data demonstrate
      the effectiveness of MSDC-0602 for attenuating NASH in a rodent model and suggest
      that targeting hepatic MPC2 may be an effective strategy for pharmacologic
      development. (Hepatology 2017;65:1543-1556).

TI  - Interleukin 6-dependent genomic instability heralds accelerated carcinogenesis
      following liver regeneration on a background of chronic hepatitis.
PG  - 1600-1611
LID - 10.1002/hep.29004 [doi]
AB  - Liver cancer, which typically develops on a background of chronic liver
      inflammation, is now the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. For 
      patients with liver cancer, surgical resection is a principal treatment modality 
      that offers a chance of prolonged survival. However, tumor recurrence after
      resection, the mechanisms of which remain obscure, markedly limits the long-term 
      survival of these patients. We have shown that partial hepatectomy in multidrug
      resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2(-/-) ) mice, a model of chronic
      inflammation-associated liver cancer, significantly accelerates
      hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we explore the postsurgical mechanisms that drive
      accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis in Mdr2(-/-) mice by perioperative
      pharmacological inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL6), which is a crucial liver
      regeneration priming cytokine. We demonstrate that inhibition of IL6 signaling
      dramatically impedes tumorigenesis following partial hepatectomy without
      compromising survival or liver mass recovery. IL6 blockade significantly
      inhibited hepatocyte cell cycle progression while promoting a hypertrophic
      regenerative response, without increasing apoptosis. Mdr2(-/-) mice contain
      hepatocytes with a notable persistent DNA damage response (gammaH2AX, 53BP1) due 
      to chronic inflammation. We show that liver regeneration in this microenvironment
      leads to a striking increase in hepatocytes bearing micronuclei, a marker of
      genomic instability, which is suppressed by IL6 blockade. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings indicate that genomic instability derived during the IL6-mediated liver 
      regenerative response within a milieu of chronic inflammation links partial
      hepatectomy to accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis; this suggests a new therapeutic 
      approach through the usage of an anti-IL6 treatment to extend the tumor-free
      survival of patients undergoing surgical resection. (Hepatology

TI  - Long noncoding RNA HULC modulates the phosphorylation of YB-1 through serving as 
      a scaffold of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and YB-1 to enhance
      hepatocarcinogenesis.
PG  - 1612-1627
LID - 10.1002/hep.29010 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulated expression of long noncoding RNAs has been reported in many types of
      cancers, indicating that it may play a critical role in tumorigenesis. The long
      noncoding RNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) was first characterized 
      in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the detailed mechanisms of HULC remain
      unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which long noncoding RNA plays
      oncogenic roles through modulating the phosphorylation status of its interaction 
      protein. First, we validated the markedly increased expression levels of HULC in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared to their adjacent noncancerous tissues.
      Furthermore, up-regulation of HULC was correlated with grading and overall
      survival. Meanwhile, HULC could promote cell proliferation, migration, and
      invasion in vitro and inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we show that
      HULC specifically binds to Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) protein both in vitro
      and in vivo. YB-1 is a major component of translationally inactive messenger
      ribonucleoprotein particles which keeps mRNA in a silent state. Our study further
      demonstrated that HULC could promote the phosphorylation of YB-1 protein, which
      leads to the release of YB-1 from its bound mRNA. As a consequence, translation
      of silenced oncogenic mRNAs would be activated, including cyclin D1, cyclin E1,
      and matrix metalloproteinase 3. In addition, we found that HULC promotes the
      phosphorylation of YB-1 protein mainly through extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that HULC promotes the phosphorylation of YB-1
      through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway, in turn regulates the 
      interaction of YB-1 with certain oncogenic mRNAs, and consequently accelerates
      the translation of these mRNAs in the process of tumorigenesis. (Hepatology

TI  - Human macrophage ferroportin biology and the basis for the ferroportin disease.
PG  - 1512-1525
LID - 10.1002/hep.29007 [doi]
AB  - Ferroportin (FPN1) is the sole iron exporter in mammals, but its cell-specific
      function and regulation are still elusive. This study examined FPN1 expression in
      human macrophages, the cells that are primarily responsible on a daily basis for 
      plasma iron turnover and are central in the pathogenesis of ferroportin disease
      (FD), the disease attributed to lack-of-function FPN1 mutations. We characterized
      FPN1 protein expression and traffic by confocal microscopy, western blotting, gel
      filtration, and immunoprecipitation studies in macrophages from control blood
      donors (donor) and patients with either FPN1 p.A77D, p.G80S, and p.Val162del
      lack-of-function or p.A69T gain-of-function mutations. We found that in normal
      macrophages, FPN1 cycles in the early endocytic compartment does not multimerize 
      and is promptly degraded by hepcidin (Hepc), its physiological inhibitor, within 
      3-6 hours. In FD macrophages, endogenous FPN1 showed a similar localization,
      except for greater accumulation in lysosomes. However, in contrast with previous 
      studies using overexpressed mutant protein in cell lines, FPN1 could still reach 
      the cell surface and be normally internalized and degraded upon exposure to Hepc.
      However, when FD macrophages were exposed to large amounts of heme iron, in
      contrast to donor and p.A69T macrophages, FPN1 could no longer reach the cell
      surface, leading to intracellular iron retention. CONCLUSION: FPN1 cycles as a
      monomer within the endocytic/plasma membrane compartment and responds to its
      physiological inhibitor, Hepc, in both control and FD cells. However, in FD, FPN1
      fails to reach the cell surface when cells undergo high iron turnover. Our
      findings provide a basis for the FD characterized by a preserved iron transfer in
      the enterocytes (i.e., cells with low iron turnover) and iron retention in cells 
      exposed to high iron flux, such as liver and spleen macrophages. (Hepatology

TI  - New classification of liver biopsy assessment for fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B
      patients before and after treatment.
PG  - 1438-1450
LID - 10.1002/hep.29009 [doi]
AB  - Liver fibrosis is the net result of dynamic changes between fibrogenesis and
      fibrolysis. Evidence has shown that antiviral therapy can reverse liver fibrosis 
      or even early cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B virus. However, current evaluation 
      systems mainly focus on the severity of, but not the dynamic changes in,
      fibrosis. Here, we propose a new classification to evaluate the dynamic changes
      in the quality of fibrosis, namely: predominantly progressive
      (thick/broad/loose/pale septa with inflammation); predominately regressive
      (delicate/thin/dense/splitting septa); and indeterminate, which displayed an
      overall balance between progressive and regressive scarring. Then, we used this
      classification to evaluate 71 paired liver biopsies of chronic hepatitis B
      patients before and after entecavir-based therapy for 78 weeks. Progressive,
      indeterminate, and regressive were observed in 58%, 29%, and 13% of patients
      before treatment versus in 11%, 11%, and 78% after treatment. Of the 55 patients 
      who showed predominantly regressive changes on posttreatment liver biopsy, 29
      cases (53%) had fibrosis improvement of at least one Ishak stage, and, more
      interestingly, 25 cases (45%) had significant improvement in terms of Laennec
      substage, collagen percentage area, and liver stiffness despite remaining in the 
      same Ishak stage. CONCLUSION: This new classification highlights the importance
      of assessing and identifying the dynamic changes in the quality of fibrosis,
      especially relevant in the era of antiviral therapy.(Hepatology
      2017;65:1438-1450).

AB  - Hereditary cholestasis in childhood and infancy with normal serum
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity is linked to several genes. Many
      patients, however, remain genetically undiagnosed. Defects in myosin VB (MYO5B;
      encoded by MYO5B) cause microvillus inclusion disease (MVID; MIM251850) with
      recurrent watery diarrhea. Cholestasis, reported as an atypical presentation in
      MVID, has been considered a side effect of parenteral alimentation. Here,
      however, we report on 10 patients who experienced cholestasis associated with
      biallelic, or suspected biallelic, mutations in MYO5B and who had neither
      recurrent diarrhea nor received parenteral alimentation. Seven of them are from
      two study cohorts, together comprising 31 undiagnosed low-GGT cholestasis
      patients; 3 are sporadic. Cholestasis in 2 patients was progressive, in 3
      recurrent, in 2 transient, and in 3 uncategorized because of insufficient
      follow-up. Liver biopsy specimens revealed giant-cell change of hepatocytes and
      intralobular cholestasis with abnormal distribution of bile salt export pump
      (BSEP) at canaliculi, as well as coarse granular dislocation of MYO5B. Mass
      spectrometry of plasma demonstrated increased total bile acids, primary bile
      acids, and conjugated bile acids, with decreased free bile acids, similar to
      changes in BSEP-deficient patients. Literature review revealed that patients with
      biallelic mutations predicted to eliminate MYO5B expression were more frequent in
      typical MVID than in isolated-cholestasis patients (11 of 38 vs. 0 of 13).
      CONCLUSION: MYO5B deficiency may underlie 20% of previously undiagnosed low-GGT
      cholestasis. MYO5B deficiency appears to impair targeting of BSEP to the
      canalicular membrane with hampered bile acid excretion, resulting in a spectrum
      of cholestasis without diarrhea. (Hepatology 2017;65:1655-1669).

TI  - Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) opposes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by 
      regulating AMP-activated protein kinase signaling in mice.
PG  - 1628-1644
LID - 10.1002/hep.29006 [doi]
AB  - Potential biomarkers that can be used to determine prognosis and perform targeted
      therapies are urgently needed to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). To meet this need, we performed a screen to identify functional genes
      associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis and its progression at the
      transcriptome and proteome levels. We identified aldehyde dedydrogenase-2 (ALDH2)
      as a gene of interest for further study. ALDH2 levels were significantly lower at
      the mRNA and protein level in tumor tissues than in normal tissues, and they were
      even lower in tissues that exhibited increased migratory capacity. A study of
      clinical associations showed that ALDH2 is correlated with survival and multiple 
      migration-associated clinicopathological traits, including the presence of
      metastasis and portal vein tumor thrombus. The result of overexpressing or
      knocking down ALDH2 showed that this gene inhibited migration and invasion both
      in vivo and in vitro. We also found that ALDH2 altered the redox status of cells 
      by regulating acetaldehyde levels and that it further activated the AMP-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Decreased levels of ALDH2
      may indicate a poor prognosis in HCC patients, while forcing the expression of
      ALDH2 in HCC cells inhibited their aggressive behavior in vitro and in mice
      largely by modulating the activity of the ALDH2-acetaldehyde-redox-AMPK axis.
      Therefore, identifying ALDH2 expression levels in HCC might be a useful strategy 
      for classifying HCC patients and for developing potential therapeutic strategies 
      that specifically target metastatic HCC. (Hepatology 2017;65:1628-1644).

TI  - Long-term outcome in liver transplantation candidates with portopulmonary
      hypertension.
PG  - 1683-1692
LID - 10.1002/hep.28990 [doi]
AB  - Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is diagnosed in 2-6% of liver transplantation 
      (LT) candidates. We studied outcomes of candidates for LT suffering from PoPH.
      Data were collected retrospectively from a prospective registry. Pulmonary
      hemodynamic variables were collected at the time of PoPH diagnosis, at last
      evaluation before LT, and within 6 months and beyond 6 months after LT.
      Forty-nine patients (35 males, 48 +/- 8 years) were analyzed (median Model for
      End-Stage Liver Disease score 20). At baseline, mean pulmonary artery pressure
      (mPAP) was 44 +/- 10 mm Hg (range 26-73 mm Hg), cardiac index was 3.5 +/- 0.9
      L/min/m(2) , and pulmonary vascular resistance was 5.6 +/- 2.8 Wood units.
      Hemodynamic reassessment performed in 35 patients who were treated with pulmonary
      arterial hypertension-targeted therapies before LT resulted in significant
      decreases in both mPAP (36 +/- 7 versus 47 +/- 10 mm Hg, P < 0.0001) and
      pulmonary vascular resistance (3.0 +/- 1.4 versus 6.1 +/- 3.1 Wood units, P <
      0.0001). Fourteen patients (29%) died without having had access to LT.
      Thirty-five patients underwent LT and were followed up for a median of 38 months.
      Eight patients (23%) died after LT including 5 due to PoPH (after 1 day to 6
      months). Among survivors (n = 27), all patients treated with intravenous
      epoprostenol were weaned off post-LT, and endothelin receptor antagonist or
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors were continued in 15/27 patients (55%). At
      last evaluation, 20/27 patients (74%) had mPAP <35 mm Hg and 8 of them (30%) had 
      mPAP <25 mm Hg. Overall survival estimates after LT were 80%, 77%, and 77% at 6
      months, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: Stabilization or
      reversibility of PoPH seems to be an attainable goal using the combination of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension-targeted therapies and LT in patients who are
      transplantation candidates. (Hepatology 2017;65:1683-1692).

TI  - Targeting beta-catenin in hepatocellular cancers induced by coexpression of
      mutant beta-catenin and K-Ras in mice.
PG  - 1581-1599
LID - 10.1002/hep.28975 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we have shown that coexpression of hMet and mutant-beta-catenin using
      sleeping beauty transposon/transposase leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in
      mice that corresponds to around 10% of human HCC. In the current study, we
      investigate whether Ras activation, which can occur downstream of Met signaling, 
      is sufficient to cause HCC in association with mutant-beta-catenin. We also
      tested therapeutic efficacy of targeting beta-catenin in an HCC model. We show
      that mutant-K-Ras (G12D), which leads to Ras activation, cooperates with
      beta-catenin mutants (S33Y, S45Y) to yield HCC in mice. Affymetrix microarray
      showed > 90% similarity in gene expression in mutant-K-Ras-beta-catenin and
      Met-beta-catenin HCC. K-Ras-beta-catenin tumors showed up-regulation of
      beta-catenin targets like glutamine synthetase (GS), leukocyte cell-derived
      chemotaxin 2, Regucalcin, and Cyclin-D1 and of K-Ras effectors, including
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylated protein
      kinase B, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin, phosphorylated eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 4E, phosphorylated 4E-binding protein 1, and p-S6
      ribosomal protein. Inclusion of dominant-negative transcription factor 4 at the
      time of K-Ras-beta-catenin injection prevented HCC and downstream beta-catenin
      and Ras signaling. To address whether targeting beta-catenin has any benefit
      postestablishment of HCC, we administered K-Ras-beta-catenin mice with EnCore
      lipid nanoparticles (LNP) loaded with a Dicer substrate small interfering RNA
      targeting catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1; CTNNB1-LNP), scrambled sequence (Scr-LNP), or
      phosphate-buffered saline for multiple cycles. A significant decrease in tumor
      burden was evident in the CTNNB1-LNP group versus all controls, which was
      associated with dramatic decreases in beta-catenin targets and some K-Ras
      effectors, leading to reduced tumor cell proliferation and viability.
      Intriguingly, in relatively few mice, non-GS-positive tumors, which were evident 
      as a small subset of overall tumor burden, were not affected by beta-catenin
      suppression. CONCLUSION: Ras activation downstream of c-Met is sufficient to
      induce clinically relevant HCC in cooperation with mutant beta-catenin.
      beta-catenin suppression by a clinically relevant modality is effective in
      treatment of beta-catenin-positive, GS-positive HCCs. (Hepatology
      2017;65:1581-1599).

TI  - The E3 ligase tripartite motif 8 targets TAK1 to promote insulin resistance and
      steatohepatitis.
PG  - 1492-1511
LID - 10.1002/hep.28971 [doi]
AB  - Tripartite motif 8 (TRIM8), an E3 ligase ubiquitously expressed in various cells,
      is closely involved in innate immunity. However, its role in nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis is largely unknown. Here, we report evidence that TRIM8 is a
      robust enhancer of steatohepatitis and its complications induced by a high-fat
      diet or a genetic deficiency (ob/ob). Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function
      approaches, we observed dramatic exacerbation of insulin resistance, hepatic
      steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by hepatocyte-specific TRIM8
      overexpression, whereas deletion or down-regulation of TRIM8 in hepatocytes led
      to a completely opposite phenotype. Furthermore, investigations of the underlying
      mechanisms revealed that TRIM8 directly binds to and ubiquitinates transforming
      growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1, thus promoting its phosphorylation and the
      activation of downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38 and nuclear factor kappaB
      signaling. Importantly, the participation of TRIM8 in human nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was verified on the basis of its
      dramatically increased expression in the livers of these patients, suggesting a
      promising development of TRIM8 disturbance for the treatment of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis-related metabolic disorders. CONCLUSION: The E3 ligase TRIM8 is a
      potent regulator that exacerbates steatohepatitis and metabolic disorders
      dependent on its binding and ubiquitinating capacity on transforming growth
      factor-beta-activated kinase 1. (Hepatology 2017;65:1492-1511).

TI  - Mutual epithelium-macrophage dependency in liver carcinogenesis mediated by ST18.
PG  - 1708-1719
LID - 10.1002/hep.28942 [doi]
AB  - The ST18 gene has been proposed to act either as a tumor suppressor or as an
      oncogene in different human cancers, but direct evidence for its role in
      tumorigenesis has been lacking thus far. Here, we demonstrate that ST18 is
      critical for tumor progression and maintenance in a mouse model of liver cancer, 
      based on oncogenic transformation and adoptive transfer of primary precursor
      cells (hepatoblasts). ST18 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were detectable
      neither in normal liver nor in cultured hepatoblasts, but were readily expressed 
      after subcutaneous engraftment and tumor growth. ST18 expression in liver cells
      was induced by inflammatory cues, including acute or chronic inflammation in
      vivo, as well as coculture with macrophages in vitro. Knocking down the ST18 mRNA
      in transplanted hepatoblasts delayed tumor progression. Induction of ST18
      knockdown in pre-established tumors caused rapid tumor involution associated with
      pervasive morphological changes, proliferative arrest, and apoptosis in tumor
      cells, as well as depletion of tumor-associated macrophages, vascular ectasia,
      and hemorrhage. Reciprocally, systemic depletion of macrophages in recipient
      animals had very similar phenotypic consequences, impairing either tumor
      development or maintenance, and suppressing ST18 expression in hepatoblasts.
      Finally, RNA sequencing of ST18-depleted tumors before involution revealed
      down-regulation of inflammatory response genes, pointing to the suppression of
      nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription. CONCLUSION: ST18 expression in
      epithelial cells is induced by tumor-associated macrophages, contributing to the 
      reciprocal feed-forward loop between both cell types in liver tumorigenesis. Our 
      findings warrant the exploration of means to interfere with ST18-dependent
      epithelium-macrophage interactions in a therapeutic setting. (Hepatology

TI  - Early detection and curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: A
      cost-effectiveness analysis in France and in the United States.
PG  - 1237-1248
LID - 10.1002/hep.28961 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of death in patients with
      cirrhosis. Patients outside clinical trials seldom benefit from evidence-based
      monitoring. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of
      complying with HCC screening guidelines. The economic evaluation compared
      surveillance of patients with cirrhosis as recommended by the guidelines
      ("gold-standard monitoring") to "real-life monitoring" from the health care
      system perspective. A Markov model described the history of the disease and
      treatment course including current first-line curative treatment: liver
      resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and liver transplantation. Transition
      probabilities were derived mainly from two French cohorts, CIRVIR and CHANGH.
      Costs were computed using French and U.S. tariffs. Effectiveness was measured in 
      life years gained (LYG). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was
      calculated for a 10-year horizon and tested with one-way and probabilistic
      sensitivity analyses. The cost difference between the two groups was $648
      ($87,476 in the gold-standard monitoring group vs. $86,829 in the real-life
      monitoring group) in France and $11,965 ($93,795 vs. $81,829) in the United
      States. Survival increased by 0.37 years (7.18 vs. 6.81 years). The ICER was
      $1,754 per LYG in France and $32,415 per LYG in the United States. The health
      gain resulted from earlier diagnosis and access to first-line curative
      treatments, among which RFA provided the best value for money. CONCLUSION: Our
      results indicate that gold-standard monitoring for patients with cirrhosis is
      cost-effective, attributed to a higher probability of benefiting from a curative 
      treatment and so a higher survival probability. (Hepatology 2017;65:1237-1248).

TI  - Central role of the TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)
      adaptor protein in murine sterile liver injury.
PG  - 1336-1351
LID - 10.1002/hep.29078 [doi]
AB  - Multiple pathways drive the sterile injury response in the liver; however, it is 
      unclear how the type of cells injured or the mechanism of injury activates these 
      pathways. Here, we use a model of selective hepatocyte death to investigate
      sterile liver injury. In this model, the TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing
      interferon-beta (TRIF) was a central mediator of the resulting intrahepatic
      inflammatory response that was independent of both upstream Toll-like receptor
      (TLR) 4 signaling and downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling. TRIF was
      required for induction of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, and IL-1beta cytokines.
      Conversely, although induction of C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2 and C-X-C
      motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 1 chemokines and up-regulation of chemokine (Ccl2, 
      Ccl7, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10) and cell-adhesion (intracellular adhesion
      molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) genes involved in myeloid cell 
      recruitment was reduced in a majority of TRIF(-/-) mice, a subset of TRIF(-/-)
      mice showed breakthrough inflammation and the ability to induce these genes and
      proteins, indicating that redundant pathways exist to respond to hepatocyte
      death. Furthermore, we found that hepatocytes themselves were the main responders
      to hepatocyte death, increasing transcription of genes involved in myeloid cell
      recruitment more than either liver sinusoidal endothelial cells or Kupffer cells.
      CONCLUSION: Our studies define a TRIF-dependent, TLR4- and type I IFN-independent
      pathway of sterile liver injury in which hepatocytes are both the targets of
      damage and the principal responding cell type. (Hepatology 2017;65:1336-1351).

TI  - Ammonia mediates cortical hemichannel dysfunction in rodent models of chronic
      liver disease.
PG  - 1306-1318
LID - 10.1002/hep.29031 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis is multifactorial
      and ammonia is thought to play a key role. Astroglial dysfunction is known to be 
      present in HE. Astrocytes are extensively connected by gap junctions formed of
      connexins, which also exist as functional hemichannels allowing exchange of
      molecules between the cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu. The
      astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis suggests that neuronal activity is
      fueled (at least in part) by lactate provided by neighboring astrocytes. We
      hypothesized that in HE, astroglial dysfunction could impair metabolic
      communication between astrocytes and neurons. In this study, we determined
      whether hyperammonemia leads to hemichannel dysfunction and impairs lactate
      transport in the cerebral cortex using rat models of HE (bile duct ligation [BDL]
      and induced hyperammonemia) and also evaluated the effect of ammonia-lowering
      treatment (ornithine phenylacetate [OP]). Plasma ammonia concentration in BDL
      rats was significantly reduced by OP treatment. Biosensor recordings demonstrated
      that HE is associated with a significant reduction in both tonic and
      hypoxia-induced lactate release in the cerebral cortex, which was normalized by
      OP treatment. Cortical dye loading experiments revealed hemichannel dysfunction
      in HE with improvement following OP treatment, while the expression of key
      connexins was unaffected. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study
      demonstrate that HE is associated with central nervous system hemichannel
      dysfunction, with ammonia playing a key role. The data provide evidence of a
      potential neuronal energy deficit due to impaired hemichannel-mediated lactate
      transport between astrocytes and neurons as a possible mechanism underlying
      pathogenesis of HE. (Hepatology 2017;65:1306-1318).

TI  - Bone marrow stem cell therapy partially ameliorates pathological consequences in 
      livers of mice expressing mutant human alpha1-antitrypsin.
PG  - 1319-1335
LID - 10.1002/hep.29027 [doi]
AB  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disease, caused by
      mutation of the AAT gene. Accumulation of mutated AAT protein aggregates in
      hepatocytes leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in impairment of
      liver functions and, in some cases, hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas decline of 
      AAT levels in sera is responsible for pulmonary emphysema. In advanced liver
      disease, the only option for treatment is liver transplantation, whereas AAT
      replacement therapy is therapeutic for emphysema. Given that hepatocytes are the 
      primary affected cells in AATD, we investigated whether transplantation of bone
      marrow (BM)-derived stem cells in transgenic mice expressing human AATZ (the Z
      variant of AAT) confers any competitive advantages compared to host cells that
      could lead to pathological improvement. Mouse BM progenitors and human
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) appeared to contribute in replacement of 40% and
      13% host hepatocytes, respectively. Transplantation of cells resulted in decline 
      of globule-containing hepatocytes, improvement in proliferation of globule-devoid
      hepatocytes from the host-derived hepatocytes, and apparently, donor-derived
      cells. Further analyses revealed that transplantation partially improves liver
      pathology as reflected by inflammatory response, fibrosis, and apoptotic death of
      hepatocytes. Cell therapy was also found to improve liver glycogen storage and
      sera glucose level in mice expressing human AATZ mice. These overall improvements
      in liver pathology were not restricted to transplantation of mouse BM cells.
      Preliminary results also showed that following transplantation of human
      BM-derived MSCs, globule-containing hepatocytes declined and donor-derived cells 
      expressed human AAT protein. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BM stem cell 
      transplantation may be a promising therapy for AATD-related liver disease.

TI  - Eight weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is effective for selected patients with
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 1094-1103
LID - 10.1002/hep.29005 [doi]
AB  - Eight weeks duration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) can be considered in
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus-infected patients who are treatment-naive, do not
      have cirrhosis, and have a pretreatment viral load <6,000,000 IU/mL. The
      effectiveness of this regimen, however, has not been fully confirmed by
      real-world experience. Using data from real-world cohorts, we aimed to determine 
      the effectiveness of 8 weeks of LDV/SOF treatment, examine variables associated
      with relapse after treatment with this regimen, and compare the effectiveness of 
      8 weeks and 12 weeks of LDV/SOF treatment. To evaluate the effectiveness of 8
      weeks of therapy and characteristics associated with relapse, we used individual 
      patient data from the IFI (Institut fur Interdisziplinare Medizin), Burman's
      Pharmacy, and Kaiser Permanente Southern California. All patients had fibrosis
      staging assessed with biopsy, transient elastography, or serum biomarkers. We
      also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of six additional real-world
      cohorts, to compare effectiveness of 8 weeks to 12 weeks duration. In our pooled 
      data analysis, 634 patients were treated for 8 weeks with LDV/SOF, of whom all
      had outcomes of cure or relapse without loss to follow-up. Per protocol rates of 
      sustained virologic response at 12 weeks were 98.1% (622/634) in the full cohort 
      and 97.9% (571/583) among treatment-eligible patients. Exact logistic regression 
      revealed no specific patient characteristics associated with relapse. Our
      meta-analysis of six additional real-world cohorts, comprised of 5,637 patients, 
      demonstrated similar risk for relapse between 8 weeks and 12 weeks of LDV/SOF
      (relative risk = 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.00). CONCLUSION: An 8-week 
      duration of treatment with LDV/SOF is highly effective in properly selected
      patients; greater use of this regimen is recommended. (Hepatology

PG  - 1293-1305
LID - 10.1002/hep.28992 [doi]
AB  - Obesity increases the risk of clinical decompensation in cirrhosis, possibly by
      increasing portal pressure. Whether weight reduction can be safely achieved
      through lifestyle (LS) changes (diet and exercise) in overweight/obese patients
      with cirrhosis, and if weight loss reduces portal pressure in this setting, is
      unknown. This prospective, multicentric, uncontrolled pilot study enrolled
      patients with compensated cirrhosis, portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure
      gradient [HVPG] >/=6 mm Hg), and body mass index (BMI) >/=26 kg/m(2) in an
      intensive 16-week LS intervention program (personalized hypocaloric normoproteic 
      diet and 60 min/wk of supervised physical activity). We measured HVPG, body
      weight (BW) and composition, adipokines, health-related quality of life, and
      safety data before and after the intervention. Changes in HVPG and BW were
      predefined as clinically relevant if >/=10% and >/=5%, respectively. Safety and
      BW were reassessed after 6 months. 60 patients were included and 50 completed the
      study (56 +/- 8 years old; 62% male; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis etiology 24%;
      BMI 33.3 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2) ; Child A 92%; HVPG >/=10 mm Hg, 72%). LS intervention
      significantly decreased BW (average, -5.0 +/- 4.0 kg; P < 0.0001), by >/=5% in
      52% and >/=10% in 16%. HVPG also significantly decreased (from 13.9 +/- 5.6 to
      12.3 +/- 5.2 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), by >/=10% in 42% and >/=20% in 24%. A >/=10% BW 
      loss was associated with a greater decrease in HVPG (-23.7 +/- 19.9% vs. -8.2 +/-
      16.6%; P = 0.024). No episodes of clinical decompensation occurred. Weight loss
      achieved at 16 weeks was maintained at 6 months; Child and Model for End-Stage
      Liver Disease scores did not change. CONCLUSION: Sixteen weeks of diet and
      moderate exercise were safe and reduced BW and portal pressure in
      overweight/obese patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. (Hepatology

TI  - Hepatostat: Liver regeneration and normal liver tissue maintenance.
PG  - 1384-1392

AB  - In contrast to all other organs, liver-to-body-weight ratio needs to be
      maintained always at 100% of what is required for body homeostasis. Adjustment of
      liver size to 100% of what is required for homeostasis has been called
      "hepatostat." Removal of a portion of any other organ is followed with local
      regeneration of a limited degree, but it never attempts to reach 100% of the
      original size. The complex mechanisms involved in this uniquely hepatic process
      encompass a variety of regenerative pathways that are specific to different types
      of injury. The most studied form of liver regeneration (LR) is that occurring
      after loss of hepatocytes in a single acute injury, such as rodent LR after
      two-thirds partial hepatectomy or administration of damaging chemicals (CCl4 ,
      acetaminophen, etc.). Alternative regenerative pathways become activated when
      normal regeneration is thwarted and trigger the appearance of "progenitor" cells.
      Chronic loss of hepatocytes is associated with regenerative efforts characterized
      by continual hepatocyte proliferation and often has adverse consequences
      (development of cirrhosis or liver cancer). Even though a very few hepatocytes
      proliferate at any given time in normal liver, the mechanisms involved in the
      maintenance of liver weight by this slow process in the absence of liver injury
      are not as well understood. (Hepatology 2017;65:1384-1392).

AB  - The identification of the key regulators of bile acid (BA) synthesis and
      transport within the enterohepatic circulation has revealed potential targets for
      pharmacological therapies of cholestatic liver diseases. Novel drug targets
      include the bile BA receptors, farnesoid X receptor and TGR5, the BA-induced gut 
      hormones, fibroblast growth factor 19 and glucagon-like peptide 1, and the BA
      transport systems, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and Na(+)
      -taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, within the enterohepatic circulation.
      Moreover, BA derivatives undergoing cholehepatic shunting may allow improved
      targeting to the bile ducts. This review focuses on the pathophysiological basis,
      mechanisms of action, and clinical development of novel pharmacological
      strategies targeting BA transport and signaling in cholestatic liver diseases.

TI  - The core domain of hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2 generates potent
      cross-neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs.
PG  - 1117-1131
LID - 10.1002/hep.28989 [doi]
AB  - A vaccine that prevents hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is urgently needed to
      support an emerging global elimination program. However, vaccine development has 
      been confounded because of HCV's high degree of antigenic variability and the
      preferential induction of type-specific immune responses with limited potency
      against heterologous viral strains and genotypes. We showed previously that
      deletion of the three variable regions from the E2 receptor-binding domain
      (Delta123) increases the ability of human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)
      to inhibit E2-CD81 receptor interactions, suggesting improved bNAb epitope
      exposure. In this study, the immunogenicity of Delta123 was examined. We show
      that high-molecular-weight forms of Delta123 elicit distinct antibody
      specificities with potent and broad neutralizing activity against all seven HCV
      genotypes. Antibody competition studies revealed that immune sera raised to
      high-molecular-weight Delta123 was poly specific, given that it inhibited the
      binding of human bNAbs directed to three major neutralization epitopes on E2. By 
      contrast, the immune sera raised to monomeric Delta123 predominantly blocked the 
      binding of a non-neutralizing antibody to Delta123, while having reduced ability 
      to block bNAb binding to E2, and neutralization was largely toward the homologous
      genotype. This increased ability of oligomeric Delta123 to generate bNAbs
      correlates with occlusion of the non-neutralizing face of E2 in this glycoprotein
      form. CONCLUSION: The results from this study reveal new information on the
      antigenic and immunogenic potential of E2-based immunogens and provide a pathway 
      for the development of a simple, recombinant protein-based prophylactic vaccine
      for HCV with potential for universal protection. (Hepatology 2017;65:1117-1131).

TI  - Metabolic and histological implications of intrahepatic triglyceride content in
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 1132-1144
LID - 10.1002/hep.28985 [doi]
AB  - The cut-off point of intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content to define
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by proton magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) was established based on the 95th percentile in a group 
      of healthy individuals (i.e., >/=5.56%). Whether this threshold correlates with
      metabolic and histological changes and whether a further accumulation of IHTG is 
      associated with worsening of these parameters has not been properly assessed in a
      large cohort of patients. In this cross-sectional study, 352 subjects were
      carefully characterized with the following studies: liver (1) H-MRS; euglycemic
      insulin clamp with measurement of glucose turnover; oral glucose tolerance test; 
      and a liver biopsy. Hepatic insulin sensitivity (suppression of endogenous
      glucose production by insulin) was affected early on after IHTG content was
      approximately 1.5% and remained uniformly impaired ( approximately 40%-45%),
      regardless of further IHTG accumulation. Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity
      showed a gradual impairment at low degrees of IHTG accumulation, but remained
      unchanged after IHTG content reached the approximately 6 +/- 2% threshold. A
      similar pattern was observed for metabolic changes typically associated with
      NAFLD, such as hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      (HDL-C). In contrast, adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (suppression of free
      fatty acids by insulin) showed a continuous worsening across the spectrum of IHTG
      accumulation in NAFLD (r = -0.38; P < 0.001). Histological severity of liver
      disease (inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis) was not associated with the
      amount of IHTG content. CONCLUSION: IHTG accumulation is strongly associated with
      adipose tissue insulin resistance (IR), supporting the current theory of
      lipotoxicity as a driver of IHTG accumulation. Once IHTG accumulation reaches
      approximately 6 +/- 2%, skeletal muscle IR, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C
      become fully established. Histological activity appears to have an early
      threshold and is not significantly influenced by increasing amounts of IHTG
      accumulation. (Hepatology 2017;65:1132-1144).

TI  - Growth factor receptor binding protein 14 inhibition triggers insulin-induced
      mouse hepatocyte proliferation and is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are recognized as
      independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hyperinsulinemia, a 
      hallmark of these pathologies, is suspected to be involved in HCC development.
      The molecular adapter growth factor receptor binding protein 14 (Grb14) is an
      inhibitor of insulin receptor catalytic activity, highly expressed in the liver. 
      To study its involvement in hepatocyte proliferation, we specifically inhibited
      its liver expression using a short hairpin RNA strategy in mice. Enhanced insulin
      signaling upon Grb14 inhibition was accompanied by a transient induction of
      S-phase entrance by quiescent hepatocytes, indicating that Grb14 is a potent
      repressor of cell division. The proliferation of Grb14-deficient hepatocytes was 
      cell-autonomous as it was also observed in primary cell cultures. Combined Grb14 
      down-regulation and insulin signaling blockade using pharmacological approaches
      as well as genetic mouse models demonstrated that Grb14 inhibition-mediated
      hepatocyte division involved insulin receptor activation and was mediated by the 
      mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1-S6K pathway and the transcription
      factor E2F1. In order to determine a potential dysregulation in GRB14 gene
      expression in human pathophysiology, a collection of 85 human HCCs was
      investigated. This revealed a highly significant and frequent decrease in GRB14
      expression in hepatic tumors when compared to adjacent nontumoral parenchyma,
      with 60% of the tumors exhibiting a reduced Grb14 mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Our
      study establishes Grb14 as a physiological repressor of insulin mitogenic action 
      in the liver and further supports that dysregulation of insulin signaling is
      associated with HCC. (Hepatology 2017;65:1352-1368).

TI  - Hepatocyte autotaxin expression promotes liver fibrosis and cancer.
PG  - 1369-1383
LID - 10.1002/hep.28973 [doi]
AB  - Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D that catalyzes the production
      of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a pleiotropic growth-factor-like
      lysophospholipid. Increased ATX expression has been detected in various chronic
      inflammatory disorders and different types of cancer; however, little is known
      about its role and mode of action in liver fibrosis and cancer. Here, increased
      ATX expression was detected in chronic liver disease (CLD) patients of different 
      etiologies, associated with shorter overall survival. In mice, different
      hepatotoxic stimuli linked with the development of different forms of CLDs were
      shown to stimulate hepatocyte ATX expression, leading to increased LPA levels,
      activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and amplification of profibrotic
      signals. Hepatocyte-specific, conditional genetic deletion and/or transgenic
      overexpression of ATX established a liver profibrotic role for ATX/LPA, whereas
      pharmacological ATX inhibition studies suggested ATX as a possible therapeutic
      target in CLDs. In addition, hepatocyte ATX ablation and the consequent
      deregulation of lipid homeostasis was also shown to attenuate hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) development, thus implicating ATX/LPA in the causative link of
      cirrhosis and HCC. CONCLUSION: ATX is a novel player in the pathogenesis of liver
      fibrosis and cancer and a promising therapeutic target. (Hepatology

TI  - Malondialdehyde epitopes are sterile mediators of hepatic inflammation in
      hypercholesterolemic mice.
PG  - 1181-1195
LID - 10.1002/hep.28970 [doi]
AB  - Diet-related health issues such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and
      cardiovascular disorders are known to have a major inflammatory component.
      However, the exact pathways linking diet-induced changes (e.g., hyperlipidemia)
      and the ensuing inflammation have remained elusive so far. We identified
      biological processes related to innate immunity and oxidative stress as prime
      response pathways in livers of low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice on
      a Western-type diet using RNA sequencing and in silico functional analyses of
      transcriptome data. The observed changes were independent of the presence of
      microbiota and thus indicative of a role for sterile triggers. We further show
      that malondialdehyde (MDA) epitopes, products of lipid peroxidation and markers
      for enhanced oxidative stress, are detectable in hepatic inflammation
      predominantly on dying cells and stimulate cytokine secretion as well as
      leukocyte recruitment in vitro and in vivo. MDA-induced cytokine secretion in
      vitro was dependent on the presence of the scavenger receptors CD36 and MSR1.
      Moreover, in vivo neutralization of endogenously generated MDA epitopes by
      intravenous injection of a specific MDA antibody results in decreased hepatic
      inflammation in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice on a Western-type
      diet. CONCLUSION: Accumulation of MDA epitopes plays a major role during
      diet-induced hepatic inflammation and can be ameliorated by administration of an 
      anti-MDA antibody. (Hepatology 2017;65:1181-1195).

TI  - Prohibitin 1 suppresses liver cancer tumorigenesis in mice and human
      hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma cells.
PG  - 1249-1266
LID - 10.1002/hep.28964 [doi]
AB  - Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) is best known as a mitochondrial chaperone, and its role in
      cancer is conflicting. Mice lacking methionine adenosyltransferase alpha1
      (MATalpha1) have lower PHB1 expression, and we reported that c-MYC interacts
      directly with both proteins. Furthermore, c-MYC and MATalpha1 exert opposing
      effects on liver cancer growth, prompting us to examine the interplay between
      PHB1, MATalpha1, and c-MYC and PHB1's role in liver tumorigenesis. We found that 
      PHB1 is highly expressed in normal hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells and
      down-regulated in most human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In HCC and CCA cells, PHB1 expression correlates
      inversely with growth. PHB1 and MAT1A positively regulate each other's
      expression, whereas PHB1 negatively regulates the expression of c-MYC, MAFG, and 
      c-MAF. Both PHB1 and MATalpha1 heterodimerize with MAX, bind to the E-box
      element, and repress E-box promoter activity. PHB1 promoter contains a repressive
      E-box element and is occupied mainly by MAX, MNT, and MATalpha1 in nonmalignant
      cholangiocytes and noncancerous tissues that switched to c-MYC, c-MAF, and MAFG
      in cancer cells and human HCC/CCA. All 8-month-old liver-specific Phb1 knockout
      mice developed HCC, and one developed CCA. Five-month-old Phb1 heterozygotes, but
      not Phb1 flox mice, developed aberrant bile duct proliferation; and one developed
      CCA 3.5 months after left and median bile duct ligation. Phb1 heterozygotes had a
      more profound fall in the expression of glutathione synthetic enzymes and higher 
      hepatic oxidative stress following left and median bile duct ligation.
      CONCLUSION: We have identified that PHB1, down-regulated in most human HCC and

TI  - Clinical presentations and outcomes of bile duct loss caused by drugs and herbal 
      and dietary supplements.
PG  - 1267-1277
LID - 10.1002/hep.28967 [doi]
AB  - Bile duct loss during the course of drug-induced liver injury is uncommon, but
      can be an indication of vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS). In this work, we
      assess the frequency, causes, clinical features, and outcomes of cases of
      drug-induced liver injury with histologically proven bile duct loss. All cases of
      drug-induced liver injury enrolled into a prospective database over a 10-year
      period that had undergone liver biopsies (n = 363) were scored for the presence
      of bile duct loss and assessed for clinical and laboratory features, causes, and 
      outcomes. Twenty-six of the 363 patients (7%) with drug-, herbal-, or
      dietary-supplement-associated liver injury had bile duct loss on liver biopsy,
      which was moderate to severe (<50% of portal areas with bile ducts) in 14 and
      mild (50%-75%) in 12. The presenting clinical features of the 26 cases varied,
      but the most common clinical pattern was a severe cholestatic hepatitis. The
      implicated agents included amoxicillin/clavulanate (n = 3), temozolomide (n = 3),
      various herbal products (n = 3), azithromycin (n = 2), and 15 other medications
      or dietary supplements. Compared to those without, those with bile duct loss were
      more likely to develop chronic liver injury (94% vs. 47%), which was usually
      cholestatic and sometimes severe. Five patients died and 2 others underwent liver
      transplantation for progressive cholestasis despite treatment with
      corticosteroids and ursodiol. The most predictive factor of poor outcome was the 
      degree of bile duct loss on liver biopsy. CONCLUSION: Bile duct loss during acute
      cholestatic hepatitis is an ominous early indicator of possible VBDS, for which
      at present there are no known means of prevention or therapy. (Hepatology

TI  - Bariatric surgery for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A clinical and
      cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1156-1164
LID - 10.1002/hep.28958 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 2%-3% of the US population and is
      expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next
      decade. Bariatric surgery may be an effective but expensive treatment for NASH.
      Using a state-transition model, our analysis assessed the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of surgery to manage NASH. We simulated the benefits and harms
      of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients defined by weight
      class (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity) and
      fibrosis stage (F0-F3). Comparators included intensive lifestyle intervention
      (ILI) and no treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Our results showed that
      surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 0.678-2.152 and
      0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. Incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with mild, moderate, 
      or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and $19,222/QALY,
      respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery increased QALYs by
      0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164. In overweight patients, it
      was cost-effective to reserve treatment only for F3 patients; the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios for providing surgery or ILI only to F3 patients were
      $30,484/QALY and $25,367/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was both
      effective and cost-effective for obese patients with NASH, regardless of fibrosis
      stage; in overweight patients, surgery increased QALYs for all patients
      regardless of fibrosis stage, but was cost-effective only for patients with F3
      fibrosis; our results highlight the promise of bariatric surgery for treating
      NASH and underscore the need for clinical trials in this area. (Hepatology

TI  - A new class of hepatitis B and D virus entry inhibitors, proanthocyanidin and its
      analogs, that directly act on the viral large surface proteins.
PG  - 1104-1116
LID - 10.1002/hep.28952 [doi]
AB  - Introduction of direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has
      provided a revolutionary improvement in the treatment outcome. In contrast to
      HCV, however, the strategy for developing new antiviral agents against hepatitis 
      B virus (HBV), especially viral-targeting compounds, is limited because HBV
      requires only four viral genes for its efficient replication/infection. Here, we 
      identify an oligomeric flavonoid, proanthocyanidin (PAC) and its analogs, which
      inhibit HBV entry into host cells by targeting the HBV large surface protein
      (LHBs). Through cell-based chemical screening, PAC was identified to inhibit HBV 
      infection with little cytotoxic effect. PAC prevented the attachment of the preS1
      region in the LHBs to its cellular receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting
      polypeptide (NTCP). PAC was shown to target HBV particles and impair their
      infectivity, whereas it did not affect the NTCP-mediated bile acid transport
      activity. Chemical biological techniques demonstrated that PAC directly
      interacted with the region essential for receptor binding in the preS1 region in 
      the LHBs protein. Importantly, PAC had a pan-genotypic anti-HBV activity and was 
      also effective against a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV
      isolate. We further showed that PAC augmented the ability of a nucleoside analog,
      tenofovir, to interrupt HBV spread over time in primary human hepatocytes by
      cotreatment. Moreover, derivative analysis could identify small molecules that
      demonstrated more-potent anti-HBV activity over PAC. CONCLUSION: PAC and its
      analogs represent a new class of anti-HBV agents that directly target the preS1
      region of the HBV large surface protein. These agents could contribute to the
      development of a potent, well-tolerated, and broadly active inhibitor of HBV
      infection. (Hepatology 2017;65:1104-1116).

TI  - IL6-mediated inflammatory loop reprograms normal to epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition(+) metastatic cancer stem cells in preneoplastic liver of transforming
      growth factor beta-deficient beta2-spectrin(+/-) mice.
PG  - 1222-1236
LID - 10.1002/hep.28951 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second-leading cause of cancer-related
      deaths worldwide with a poor survival rate. As many as 40% of HCCs are clonal,
      with alteration of key tumor-suppressor pathways in stem cells as the primary
      cause of HCC initiation. However, mechanisms that generate metastatic stem cells 
      in preneoplastic liver tissue are not well understood. We hypothesized that
      chronic inflammation is a major driver of the transformation of genetically
      defective liver stem cells (LSCs) into highly metastatic liver cancer cells in
      premalignant liver tissue. We developed models of chronic inflammation in
      wild-type (WT) and beta2-spectrin (beta2SP)(+/-) (SPTBN1) mice. CD133(+) LSCs
      derived from preneoplastic livers of beta2SP(+/-) mice treated with interleukin-6
      (pIL6; (IL6) beta2SP(+/-) LSCs) were highly tumorigenic and metastatic, whereas
      those derived from WT mice treated with pIL6 ((IL6) WT LSCs) had significantly
      less proliferation and no tumorigenic properties. (IL6) beta2SP(+/-) LSCs not
      only exhibited nuclear localization of Twist and Slug, markers of
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but also constitutive activation of
      nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB; RELA). Knockdown of NFkappaB decreased the EMT 
      phenotypes and metastatic capacity of these cells. NFkappaB in (IL6) beta2SP(+/-)
      LSCs was activated by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-activated kinase 
      1 (TAK1; MAP3K7), which is associated with poor survival in HCC and interleukin-6
      (IL6) expression. The amount of constitutively activated NFkappaB increased
      dramatically from normal to cirrhotic to HCC tissues from human patients.
      CONCLUSION: IL6-mediated inflammation programs constitutive activation of the
      TAK1-NFkappaB signaling cascade in CD133(+) LSCs, and this program interacts with
      deficient TGFbeta signaling, thereby accelerating the transformation of normal
      LSCs to metastatic cancer stem cells (mCSCs). Indeed, this study delineates the
      development of EMT-positive mCSCs in HCC-free liver tissue upon chronic
      inflammation. (Hepatology 2017;65:1222-1236).

TI  - Lipid zonation and phospholipid remodeling in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PG  - 1165-1180
LID - 10.1002/hep.28953 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can progress from simple steatosis
      (i.e., nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
      cirrhosis, and cancer. Currently, the driver for this progression is not fully
      understood; in particular, it is not known how NAFLD and its early progression
      affects the distribution of lipids in the liver, producing lipotoxicity and
      inflammation. In this study, we used dietary and genetic mouse models of NAFL and
      NASH and translated the results to humans by correlating the spatial distribution
      of lipids in liver tissue with disease progression using advanced mass
      spectrometry imaging technology. We identified several lipids with distinct zonal
      distributions in control and NAFL samples and observed partial to complete loss
      of lipid zonation in NASH. In addition, we found increased hepatic expression of 
      genes associated with remodeling the phospholipid membrane, release of
      arachidonic acid (AA) from the membrane, and production of eicosanoid species
      that promote inflammation and cell injury. The results of our
      immunohistochemistry analyses suggest that the zonal location of remodeling
      enzyme LPCAT2 plays a role in the change in spatial distribution for
      AA-containing lipids. This results in a cycle of AA-enrichment in pericentral
      hepatocytes, membrane release of AA, and generation of proinflammatory
      eicosanoids and may account for increased oxidative damage in pericentral regions
      in NASH. CONCLUSION: NAFLD is associated not only with lipid enrichment, but also
      with zonal changes of specific lipids and their associated metabolic pathways.
      This may play a role in the heterogeneous development of NAFLD. (Hepatology
      2017;65:1165-1180).

TI  - The SRL peptide of rhesus rotavirus VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte infection
      and the murine model of biliary atresia.
PG  - 1278-1292
LID - 10.1002/hep.28947 [doi]
AB  - Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy that progresses to 
      end-stage liver disease, often requiring transplantation. The murine model of BA,
      employing rhesus rotavirus (RRV), parallels human disease and has been used to
      elucidate mechanistic aspects of a virus induced biliary cholangiopathy. We
      previously reported that the RRV VP4 gene plays an integral role in activating
      the immune system and induction of BA. Using rotavirus binding and blocking
      assays, this study elucidated how RRV VP4 protein governs cholangiocyte
      susceptibility to infection both in vitro and in vivo in the murine model of BA. 
      We identified the amino acid sequence on VP4 and its cholangiocyte binding
      protein, finding that the sequence is specific to those rotavirus strains that
      cause obstructive cholangiopathy. Pretreatment of murine and human cholangiocytes
      with this VP4-derived peptide (TRTRVSRLY) significantly reduced the ability of
      RRV to bind and infect cells. However, the peptide did not block cholangiocyte
      binding of TUCH and Ro1845, strains that do not induce murine BA. The SRL
      sequence within TRTRVSRLY is required for cholangiocyte binding and viral
      replication. The cholangiocyte membrane protein bound by SRL was found to be
      Hsc70. Inhibition of Hsc70 by small interfering RNAs reduced RRV's ability to
      infect cholangiocytes. This virus-cholangiocyte interaction is also seen in vivo 
      in the murine model of BA, where inoculation of mice with TRTRVSRLY peptide
      significantly reduced symptoms and mortality in RRV-injected mice. CONCLUSION:
      The tripeptide SRL on RRV VP4 binds to the cholangiocyte membrane protein Hsc70, 
      defining a novel binding site governing VP4 attachment. Investigations are
      underway to determine the cellular response to this interaction to understand how
      it contributes to the pathogenesis of BA. (Hepatology 2017;65:1278-1292).

TI  - Yes-associated protein/TEA domain family member and hepatocyte nuclear factor
      4-alpha (HNF4alpha) repress reciprocally to regulate hepatocarcinogenesis in rats
      and mice.
PG  - 1206-1221
LID - 10.1002/hep.28911 [doi]
AB  - Great progress has been achieved in the study of Hippo signaling in regulating
      tumorigenesis; however, the downstream molecular events that mediate this process
      have not been completely defined. Moreover, regulation of Hippo signaling during 
      tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. In the
      present study, we systematically investigated the relationship between
      Yes-associated protein/TEA domain family member (YAP-TEAD) and hepatocyte nuclear
      factor 4-alpha (HNF4alpha) in the hepatocarcinogenesis of HCC cells. Our results 
      indicated that HNF4alpha expression was negatively regulated by YAP1 in HCC cells
      by a ubiquitin proteasome pathway. By contrast, HNF4alpha was found to directly
      associate with TEAD4 to compete with YAP1 for binding to TEAD4, thus inhibiting
      the transcriptional activity of YAP-TEAD and expression of their target genes.
      Moreover, overexpression of HNF4alpha was found to significantly compromise
      YAP-TEAD-induced HCC cell proliferation and stem cell expansion. Finally, we
      documented the regulatory mechanism between YAP-TEAD and HNF4alpha in rat and
      mouse tumor models, which confirmed our in vitro results. CONCLUSION: There is a 
      double-negative feedback mechanism that controls TEAD-YAP and HNF4alpha
      expression in vitro and in vivo, thereby regulating cellular proliferation and
      differentiation. Given that YAP acts as a dominant oncogene in HCC and plays a
      crucial role in stem cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration, manipulating the
      interaction between YAP, TEADs, and HNF4alpha may provide a new approach for HCC 
      treatment and regenerative medicine. (Hepatology 2017;65:1206-1221).

TI  - An assessment of benefits and harms of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in
      patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 1196-1205
LID - 10.1002/hep.28895 [doi]
AB  - Although surveillance ultrasound and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) tests have minimal
      direct harm, downstream harms from follow-up tests must be weighed against
      surveillance benefits when determining the value of hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) screening programs. Our study's aims were to characterize prevalence and
      correlates of surveillance benefits and harms in cirrhosis patients undergoing
      HCC surveillance. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with
      cirrhosis followed at a safety-net health system between July 2010 and July 2013.
      We recorded surveillance-related benefits, defined as early tumor detection and
      curative treatment, and surveillance-related physical harms, defined as computed 
      tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, biopsies, or other procedures
      performed for false-positive or indeterminate surveillance results.
      Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of surveillance harms were evaluated
      using multivariable logistic regression. We identified 680 patients with
      cirrhosis, of whom 78 (11.5%) developed HCC during the 3-year study period. Of
      the 48 (61.5%) HCCs identified by surveillance, 43.8% were detected by
      ultrasound, 31.2% by AFP, and 25.0% by both surveillance tests.
      Surveillance-detected patients had a higher proportion of early HCC (70.2% vs.
      40.0%; P = 0.009), with no difference in tumor stage between ultrasound- and
      AFP-detected tumors (P = 0.53). Surveillance-related physical harms were observed
      in 187 (27.5%) patients, with a higher proportion of ultrasound-related harm than
      AFP-related harm (22.8% vs. 11.4%; P < 0.001). Surveillance-related harms were
      associated with elevated ALT (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.26-2.76), thrombocytopenia (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.26-3.38), and hepatology 
      subspecialty care (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.42). CONCLUSION: Over one fourth of
      patients with cirrhosis experience physical harm for false-positive or
      indeterminate surveillance tests-more often related to ultrasound than AFP.
      Interventions are needed to reduce surveillance-related harm to increase the
      value of HCC screening programs in clinical practice. (Hepatology
      2017;65:1196-1205).

TI  - Improved noninvasive prediction of liver fibrosis by liver stiffness measurement 
      in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease accounting for controlled
      attenuation parameter values.

AB  - Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) frequently overestimates the severity of liver 
      fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Controlled attenuation
      parameter (CAP) is a new parameter provided by the same machine used for LSM and 
      associated with both steatosis and body mass index, the two factors mostly
      affecting LSM performance in NAFLD. We aimed to determine whether prediction of
      liver fibrosis by LSM in NAFLD patients is affected by CAP values. Patients (n = 
      324) were assessed by clinical and histological (Kleiner score) features. LSM and
      CAP were performed using the M probe. CAP values were grouped by tertiles (lower 
      132-298, middle 299-338, higher 339-400 dB/m). Among patients with F0-F2
      fibrosis, mean LSM values, expressed in kilopascals, increased according to CAP
      tertiles (6.8 versus 8.6 versus 9.4, P = 0.001), and along this line the area
      under the curve of LSM for the diagnosis of F3-F4 fibrosis was progressively
      reduced from lower to middle and further to higher CAP tertiles (0.915,
      0.848-0.982; 0.830, 0.753-0.908; 0.806, 0.723-0.890). As a consequence, in
      subjects with F0-F2 fibrosis, the rates of false-positive LSM results for F3-F4
      fibrosis increased according to CAP tertiles (7.2% in lower versus 16.6% in
      middle versus 18.1% in higher). Consistent with this, a decisional flowchart for 
      predicting fibrosis was suggested by combining both LSM and CAP values.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NAFLD, CAP values should always be taken into
      account in order to avoid overestimations of liver fibrosis assessed by transient
      elastography. (Hepatology 2017;65:1145-1155).

TI  - Farnesoid X receptor ablation sensitizes mice to hepatitis b virus X
      protein-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
PG  - 893-906
LID - 10.1002/hep.28924 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a hepatitis B virus protein
      that has multiple cellular functions, but its role in HCC pathogenesis has been
      controversial. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor with activities
      in anti-inflammation and inhibition of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, whether or 
      how FXR can impact hepatitis B virus/HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis remains
      unclear. In this study, we showed that HBx can interact with FXR and function as 
      a coactivator of FXR. Expression of HBx in vivo enhanced FXR-responsive gene
      regulation. HBx also increased the transcriptional activity of FXR in a
      luciferase reporter gene assay. The HBx-FXR interaction was confirmed by
      coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, and the FXR
      activation function 1 domain was mapped to bind to the third alpha helix in the C
      terminus of HBx. We also found that the C-terminally truncated variants of HBx,
      which were found in clinical HCC, were not effective at transactivating FXR.
      Interestingly, recruitment of the full-length HBx, but not the C-terminally
      truncated HBx, enhanced the binding of FXR to its response element. In vivo, FXR 
      ablation markedly sensitized mice to HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
      CONCLUSIONS: We propose that transactivation of FXR by full-length HBx may
      represent a protective mechanism to inhibit HCC and that this inhibition may be
      compromised upon the appearance of C-terminally truncated HBx or when the
      expression and/or activity of FXR is decreased. (Hepatology 2017;65:893-906).

TI  - Prostaglandin E2 promotes hepatic bile acid synthesis by an E prostanoid receptor
      3-mediated hepatocyte nuclear receptor 4alpha/cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase
      pathway in mice.
PG  - 999-1014
LID - 10.1002/hep.28928 [doi]
AB  - Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) is an important lipid mediator of inflammation. However,
      whether and how PGE2 regulates hepatic cholesterol metabolism remains unknown. We
      found that expression of the PGE2 receptor, E prostanoid receptor 3 (EP3)
      expression is remarkably increased in hepatocytes in response to hyperlipidemic
      stress. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of EP3 receptor (EP3(hep-/-) ) results in
      hypercholesterolemia and augments diet-induced atherosclerosis in low-density
      lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr(-/-) ) mice. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase
      (CYP7A1) is down-regulated in livers of EP3(hep-/-) Ldlr(-/-) mice, leading to
      suppressed hepatic bile acid (BA) biosynthesis. Mechanistically, hepatic-EP3
      deficiency suppresses CYP7A1 expression by elevating protein kinase A
      (PKA)-dependent Ser143 phosphorylation of hepatocyte nuclear receptor 4alpha
      (HNF4alpha). Disruption of the PKA-HNF4alpha interaction and BA sequestration
      rescue impaired BA excretion and ameliorated atherosclerosis in EP3(hep-/-)
      Ldlr(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an unexpected role of
      proinflammatory mediator PGE2 in improving hepatic cholesterol metabolism through
      activation of the EP3-mediated PKA/HNF4alpha/CYP7A1 pathway, indicating that
      inhibition of this pathway may be a novel therapeutic strategy for dyslipidemia
      and atherosclerosis. (Hepatology 2017;65:999-1014).

TI  - The unfolded protein response mediates fibrogenesis and collagen I secretion
      through regulating TANGO1 in mice.
PG  - 983-998
LID - 10.1002/hep.28921 [doi]
AB  - Fibrogenesis encompasses the deposition of matrix proteins, such as collagen I,
      by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) that culminates in cirrhosis. Fibrogenic signals
      drive transcription of procollagen I, which enters the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER), is trafficked through the secretory pathway, and released to generate
      extracellular matrix. Alternatively, disruption of procollagen I ER export could 
      activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and drive HSC apoptosis. Using a
      small interfering RNA screen, we identified Transport and Golgi organization 1
      (TANGO1) as a potential participant in collagen I secretion. We investigated the 
      role of TANGO1 in procollagen I secretion in HSCs and liver fibrogenesis.
      Depletion of TANGO1 in HSCs blocked collagen I secretion without affecting other 
      matrix proteins. Disruption of secretion led to procollagen I retention within
      the ER, induction of the UPR, and HSC apoptosis. In wild-type (WT) HSCs, both
      TANGO1 and the UPR were induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). As 
      the UPR up-regulates proteins involved in secretion, we studied whether TANGO1
      was a target of the UPR. We found that UPR signaling is responsible for
      up-regulating TANGO1 in response to TGFbeta, and this mechanism is mediated by
      the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). In vivo, murine and
      human cirrhotic tissue displayed increased TANGO1 messenger RNA levels. Finally, 
      TANGO1(+/-) mice displayed less hepatic fibrosis compared to WT mice in two
      separate murine models: CCl4 and bile duct ligation. CONCLUSION: Loss of TANGO1
      leads to procollagen I retention in the ER, which promotes UPR-mediated HSC
      apoptosis. TANGO1 regulation during HSC activation occurs through a UPR-dependent
      mechanism that requires the transcription factor, XBP1. Finally, TANGO1 is
      critical for fibrogenesis through mediating HSC homeostasis. The work reveals a
      unique role for TANGO1 and the UPR in facilitating collagen I secretion and
      fibrogenesis. (Hepatology 2017;65:983-998).

TI  - Combined magnetic resonance elastography and collagen molecular magnetic
      resonance imaging accurately stage liver fibrosis in a rat model.
PG  - 1015-1025
LID - 10.1002/hep.28930 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic fibrosis is associated with an overproduction of matrix proteins and a
      pathological increase of liver stiffness. Noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR)
      quantification of matrix can be assessed with a collagen-binding molecular MR
      probe and stiffness by MR elastography, complementary techniques. This study used
      both imaging techniques to more accurately stage hepatic fibrosis in a rat model.
      Thirty rats with varying levels of diethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis were
      imaged before and 45 minutes after injection of collagen-specific probe EP-3533. 
      MR elastography was performed in the same imaging session. Changes in liver
      relaxation rate post-EP-3533 and liver stiffness were compared to the collagen
      proportional area determined by histology and to Ishak scoring using receiver
      operating characteristic analysis. Collagen imaging was most sensitive to early
      fibrosis, while elastography was more sensitive to advanced fibrosis. This
      complementary feature enabled the formulation of a composite model using
      multivariate analysis of variance. This model incorporated the discriminating
      advantages of both MR techniques, resulting in more accurate staging throughout
      fibrotic progression. CONCLUSION: Collagen molecular MR imaging is complementary 
      to MR elastography, and combining the two techniques in a single exam leads to
      increased diagnostic accuracy for all stages of fibrosis. (Hepatology

TI  - The hepatic "matrisome" responds dynamically to injury: Characterization of
      transitional changes to the extracellular matrix in mice.
PG  - 969-982
LID - 10.1002/hep.28918 [doi]
AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of diverse components that work
      bidirectionally with surrounding cells to create a responsive microenvironment.
      In some contexts (e.g., hepatic fibrosis), changes to the ECM are well recognized
      and understood. However, it is becoming increasingly accepted that the hepatic
      ECM proteome (i.e., matrisome) responds dynamically to stress well before
      fibrosis. The term "transitional tissue remodeling" describes qualitative and
      quantitative ECM changes in response to injury that do not alter the overall
      architecture of the organ; these changes in ECM may contribute to early disease
      initiation and/or progression. The nature and magnitude of these changes to the
      ECM in liver injury are poorly understood. The goals of this work were to
      validate analysis of the ECM proteome and compare the impact of 6 weeks of
      ethanol diet and/or acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Liver sections were processed
      in a series of increasingly rigorous extraction buffers to separate proteins by
      solubility. Extracted proteins were identified using liquid chromatography/tandem
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both ethanol and LPS dramatically increased the
      number of matrisome proteins approximately 25%. The enhancement of LPS-induced
      liver damage by ethanol preexposure was associated with unique protein changes.
      CONCLUSION: An extraction method to enrich the hepatic ECM was characterized. The
      results demonstrate that the hepatic matrisome responds dynamically to both acute
      (LPS) and chronic (ethanol) stresses, long before more-dramatic fibrotic changes 
      to the liver occur. The changes to the mastrisome may contribute, at least in
      part, to the pathological responses to these stresses. It is also interesting
      that several ECM proteins responded similarly to both stresses, suggesting a
      common mechanism in both models. Nevertheless, there were responses that were
      unique to the individual and combined exposures. (Hepatology 2017;65:969-982).

      disease: A cohort study.
PG  - 828-835
LID - 10.1002/hep.28917 [doi]
AB  - The presence of an association between chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
      and fatty liver is controversial. We examined the association between HBV
      infection and the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We
      conducted a cohort study of 83,339 participants without NAFLD at baseline who
      underwent serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) between 2002 
      and 2006 and were followed annually or biennially until December 2014. NAFLD was 
      defined as the presence of ultrasonographic fatty liver in the absence of
      excessive alcohol use or other identifiable causes. We used a parametric Cox
      model to estimate adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals of
      incident NAFLD. During 484,736.1 person-years of follow-up, 20,200 incident NAFLD
      cases were identified. In models adjusted for age, sex, year of visit, smoking
      status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, education level, and body mass index,
      the adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for incident NAFLD comparing 
      HBsAg-positive to HBsAg-negative participants was 0.83 (0.73-0.94). After
      introducing HBV infection and confounders (including homeostasis model assessment
      of insulin resistance and metabolic factors) as time-dependent exposures, the
      association between HBV infection and decreased risk of incident NAFLD was
      attenuated but persisted. These associations were consistently observed across
      clinically relevant, prespecified subgroups. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of 
      apparently healthy Korean adults, HBsAg seropositivity was associated with lower 
      risk of developing NAFLD, indicating a possible effect of HBV infection on the
      pathogenesis of NAFLD development. (Hepatology 2017;65:828-835).

TI  - A practical approach to nutritional screening and assessment in cirrhosis.
PG  - 1044-1057
LID - 10.1002/hep.29003 [doi]
AB  - Malnutrition is one of the most common complications of cirrhosis, associated
      with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. As a potentially modifiable
      condition, it is of particular importance to identify malnourished patients so
      that nutritional therapy can be instituted. Nutrition screening and assessment
      are infrequently performed in patients with cirrhosis. The reasons for this are
      multifactorial, including the absence of a validated "rapid" screening tool,
      multiple definitions of what constitutes malnutrition, and challenges with
      interpreting body composition and laboratory results in the setting of volume
      overload and liver dysfunction. This article summarizes the clinically relevant
      evidence and presents key issues, tools, and clinical options that are applicable
      to patients with cirrhosis. The definition, etiology, and clinically relevant
      outcomes associated with malnutrition are reviewed. Rapid nutritional screening
      is differentiated from more detailed nutritional assessment. Nutritional
      assessment in special populations, including women and the obese, and the role of
      inflammation are discussed. Multicenter studies using a common nutritional
      screening/assessment strategy are the next steps to fast-track adoption and
      implementation of nutrition-related evaluations into routine clinical practice.

TI  - Reduction in liver transplant wait-listing in the era of direct-acting antiviral 
      therapy.
PG  - 804-812
LID - 10.1002/hep.28923 [doi]
AB  - Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, recently approved for patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis (DC) secondary to hepatitis C virus (HCV), is associated 
      with improved hepatic function. We analyzed trends in liver transplant (LT)
      wait-listing (WL) to explore potential impact of effective medical therapy on WL 
      registration. This is a cohort study using the Scientific Registry of Transplant 
      Recipients database from 2003 to 2015. A total of 47,591 adults wait-listed for
      LT from HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
      were identified. LT indication was defined as DC if the Model for End-Stage Liver
      Disease (MELD) at WL was >/=15 or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Era of listing 
      was divided into interferon (IFN; 2003-2010), protease inhibitor (PI; 2011-2013),
      and direct-acting antiviral (DAA; 2014-2015). Annual standardized incidence rates
      of WL were analyzed using Poisson regression. Adjusted incidences of LT WL for DC
      in HCV patients decreased by 5% in the PI era (P = 0.004) and 32% in the DAA era 
      (P < 0.001) compared to the IFN era. Listing for DC in HBV also decreased in the 
      PI (-17%; P = 0.002) and DAA eras (-24%; P < 0.001). Conversely, WL for DC in
      NASH increased by 41% in the PI era (P < 0.001) and 81% in the DAA era (P <
      0.001). WL for HCC in both the HCV and NASH populations increased in both the PI 
      and DAA eras (P < 0.001 for all) whereas HCC WL in HBV remained stable (P > 0.05 
      for all). CONCLUSION: The rate of LT WL for HCV complicated by DC has decreased
      by over 30% in the era of DAA therapy. Further reductions in WL are anticipated
      with increased testing, linkage to care, and access to DAA therapy. (Hepatology

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected adults with non-genotype 3
      hepatitis C virus have less hepatic steatosis than adults with neither infection.
PG  - 853-863
LID - 10.1002/hep.28968 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic steatosis (HS) is common in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, but the independent contributions 
      of HCV and HIV to HS are unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy
      were used to measure visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat fraction (LFF)
      (total lipids/[total lipids + water]) in 356 adults: 57 with HCV monoinfection,
      70 with HIV/HCV coinfection, 122 with HIV monoinfection, and 107 with neither
      infection. Participants who were infected with HCV genotype 3 were excluded
      because of the genotype's reported steatogenic effects. For prevalence estimates,
      HS was defined as LFF >/= 0.05. We estimated the association of HIV and HCV
      status with LFF using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for
      demographics, lifestyle, and metabolic factors including the homeostasis model
      assessment estimate of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and liver fibrosis defined
      using the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). The
      prevalence of HS was highest in the uninfected (33%) and HIV-monoinfected (28%), 
      followed by the HCV-monoinfected (19%) and HIV/HCV-coinfected (11%) (P = 0.003
      across groups). Compared with uninfected participants-and after adjusting for
      demographics, lifestyle, and metabolic factors-HIV monoinfection, HCV
      monoinfection, and HIV/HCV coinfection were associated with 19% (95% confidence
      interval [CI], -39% to 6%), 38% (95% CI, -55% to -12%), and 42% (95% CI, -59% to 
      -18%) lower LFF, respectively. HCV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection remained
      strongly associated with lower LFF after further adjusting for APRI, and results 
      were unchanged after excluding subjects with suspected cirrhosis. Among the
      entire cohort, Hispanic ethnicity, male sex, VAT, and HOMA-IR were independently 
      associated with greater LFF. CONCLUSION: Contrary to expectations,
      HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected adults had significantly less liver fat
      than uninfected adults, even after adjusting for demographics, lifestyle,
      metabolic factors, and hepatic fibrosis. Our findings suggest that non-genotype 3
      HCV infection may be protective against HS. The mechanisms by which this occurs
      and the impact of HCV treatment on HS requires further investigation. (Hepatology
      2017;65:853-863).

TI  - Long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid for the
      treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.
PG  - 920-928
LID - 10.1002/hep.28932 [doi]
AB  - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune liver
      disease that mainly affects middle-aged women. Obeticholic acid (OCA), which was 
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for PBC treatment, has
      demonstrated positive effects on biochemical markers of liver function. Our
      objective was to evaluate the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of
      OCA as a second-line treatment for PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid
      (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. We developed a mathematical
      model to simulate the lifetime course of PBC patients treated with OCA+UDCA
      versus UDCA alone. Efficacy data were derived from the phase 3 PBC OCA
      International Study of Efficacy trial, and the natural history of PBC was
      informed by published clinical studies. Model outcomes were validated using the
      PBC Global Study. We found that in comparison with UDCA, OCA+UDCA could decrease 
      the 15-year cumulative incidences of decompensated cirrhosis from 12.2% to 4.5%, 
      hepatocellular carcinoma from 9.1% to 4.0%, liver transplants from 4.5% to 1.2%, 
      and liver-related deaths from 16.2% to 5.7% and increase 15-year transplant-free 
      survival from 61.1% to 72.9%. The lifetime cost of PBC treatment would increase
      from $63,000 to $902,000 (1,330% increment). The discounted quality-adjusted life
      years with UDCA and OCA+UDCA were 10.74 and 11.78, respectively, and the
      corresponding costs were $142,300 and $633,900, resulting in an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of $473,400/quality-adjusted life year gained. The
      results were most sensitive to the cost of OCA. CONCLUSION: OCA is a promising
      new therapy to substantially improve the long-term outcomes of PBC patients, but 
      at its current annual price of $69,350, it is not cost-effective using a
      willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year; pricing
      below $18,450/year is needed to make OCA cost-effective. (Hepatology
      2017;65:920-928).

TI  - Optimal timing of hepatitis C treatment for patients on the liver transplant
      waiting list.
PG  - 777-788
LID - 10.1002/hep.28926 [doi]
AB  - The availability of oral direct-acting antivirals has altered the hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) treatment paradigm for both pre-liver transplant (LT) and post-LT
      patients. There is a perceived trade-off between pre-LT versus post-LT treatment 
      of HCV-treatment may improve liver function but potentially decrease the
      likelihood of a necessary LT. Our objective was to identify LT-eligible patients 
      with decompensated cirrhosis who would benefit (and not benefit) from pre-LT
      treatment based on their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. We
      simulated a virtual trial comparing long-term outcomes of pre-LT versus post-LT
      HCV treatment with oral direct-acting antivirals for patients with MELD scores
      between 10 and 40. We developed a Markov-based microsimulation model, which
      simulated the life course of patients on the transplant waiting list and after
      LT. Simulation of LT integrated data from recent trials of oral direct-acting
      antivirals (SOLAR 1 and 2), the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), and
      other studies. The outcomes of the model included life expectancy, 1-year and
      5-year patient survival, and mortality. Model-predicted patient survival was
      validated with UNOS data. We found that, at the national level, treating HCV
      before LT increased life expectancy if MELD was </=27 but could decrease life
      expectancy at higher MELD scores. Depending on the UNOS region, the threshold
      MELD score to treat HCV pre-LT varied between 23 and 27 and was lower for UNOS
      regions 3, 10, and 11 and higher for regions 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Sensitivity
      analysis showed that the thresholds were stable. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest
      that the optimal MELD threshold below which decompensated cirrhosis patients
      should receive HCV treatment while awaiting LT is between 23 and 27, depending on
      the UNOS region. (Hepatology 2017;65:777-788).

TI  - Validation of the prognostic value of histologic scoring systems in primary
      sclerosing cholangitis: An international cohort study.
PG  - 907-919
LID - 10.1002/hep.28963 [doi]
AB  - Histologic scoring systems specific for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are 
      not validated. We recently determined the applicability and prognostic value of
      three histological scoring systems in a single PSC cohort. The aim of this study 
      was to validate their prognostic use and reproducibility across a multicenter PSC
      cohort. Liver biopsies from PSC patients were collected from seven European
      institutions. Histologic scoring was performed using the Nakanuma, Ishak, and
      Ludwig scoring systems. Biopsies were independently scored by six liver
      pathologists for interobserver agreement. The prognostic value of clinical,
      biochemical, and all three histologic scoring systems on predicting composite
      endpoints 1 (PSC-related death and liver transplantation), 2 (liver
      transplantation), and 3 (liver-related events), was assessed using univariable
      and multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling. A total of 119 PSC patients 
      were identified, and the median follow-up was 142 months. During follow-up, 31
      patients died (20 PSC-related deaths), 31 patients underwent liver
      transplantation, and 35 patients experienced one or more liver-related events.
      All three staging systems were independent predictors of endpoints 2 and 3
      (Nakanuma system: hazard ratio [HR], 3.16 [95% confidence interval (CI),
      1.49-6.68] for endpoint 2 and HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.17-3.57] for endpoint 3; Ishak 
      system: HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.10-2.18] for endpoint 2 and HR, 1.43 [95% CI,
      1.10-1.85] for endpoint 3; Ludwig system: HR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.19-5.80] for
      endpoint 2 and HR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.09-3.89] for endpoint 3). Only the Nakanuma
      staging system was independently associated with endpoint 1: HR, 2.14 (95% CI,
      1.22-3.77). Interobserver agreement was moderate for Nakanuma stage (kappa =
      0.56) and substantial for Nakanuma component fibrosis (kappa = 0.67), Ishak stage
      (kappa = 0.64), and Ludwig stage (kappa = 0.62). CONCLUSION: We confirm the
      independent prognostic value and demonstrate for the first time the
      reproducibility of staging disease progression in PSC using the Nakanuma, Ishak, 
      and Ludwig staging systems. The Nakanuma staging system-incorporating features of
      chronic biliary disease-again showed the strongest predictive value. (Hepatology

TI  - A novel glucagon-like peptide 1/glucagon receptor dual agonist improves
      steatohepatitis and liver regeneration in mice.
PG  - 950-968
LID - 10.1002/hep.28962 [doi]
AB  - Because nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with impaired liver
      regeneration, we investigated the effects of G49, a dual glucagon-like
      peptide-1/glucagon receptor agonist, on NASH and hepatic regeneration. C57Bl/6
      mice fed chow or a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 1 week were
      divided into 4 groups: control (chow diet), MCD diet, chow diet plus G49, and
      M+G49 (MCD diet plus G49). Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks were
      divided into groups: HFD and H+G49 (HFD plus G49). Following 2 (MCD groups) or 3 
      (HFD groups) weeks of treatment with G49, partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed,
      and all mice were maintained on the same treatment schedule for 2 additional
      weeks. Analysis of liver function, hepatic regeneration, and comprehensive
      genomic and metabolic profiling were conducted. NASH was ameliorated in the M+G49
      group, manifested by reduced inflammation, steatosis, oxidative stress, and
      apoptosis and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. G49 treatment was also
      associated with replenishment of intrahepatic glucose due to enhanced
      gluconeogenesis and reduced glucose use through the pentose phosphate cycle and
      oxidative metabolism. Following PH, G49 treatment increased survival, restored
      the cytokine-mediated priming phase, and enhanced the proliferative capacity and 
      hepatic regeneration ratio in mice on the MCD diet. NASH markers remained
      decreased in M+G49 mice after PH, and glucose use was shifted to the pentose
      phosphate cycle and oxidative metabolism. G49 administered immediately after PH
      was also effective at alleviating the pathological changes induced by the MCD
      diet. Benefits in terms of liver regeneration were also found in mice fed HFD and
      treated with G49. CONCLUSION: Dual-acting glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon
      receptor agonists such as G49 represent a novel therapeutic approach for patients
      with NASH and particularly those requiring PH. (Hepatology 2017;65:950-968).

TI  - Hepatitis C virus infection triggers a tumor-like glutamine metabolism.
PG  - 789-803
LID - 10.1002/hep.28949 [doi]
AB  - Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the main causes of
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the infection
      to cancer development remain poorly understood. Here we used HCV-infected cells
      and liver biopsies to study how HCV modulates the glutaminolysis pathway, which
      is known to play an important role in cellular energetics, stress defense, and
      neoplastic transformation. Transcript levels of glutaminolytic factors were
      quantified in Huh7.5 cells or primary human hepatocytes infected with the
      Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 HCV strain as well as in biopsies of chronic HCV
      patients. Nutrient deprivation, biochemical analysis, and metabolite
      quantification were performed with HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, short 
      hairpin RNA vectors and small molecule inhibitors were used to investigate the
      dependence of HCV replication on metabolic changes. We show that HCV modulates
      the transcript levels of key enzymes of glutamine metabolism in vitro and in
      liver biopsies of chronic HCV patients. Consistently, HCV infection increases
      glutamine use and dependence. We finally show that inhibiting glutamine
      metabolism attenuates HCV infection and the oxidative stress associated with HCV 
      infection. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that HCV establishes glutamine
      dependence, which is required for viral replication, and, importantly, that
      glutamine addiction is a hallmark of tumor cells. While HCV induces
      glutaminolysis to create an environment favorable for viral replication, it
      predisposes the cell to transformation. Glutaminolytic enzymes may be interesting
      therapeutic targets for prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis
      C. (Hepatology 2017;65:789-803).

TI  - Risk for alcoholic liver cirrhosis after an initial hospital contact with alcohol
      problems: A nationwide prospective cohort study.
PG  - 929-937
LID - 10.1002/hep.28943 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic liver cirrhosis is usually preceded by many years of heavy drinking, in
      which cessation in drinking could prevent the disease. Alcohol problems are not
      consistently managed in hospital patients. We followed all Danish patients with
      an initial hospital contact with alcohol problems (intoxication, harmful use, or 
      dependence) during 1998-2002 for alcoholic liver cirrhosis development (n =
      36,044). In this registry-based cohort, we identified predictors of the absolute 
      risk for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated
      as the incidence rate of alcoholic liver cirrhosis in these patients relative to 
      the general population. Age and alcohol diagnosis were significant predictors of 
      alcoholic liver cirrhosis risk in men and women, whereas civil status, education,
      and type of hospital care were not. In men, the 15-year absolute risk was 0.7%
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4, 0.8) for 20-29 years, 5.5% (95% CI, 4.9, 6.2)
      for 30-39 years, 9.8% (95% CI, 9.0, 11) for 40-49 years, 8.9% (95% CI, 8.1, 9.8) 
      for 50-59 years, 6.2% (95% CI, 5.1, 7.2) for 60-69 years, and 2.5% (95% CI, 1.7, 
      3.3) for 70-84 years. According to alcohol diagnosis in men, the 15-year absolute
      risk was 2.6% (95% CI, 2.3, 2.9) for intoxication, 7.7% (95% CI, 6.4, 7.9) for
      harmful use, and 8.8% (95% CI, 8.2, 9.4) for dependence. The IRR for alcoholic
      liver cirrhosis in the cohort relative to the general population was 11 (95% CI, 
      10, 12) in men and 18 (95% CI, 15, 21) in women. CONCLUSION: Hospital patients
      with alcohol problems had a much greater risk for alcoholic liver cirrhosis
      compared to the general population. The risk was particularly increased for
      patients 40-59 years and for patients diagnosed with harmful use or dependence.

AB  - Blocking hepatic very low-density lipoprotein secretion through genetic or
      pharmacologic inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp)
      causes hepatic steatosis, yet the risks for developing hepatic fibrosis are
      poorly understood. We report that liver-specific Mttp knockout mice (Mttp-LKO)
      exhibit both steatosis and fibrosis, which is exacerbated by a
      high-transfat/fructose diet. When crossed into germline liver fatty acid (FA)
      binding protein null mice (Mttp-LKO, i.e., double knockout mice) hepatic
      steatosis was greatly diminished and fibrosis prevented, on both low-fat and
      high-fat diets. The mechanisms underlying protection include reduced long chain
      FA uptake, shifts in FA distribution (lipidomic profiling), and metabolic
      turnover, specifically decreased hepatic 18:2 FA and triglyceride species and a
      shift in 18:2 FA use for oxidation versus incorporation into newly synthesized
      triglyceride. Double knockout mice were protected against fasting-induced hepatic
      steatosis (a model of enhanced exogenous FA delivery) yet developed steatosis
      upon induction of hepatic de novo lipogenesis with fructose feeding. Mttp-LKO
      mice, on either the liver FA binding protein null or Apobec-1 null background
      (i.e., apolipoprotein B100 only) exhibited only subtle increases in endoplasmic
      reticulum stress, suggesting that an altered unfolded protein response is
      unlikely to account for the attenuated phenotype in double knockout mice. Acute, 
      antisense-mediated liver FA binding protein knockdown in Mttp-LKO mice also
      reduced FA uptake, increased oxidation versus incorporation of 18:2 species with 
      complete reversal of hepatic steatosis, increased hepatic injury, and worsened
      fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Perturbing exogenous hepatic FA use modulates both hepatic 
      steatosis and fibrosis in the setting of hepatic Mttp deletion, adding new
      insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms and consequences of defective very
      low-density lipoprotein secretion. (Hepatology 2017;65:836-852).

TI  - Pediatric acute liver failure of undetermined cause: A research workshop.
PG  - 1026-1037
LID - 10.1002/hep.28944 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a potentially devastating condition that 
      occurs in previously healthy children of all ages and frequently leads to a rapid
      clinical deterioration. An identified cause for liver injury is lacking in
      approximately 30% of cases. Children with undetermined diagnosis have lower
      spontaneous survival and higher rates of transplantation and death than other
      diagnostic groups. A single-day workshop sponsored by the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases brought together clinicians and basic 
      scientists to integrate aligned research findings and develop a foundation for
      new mechanistic studies and future treatment trials. The clinical phenotype of
      indeterminate PALF shares important similarities to the hyperinflammatory state
      characteristic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage
      activation syndrome (MAS). A failure of cytotoxic T cells to limit or contract
      inflammatory responses may propagate injury and lead to a local and systemic
      milieu that does not support normal hepatic regeneration. Evidence was presented 
      that bone marrow (BM)-derived Sinusoidal endothelial cell PROgenitor Cells
      (sprocs) play a vital role in hepatic regeneration. Overwhelming systemic
      inflammatory responses may suppress mobilization of BM sprocs and dampen hepatic 
      recovery. CONCLUSION: Experience gained through treatment trials of HLH and MAS
      in childhood may inform study design for therapy of PALF. Successful approaches
      to limiting neuroinflammation through reduction of systemic inflammation and
      standardized neuroprotection protocols that limit glial injury could
      significantly improve intact survival. Finally, given that PALF is a rare
      disease, investigative efforts must include broad multicenter collaboration and
      careful stewardship of biorepository specimens. (Hepatology 2017;65:1026-1037).

AB  - Liver fibrosis results from chronic liver injury of different etiologies. It is
      characterized by dysregulation of physiological remodeling, activation of
      myofibroblasts, and formation of a fibrous scar. Myofibroblasts develop
      contractile functions and secrete the extracellular matrix proteins that form
      this fibrous scar. Myofibroblasts are not present in the normal liver but
      activate and proliferate in response to injury and inflammation. This review
      summarizes the understanding and controversies on the contribution of cell
      populations to the myofibroblasts in liver fibrosis. (Hepatology

TI  - Elevated FABP1 serum levels are associated with poorer survival in
      acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure.

LID - 10.1002/hep.28945 [doi]
AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with
      significant mortality. Traditional prognostic scores lack sensitivity. Serum
      liver-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) early (day 1) or late (day 3-5)
      levels are associated with 21-day mortality in the absence of liver transplant.
      Serum samples from 198 APAP-ALF patients (nested case-control study with 99
      survivors, 99 nonsurvivors) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      with clinical data from the US Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry
      (1998-2014). APAP-ALF survivors had significantly lower serum FABP1 levels early 
      (238.6 versus 690.8 ng/mL, P < 0.0001) and late (148.4 versus 612.3 ng/mL, P <
      0.0001) compared with nonsurvivors. FABP1 > 350 ng/mL was associated with
      significantly higher risk of death at early (P = 0.0004) and late (P < 0.0001)
      time points. Increased serum FABP1 early (log FABP1 odds ratio = 1.31, P = 0.027)
      and late (log FABP1 odds ratio = 1.50, P = 0.005) were associated with
      significantly increased 21-day mortality after adjusting for significant
      covariates (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, vasopressor use). Areas under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve for early and late multivariable models
      were 0.778 and 0.907, respectively. The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve of the King's College criteria (early, 0.552 alone, 0.711
      with FABP1; late, 0.604 alone, 0.797 with FABP1) and the Acute Liver Failure
      Study Group prognostic index (early, 0.686 alone, 0.766 with FABP1; late, 0.711
      alone, 0.815 with FABP1) significantly improved with the addition of FABP1 (P <
      0.002 for all). CONCLUSION: In patients with APAP-ALF, FABP1 may have good
      potential to discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors and may improve models
      currently used in clinical practice; validation of FABP1 as a clinical prediction
      tool in APAP-ALF warrants further investigation. (Hepatology 2017;65:938-949).

TI  - The underreporting of hepatocellular carcinoma to the cancer register and a
      log-linear model to estimate a more correct incidence.
PG  - 885-892
LID - 10.1002/hep.28775 [doi]
AB  - The Cancer Register (CR) in Sweden has reported that the incidence of primary
      liver cancer (PLC) has slowly declined over the last decades. Even though all
      cancers, irrespective of diagnostic method, should be reported to the CR, the PLC
      incidence may not reflect the true rate. Improved diagnostic tools have enabled
      diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma based on noninvasive methods without
      histological verification, possibly associated with missed cancer reports or
      misclassification in the CR. Our objective was to study the completeness and
      assess the underreporting of PLC to the CR and to produce a more accurate
      estimate based on three registers. The CR, the Cause of Death Register, and the
      Patient Register were investigated. Differences and overlap were examined, the
      incidence was estimated by merging data from the registers, and the number
      reported to none of the registers was estimated using a log-linear
      capture-recapture model. The results show that 98% of the PLCs reported to the CR
      were histologically verified; 80% were hepatocellular carcinoma and 20% were
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Unspecified liver cancer decreased over time and
      constituted <10% of all reported liver cancers. The CR may underestimate the
      liver cancer incidence by 37%-45%, primarily due to missed cancer reports. The
      estimated annual number of liver cancers increased over time, but the
      standardized incidence was stable around 11 per 100,000. Hepatitis C-associated
      liver cancer increased and constituted 20% in 2010. CONCLUSION: There was an
      underreporting of PLC diagnosed by noninvasive methods; the incidence was
      considerably higher than estimated by the CR, with a stable incidence over time; 
      reporting needs to improve and combining registers is recommended when studying
      incidence. (Hepatology 2017;65:885-892).

AB  - Over 20% of patients with cirrhosis are nonadherent with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) surveillance recommendations; however, few studies have evaluated the
      impact of patient-level factors on surveillance receipt. We characterized the
      association between HCC surveillance receipt and patient knowledge, attitudes,
      and perceived barriers in a racially diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged 
      cohort of patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis followed at a large
      urban hospital were invited to complete a survey about HCC surveillance between
      August 2014 and December 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
      identify factors associated with HCC surveillance receipt during the 12-month
      period preceding and 6-month period after survey administration. We achieved a
      response rate of 71.8% (n = 541 of 753). Patients demonstrated high levels of
      HCC-related knowledge (summary score, 77.7%); however, 48.6% believed that eating
      a healthy diet precluded the need for HCC surveillance, and 34.0% believed that
      HCC surveillance was not necessary if they had a normal physical exam and/or
      lacked clinical symptoms. Patients expressed worry about developing and dying
      from HCC, but nearly half (49.9%) of patients reported barriers to receiving HCC 
      surveillance, including difficulty with the scheduling process (30.5%), costs of 
      surveillance testing (25.3%), and transportation difficulties (17.3%). HCC
      surveillance receipt was significantly higher in patients who knew cirrhosis is a
      risk factor for developing HCC (odds ratio [OR], 3.09; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.25-7.62) and significantly lower in those reporting barriers to
      surveillance (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25-0.70). CONCLUSION: Patients with cirrhosis
      are knowledgeable and interested in HCC surveillance; however, patient-reported
      barriers are associated with lower surveillance rates in clinical practice and
      represent potential intervention targets to improve HCC surveillance
      effectiveness. (Hepatology 2017;65:875-884).

TI  - Identifying barriers to hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in a national
      sample of patients with cirrhosis.
PG  - 864-874
LID - 10.1002/hep.28765 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
      cirrhosis patients. This provides an opportunity to target the highest-risk
      population, yet surveillance rates in the United States and Europe range from 10%
      to 40%. The goal of this study was to identify barriers to HCC surveillance,
      using data from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest provider of
      liver-related health care in the United States. We included all patients 75 years
      of age or younger who were diagnosed with cirrhosis from January 1, 2008, until
      December 31, 2010. The primary outcome was a continuous measure of the percentage
      of time up-to-date with HCC surveillance (PTUDS) based on abdominal ultrasound
      (secondary outcomes included computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging).
      Among 26,577 patients with cirrhosis (median follow-up = 4.7 years), the mean
      PTUDS was 17.8 +/- 21.5% (ultrasounds) and 23.3 +/- 24.1% when any liver imaging 
      modality was included. The strongest predictor of increased PTUDS was the number 
      of visits to a specialist (gastroenterologist/hepatologist and/or infectious
      diseases) in the first year after cirrhosis diagnosis; the association between
      visits to a primary care physician and increasing surveillance was very small.
      Increasing distance to the closest Veterans Administration center was associated 
      with decreased PTUDS. There was an inverse association between ultrasound lead
      time (difference between the date an ultrasound was ordered and requested exam
      date) and the odds of it being performed: odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence
      interval 0.72-0.82 when ordered > 180 days ahead of time; odds ratio = 0.90, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.85-0.94 if lead time 91-180 days. CONCLUSIONS: The
      responsibility for suboptimal surveillance rests with patients, providers, and
      the overall health care system; several measures can be implemented to
      potentially increase HCC surveillance, including increasing patient-specialist
      visits and minimizing appointment lead time. (Hepatology 2017;65:864-874).

TI  - G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor plays a key role in bile acid metabolism and
      fasting-induced hepatic steatosis in mice.
PG  - 813-827
LID - 10.1002/hep.28707 [doi]
AB  - Bile acids are signaling molecules that play a critical role in regulation of
      hepatic metabolic homeostasis by activating nuclear farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)
      and membrane G-protein-coupled receptor (Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5;
      Tgr5). The role of FXR in regulation of bile acid synthesis and hepatic
      metabolism has been studied extensively. However, the role of TGR5 in hepatic
      metabolism has not been explored. The liver plays a central role in lipid
      metabolism, and impaired response to fasting and feeding contributes to steatosis
      and nonalcoholic fatty liver and obesity. We have performed a detailed analysis
      of gallbladder bile acid and lipid metabolism in Tgr5(-/-) mice in both free-fed 
      and fasted conditions. Lipid profiles of serum, liver and adipose tissues, bile
      acid composition, energy metabolism, and messenger RNA and protein expression of 
      the genes involved in lipid metabolism were analyzed. Results showed that
      deficiency of the Tgr5 gene in mice alleviated fasting-induced hepatic lipid
      accumulation. Expression of liver oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase in the alternative
      bile acid synthesis pathway was reduced. Analysis of gallbladder bile acid
      composition showed marked increase of taurocholic acid and decrease of
      tauro-alpha and beta-muricholic acid in Tgr5(-/-) mice. Tgr5(-/-) mice had
      increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation rate and decreased hepatic fatty acid
      uptake. Interestingly, fasting induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 in liver 
      was attenuated. In addition, fasted Tgr5(-/-) mice had increased activation of
      hepatic growth hormone-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
      (GH-Stat5) signaling compared to wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: TGR5 may play a role
      in determining bile acid composition and in fasting-induced hepatic steatosis
      through a novel mechanism involving activation of the GH-Stat5 signaling pathway.

TI  - Loss of the transforming growth factor-beta effector beta2-Spectrin promotes
      genomic instability.
PG  - 678-693
LID - 10.1002/hep.28927 [doi]
AB  - Exposure to genotoxins such as ethanol-derived acetaldehyde leads to DNA damage
      and liver injury and promotes the development of cancer. We report here a major
      role for the transforming growth factor beta/mothers against decapentaplegic
      homolog 3 adaptor beta2-Spectrin (beta2SP, gene Sptbn1) in maintaining genomic
      stability following alcohol-induced DNA damage. beta2SP supports DNA repair
      through beta2SP-dependent activation of Fanconi anemia complementation group D2
      (Fancd2), a core component of the Fanconi anemia complex. Loss of beta2SP leads
      to decreased Fancd2 levels and sensitizes beta2SP mutants to DNA damage by
      ethanol treatment, leading to phenotypes that closely resemble those observed in 
      animals lacking both aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 and Fancd2 and resemble human fetal
      alcohol syndrome. Sptbn1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to DNA crosslinking
      agents and have defective DNA double-strand break repair that is rescued by
      ectopic Fancd2 expression. Moreover, Fancd2 transcription in response to DNA
      damage/transforming growth factor beta stimulation is regulated by the
      beta2SP/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 complex. CONCLUSION:
      Dysfunctional transforming growth factor beta/beta2SP signaling impacts the
      processing of genotoxic metabolites by altering the Fanconi anemia DNA repair
      pathway. (Hepatology 2017;65:678-693).

TI  - Deregulated neddylation in liver fibrosis.
PG  - 694-709
LID - 10.1002/hep.28933 [doi]
AB  - Hepatic fibrosis is a global health problem currently without effective
      therapeutic approaches. Even though the ubiquitin-like posttranslational
      modification of neddylation, that conjugates Nedd8 (neural precursor cell
      expressed developmentally downregulated) to specific targets, is aberrant in many
      pathologies, its relevance in liver fibrosis (LF) remained unexplored. Our
      results show deregulated neddylation in clinical fibrosis and both in mouse
      bileductligation- and CCl4 -induced fibrosis. Importantly, neddylation
      inhibition, by using the pharmacological inhibitor, MLN4924, reduced liver
      injury, apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis by targeting different hepatic cell
      types. On one hand, increased neddylation was associated with augmented caspase 3
      activity in bile-acid-induced apoptosis in mouse hepatocytes whereas neddylation 
      inhibition ameliorated apoptosis through reduction of expression of the Cxcl1 and
      Ccl2 chemokines. On the other hand, chemokine receptors and cytokines, usually
      induced in activated macrophages, were reduced after neddylation inhibition in
      mouse Kupffer cells. Under these circumstances, decreased hepatocyte cell death
      and inflammation after neddylation inhibition could partly account for reduction 
      of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. We provide evidence that augmented
      neddylation characterizes activated HSCs, suggesting that neddylation inhibition 
      could be important for resolving LF by directly targeting these fibrogenic cells.
      Indeed, neddylation inhibition in activated HSCs induces apoptosis in a process
      partly mediated by accumulation of c-Jun, whose cullin-mediated degradation is
      impaired under these circumstances. CONCLUSION: Neddylation inhibition reduces
      fibrosis, suggesting neddylation as a potential and attractive therapeutic target
      in liver fibrosis. (Hepatology 2017;65:694-709).

TI  - Functional defect of variants in the adenosine triphosphate-binding sites of
      ABCB4 and their rescue by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770).
PG  - 560-570
LID - 10.1002/hep.28929 [doi]
AB  - ABCB4 (MDR3) is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporter expressed at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, where it
      mediates phosphatidylcholine (PC) secretion. Variations in the ABCB4 gene are
      responsible for several biliary diseases, including progressive familial
      intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), a rare disease that can be lethal in the
      absence of liver transplantation. In this study, we investigated the effect and
      potential rescue of ABCB4 missense variations that reside in the highly conserved
      motifs of ABC transporters, involved in ATP binding. Five disease-causing
      variations in these motifs have been identified in ABCB4 (G535D, G536R, S1076C,
      S1176L, and G1178S), three of which are homologous to the gating mutations of
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR or ABCC7; i.e., G551D, 
      S1251N, and G1349D), that were previously shown to be function defective and
      corrected by ivacaftor (VX-770; Kalydeco), a clinically approved CFTR
      potentiator. Three-dimensional structural modeling predicted that all five ABCB4 
      variants would disrupt critical interactions in the binding of ATP and thereby
      impair ATP-induced nucleotide-binding domain dimerization and ABCB4 function.
      This prediction was confirmed by expression in cell models, which showed that the
      ABCB4 mutants were normally processed and targeted to the plasma membrane,
      whereas their PC secretion activity was dramatically decreased. As also
      hypothesized on the basis of molecular modeling, PC secretion activity of the
      mutants was rescued by the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770). CONCLUSION:
      Disease-causing variations in the ATP-binding sites of ABCB4 cause defects in PC 
      secretion, which can be rescued by ivacaftor. These results provide the first
      experimental evidence that ivacaftor is a potential therapy for selected patients
      who harbor mutations in the ATP-binding sites of ABCB4. (Hepatology
      2017;65:560-570).

TI  - The ascending pathophysiology of cholestatic liver disease.
PG  - 722-738
LID - 10.1002/hep.28965 [doi]
AB  - In this review we develop the argument that cholestatic liver diseases,
      particularly primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (PSC), evolve over time with anatomically an ascending course of the disease
      process. The first and early lesions are in "downstream" bile ducts. This
      eventually leads to cholestasis, and this causes bile salt (BS)-mediated toxic
      injury of the "upstream" liver parenchyma. BS are toxic in high concentration.
      These concentrations are present in the canalicular network, bile ducts, and
      gallbladder. Leakage of bile from this network and ducts could be an important
      driver of toxicity. The liver has a great capacity to adapt to cholestasis, and
      this may contribute to a variable symptom-poor interval that is often observed.
      Current trials with drugs that target BS toxicity are effective in only about
      50%-60% of primary biliary cholangitis patients, with no effective therapy in
      PSC. This motivated us to develop and propose a new view on the pathophysiology
      of primary biliary cholangitis and PSC in the hope that these new drugs can be
      used more effectively. These views may lead to better stratification of these
      diseases and to recommendations on a more "tailored" use of the new therapeutic
      agents that are currently tested in clinical trials. Apical sodium-dependent BS
      transporter inhibitors that reduce intestinal BS absorption lower the BS load and
      are best used in cholestatic patients. The effectiveness of BS
      synthesis-suppressing drugs, such as farnesoid X receptor agonists, is greatest
      when optimal adaptation is not yet established. By the time cytochrome P450 7A1
      expression is reduced these drugs may be less effective. Anti-inflammatory agents
      are probably most effective in early disease, while drugs that antagonize BS
      toxicity, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and nor-ursodeoxycholic acid, may be
      effective at all disease stages. Endoscopic stenting in PSC should be reserved
      for situations of intercurrent cholestasis and cholangitis, not for cholestasis
      in end-stage disease. These are arguments to consider a step-wise pathophysiology
      for these diseases, with therapy adjusted to disease stage. An obstacle in such
      an approach is that disease stage-defining biomarkers are still lacking. This
      review is meant to serve as a call to prioritize the development of biomarkers
      that help to obtain a better stratification of these diseases. (Hepatology

TI  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis promotes liver regeneration.
PG  - 616-630
LID - 10.1002/hep.28912 [doi]
AB  - The regenerative capacity of the liver is essential for recovery from surgical
      resection or injuries induced by trauma or toxins. During liver regeneration, the
      concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) falls, at least in part 
      due to metabolic competition for precursors. To test whether NAD availability
      restricts the rate of liver regeneration, we supplied nicotinamide riboside (NR),
      an NAD precursor, in the drinking water of mice subjected to partial hepatectomy.
      NR increased DNA synthesis, mitotic index, and mass restoration in the
      regenerating livers. Intriguingly, NR also ameliorated the steatosis that
      normally accompanies liver regeneration. To distinguish the role of hepatocyte
      NAD levels from any systemic effects of NR, we generated mice overexpressing
      nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme for NAD synthesis,
      specifically in the liver. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase overexpressing 
      mice were mildly hyperglycemic at baseline and, similar to mice treated with NR, 
      exhibited enhanced liver regeneration and reduced steatosis following partial
      hepatectomy. Conversely, mice lacking nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in
      hepatocytes exhibited impaired regenerative capacity that was completely rescued 
      by administering NR. CONCLUSION: NAD availability is limiting during liver
      regeneration, and supplementation with precursors such as NR may be therapeutic
      in settings of acute liver injury. (Hepatology 2017;65:616-630).

TI  - Development and validation of a mathematical equation to estimate glomerular
      filtration rate in cirrhosis: The royal free hospital cirrhosis glomerular
      filtration rate.
PG  - 582-591
LID - 10.1002/hep.28891 [doi]
AB  - Current expressions based on serum creatinine concentration overestimate kidney
      function in cirrhosis, leading to significant differences between "true" and
      calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We compared the performance of the
      four-variable and six-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and chronic 
      kidney disease epidemiology with "true," or measured, GFR (mGFR) and the impact
      of this difference on Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) calculation. We
      subsequently developed and validated a GFR equation specifically for cirrhosis
      and compared the performance of the new derived formula with existing GFR
      formulae. We included 469 consecutive patients who had a transplant assessment
      between 2011 and 2014. mGFR was measured using plasma isotope clearance according
      to a technique validated in patients with ascites. A corrected creatinine was
      derived from the mGFR after application of the Modification of Diet in Renal
      Disease formula. Subsequently, a corrected MELD was calculated and compared with 
      the conventionally calculated MELD. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used 
      to derive a GFR equation. This was compared with the mGFR in independent external
      and internal validation sets of 82 and 174 patients with cirrhosis, respectively.
      A difference >20 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) between existing formulae and mGFR was
      observed in 226 (48.2%) patients. The corrected MELD score was >/=3 points higher
      in 177 (37.7%) patients. The predicted equation (r(2) = 74.6%) was GFR = 45.9 x
      (creatinine(-0.836) ) x (urea(-0.229) ) x (international normalized ratio(-0.113)
      ) x (age(-0.129) [Corrected November 29, 2016: originally written as "age-129."])
      x (sodium(0.972) ) x 0.809 (if female) x 0.92 (if moderate/severe ascites). An
      online calculator is available at http://rfh-cirrhosis-gfr.ucl.ac.uk. The model
      was a good fit and showed the greatest accuracy compared to that of existing
      formulae. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a new accurate model for GFR
      assessment in cirrhosis, the Royal Free Hospital cirrhosis GFR, using readily
      available variables; this remains to be tested and incorporated in prognostic
      scores in patients with cirrhosis. (Hepatology 2017;65:582-591).

TI  - The association between race/ethnicity and the effectiveness of direct antiviral 
      agents for hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 426-438
LID - 10.1002/hep.28901 [doi]
AB  - Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower rates of sustained
      virologic response (SVR) to interferon-based treatments for chronic hepatitis C
      virus infection, whereas Asian race was associated with higher SVR rates compared
      to white patients. We aimed to describe the association between race/ethnicity
      and effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral regimens in the Veterans Affairs
      health care system nationally. We identified 21,095 hepatitis C virus-infected
      patients (11,029 [52%] white, 6,171 [29%] black, 1,187 [6%] Hispanic, 348 [2%]
      Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native, and 2,360 [11%]
      declined/missing race or ethnicity) who initiated antiviral treatment with
      regimens containing sofosbuvir, simeprevir + sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir,
      or paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir/dasabuvir during the 18-month period from
      January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015. Overall SVR rates were 89.8% (95% confidence
      interval [CI] 89.2-90.4) in white, 89.8% (95% CI 89.0-90.6) in black, 86.0% (95% 
      CI 83.7-88.0) in Hispanic, and 90.7% (95% CI 87.0-93.5) in Asian/Pacific
      Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native patients. However, after adjustment for
      baseline characteristics, black (adjusted odds ratio = 0.77, P < 0.001) and
      Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio = 0.76, P = 0.007) patients were less likely to
      achieve SVR than white patients, a difference that was not explained by early
      treatment discontinuations. Among genotype 1-infected patients treated with
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir monotherapy, black patients had significantly lower SVR
      than white patients when treated for 8 weeks but not when treated for 12 weeks.
      CONCLUSION: Direct-acting antivirals produce high SVR rates in white, black,
      Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native patients; but 
      after adjusting for baseline characteristics, black race and Hispanic ethnicity
      remain independent predictors of treatment failure. Short 8-week
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir monotherapy regimens should perhaps be avoided in black
      patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. (Hepatology 2017;65:426-438).

TI  - Metabolic profiling of fatty liver in young and middle-aged adults:
      Cross-sectional and prospective analyses of the Young Finns Study.
PG  - 491-500
LID - 10.1002/hep.28899 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver is associated with obesity-related metabolic
      disturbances, but little is known about the metabolic perturbations preceding
      fatty liver disease. We performed comprehensive metabolic profiling to assess how
      circulating metabolites, such as lipoprotein lipids, fatty acids, amino acids,
      and glycolysis-related metabolites, reflect the presence of and future risk for
      fatty liver in young adults. Sixty-eight lipids and metabolites were quantified
      by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics in the population-based Young Finns
      Study from serum collected in 2001 (n = 1,575), 2007 (n = 1,509), and 2011 (n =
      2,002). Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasound in 2011 when participants were
      aged 34-49 years (19% prevalence). Cross-sectional associations as well as 4-year
      and 10-year risks for fatty liver were assessed by logistic regression.
      Metabolites across multiple pathways were strongly associated with the presence
      of fatty liver (P < 0.0007 for 60 measures in age-adjusted and sex-adjusted
      cross-sectional analyses). The strongest direct associations were observed for
      extremely large very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (odds ratio [OR] =
      4.86 per 1 standard deviation, 95% confidence interval 3.48-6.78), other
      very-low-density lipoprotein measures, and branched-chain amino acids (e.g.,
      leucine OR = 2.94, 2.51-3.44). Strong inverse associations were observed for
      high-density lipoprotein measures, e.g., high-density lipoprotein size (OR =
      0.36, 0.30-0.42) and several fatty acids including omega-6 (OR = 0.37,
      0.32-0.42). The metabolic associations were attenuated but remained significant
      after adjusting for waist, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking (P
      < 0.0007). Similar aberrations in the metabolic profile were observed already 10 
      years before fatty liver diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Circulating lipids, fatty acids, 
      and amino acids reflect fatty liver independently of routine metabolic risk
      factors; these metabolic aberrations appear to precede the development of fatty
      liver in young adults. (Hepatology 2017;65:491-500).

TI  - Hyperoxidized albumin modulates neutrophils to induce oxidative stress and
      inflammation in severe alcoholic hepatitis.
PG  - 631-646
LID - 10.1002/hep.28897 [doi]
AB  - Albumin is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However,
      modifications in albumin structure may reduce its antioxidant properties and
      modulate its immune-regulatory functions. We examined alterations in circulating 
      albumin in severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) patients and their contribution to
      neutrophil activation, intracellular stress, and alteration in associated
      molecular pathways. Albumin modifications and plasma oxidative stress were
      assessed in SAH patients (n = 90), alcoholic cirrhosis patients (n = 60), and
      healthy controls (n = 30) using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and
      spectrophotometry. Activation and intracellular ROS were measured in healthy
      neutrophils after treatment with purified albumin from the study groups. Gene
      expression of SAH neutrophils was analyzed and compared to gene expression from
      healthy neutrophils after stimulation with purified albumin from SAH patient
      plasma. SAH-albumin showed the highest albumin oxidative state (P < 0.05) and
      prominent alteration as human nonmercaptalbumin 2 (P < 0.05). Plasma oxidative
      stress (advanced oxidative protein product) was higher in SAH versus alcoholic
      cirrhosis patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05). Neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin, myeloperoxidase, and intracellular ROS levels
      were highest in SAH-albumin-treated neutrophils (P < 0.05). Genes associated with
      neutrophil activation, ROS production, intracellular antioxidation, and leukocyte
      migration plus genes for proinflammatory cytokines and various toll-like
      receptors were overexpressed in SAH neutrophils compared to healthy neutrophils
      (P < 0.05). Expression of the above-mentioned genes in SAH-albumin-stimulated
      healthy neutrophils was comparable with SAH patient neutrophils, except for genes
      associated with apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy (P <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SAH, there is a significant increase in
      albumin oxidation, and albumin acts as a pro-oxidant; this promotes oxidative
      stress and inflammation in SAH patients through activation of neutrophils.

TI  - Rifaximin has no effect on hemodynamics in decompensated cirrhosis: A randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 592-603
LID - 10.1002/hep.28898 [doi]
AB  - Decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by disturbed systemic and splanchnic
      hemodynamics. Bacterial translocation from the gut is considered the key driver
      in this process. Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin may improve
      hemodynamics. This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial
      (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01769040) investigates the effects of rifaximin on
      hemodynamics, renal function, and vasoactive hormones. We randomized 54 stable
      outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites to rifaximin 550 mg twice a day (n = 36)
      or placebo twice a day (n = 18). Forty-five patients were male, mean age 56 years
      (+/-8.4), average Child score 8.3 (+/-1.3), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
      score 11.7 (+/-3.9). Measurements of hepatic venous pressure gradient, cardiac
      output, and systemic vascular resistance were made at baseline and after 4 weeks.
      The glomerular filtration rate and plasma renin, noradrenaline,
      lipopolysaccharide binding protein, troponin T, and brain natriuretic peptide
      levels were measured. Rifaximin had no effect on hepatic venous pressure
      gradient, mean 16.8 +/- 3.8 mm Hg at baseline versus 16.6 +/- 5.3 mm Hg at
      follow-up, compared to the placebo, mean 16.4 +/- 4 mm Hg at baseline versus 16.3
      +/- 4.4 mm Hg at follow-up, P = 0.94. No effect was found on cardiac output, mean
      6.9 +/- 1.7 L/min at baseline versus 6.9 +/- 2.3 L/min at follow-up, compared to 
      placebo, mean 6.6 +/- 1.9 L/min at baseline compared to 6.5 +/-2.1 L/min at
      follow-up, P = 0.66. No effects on the glomerular filtration rate, P = 0.14, or
      vasoactive hormones were found. Subgroup analyses on patients with increased
      lipopolysaccharide binding protein and systemic vascular resistance below the
      mean (1,011 dynes x s/cm(5) ) revealed no effect of rifaximin. CONCLUSION: Four
      weeks of treatment with rifaximin did not reduce the hepatic venous pressure
      gradient or improve systemic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites;
      rifaximin did not affect glomerular filtration rate or levels of vasoactive
      hormones. (Hepatology 2017;65:592-603).

TI  - Stem cell-derived models to improve mechanistic understanding and prediction of
      human drug-induced liver injury.
PG  - 710-721
LID - 10.1002/hep.28886 [doi]
AB  - Current preclinical drug testing does not predict some forms of adverse drug
      reactions in humans. Efforts at improving predictability of drug-induced tissue
      injury in humans include using stem cell technology to generate human cells for
      screening for adverse effects of drugs in humans. The advent of induced
      pluripotent stem cells means that it may ultimately be possible to develop
      personalized toxicology to determine interindividual susceptibility to adverse
      drug reactions. However, the complexity of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver
      injury means that no current single-cell model, whether of primary liver tissue
      origin, from liver cell lines, or derived from stem cells, adequately emulates
      what is believed to occur during human drug-induced liver injury. Nevertheless, a
      single-cell model of a human hepatocyte which emulates key features of a
      hepatocyte is likely to be valuable in assessing potential chemical risk;
      furthermore, understanding how to generate a relevant hepatocyte will also be
      critical to efforts to build complex multicellular models of the liver.
      Currently, hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from stem cells still fall short 
      of recapitulating the full mature hepatocellular phenotype. Therefore, we
      convened a number of experts from the areas of preclinical and clinical
      hepatotoxicity and safety assessment, from industry, academia, and regulatory
      bodies, to specifically explore the application of stem cells in hepatotoxicity
      safety assessment and to make recommendations for the way forward. In this short 
      review, we particularly discuss the importance of benchmarking stem cell-derived 
      hepatocyte-like cells to their terminally differentiated human counterparts using
      defined phenotyping, to make sure the cells are relevant and comparable between
      labs, and outline why this process is essential before the cells are introduced
      into chemical safety assessment. (Hepatology 2017;65:710-721).

TI  - Acetylation of PGK1 promotes liver cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
PG  - 515-528
LID - 10.1002/hep.28887 [doi]
AB  - Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is an important enzyme in the metabolic
      glycolysis pathway. In this study, we observed a significant overexpression of
      PGK1 in liver cancer tissues and a negative correlation between PGK1 expression
      and liver cancer patient survival. Furthermore, depletion of PGK1 dramatically
      reduced cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, indicating an oncogenic role
      of PGK1 in liver cancer progression. Moreover, we identified acetylation at the
      K323 site of PGK1 as an important regulatory mechanism for promoting its
      enzymatic activity and cancer cell metabolism. And we further characterized
      P300/cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein-binding
      protein-associated factor (PCAF) and Sirtuin 7 as the enzymes regulating K323
      acetylation from both directions in liver cancer cells. CONCLUSION: These
      findings demonstrate a novel regulation of PGK1 as well as its important role in 
      liver cancer progression. (Hepatology 2017;65:515-528).

TI  - METTL14 suppresses the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma by
      modulating N(6) -methyladenosine-dependent primary MicroRNA processing.
PG  - 529-543
LID - 10.1002/hep.28885 [doi]
AB  - N(6) -Methyladenosine (m(6) A) modification has been implicated in many
      biological processes. However, its role in cancer has not been well studied.
      Here, we demonstrate that m(6) A modifications are decreased in hepatocellular
      carcinoma, especially in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and that
      methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) is the main factor involved in aberrant m(6) 
      A modification. Moreover, METTL14 down-regulation acts as an adverse prognosis
      factor for recurrence-free survival of hepatocellular carcinoma and is
      significantly associated with tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We confirm
      that METTL14 interacts with the microprocessor protein DGCR8 and positively
      modulates the primary microRNA 126 process in an m(6) A-dependent manner. Further
      experiments show that microRNA 126 inhibits the repressing effect of METTL14 in
      tumor metastasis. CONCLUSION: These studies reveal an important role of METTL14
      in tumor metastasis and provide a fresh view on m(6) A modification in tumor
      progression. (Hepatology 2017;65:529-543).

TI  - CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T cells promote aberrant immunoglobulin G production and maintain
      CD8(+) T-cell suppression during chronic liver disease.
PG  - 661-677
LID - 10.1002/hep.28894 [doi]
AB  - Persistent hepatotropic viral infections are a common etiologic agent of chronic 
      liver disease. Unresolved infection can be attributed to nonfunctional
      intrahepatic CD8+ T-cell responses. In light of dampened CD8(+) T-cell responses,
      liver disease often manifests systemically as immunoglobulin (Ig)-related
      syndromes due to aberrant B-cell functions. These two opposing yet coexisting
      phenomena implicate the potential of altered CD4(+) T-cell help. Elevated CD4(+) 
      forkhead box P3-positive (Foxp3+) T cells were evident in both human liver
      disease and a mouse model of chemically induced liver injury despite marked
      activation and spontaneous IgG production by intrahepatic B cells. While this
      population suppressed CD8(+) T-cell responses, aberrant B-cell activities were
      maintained due to expression of CD40 ligand on a subset of CD4(+) Foxp3+ T cells.
      In vivo blockade of CD40 ligand attenuated B-cell abnormalities in a mouse model 
      of liver injury. A phenotypically similar population of CD4(+) Foxp3+, CD40
      ligand-positive T cells was found in diseased livers explanted from patients with
      chronic hepatitis C infection. This population was absent in nondiseased liver
      tissues and peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Liver disease elicits alterations in
      the intrahepatic CD4(+) T-cell compartment that suppress T-cell immunity while
      concomitantly promoting aberrant IgG mediated manifestations. (Hepatology
      2017;65:661-677).

TI  - Short-duration treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir for hepatitis
      C: A randomized trial.
PG  - 439-450
LID - 10.1002/hep.28877 [doi]
AB  - Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent the standard of care for patients
      with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Combining DAAs with different mechanisms 
      may allow for shorter treatment durations that are effective across multiple
      genotypes. The aim of the C-SWIFT study was to identify the minimum effective
      treatment duration across multiple genotypes. C-SWIFT was an open-label,
      single-center trial in treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype (GT)1
      or 3 infection. All patients received elbasvir (EBR) 50 mg/grazoprevir (GZR) 100 
      mg with sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg for 4-12 weeks. Patients with GT1 infection who
      failed therapy were eligible for retreatment with EBR/GZR+SOF and ribavirin for
      12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virological response
      [SVR]12 (SVR of HCV RNA <15 IU/mL 12 weeks after the end of therapy). Rates of
      SVR12 were 32% (10 of 31) and 87% (26 of 30) in patients without cirrhosis with
      GT1 infection treated for 4 and 6 weeks and 80% (16 of 20) and 81% (17 of 21) in 
      GT1-infected patients with cirrhosis treated for 6 and 8 weeks. Among
      GT3-infected patients without cirrhosis, SVR12 was 93% (14 of 15) and 100% (14 of
      14) after 8 and 12 weeks. SVR12 in GT3-infected patients with cirrhosis was 83%
      (10 of 12) after 12 weeks of treatment. Twenty-three GT1-infected patients who
      relapsed following initial treatment completed retreatment; all achieved SVR12.
      In the initial treatment phase, there was one serious adverse event of pneumonia,
      which led to treatment discontinuation, and during retreatment, 1 patient
      discontinued ribavirin because of pruritus. CONCLUSION: Data from this study
      support the use of 8-week treatment regimens that maintain high efficacy, even
      for patients with HCV GT3 infection. Retreatment of patients who failed
      short-duration therapy was achieved through extended treatment duration and
      addition of ribavirin. (Hepatology 2017;65:439-450).

TI  - Antiviral treatment and liver-related complications in hepatitis delta.
PG  - 414-425
LID - 10.1002/hep.28876 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is the most severe form of viral hepatitis. Pegylated
      interferon alfa (PEG-IFNalpha) is effective in only 25%-30% of patients and is
      associated with frequent side effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the
      clinical long-term outcome of hepatitis delta in relation to different antiviral 
      treatment strategies. We studied 136 anti-HDV-positive patients who were followed
      for at least 6 months in a retrospective single-center cohort (mean time of
      follow-up, 5.2 years; range, 0.6-18.8). Liver cirrhosis was already present in 62
      patients at first presentation. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not receive
      any antiviral treatment, 38% were treated with interferon alfa (IFNalpha)-based
      therapies, and 33% received nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) only. Clinical
      endpoints defined as hepatic decompensation (ascites, encephalopathy, and
      variceal bleeding), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and
      liver-related death developed in 55 patients (40%). Patients who received
      IFNalpha-based therapies developed clinical endpoints less frequently than those 
      treated with NA (P = 0.02; HR, 4.0) or untreated patients (P = 0.05; HR, 2.2;
      17%, 64%, and 44%), respectively, which was significant in both chi-square and
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, considering various clinical and virological 
      parameters, IFNalpha therapy was independently associated with a more benign
      clinical long-term outcome in multivariate logistic regression analysis (P =
      0.04; odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.9). Loss of HDV RNA
      during follow-up was more frequent in IFNalpha-treated patients and strongly
      linked with a lower likelihood to experience liver-related complications.
      CONCLUSION: IFNalpha-based antiviral therapy of hepatitis delta was independently
      associated with a lower likelihood for clinical disease progression. Durable
      undetectability of HDV RNA is a valid surrogate endpoint in the treatment of
      hepatitis delta. (Hepatology 2017;65:414-425).

TI  - Long noncoding RNA MEG3 induces cholestatic liver injury by interaction with
      PTBP1 to facilitate shp mRNA decay.
PG  - 604-615

AB  - Bile acids (BAs) play critical physiological functions in cholesterol
      homeostasis, and deregulation of BA metabolism causes cholestatic liver injury.
      The long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was recently shown as a
      potential tumor suppressor; however, its basic hepatic function remains elusive. 
      Using RNA pull-down with biotin-labeled sense or anti-sense MEG 3RNA followed by 
      mass spectrometry, we identified RNA-binding protein polypyrimidine tract-binding
      protein 1 (PTBP1) as a MEG3 interacting protein and validated their interaction
      by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Bioinformatics analysis revealed putative
      binding sites for PTBP1 within the coding region (CDS) of small heterodimer
      partner (SHP), a key repressor of BA biosynthesis. Forced expression of MEG3 in
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells guided and facilitated PTBP1 binding to the Shp
      CDS, resulting in Shp mRNA decay. Transient overexpression of MEG3 RNA in vivo in
      mouse liver caused rapid Shp mRNA degradation and cholestatic liver injury, which
      was accompanied by the disruption of BA homeostasis, elevation of liver enzymes, 
      as well as dysregulation of BA synthetic enzymes and metabolic genes.
      Interestingly, RNA sequencing coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a
      drastic induction of MEG3 RNA in Shp(-/-) liver. SHP inhibited MEG3 gene
      transcription by repressing cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
      transactivation of the MEG3 promoter. In addition, the expression of MEG3 and
      PTBP1 was activated in human fibrotic and cirrhotic livers. CONCLUSION: MEG3
      causes cholestasis by serving as a guide RNA scaffold to recruit PTBP1 to
      destabilize Shp mRNA. SHP in turn represses CREB-mediated activation of MEG3
      expression in a feedback-regulatory fashion. (Hepatology 2017;65:604-615).

TI  - Metabolic and hepatic effects of bloodletting in dysmetabolic iron overload
      syndrome: A randomized controlled study in 274 patients.
PG  - 465-474
LID - 10.1002/hep.28856 [doi]
AB  - Dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome (DIOS) is a common cause of
      hyperferritinemia, accounting for a mild increase of iron stores in
      insulin-resistant subjects. Iron removal could improve insulin sensitivity. We
      performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (NCT01015525) in
      nondiabetic DIOS patients with hepatic iron >50 mumol/g at magnetic resonance
      imaging to compare the metabolic and hepatic outcomes of 1-year maintenance of
      serum ferritin levels <50 mug/L by bloodletting associated with lifestyle and
      diet advice (LFDA) to those of LFDA only. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1)
      with stratification by center (n = 8) and hyperglycemia (>5.6 mmol/L). Sample
      size was calculated to provide 90% power and a difference in fasting glycemia of 
      0.25 mmol/L. Analysis was done in an intention-to-treat population. In 2010-2014,
      146 patients were randomly assigned to receive venesections with LFDA and 128 to 
      LFDA only. At the end of the study, comparison of iron-depleted patients and
      controls showed ferritin levels 71 +/- 48 mug/L after removal of 4.9 +/- 1.6 L of
      blood versus 733 +/- 277 mug/L (P < 0.0001), glycemia 5.44 +/- 0.7 versus 5.49
      +/- 0.7 mmol/L (P = 0.57), body weight +0.5 +/- 4.3% versus -0.6 +/- 3.3% (P =
      0.03), homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance 3.39 versus 2.40 (P 
      = 0.002), alanine aminotransaminase 33 +/- 22 versus 37 +/- 21 IU/L (P = 0.10),
      aspartate aminotransaminase 27 +/- 13 versus 27 +/- 10 IU/L (P = 0.81),
      gamma-glutamyl transferase 54 +/- 138 versus 49 +/- 35 IU/L (P = 0.72), Fatty
      Liver Index 58.9 +/- 24.6 versus 61.2 +/- 22.9 (P = 0.37), and Fibrosis-4 score
      1.5 +/- 0.6 versus 1.30 +/- 0.6 (P = 0.51). Fatigue occurred in 25.3% of
      venesected patients versus 2.3% of controls (P < 0.0001). In the subgroup of
      patients who lost weight, glycemia, homeostasis model of assessment of insulin
      resistance, serum ferritin, lipid profile, and liver function tests improved
      irrespective of bloodletting. CONCLUSION: In DIOS patients, iron depletion by
      bloodletting does not improve metabolic and hepatic features, is associated with 
      weight gain, and is not as well tolerated as expected; sustained modification of 
      diet and lifestyle habits remains the first therapeutic intervention in DIOS.

TI  - Low-grade endotoxemia and platelet activation in cirrhosis.
PG  - 571-581
LID - 10.1002/hep.28853 [doi]
AB  - Patients with cirrhosis may display impaired or enhanced platelet activation, but
      the reasons for these equivocal findings are unclear. We investigated if
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is implicated in platelet activation. In a
      cross-sectional study, conducted in an ambulatory care clinic and hospital,
      comparing 69 cirrhosis patients and 30 controls matched for sex, age, and
      atherosclerotic risk factors, serum levels of LPS, soluble cluster of
      differentiation 40 ligand and p-selectin (two markers of platelet activation),
      and zonulin (a marker of gut permeability) were investigated. Ex vivo and in
      vitro studies were also performed to explore the effect of LPS on platelet
      activation. Compared to controls, cirrhosis patients displayed higher serum
      levels of LPS (6.0 [4.0-17.5] versus 57.4 [43.4-87.2] pg/mL, P < 0.0001), soluble
      cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (7.0 +/- 2.2 versus 24.4 +/- 13.3 ng/mL, P <
      0.0001), soluble p-selectin (14.2 +/- 4.05 versus 33.2 +/- 15.2 ng/mL, P <
      0.0001), and zonulin (1.87 +/- 0.84 versus 2.54 +/- 0.94 ng/mL, P < 0.006). LPS
      significantly correlated with zonulin (r = 0.45, P < 0.001). Ex vivo studies
      showed that platelets from cirrhosis patients were more responsive to the
      agonists independently from platelet count; this phenomenon was blunted by
      incubation with an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor 4. In vitro study by normal
      platelets showed that LPS alone (50-150 pg/mL) did not stimulate platelets but
      amplified platelet response to the agonists; Toll-like receptor 4 inhibitor
      blunted this effect. CONCLUSION: LPS may be responsible for platelet activation
      and potentially contributes to thrombotic complications occurring in cirrhosis.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles released by hepatocytes from gastric infusion model of
      alcoholic liver disease contain a MicroRNA barcode that can be detected in blood.
PG  - 475-490
LID - 10.1002/hep.28838 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released during cell stress, or demise, can contain 
      a barcode of the cell origin, including specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we
      tested the hypothesis that during early alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH)
      development, hepatocytes (HCs) release EVs with an miRNA signature that can be
      measured in circulation. A time-course experiment showed that after 2 weeks of
      intragastric infusion, a time point that results in isolated steatosis, there was
      no increase of blood EVs. After 4 weeks of infusion, mice developed features of
      early ASH accompanied by a marked increase in the level of EVs in blood (P <
      0.05), as well as in culture media of isolated HCs (P < 0.001) and hepatic
      macrophages (P < 0.001), with HCs being the predominant source of EVs. The
      transcriptome analysis of HC-EVs from ASH mice detected differentially expressed 
      miRNAs, including nine significantly up-regulated and four significantly
      down-regulated miRNAs. Target prediction and pathway analyses of the up-regulated
      miRNAs identified 121 potential target genes involved in inflammatory and cancer 
      pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B, EGF, Wnt, and B-cell lymphoma 2. Three 
      miRNAs, let7f, miR-29a, and miR-340, were increased in blood EVs from ASH mice (P
      < 0.05), but not in blood EVs from three other models of chronic liver injury,
      including bile duct ligation, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and obese mice, as
      well as EVs released from hepatocytes exposed to ethanol. Blood EV level (P <
      0.01) and three miRNAs (P < 0.05) were significantly increased in patients with
      ambulatory mild ALD as compared to nonalcoholics. CONCLUSION: Damaged hepatocytes
      from ASH mice are a key EV source with a specific miRNA cargo, which are specific
      for ASH-related liver injury. These findings uncover EVs as a potentially novel
      diagnostic for ASH. (Hepatology 2017;65:475-490).

TI  - Forkhead box A2 regulates biliary heterogeneity and senescence during cholestatic
      liver injury in micedouble dagger.
PG  - 544-559
LID - 10.1002/hep.28831 [doi]
AB  - Biliary-committed progenitor cells (small mouse cholangiocytes; SMCCs) from small
      bile ducts are more resistant to hepatobiliary injury than large mouse
      cholangiocytes (LGCCs) from large bile ducts. The definitive endoderm marker,
      forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), is the key transcriptional factor that regulates cell
      differentiation and tissue regeneration. Our aim was to characterize the
      translational role of FoxA2 during cholestatic liver injury. Messenger RNA
      expression in SMCCs and LGCCs was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      array analysis. Liver tissues and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from primary
      sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients were 
      tested by real-time PCR for methylation, senescence, and fibrosis markers. Bile
      duct ligation (BDL) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MDR2) knockout mice
      (MDR2(-/-) ) were used as animal models of cholestatic liver injury with or
      without healthy transplanted large or small cholangiocytes. We demonstrated that 
      FoxA2 was notably enhanced in murine liver progenitor cells and SMCCs and was
      silenced in human PSC and PBC liver tissues relative to respective controls that 
      are correlated with the epigenetic methylation enzymes, DNA methyltransferase
      (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3B. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
      aminotransferase levels in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency
      mice engrafted with SMCCs post-BDL showed significant changes compared to
      vehicle-treated mice, along with improved liver fibrosis. Enhanced expression of 
      FoxA2 was observed in BDL mouse liver after SMCC cell therapy. Furthermore,
      activation of fibrosis signaling pathways were observed in BDL/MDR2(-/-) mouse
      liver as well as in isolated HSCs by laser capture microdissection, and these
      signals were recovered along with reduced hepatic senescence and enhanced hepatic
      stellate cellular senescence after SMCC engraft. CONCLUSION: The definitive
      endoderm marker and the positive regulator of biliary development, FoxA2,
      mediates the therapeutic effect of biliary-committed progenitor cells during
      cholestatic liver injury. (Hepatology 2017;65:544-559).

TI  - Extracellular vesicles carry microRNA-195 to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 
      improve survival in a rat model.
PG  - 501-514
LID - 10.1002/hep.28735 [doi]
AB  - The cancer microenvironment plays a central role in cancer development, growth,
      and homeostasis. This paradigm suggests that cancer fibroblasts support cancers, 
      probably in response to stimuli received from the cancer cells. We aimed at
      investigating whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) can shuttle microRNA (miR)
      species between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells. To this
      end, we extracted EVs according to published protocols. EVs were studied for
      their miR content by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain
      reaction. EVs were transfected with select miR species and utilized in vitro as
      well as in vivo in a rat model of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). We found that miR-195
      is down-regulated in CCA cells, as well as in adjoining fibroblasts. Furthermore,
      we report that EVs shuttle miR-195 from fibroblasts to cancer cells. Last, we
      show that fibroblast-derived EVs, loaded with miR-195, can be administered in a
      rat model of CCA, concentrate within the tumor, decrease the size of cancers, and
      improve survival of treated rats. CONCLUSION: EVs play a salient role in
      trafficking miR species between cancer cells and CAFs in human CCA. Understanding
      of these mechanisms may allow devising of novel therapeutics. (Hepatology

AB  - Vemurafenib (Zelboraf; Genentech, CA) is a highly effective oral chemotherapy
      agent for patients with metastatic melanoma who carry the BRAF V600E mutation.
      Side effects of this protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) include arthralgia, rash, and
      fatigue, which are reported in up to one third of treated patients. Mild
      abnormalities in liver biochemistries were reported with vemurafenib use in 30%
      of subjects, 11% developed severe laboratory abnormalities, and acute liver
      failure has been reported (Table ). Herein, a case of severe vemurafenib-induced 
      granulomatous hepatitis leading to chronic cholestasis is reported along with a
      review of the hepatotoxicity of other PKIs.

TI  - Five-year histological and serological follow-up of operationally tolerant
      pediatric liver transplant recipients enrolled in WISP-R.
PG  - 647-660
LID - 10.1002/hep.28681 [doi]
AB  - Pediatric liver transplant recipients arguably have the most to gain and the most
      to lose from discontinuing immunosuppression (IS). Whereas IS undoubtedly exerts 
      a cumulative toll, there is concern that insufficient or no IS may contribute to 
      allograft deterioration. Twelve pediatric recipients of parental living donor
      liver grafts, identified as operationally tolerant through complete IS withdrawal
      (WISP-R; NCT00320606), were followed for a total of 5 years (1 year of IS
      withdrawal and 4 years off IS) with serial liver tests and autoantibody and
      alloantibody assessments. Liver biopsies were performed 2 and 4 years off IS,
      and, at these time points, immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and C1q binding
      activity for donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) were determined. There were no
      cases of chronic rejection, graft loss, or death. Allografts did not exhibit
      progressive increase in inflammation or fibrosis. Smooth-muscle actin expression 
      by stellate cells and CD34 expression by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
      remained stable, consistent with the absence of progressive graft injury. Three
      subjects never exhibited DSA. However, 3 subjects showed intermittent de novo
      class I DSA, 4 subjects showed persistent de novo class II DSA, and 5 subjects
      showed persistent preexisting class II DSA. Class II DSA was predominantly
      against donor DQ antigens, often of high mean fluorescence intensity, rarely of
      the IgG3 subclass, and often capable of binding C1q. CONCLUSION: Operationally
      tolerant pediatric liver transplant recipients maintain generally stable
      allograft histology in spite of apparently active humoral allo-immune responses. 
      The absence of increased inflammation or progressive fibrosis suggests that a
      subset of liver allografts seem resistant to the chronic injury that is
      characteristic of antibody-mediated damage. (Hepatology 2017;65:647-660).

      patients unveiled by an integrated meta-omics-based approach.
PG  - 451-464
LID - 10.1002/hep.28572 [doi]
AB  - There is evidence that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is affected by
      gut microbiota. Therefore, we investigated its modifications in pediatric NAFLD
      patients using targeted metagenomics and metabolomics. Stools were collected from
      61 consecutive patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL),
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or obesity and 54 healthy controls (CTRLs), 
      matched in a case-control fashion. Operational taxonomic units were pyrosequenced
      targeting 16S ribosomal RNA and volatile organic compounds determined by
      solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The
      alpha-diversity was highest in CTRLs, followed by obese, NASH, and NAFL patients;
      and beta-diversity distinguished between patients and CTRLs but not NAFL and
      NASH. Compared to CTRLs, in NAFLD patients Actinobacteria were significantly
      increased and Bacteroidetes reduced. There were no significant differences among 
      the NAFL, NASH, and obese groups. Overall NAFLD patients had increased levels of 
      Bradyrhizobium, Anaerococcus, Peptoniphilus, Propionibacterium acnes, Dorea, and 
      Ruminococcus and reduced proportions of Oscillospira and Rikenellaceae compared
      to CTRLs. After reducing metagenomics and metabolomics data dimensionality,
      multivariate analyses indicated a decrease of Oscillospira in NAFL and NASH
      groups and increases of Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Dorea in NASH patients
      compared to CTRLs. Of the 292 volatile organic compounds, 26 were up-regulated
      and 2 down-regulated in NAFLD patients. Multivariate analyses found that
      combination of Oscillospira, Rickenellaceae, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides
      fragilis, Sutterella, Lachnospiraceae, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 1-butanol, and
      2-butanone could discriminate NAFLD patients from CTRLs. Univariate analyses
      found significantly lower levels of Oscillospira and higher levels of 1-pentanol 
      and 2-butanone in NAFL patients compared to CTRLs. In NASH, lower levels of
      Oscillospira were associated with higher abundance of Dorea and Ruminococcus and 
      higher levels of 2-butanone and 4-methyl-2-pentanone compared to CTRLs.
      CONCLUSION: An Oscillospira decrease coupled to a 2-butanone up-regulation and
      increases in Ruminococcus and Dorea were identified as gut microbiota signatures 
      of NAFL onset and NAFL-NASH progression, respectively. (Hepatology

AB  - The field of hepatology has experienced dramatic changes since the last workforce
      study in hepatology over 15 years ago. Hepatology practice has been dominated by 
      hepatitis C but is now being overtaken by patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver 
      disease. Expertise once attainable only through informal training, hepatology now
      has an accredited fellowship pathway and is recognized as a distinct discipline
      from gastroenterology with its own board certification. These changes that have
      occurred since the last workforce study in the prevalence and therapy of liver
      diseases and training may impact workforce needs. The time has come to conduct an
      updated analysis of the state of the hepatology workforce. The purpose of this
      article is to discuss the current issues facing training and workforce in
      hepatology and propose the next steps in conducting a workforce study.

TI  - A Karnofsky performance status-based score predicts death after hospital
      discharge in patients with cirrhosis.

LID - 10.1002/hep.28900 [doi]
AB  - Identification of patients with cirrhosis at risk for death within 3 months of
      discharge from the hospital is essential to individualize postdischarge plans.
      The objective of the study was to identify an easy-to-use prognostic model based 
      on the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). The North American Consortium for the 
      Study of End-Stage Liver Disease consists of 16 tertiary-care hepatology centers 
      that prospectively enroll nonelectively admitted cirrhosis patients. Patients
      enrolled had KPS assessed 1 week postdischarge. KPS was categorized into low
      (score 10-40), intermediate (50-70), and high (80-100). Of 954 middle-aged
      patients (57 +/- 10 years, 63% men) with a median Model for End-Stage Liver
      Disease (MELD) score of 17 (interquartile range 13-21), the mortality rates for
      the low, intermediate, and high performance status groups were 23% (36/159), 11% 
      (55/489), and 5% (15/306), respectively. Low, intermediate, and high performance 
      status was seen in 17%, 51%, and 32% of the cohort, respectively. Low performance
      status was associated with older age, dialysis, hepatic encephalopathy, longer
      length of stay, and higher white blood cell count or MELD score at discharge. A
      model was derived using the three independent predictors of 3-month mortality:
      KPS, age, and MELD score. This score had better discrimination (area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74) than a model using MELD (area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.62) or MELD and age (area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.67) to predict 3-month
      mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhosis patients at risk for 3-month postdischarge
      mortality can be identified using a novel KPS-based score; this score may be
      adopted in practice to guide postdischarge early interventions, including the
      integrated provision of active and palliative management strategies. (Hepatology 
      2017;65:217-224).

TI  - Polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster influence systemic inflammation in
      patients at risk for acute-on-chronic liver failure.
PG  - 202-216
LID - 10.1002/hep.28896 [doi]
AB  - Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in cirrhosis is an increasingly recognized 
      syndrome characterized by acute decompensation, organ failure(s) and high
      short-term mortality. Recent findings suggest that an overexuberant systemic
      inflammation plays a primary role in ACLF progression. In this study, we examined
      whether genetic factors shape systemic immune responses in patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
      inflammation-related genes (interleukin [IL]-1 beta [IL-1beta], rs1143623; IL-1
      receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], rs4251961; IL-10, rs1800871; suppressor of cytokine
      signaling-3, rs4969170; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
      protein 2, rs3135500; and chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1, rs1878022) were
      genotyped in 279 patients with cirrhosis with (n = 178) and without (n = 101)
      ACLF from the CANONIC study of the CLIF consortium. Among these SNPs, we
      identified two polymorphisms belonging to the IL-1 gene cluster (IL-1beta and
      IL-1ra) in strong association with ACLF. Both SNPs were protective against ACLF; 
      IL-1beta (odds ratio [OR], 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.89; P <
      0.05) and IL-1ra (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.95; P < 0.05) under the recessive and 
      overdominant inheritance models, respectively. These protective SNPs translated
      into reduced circulating levels of IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, IL-6, granulocyte-colony 
      stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and
      C-reactive protein at enrollment as well as after 7-14 days of admission. These
      findings were confirmed in vitro in leukocytes incubated with plasma from
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis carrying the protective SNP genotypes.
      Notably, a higher frequency of the protective genotypes was observed in patients 
      without (80%) than in those with (20%) ACLF. Consistently, patients carrying the 
      combined protective genotypes showed a lower 28-day mortality rate. CONCLUSION:
      These data identify two common functional polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster,
      which are associated with the inflammatory process related to development of
      ACLF. (Hepatology 2017;65:202-216).

AB  - Despite being the most common liver cancer in children, hepatoblastoma (HB) is a 
      rare neoplasm. Consequently, few pretreatment tumors have been molecularly
      profiled, and there are no validated prognostic or therapeutic biomarkers for HB 
      patients. We report on the first large-scale effort to profile pretreatment HBs
      at diagnosis. Our analysis of 88 clinically annotated HBs revealed three
      risk-stratifying molecular subtypes that are characterized by differential
      activation of hepatic progenitor cell markers and metabolic pathways: high-risk
      tumors were characterized by up-regulated nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2
      activity; high lin-28 homolog B, high mobility group AT-hook 2, spalt-like
      transcription factor 4, and alpha-fetoprotein expression; and high coordinated
      expression of oncofetal proteins and stem-cell markers, while low-risk tumors had
      low lin-28 homolog B and lethal-7 expression and high hepatic nuclear factor 1
      alpha activity. CONCLUSION: Analysis of immunohistochemical assays using
      antibodies targeting these genes in a prospective study of 35 HBs suggested that 
      these candidate biomarkers have the potential to improve risk stratification and 
      guide treatment decisions for HB patients at diagnosis; our results pave the way 
      for clinical collaborative studies to validate candidate biomarkers and test
      their potential to improve outcome for HB patients. (Hepatology 2017;65:104-121).

TI  - Bile acid excess induces cardiomyopathy and metabolic dysfunctions in the heart.
PG  - 189-201
LID - 10.1002/hep.28890 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis is strongly associated with 
      increased serum bile acid concentrations. Here we show that excess bile acids
      decrease fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes and can cause heart dysfunction, 
      a cardiac syndrome that we term cholecardia. Farnesoid X receptor; Small
      Heterodimer Partner double knockout mice, a model for bile acid overload, display
      cardiac hypertrophy, bradycardia, and exercise intolerance. In addition, double
      knockout mice exhibit an impaired cardiac response to catecholamine challenge.
      Consistent with this decreased cardiac function, we show that elevated serum bile
      acids reduce cardiac fatty acid oxidation both in vivo and ex vivo. We find that 
      increased bile acid levels suppress expression of proliferator-activated
      receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha, a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and 
      that proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha overexpression in
      cardiac cells was able to rescue the bile acid-mediated reduction in fatty acid
      oxidation genes. Importantly, intestinal bile acid sequestration with
      cholestyramine was sufficient to reverse the observed heart dysfunction in the
      double knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased proliferator-activated
      receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha expression contributes to the metabolic
      dysfunction in cholecardia so that reducing serum bile acid concentrations may be
      beneficial against the metabolic and pathological changes in the heart.

TI  - Redox-dependent regulation of hepatocyte absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome
      activation in sterile liver injury in mice.
PG  - 253-268
LID - 10.1002/hep.28893 [doi]
AB  - Sterile liver inflammation, such as liver ischemia-reperfusion, hemorrhagic shock
      after trauma, and drug-induced liver injury, is initiated and regulated by
      endogenous mediators including DNA and reactive oxygen species. Here, we identify
      a mechanism for redox-mediated regulation of absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)
      inflammasome activation in hepatocytes after redox stress in mice, which occurs
      through interaction with cytosolic high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). We show
      that in liver during hemorrhagic shock in mice and in hepatocytes after hypoxia
      with reoxygenation, cytosolic HMGB1 associates with AIM2 and is required for
      activation of caspase-1 in response to cytosolic DNA. Activation of caspase-1
      through AIM2 leads to subsequent hepatoprotective responses such as autophagy.
      HMGB1 binds to AIM2 at a non-DNA-binding site on the hematopoietic
      interferon-inducible nuclear antigen domain of AIM2 to facilitate inflammasome
      and caspase-1 activation in hepatocytes. Furthermore, binding of HMGB1 to AIM2 is
      stronger with fully reduced all-thiol HMGB1 than with partially oxidized
      disulfide-HMGB1, and binding strength corresponds to caspase-1 activation. These 
      data suggest that HMGB1 redox status regulates AIM2 inflammasome activation.
      CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a novel and important mechanism for regulation
      of AIM2 inflammasome activation in hepatocytes during redox stress and may
      suggest broader implications for how this and other inflammasomes are activated
      and how their activation is regulated during cell stress, as well as the
      mechanisms of inflammasome regulation in nonimmune cell types. (Hepatology
      2017;65:253-268).

      the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms underlying this observation
      are unclear. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between EPO production and
      overall prognosis in our cohort of 664 patients as well as in data from The
      Cancer Genome Atlas. In the subset of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with
      erythrocytosis, we identified somatic mutations of mitochondrial DNA, resulting
      in impairment of respiratory metabolism, which sequentially led to depletion of
      alpha-ketoglutarate, stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-alpha, and
      expression of target genes such as EPO. Cell lines and patient-derived xenograft 
      models were used to demonstrate that EPO promoted cancer stem cell self-renewal
      and expansion in an autocrine/paracrine manner through enhanced Janus
      kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling both in vitro
      and in vivo. Furthermore, to explore the therapeutic targeting of EPO-induced
      tumor changes, we found that blocking EPO signaling with soluble EPO receptor
      extracellular domain Fc fusion protein could inhibit tumor growth both in vitro
      and in vivo. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest clinical and therapeutic
      implications for erythrocytosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. There is an
      underlying link between mitochondrial function and hypoxia inducible factor alpha
      signaling, revealing a mechanism of erythrocytosis in a subset of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma patients who may benefit from treatment involving EPO signaling
      interference. (Hepatology 2017;65:134-151).

AB  - The liver maintains an immunologically tolerant environment as a result of
      continuous exposure to food and bacterial constituents from the digestive tract. 
      Hepatotropic pathogens can take advantage of this niche and establish lifelong
      chronic infections causing hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
      Macrophages (Mvarphi) play a critical role in regulation of immune responses to
      hepatic infection and regeneration of tissue. However, the factors crucial for
      Mvarphi in limiting hepatic inflammation or resolving liver damage have not been 
      fully understood. In this report, we demonstrate that expression of C-type lectin
      receptor scavenger receptor-AI (SR-AI) is crucial for promoting M2-like Mvarphi
      activation and polarization during hepatic inflammation. Liver Mvarphi uniquely
      up-regulated SR-AI during hepatotropic viral infection and displayed increased
      expression of alternative Mvarphi activation markers, such as YM-1, arginase-1,
      and interleukin-10 by activation of mer receptor tyrosine kinase associated with 
      inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin. Expression of these molecules was
      reduced on Mvarphi obtained from livers of infected mice deficient for the gene
      encoding SR-AI (msr1). Furthermore, in vitro studies using an SR-AI-deficient
      Mvarphi cell line revealed impeded M2 polarization and decreased phagocytic
      capacity. Direct stimulation with virus was sufficient to activate M2 gene
      expression in the wild-type (WT) cell line, but not in the knockdown cell line.
      Importantly, tissue damage and fibrosis were exacerbated in SR-AI(-/-) mice
      following hepatic infection and adoptive transfer of WT bone-marrow-derived
      Mvarphi conferred protection against fibrosis in these mice. CONCLUSION: SR-AI
      expression on liver Mvarphi promotes recovery from infection-induced tissue
      damage by mediating a switch to a proresolving Mvarphi polarization state.

TI  - Survival and cost-effectiveness of sorafenib therapy in advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma: An analysis of the SEER-Medicare database.
PG  - 122-133
LID - 10.1002/hep.28881 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is the only chemotherapeutic approved for treatment of advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its effectiveness in patients with
      Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis and any moderating effects of health system
      characteristics are unclear. We examined the survival and cost-effectiveness
      associated with sorafenib in elderly patients with advanced HCC. We performed an 
      analysis of Medicare beneficiaries with HCC diagnoses from 2007 to 2009. We
      compared advanced stage patients with HCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer
      stage III/IV) who received sorafenib within 6 months of diagnosis (and were
      otherwise untreated) to advanced stage patients with HCC who received no therapy 
      (control). We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify
      predictors of survival. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were
      calculated for sorafenib-treated and control patients. We included 228
      sorafenib-treated patients and 870 control patients. The median survival of the
      sorafenib-treated patients was 150.5 days versus 62 days for control patients. On
      multivariate analysis, significant predictors of improved survival were treatment
      with sorafenib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.57-0.77), being seen at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center
      (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.97), and being seen at a transplantation center (HR,
      0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93). Predictors of worse survival included stage IV disease 
      (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.24-1.58), decompensated cirrhosis (HR, 1.49; 95% CI,
      1.30-1.70), and treatment in an urban setting (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.73.)
      Although sorafenib use was associated with a survival benefit (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 
      0.47-0.79) among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the median survival
      benefit was 31 days, and it was not cost-effective (ICER, $224,914 per life year 
      gained). CONCLUSION: Sorafenib is associated with improved survival in elderly
      patients with advanced HCC; however, it is not cost-effective among those with
      hepatic decompensation. (Hepatology 2017;65:122-133).

TI  - Human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells promote intracellular crawling of
      lymphocytes during recruitment: A new step in migration.
PG  - 294-309
LID - 10.1002/hep.28879 [doi]
AB  - The recruitment of lymphocytes via the hepatic sinusoidal channels and
      positioning within liver tissue is a critical event in the development and
      persistence of chronic inflammatory liver diseases. The hepatic sinusoid is a
      unique vascular bed lined by hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs), a
      functionally and phenotypically distinct subpopulation of endothelial cells.
      Using flow-based adhesion assays to study the migration of lymphocytes across
      primary human HSECs, we found that lymphocytes enter into HSECs, confirmed by
      electron microscopy demonstrating clear intracellular localization of lymphocytes
      in vitro and by studies in human liver tissues. Stimulation by interferon-gamma
      increased intracellular localization of lymphocytes within HSECs. Furthermore,
      using confocal imaging and time-lapse recordings, we demonstrated "intracellular 
      crawling" of lymphocytes entering into one endothelial cell from another. This
      required the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and stabilin-1 and
      was facilitated by the junctional complexes between HSECs. CONCLUSION: Lymphocyte
      migration is facilitated by the unique structure of HSECs. Intracellular crawling
      may contribute to optimal lymphocyte positioning in liver tissue during chronic
      hepatitis. (Hepatology 2017;65:294-309).

TI  - Uptake of hepatitis C screening, characteristics of patients tested, and
      intervention costs in the BEST-C study.
PG  - 44-53
LID - 10.1002/hep.28880 [doi]
AB  - From December 2012 to March 2014, three randomized trials, each implementing a
      unique intervention in primary care settings (repeated mailing, an electronic
      health record best practice alert [BPA], and patient solicitation), evaluated
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody testing, diagnosis, and costs for each of the
      interventions compared with standard-of-care testing. Multilevel multivariable
      models were used to estimate the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) for receiving an HCV
      antibody test, and costs were estimated using activity-based costing. The goal of
      this study was to estimate the effects of interventions conducted as part of the 
      Birth-Cohort Evaluation to Advance Screening and Testing for Hepatitis C study on
      HCV testing and costs among persons of the 1945-1965 birth cohort (BC).
      Intervention resulted in substantially higher HCV testing rates compared with
      standard-of-care testing (26.9% versus 1.4% for repeated mailing, 30.9% versus
      3.6% for BPA, and 63.5% versus 2.0% for patient solicitation) and significantly
      higher aRR for testing after controlling for sex, birth year, race, insurance
      type, and median household income (19.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.7-38.2] 
      for repeated mailing, 13.2 [95% CI, 3.6-48.6] for BPA, and 32.9 [95% CI,
      19.3-56.1] for patient solicitation). The BPA intervention had the lowest
      incremental cost per completed test ($24 with fixed startup costs, $3 without)
      and also the lowest incremental cost per new case identified after omitting fixed
      startup costs ($1691). CONCLUSION: HCV testing interventions resulted in an
      increase in BC testing compared with standard-of-care testing but also increased 
      costs. The effect size and incremental costs of BPA intervention (excluding
      startup costs) support more widespread adoption compared with the other
      interventions. (Hepatology 2017;65:44-53).

TI  - IL-6 trans-signaling is essential for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma
      in mice.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent tumors worldwide with 
      rising incidence. The inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), is a critical 
      mediator of HCC development. It can signal through two distinct pathways: the
      IL-6 classic and the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway. Whereas IL-6 classic signaling
      is important for innate and acquired immunity, IL-6 trans-signaling has been
      linked to accelerated liver regeneration and several chronic inflammatory
      pathologies. However, its implication in liver tumorigenesis has not been
      addressed yet. Here, we show that IL-6 trans-signaling, but not IL-6 classic
      signaling, is essential to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis by two
      mechanisms: First, it prevents DNA-damage-induced hepatocyte apoptosis through
      suppression of p53 and enhances beta-catenin activation and tumor proliferation. 
      Second, IL-6 trans-signaling directly induces endothelial cell proliferation to
      promote tumor angiogenesis. Consequently, soluble gp130 fused to Fc transgenic
      mice lacking IL-6 trans-signaling are largely protected from tumor formation in a
      diethylnitrosamine/3,3',5,5'-tetrachloro-1,4-bis(pyridyloxy)benzene model of HCC.
      CONCLUSION: IL-6 trans-signaling, and not IL-6 classic signaling, is mandatory
      for development of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Therefore, specific inhibition 
      of IL-6 trans-signaling, rather than total inhibition of IL-6 signaling, is
      sufficient to blunt tumor initiation and impair tumor progression without
      compromising IL-6 classic signaling-driven protective immune responses.

TI  - Depletion of myeloid cells exacerbates hepatitis and induces an aberrant increase
      in histone H3 in mouse serum.
PG  - 237-252
LID - 10.1002/hep.28878 [doi]
AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages and bone marrow (BM)-derived monocytes play a crucial
      role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis; however, their contribution to
      recovery from acute tissue injury is not fully understood. To address this issue,
      we generated an acute murine liver injury model using hepatocyte-specific
      Cflar-deficient (Cflar(Hep-low) ) mice. Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein
      expression was down-regulated in Cflar-deficient hepatocytes, which thereby
      increased susceptibility of hepatocytes to death receptor-induced apoptosis.
      Cflar(Hep-low) mice developed acute hepatitis and recovered with clearance of
      apoptotic hepatocytes at 24 hours after injection of low doses of tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha (TNFalpha), which could not induce hepatitis in wild-type (WT) mice.
      Depletion of Kupffer cells (KCs) by clodronate liposomes did not impair clearance
      of dying hepatocytes or exacerbate hepatitis in Cflar(Hep-low) mice. To elucidate
      the roles of BM-derived monocytes and neutrophils in clearance of apoptotic
      hepatocytes, we examined the effect of depletion of these cells on
      TNFalpha-induced hepatitis in Cflar(Hep-low) mice. We reconstituted
      Cflar(Hep-low) mice with BM cells from transgenic mice in which human diphtheria 
      toxin receptor (DTR) was expressed under control of the lysozyme M (LysM)
      promoter. TNFalpha-induced infiltration of myeloid cells, including monocytes and
      neutrophils, was completely ablated in LysM-DTR BM-reconstituted Cflar(Hep-low)
      mice pretreated with diphtheria toxin, whereas KCs remained present in the
      livers. Under these experimental conditions, LysM-DTR BM-reconstituted
      Cflar(Hep-low) mice rapidly developed severe hepatitis and succumbed within
      several hours of TNFalpha injection. We found that serum interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      TNFalpha, and histone H3 were aberrantly increased in LysM-DTR BM-reconstituted, 
      but not in WT BM-reconstituted, Cflar(Hep-low) mice following TNFalpha injection.
      CONCLUSION: These findings indicate an unexpected role of myeloid cells in
      decreasing serum IL-6, TNFalpha, and histone H3 levels via the suppression of
      TNFalpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. (Hepatology 2017;65:237-252).

TI  - Identifying nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients with active fibrosis by
      measuring extracellular matrix remodeling rates in tissue and blood.
PG  - 78-88
LID - 10.1002/hep.28860 [doi]
AB  - Excess collagen synthesis (fibrogenesis) in the liver plays a causal role in the 
      progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods are needed to
      identify patients with more rapidly progressing disease and to demonstrate early 
      response to treatment. We describe here a novel method to quantify hepatic
      fibrogenesis flux rates both directly in liver tissue and noninvasively in blood.
      Twenty-one patients with suspected NAFLD ingested heavy water ((2) H2 O, 50-mL
      aliquots) two to three times daily for 3-5 weeks prior to a clinically indicated 
      liver biopsy. Liver collagen fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and plasma lumican
      FSR were measured based on (2) H labeling using tandem mass spectrometry.
      Patients were classified by histology for fibrosis stage (F0-F4) and as having
      nonalcoholic fatty liver or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Magnetic
      resonance elastography measurements of liver stiffness were also performed.
      Hepatic collagen FSR in NAFLD increased with advancing disease stage (e.g.,
      higher in NASH than nonalcoholic fatty liver, positive correlation with fibrosis 
      score and liver stiffness) and correlated with hemoglobin A1C. In addition,
      plasma lumican FSR demonstrated a significant correlation with hepatic collagen
      FSR. CONCLUSION: Using a well-characterized cohort of patients with biopsy-proven
      NAFLD, this study demonstrates that hepatic scar in NASH is actively remodeled
      even in advanced fibrosis, a disease that is generally regarded as static and
      slowly progressive. Moreover, hepatic collagen FSR correlates with established
      risks for fibrotic disease progression in NASH, and plasma lumican FSR correlates
      with hepatic collagen FSR, suggesting applications as direct or surrogate
      markers, respectively, of hepatic fibrogenesis in humans. (Hepatology
      2017;65:78-88).

AB  - The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients with
      antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), but no clinical evidence of primary biliary 
      cholangitis (PBC), are largely unknown. A prospective study of AMA incidence was 
      conducted through a nation-wide network of 63 French immunology laboratories.
      Clinical data from 720 of 1,318 AMA-positive patients identified in 1 year were
      collected. Patients were categorized as either newly diagnosed with PBC (n =
      275), previously diagnosed with PBC (n = 216), or with nonestablished diagnosis
      of PBC (n = 229). The latter group was specifically evaluated. Follow-up data
      were collected for up to 7 years after detection of AMAs. Prevalence of
      AMA-positive patients without evidence of PBC was 16.1 per 100,000. These
      patients had the following characteristics: 78% female; median age 58 years;
      median AMA titer 1:160; extrahepatic autoimmune disorders 46%; normal serum
      alkaline phosphatases (ALP) 74%; ALP above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
      13%; and cirrhosis 6%. Compared to those newly diagnosed with PBC, the patients
      were slightly younger, had lower AMA titers, and lower sex-ratio imbalance. Among
      the patients with normal ALP and no evidence of cirrhosis, the 5-year incidence
      rate of PBC was 16%. Whereas no patients died from PBC, the 5-year survival rate 
      was 75%, as compared to 90% in a control, standardized population matched for age
      and sex (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the newly detected AMAs in
      clinical practice does not lead to a diagnosis of PBC. PBC is unrecognized in 13%
      of those cases. Only 1 in 6 patients with AMAs and normal ALP will develop PBC
      after 5 years. The mortality of AMA-positive patients without PBC is increased
      irrespective of the risk of PBC development. (Hepatology 2017;65:152-163).

TI  - Liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements.
PG  - 363-373
LID - 10.1002/hep.28813 [doi]
AB  - Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are used increasingly both in the United
      States and worldwide, and HDS-induced liver injury in the United States has
      increased proportionally. Current challenges in the diagnosis and management of
      HDS-induced liver injury were the focus of a 2-day research symposium sponsored
      by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the National
      Institutes of Health. HDS-induced liver injury now accounts for 20% of cases of
      hepatotoxicity in the United States based on research data. The major implicated 
      agents include anabolic steroids, green tea extract, and multi-ingredient
      nutritional supplements. Anabolic steroids marketed as bodybuilding supplements
      typically induce a prolonged cholestatic but ultimately self-limiting liver
      injury that has a distinctive serum biochemical as well as histological
      phenotype. Green tea extract and many other products, in contrast, tend to cause 
      an acute hepatitis-like injury. Currently, however, the majority of cases of
      HDS-associated liver injury are due to multi-ingredient nutritional supplements, 
      and the component responsible for the toxicity is usually unknown or can only be 
      suspected. HDS-induced liver injury presents many clinical and research
      challenges in diagnosis, identification of the responsible constituents,
      treatment, and prevention. Also important are improvements in regulatory
      oversight of nonprescription products to guarantee their constituents and ensure 
      purity and safety. The confident identification of injurious ingredients within
      HDS will require strategic alignments among clinicians, chemists, and
      toxicologists. The ultimate goal should be to prohibit or more closely regulate
      potentially injurious ingredients and thus promote public safety. (Hepatology
      2017;65:363-373).

TI  - Pivotal role of glutamine synthetase in ammonia detoxification.
PG  - 281-293
LID - 10.1002/hep.28852 [doi]
AB  - Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes condensation of ammonia with glutamate to
      glutamine. Glutamine serves, with alanine, as a major nontoxic interorgan ammonia
      carrier. Elimination of hepatic GS expression in mice causes only mild
      hyperammonemia and hypoglutaminemia but a pronounced decrease in the whole-body
      muscle-to-fat ratio with increased myostatin expression in muscle. Using
      GS-knockout/liver and control mice and stepwise increments of enterally infused
      ammonia, we show that approximately 35% of this ammonia is detoxified by hepatic 
      GS and approximately 35% by urea-cycle enzymes, while approximately 30% is not
      cleared by the liver, independent of portal ammonia concentrations </=2 mmol/L.
      Using both genetic (GS-knockout/liver and GS-knockout/muscle) and pharmacological
      (methionine sulfoximine and dexamethasone) approaches to modulate GS activity, we
      further show that detoxification of stepwise increments of intravenously (jugular
      vein) infused ammonia is almost totally dependent on GS activity. Maximal
      ammonia-detoxifying capacity through either the enteral or the intravenous route 
      is approximately 160 mumol/hour in control mice. Using stable isotopes, we show
      that disposal of glutamine-bound ammonia to urea (through mitochondrial
      glutaminase and carbamoylphosphate synthetase) depends on the rate of glutamine
      synthesis and increases from approximately 7% in methionine sulfoximine-treated
      mice to approximately 500% in dexamethasone-treated mice (control mice, 100%),
      without difference in total urea synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic GS contributes
      to both enteral and systemic ammonia detoxification. Glutamine synthesis in the
      periphery (including that in pericentral hepatocytes) and glutamine catabolism in
      (periportal) hepatocytes represents the high-affinity ammonia-detoxifying system 
      of the body. The dependence of glutamine-bound ammonia disposal to urea on the
      rate of glutamine synthesis suggests that enhancing peripheral glutamine
      synthesis is a promising strategy to treat hyperammonemia. Because total urea
      synthesis does not depend on glutamine synthesis, we hypothesize that glutamate
      dehydrogenase complements mitochondrial ammonia production. (Hepatology

TI  - The dendritic cell-T helper 17-macrophage axis controls cholangiocyte injury and 
      disease progression in murine and human biliary atresia.
PG  - 174-188
LID - 10.1002/hep.28851 [doi]
AB  - Biliary atresia (BA) is a fibroinflammatory obstruction of the extrahepatic
      biliary tree in neonates. While intrahepatic bile duct proliferation is universal
      at diagnosis, bile duct paucity develops later. We hypothesized that polarized T 
      helper lymphocyte responses orchestrate progression of intrahepatic biliary
      injury in this disease. Interleukin 17A (IL-17A)-green fluorescent protein,
      cluster of differentiation 11c (CD11c)/diphtheria toxin receptor, and IL-17
      receptor A(-/-) mice were used to examine T-lymphocyte polarization, inflammatory
      leukocyte recruitment, and biliary injury in rhesus rotavirus-induced BA.
      Multiparameter flow cytometry and automated image analysis of immunostaining were
      applied to liver tissue samples from infants with BA. In the mouse model,
      activated CD4(+) lymphocytes started to emerge in the liver on day 8 after viral 
      challenge, while innate immune responses were waning. Plasma IL-17A levels rose
      concomitantly with hepatic accumulation of T helper 17 lymphocytes and myeloid
      dendritic cells. Targeted depletion of CD11c(+) dendritic cells diminished
      hepatic IL-17A production and ameliorated intrahepatic bile duct injury.
      Recombinant IL-17A induced expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in
      neonatal cholangiocytes in vitro, and blockade of the corresponding chemokine
      (C-C motif) receptor 2 reduced recruitment of inflammatory macrophages to the
      liver in vivo. Genetic disruption of IL-17A signaling was associated with
      down-regulation of hepatic Ccl2/Ccr2 messenger RNA expression, reduced
      infiltration of the liver with inflammatory Ly6C(hi) macrophages, and improved
      survival. In the liver of infants with BA, cholangiocytes were found to express
      IL-17 receptor A, and the prevalence of IL-17A(+) cells was positively correlated
      with the degree of CD68(+) macrophage infiltration at diagnosis. Hepatic CD4(+)
      lymphocytes were chief producers of IL-17A in patients with progressive disease
      undergoing liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: These findings identify the
      dendritic cell-T helper 17-macrophage axis as a target for the development of
      strategies to block progression of intrahepatic bile duct injury in patients with
      BA. (Hepatology 2017;65:174-188).

TI  - "Hep C, where art thou": What are the remaining (fundable) questions in hepatitis
      C virus research?
PG  - 341-349
LID - 10.1002/hep.28848 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has dominated the field of hepatology for the past 25
      years, and its cure in the majority of treated patients is one of the greatest
      achievements in all of medicine. However, the latter has led to the belief by
      some that HCV research should be shelved for other, more pressing areas. The
      mission for HCV eradication is far from accomplished. As a historical reference, 
      we should consider that disease elimination has required vaccination with all
      previously controlled infections including smallpox and polio and that simple,
      effective treatment is not sufficient in most infections to lead to substantial
      control. Syphilis is the best example, for which a single dose of penicillin
      (which literally costs pennies and that we have had since 1945) is curative in
      early stages. Not only have we not eradicated syphilis, rates of infection have
      increased in many places within the United States in recent years. Most
      HCV-infected subjects are unaware of their infection, remaining at risk for
      transmission to others and disease progression, including cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma. In the era of highly effective direct-acting antivirals
      (DAAs), many questions pertaining to HCV remain, but they are more complex and
      difficult to answer. Here, I provide my perspective on some of these salient
      issues: the residual risk for disease progression after sustained virologic
      response, the optimal approach to current DAA failures, the impact of targeting
      people who inject drugs with DAAs, vaccine prospects, and application of
      neutralizing HCV glycoprotein antibodies. (Hepatology 2017;65:341-349).

TI  - CD14(+) monocyte-derived galectin-9 induces natural killer cell cytotoxicity in
      chronic hepatitis C.
PG  - 18-31
LID - 10.1002/hep.28847 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cell activation is associated with both liver injury and
      persistent infection in chronic hepatitis C (CHC); however, the detailed
      mechanism of this activation has not yet been fully elucidated. Because
      galectin-9 (Gal-9) has been reported to be increased in the serum and liver
      tissue of CHC patients, we investigated the function of Gal-9 in NK cell
      activation in CHC. First, we evaluated the function of Gal-9 on NK cytotoxicity
      in vitro. Gal-9 treatment resulted in increased cytotoxicity of naive NK cells,
      and the Gal-9-activated NK cells demonstrated cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells 
      and T cells. Additionally, coculturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      with JFH-1/Huh7.5.1 cells increased both Gal-9 production and NK cell
      cytotoxicity. Next, we investigated the source of Gal-9 and the mechanism of
      Gal-9 production. Deletion of CD14(+) monocytes from PBMCs resulted in reduced
      Gal-9 production in the coculture with JFH-1/Huh7.5.1 cells. Gal-9 production was
      driven by coculturing of PBMCs with apoptotic hepatocytes. Blocking integrin
      alphav beta3 , a receptor for phosphatidylserine expressed on apoptotic cells,
      also resulted in decreased Gal-9 production. Finally, we found that serum Gal-9
      levels were significantly higher in CHC patients than in healthy donors and
      patients who achieved sustained virologic response. Among CHC patients, serum
      Gal-9 levels were significantly higher in patients with elevated alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) than in those with normal ALT. CONCLUSION: These results
      demonstrate that CD14(+) monocyte-derived Gal-9 increases NK cell cytotoxicity in
      HCV infection, which might be associated with liver injury and persistent
      infection. (Hepatology 2017;65:18-31).

AB  - The ability to noninvasively diagnose acute cellular rejection (ACR) with high
      specificity and sensitivity would significantly advance personalized liver
      transplant recipient care and management of immunosuppression. We performed
      microRNA (miRNA) profiling in 318 serum samples from 69 liver transplant
      recipients enrolled in the Immune Tolerance Network immunosuppression withdrawal 
      (ITN030ST) and Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT-03) studies. We
      quantified serum miRNA at clinically indicated and/or protocol biopsy events (n =
      130). The trajectory of ACR diagnostic miRNAs during immunosuppression withdrawal
      were also evaluated in sera taken at predetermined intervals during
      immunosuppression minimization before and at clinically indicated liver biopsy (n
      = 119). Levels of 31 miRNAs were significantly associated with ACR diagnosis with
      two miRNAs differentiating ACR from non-ACR (area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve = 90%, 95% confidence interval = 82%-96%) and predicted ACR 
      events up to 40 days before biopsy-proven rejection. The most differentially
      expressed miRNAs were low or absent in the blood of healthy individuals but
      highly expressed in liver tissue, indicating an ectopic origin from the liver
      allograft. Pathway analyses of rejection-associated miRNAs and their target
      messenger RNAs (mRNAs) showed induction of proinflammatory and cell death-related
      pathways. Integration of differentially expressed serum miRNA with concordant
      liver biopsy mRNA demonstrates interaction between molecules with a known role in
      transplant rejection. CONCLUSION: Distinct miRNA levels profiled from sera at the
      time of clinical allograft dysfunction can be used to noninvasively diagnose ACR.
      Predictive trajectories of the same profile during supervised immunosuppression
      minimization diagnosed rejection up to 40 days prior to clinical expression. The 
      rejection-associated miRNAs in sera appear to be ectopically expressed liver and 
      specific immune cell miRNAs that are biologically related, and the consequences
      of immune-mediated damage to the allograft. (Hepatology 2017;65:269-280).

AB  - Some patients with microvillus inclusion disease due to myosin 5B (MYO5B)
      mutations may develop cholestasis characterized by a progressive familial
      intrahepatic cholestasis-like phenotype with normal serum gamma-glutamyl
      transferase activity. So far MYO5B deficiency has not been reported in patients
      with such a cholestasis phenotype in the absence of intestinal disease. Using a
      new-generation sequencing approach, we identified MYO5B mutations in five
      patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis-like phenotype with
      normal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity without intestinal disease.
      CONCLUSION: These data show that MYO5B deficiency may lead to isolated
      cholestasis and that MYO5B should be considered as an additional progressive
      familial intrahepatic cholestasis gene. (Hepatology 2017;65:164-173).

TI  - Sirtuin 2 aggravates postischemic liver injury by deacetylating mitogen-activated
      protein kinase phosphatase-1.
PG  - 225-236

AB  - Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) is known to negatively regulate anoxia-reoxygenation injury in 
      myoblasts. Because protein levels of Sirt2 are increased in ischemia-reperfusion 
      (I/R)-injured liver tissues, we examined whether Sirt2 is protective or
      detrimental against hepatic I/R injury. We overexpressed Sirt2 in the liver of
      C57BL/6 mice using a Sirt2 adenovirus. Wild-type and Sirt2 knockout mice were
      subjected to a partial (70%) hepatic ischemia for 45 minutes, followed by various
      periods of reperfusion. In another set of experiments, wild-type mice were
      pretreated intraperitoneally with AGK2, a Sirt2 inhibitor. Isolated hepatocytes
      and Kupffer cells from wild-type and Sirt2 knockout mice were subjected to
      hypoxia-reoxygenation injury to determine the in vitro effects of Sirt2. Mice
      subjected to I/R injury showed typical patterns of hepatocellular damage. Prior
      injection with Sirt2 adenovirus aggravated liver injury, as demonstrated by
      increases in serum aminotransferases, prothrombin time, proinflammatory
      cytokines, hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis, and neutrophil infiltration
      relative to control virus-injected mice. Pretreatment with AGK2 resulted in
      significant improvements in serum aminotransferase levels and histopathologic
      findings. Similarly, experiments with Sirt2 knockout mice also revealed reduced
      hepatocellular injury. The molecular mechanism of Sirt2's involvement in this
      aggravation of hepatic I/R injury includes the deacetylation and inhibition of
      mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and consequent activation of
      mitogen-activated protein kinases. CONCLUSION: Sirt2 is an aggravating factor
      during hepatic I/R injury. (Hepatology 2017;65:225-236).

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
      therapeutic options and noninvasive markers of disease activity and severity
      remain limited. We investigated the association between plasma biomarkers and
      liver histology in order to identify markers of disease activity and severity in 
      patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Thirty-two plasma biomarkers chosen a priori
      as possible discriminators of NAFLD were measured in participants enrolled in the
      Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Clinical Research Network. Dichotomized
      histologic outcomes were evaluated using centrally read biopsies. Biomarkers with
      statistically significant associations with NAFLD histology were evaluated in
      multivariable models adjusted for clinical factors. Of 648 participants (74.4%
      white, 61.7% female, mean age 47.7 years), 58.0% had definite NASH, 55.5% had
      mild/no fibrosis (stage 0-1), and 44.4% had significant fibrosis (stage 2-4).
      Increased activated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 had a strong association
      with definite NASH compared to not NASH or borderline NASH in multivariable
      analysis (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.34, P < 0.001).
      Biomarkers associated with significant fibrosis (versus mild/no fibrosis) in
      multivariable analysis included higher levels of interleukin-8, monocyte
      chemoattractant protein-1, resistin, soluble interleukin-1 receptor I, soluble
      interleukin-2 receptor alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and lower levels of
      insulin-like growth factor 2. CONCLUSIONS: Specific plasma biomarkers are
      significantly associated with disease activity and severity of fibrosis in NAFLD 
      and are potentially valuable tools for noninvasive stratification of patients
      with NAFLD and identification of targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Bile acids and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Molecular insights and
      therapeutic perspectives.
PG  - 350-362
LID - 10.1002/hep.28709 [doi]
AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem worldwide
      and an important risk factor for both hepatic and cardiometabolic mortality. The 
      rapidly increasing prevalence of this disease and of its aggressive form
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will require novel therapeutic approaches to 
      prevent disease progression to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and cancer. In
      recent years, bile acids have emerged as relevant signaling molecules that act at
      both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues to regulate lipid and carbohydrate
      metabolic pathways as well as energy homeostasis. Activation or modulation of
      bile acid receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor and TGR5, and transporters,
      such as the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, appear to affect
      both insulin sensitivity and NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis at multiple levels, and
      these approaches hold promise as novel therapies. In the present review, we
      summarize current available data on the relationships of bile acids to NAFLD and 
      the potential for therapeutically targeting bile-acid-related pathways to address
      this growing world-wide disease. (Hepatology 2017;65:350-362).

TI  - Histological severity and clinical outcomes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
      in nonobese patients.

AB  - Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to obesity,
      around 10%-20% of nonobese Americans and Asians still develop NAFLD. Data on this
      special group are limited. We therefore studied the severity and clinical
      outcomes of nonobese NAFLD patients. Consecutive NAFLD patients who underwent
      liver biopsy were prospectively recruited. We used the NASH Clinical Research
      Network system to score the histology. The Asian body mass index cutoff of 25
      kg/m(2) was used to define nonobese NAFLD. Among 307 recruited NAFLD patients, 72
      (23.5%) were nonobese. Compared to obese patients, nonobese patients had lower
      NAFLD activity score (3.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.2; P = 0.019), mainly contributed
      by steatosis (1.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.8; P = 0.014) and presence of hepatocyte 
      ballooning (60.9% vs. 73.4%; P = 0.045). Similarly, nonobese patients had lower
      fibrosis stage (1.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.4; P = 0.004), serum cytokeratin-18
      fragments (283 vs. 404 U/L; P < 0.001) and liver stiffness measurement by
      transient elastography (6.3 vs. 8.6 kilopascals; P < 0.001). By multivariate
      analysis in nonobese patients, only elevated serum triglyceride level was
      independently associated with higher NAFLD activity score (adjusted odds ratio
      [OR], 1.644; P = 0.021), whereas elevated creatinine level was the only factor
      associated with advanced fibrosis (adjusted OR, 1.044; P = 0.025). After a median
      follow-up of 49 months, 6 patients died, 2 developed hepatocellular carcinoma,
      and 1 had liver failure, all of whom were in the obese group. CONCLUSION:
      Nonobese NAFLD patients tend to have less-severe disease and may have a better
      prognosis than obese patients. Hypertriglyceridemia and higher creatinine are the
      key factors associated with advanced liver disease in nonobese patients.
